Kristy Kirkup, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Jagmeet Singh celebrated his byelection win the same way he rang in winning the NDP leadership race: on a dance floor.

""We danced the night away,"" Singh said Tuesday morning in an interview as his party breathed a collective sigh of relief following a win in the federal riding of Burnaby South.

Preliminary results from Elections Canada show he was able to clinch the riding with 39 per cent of the vote.

For Singh, the win means he can finally go toe-to-toe in the House of Commons with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- something he hasn't been able to do since taking over the reins of the NDP from Tom Mulcair in October 2017.

Singh is now calling on New Democrats to make the most of months leading up to the October election, knowing full well he has a limited amount of time to shine in the Commons with Parliament to rise in June.

The earliest Singh can take his new seat in the House of Commons will be March 18, but he will be in Ottawa Wednesday to lead the party's weekly caucus meeting on Parliament Hill.

""It allows me to ramp up the pressure on Mr. Trudeau, on the Liberal government and allows me to really put into focus the question 'Is this Liberal government more interested in helping their well-connected, powerful friends like SNC-Lavalin,"" he said.

There is no time for Singh to waste, said Mulcair's former principal secretary Karl Belanger, noting the election is just around the corner.

""Now (Singh) has an opportunity to be seen and heard on the same stage as the other main party leaders and it will be up to him to perform and do well and connect with Canadians with a narrative that speaks to their priorities.""

The Liberals and Conservatives were also celebrating byelection wins this week. Conservative Scot Davidson easily won in York-Simcoe in southern Ontario, replacing Peter Van Loan, who held the seat since 2004 before announcing his retirement.

Liberal Rachel Bendayan was the winner in the Montreal seat of Outremont, much to the delight of Liberal cabinet ministers who are declaring the NDP's ""orange wave"" in Quebec dead.

""It's finished,"" said Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne. ""Just look at the results.""

The early Elections Canada data suggests Bendayan won with 40 per cent of the vote followed by the NDP's candidate Julia Sanchez, who had 26 per cent of the vote. The Green party had a third place finish, the Bloc Quebecois were fourth and the Conservatives were fifth.

Outremont was the seat won by Mulcair in a 2007 byelection, a victory that helped the party build support in Quebec and led to the NDP's Quebec breakthrough during the 2011 election. The NDP formed official opposition for the first time that year before falling back to third-party status in 2015.

Singh said it was not a surprise that Outremont was a challenge but he disputed the idea that the orange wave has crested.

""The base that we built in Quebec is alive and well,"" he said, adding that he's planning a visit to the province next week.

Quebec MP Alexandre Boulerice said asserting the NDP is dead in Quebec is ""classic Liberal arrogance.""

He said the NDP is very proud of Singh's victory, noting he is the first racialized federal leader to sit in the House of Commons.

Quebec Conservative MP Gerard Deltell also insisted the NDP is not dead in his province while he stressed no one should be drawing conclusions based on byelection results.

Maxime Bernier, who left the Conservative fold to launch the People's Party of Canada last fall, tweeted on Tuesday to give his assessment of the byelection results, which was the first test for his fledgling political party.

He said he expected his party to fare better in the ridings of York-Simcoe and Outremont, where the candidates earned about two per cent of the vote but adding there were ""great results"" in Burnaby South with nearly 11 per cent of the vote.

The progress is ""overall encouraging"" after five months as a party, Bernier added.

2,Empty,2019-03-01T15:19:33Z,Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau looks vulnerable after his former attorney general alleged that he interfered in the justice system.,"Justin Trudeau’s ship may be sinking, but he’s not changing course.

The Canadian prime minister plowed ahead Thursday after his former attorney general alleged, in explosive testimony aired on national television, that he interfered in the justice system by pressing to end a criminal case against an iconic Quebec construction firm. Speaking to reporters in Montreal, Trudeau insisted again his government had every right to consider the job losses that could result from a guilty verdict for SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.

The scandal has suddenly made Trudeau vulnerable, consuming his Liberals in the run-up to an election in which he’d have otherwise have been the frontrunner. He’s lost his polling lead for the first time since June, and the controversy has undermined his personal brand as a progressive leader who singlehandedly returned his moribund party to power in 2015 on a pledge of change.

“It’s very damaging and it’s very serious,” said Penny Collenette, a University of Ottawa professor who served as director of appointments under a former Liberal prime minister. Every politician wants to protect jobs, she said. “But I think the question that needs to be asked here is: at what cost?”

Trudeau’s fate depends on several factors — including whether cabinet stands by him and the Liberals stay united. Only a handful of lawmakers have voiced any measure of support for Jody Wilson-Raybould, who quit cabinet last month but remains a Liberal member of parliament. The prime minister hasn’t decided yet whether to force her out of the party’s caucus.

Divided They Fall

Any divisions within his government on the matter could be fatal for efforts to convince voters the Liberals have done nothing wrong, said Nik Nanos, a pollster with Nanos Research Group. Trudeau, at the center of the crisis and with his own popularity waning, will also need a more team-oriented campaign in the next election to win voters who may blame him for the current crisis.

“If a narrative emerges that the caucus is divided on this, that will be lethal for Justin Trudeau,” Nanos said in a telephone interview. “I can’t remember any party leader winning an election with his caucus divided. If the caucus can’t even agree, how is it that they can govern?”

The latest polls already show the Liberals have lost their lead in voting intentions. An aggregate of public opinion surveys maintained by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. shows Trudeau’s team with 33.9 percent of the vote, below the Conservatives with 35.8 percent.

What’s hurting the prime minister is the extraordinary spectacle of a former high-ranking member of his government now emerging as its most powerful critic — and his rivals smell blood. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called for Trudeau’s resignation and wrote the Royal Canadian Mounted Police seeking an investigation. The police force hasn’t said whether or not it will look into the matter. New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh is demanding a public inquiry.

Among those Wilson-Raybould accused of improper pressure is Bill Morneau, who she said she spoke to in the House of Commons. The finance minister said Thursday it was Wilson-Raybould who approached him, and defended the actions of his chief of staff, Ben Chin, in stressing the magnitude of potential job losses at the company.

“My role is, and continues to be, to think about how protect Canadian jobs,” Morneau told reporters in Toronto. “I will continue do that. I think that’s critically important for us to understand in every decision we take as a government.”

Wilson-Raybould also took aim at Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former principal secretary, who on Thursday asked to be allowed to speak to a committee of lawmakers to tell his version of events. The former attorney general — whose absence from cabinet will be filled in a shuffle Friday, according to CBC — may also end up testifying again.

United So Far

But no current minister has broken ranks. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told the CBC she couldn’t imagine Trudeau applying inappropriate pressure, and signaled frustration that Wilson-Raybould was now taking aim at cabinet. “At the end of the day, when you leave the room, you have to play as a united team,” Freeland said.

Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he believes Trudeau was within the “box of what’s legal” with his actions, and that no one should jump to conclusions. “We should take the time to listen to the other witnesses.” Champagne and another minister, border security chief Bill Blair, each brushed aside a question on whether Trudeau should replace key staff. “I remain very confident in the work of this government,” Blair said.

Parliament adjourns on Friday for a two-week break, due to return in time for Morneau’s March 19 budget. The path of the scandal could also depend on what Liberal lawmakers hear while away from Ottawa, in their home districts scattered across Canada.

“They’re going to get earfuls,” Collenette said. “If the truth is really two perceptions, then voters will make up their minds. But they need facts.”

3,Empty,2019-03-05T07:45:42Z,Treasury Board President Jane Philpott announced her resignation amid a corruption scandal involving Quebec-based firm SNC-Lavalin,"A second minister from Justin Trudeau’s administration has resigned in the wake of an unfolding corruption scandal, dealing additional damage to the Canadian prime minister’s already slipping popularity.

Treasury Board President Jane Philpott announced her resignation on Monday, writing in a statement that she has been “considering the events that have shaken the federal government in recent weeks” and has made the decision to quit “after serious reflection.”

Trudeau’s government has been swept up in controversy since his former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused the administration of trying to stop a criminal case against Quebec-based firm SNC-Lavalin, one of the world’s largest engineering and construction companies.

The firm is facing corruption charges for allegedly paying C$48m (US$36m) worth of bribes in Libya in order to secure lucrative contracts, according to the BBC.

Trudeau and top aides have been accused of pursuing a months-long campaign to silence the trial. Trudeau has maintained that his government acted in the interest of preventing job losses that could result from a guilty verdict for SNC-Lavalin.

The firm employs close to 9,000 employees across Canada, according to SNC-Lavlin’s website.

In her statement, Philpott said efforts to “pressure the former Attorney General to intervene” in the case raised “serious concerns” for her.

Philpott previously served as Canada’s Minister of Health, Minister of Indigenous Services, President of the Treasury Board and Minister of Digital Government.

“It grieves me to leave a portfolio where I was at work to deliver on an important mandate,” Philpott wrote. “But I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities and constitutional obligations.”

According to a February poll conducted by Canadian analytics company Leger, 36% of respondents indicated they were “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied” with the government led by Trudeau, down from 45% in November 2018.

Canada will head to general elections in October.

Technically, web pages auction off ad spaces through its platform, and the winning bid shows up automatically. The whole process takes a fraction of a second. Google has decided that changing all that to make sure it can comply with the law's requirements would be too much work. Colin McKay, the head of public policy and government relations at Google Canada, told the publication that the best way to make sure the company doesn't run afoul of the new rules is to stop accepting political ads altogether.

That the law requires platforms to keep track of not just political ads -- those that feature specific candidates or parties -- but also ads of a partisan nature -- those that don't mention names -- further complicates things. ""The challenge for us is that that definition (of partisan) is extremely broad,"" McKay added. Google maintains an archive of election ads in the US, but the registry only contains advertisements that feature candidates and current officeholders. It doesn't include partisan or issue ads meant to sway people's opinions.

Canadian officials passed the bill late last year in an effort to deter foreign players from meddling with the 2019 federal elections. Google had implemented changes and new features in the US meant to accomplish the same thing, but it looks like Canada's new rules are just a bit too troublesome for the tech giant.

View full cov…,"British Prime Minister Theresa May has sown more confusion into the Brexit process by opening the door to delaying Britain’s departure from the European Union without saying how long the extension might last.

On Tuesday, Ms. May said members of Parliament would be able to vote to extend the March 29 deadline for the United Kingdom to leave the EU if she is unable to win parliamentary support for a Brexit deal with the bloc.

Ms. May has been scrambling for weeks to salvage a withdrawal agreement she struck with the EU that has met fierce opposition from within her Conservative Party caucus. On Tuesday, she told the House of Commons that she believed a final deal was still possible before March 29, but she acknowledged that many MPs have become “genuinely worried that time is running out” and that businesses are growing uneasy about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. The EU would have to consent to an extension and Ms. May refused to say how long it might last, indicating only that she’d like any delay to be “as short as possible”.

Story continues below advertisement

The announcement was a reversal for the Prime Minister who had spent months insisting that she would not delay Brexit. That stance had rattled many business leaders who feared the U.K. would crash out of the EU without any arrangements for trade, banking, transportation and many other issues. A government report released after Ms. May spoke confirmed many of those fears by pointing out how unprepared the country was for a no-deal Brexit.

According to the report, only 40,000 of 240,000 businesses have signed up for a special customs number they will need in order to trade with the EU after Brexit. The report also said that a majority of people have no idea they will face new EU customs and immigration controls after Brexit or that they will require an International Driving Permit to drive in the EU. Food imports from the EU could be disrupted, the report noted, and there will be widespread problems for financial service companies, law firms, chemical manufacturers, car makers and transport companies. The government also hasn’t come close to converting 40 EU trade deals into U.K. agreements. Ministers had hoped to have all 40 deals in place by the Brexit deadline, but so far just six have been signed and they don’t include large trading partners such as Canada, Japan or South Korea.

Ms. May has been under increasing pressure to rule out a no-deal Brexit and extend the March 29 deadline. On Tuesday, three junior cabinet ministers said they would resign unless Ms. May rejected leaving without a deal and up to a dozen senior ministers are believed to have also threatened to quit. Ms. May finally bowed to the pressure and agreed to allow MPs to vote on an extension. However, she faced criticism from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who said Ms. May had been ""grotesquely reckless” in her Brexit strategy and was just trying to “run down the clock.”

In her revised timetable, Ms. May is due to present a new Brexit deal to parliament on March 12 and, if it’s rejected, MPs will vote over the next two days on whether to leave the EU without a deal or move to extend the deadline. “Let me be clear, I do not want to see [the deadline] extended,” she told MPs. “Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on 29 March.”

EU officials have indicated that any delay beyond the end of June would be difficult because of elections to the European parliament. Those elections are in May and the new parliament convenes on July 2. The U.K. isn’t participating in the elections because the country is supposed to be out of the EU as of March 29. Any extension of that deadline beyond the end of June would mean the U.K. would have to field candidates for the European parliament. “What kind of message would that send to the more than 17 million people who voted to leave the EU nearly three years ago now?” Ms. May asked MPs on Tuesday.

It’s also not clear if an extension will make it any easier for Ms. May to get her Brexit deal approved by parliament. The main sticking point remains the so-called backstop, a provision in the withdrawal agreement that guarantees no hard border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K., and the Republic of Ireland by ensuring that Northern Ireland remains linked to the EU’s regulations. Many Tory MPs say the backstop will keep the U.K. tied to the EU indefinitely and they wanted it removed or restricted with a time limit. The EU has refused to make any changes to the agreement, arguing the backstop protects assurances made in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that ended decades of sectarian violence and eliminated border controls.",May leaves opening for Brexit delay if parliament unable to reach deal - The Globe and Mail,The Globe And Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-may-leaves-opening-for-brexit-delay-if-parliament-unable-to-reach-deal/

President Trump seems to think so. “We’re getting very, very close,” he told a group of governors visiting the White House in February.

Citing “substantial progress” in recent negotiations, Trump postponed a March 1 deadline that would have sharply increased the rate of tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods. Trump said he hoped a meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping, most likely in late March at Mar-a-Lago, would become a “signing summit.”

Trump’s lunge for a deal may be driven in part by the fast-advancing U.S. electoral calendar. As Democrats begin lining up to run against him next year, the President may be hoping to avoid the stock-market gyrations and economic pain an escalating trade war might soon begin to inflict.

He could surely use what he sees as a big political win on China at a time when multiple investigations, increasingly aggressive Democratic lawmakers, his failure to build a border wall and embarrassing public testimony from his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen are all clouding his political horizons.

But as with his would-be reset with Russia, Trump can’t change the structural game with China with a single agreement. Although Trump entered office predicting he would improve relations with Moscow, lawmakers of both parties continue to accuse Russia of interference in U.S. elections and various other crimes. Sanctions remain in place and may well expand. Neither Trump’s praise nor congressional punishment has persuaded Russia to change course.

The same goes for China. Trump will doubtless win some concessions from Xi, perhaps expanded access for U.S. companies to the Chinese marketplace, agreements on currency management, more Chinese purchases of American soybeans and promises in principle to address other U.S. demands.

What Trump cannot do is persuade Xi to overhaul China’s broader economic model. The Chinese state will continue to subsidize state-owned companies and privately owned national champions, tilting the global playing field in its favor. It will push forward, by any means necessary, on expanding technological innovation to compete with U.S. and European firms in the most important economic sectors of the 21st century–AI, fintech and consumer electronics, for example. On these subjects, whatever Xi promises Trump or Chinese officials say publicly, they will not compromise.

There are also limits to what Trump can offer to get that deal with Xi. If he signs off on an agreement that removes pressure on Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE, each suspected of undermining U.S. national security, he’ll get pushback from Congress. If he tries to use Meng Wanzhou–the Huawei executive arrested in Canada for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran–as a bargaining chip, he’ll face criticism that he’s meddling in a law-enforcement matter and exceeding his authority.

Even if Trump and Xi cheer markets in March with a broad Mar-a-Lago agreement over coffee and chocolate cake, the damage to relations between the superpower and the rising challenger has already been done. Trust between them now stands at its lowest point in 30 years, and each government will continue a long-term project of making its side less vulnerable to pressure from the other.

In short, the U.S.-China relationship is fundamentally broken, and no politically inspired, vaguely worded compromise will change that.

DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Jagmeet Singh faces the biggest test of his NDP leadership in a by-election on Monday as he vies for a seat in the House of Commons.

The Burnaby South vote in the Vancouver region is one of three by-elections taking place on Monday, with others north of Toronto and in Montreal. The votes come just six months before campaigning is likely to officially begin for the general federal election.

Much is at stake for Mr. Singh, who was elected leader of the NDP in the fall of 2017 on a decisive first-ballot victory. Previous NDP leader Tom Mulcair said in January that it would be difficult for Mr. Singh to stay on as leader if he loses Burnaby South. Mr. Singh at the time insisted he would lead the NDP this fall regardless of the by-election result. The 40-year-old has struggled at times as party leader: He has been criticized for low poll numbers and poor fundraising.

Story continues below advertisement

Brad Lavigne, who helped orchestrate Jack Layton’s orange wave in 2011 as NDP campaign chief, said on Sunday that a victory in the by-election would be essential to unite the NDP.

Mr. Lavigne said Mr. Singh has poured considerable personal energy into the riding, through extensive door-knocking and meetings with constituents. The riding has voted NDP in the past on a federal and provincial level. The B.C. NDP dominated Burnaby when John Horgan was elected in 2017, and on Saturday the Premier on Twitter called on voters to get to the polls to back Mr. Singh.

The Burnaby South contest has been turbulent. The Liberals’ first candidate, Karen Wang, stepped down after a social media post on the social messaging app WeChat that zeroed in on Mr. Singh’s ethnicity and highlighted that she was only candidate of Chinese ethnicity. A recent all-candidates’ debate became heated on issues of race and immigration.

Richard T. Lee is the new Liberal candidate. Jay Shin is running for the Conservatives. Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson represents the upstart People’s Party of Canada. The Greens chose not to run a candidate against Mr. Singh.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced criticism last fall for delaying a by-election call after the NDP’s Kennedy Stewart vacated the Burnaby South seat in September to become the mayor of Vancouver.

Mr. Singh said voters are “very disappointed” in Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal government.

“It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation,” said Mr. Singh, referring to the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Story continues below advertisement

Political scientist Richard Johnston at the University of British Columbia said the SNC-Lavalin case could be a “gift” for Mr. Singh, because it could turn some potential Liberal voters to the NDP.

David Moscrop, a political scientist at the University of Ottawa, said it is unclear whether Mr. Singh should stay on as leader of the NDP if he lost.

“There’s this assumption that if he lost the by-election, he couldn’t show his face in the general election. I don’t think Canadians would really care,” Mr. Moscrop said. “The NDP caucus might see things differently.”

In 2015, the NDP barely won Burnaby South, as the Liberals had a strong showing in the province when Mr. Trudeau swept to power. Mr. Stewart, who had won a close race in Burnaby-Douglas in 2011, won 35.1 per cent of the vote in Burnaby South, ahead of the Liberals’ 33.9 per cent. The margin was 547 votes. The Conservatives had 27.1 per cent of the vote.

The Burnaby-South riding is an amalgam of two older ridings, the southern half of Burnaby-Douglas – where the NDP had a long, but narrow, hold on power federally – and the western half of Burnaby-New Westminster – where the NDP had a long, and mostly dominant, hold on power federally.

Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

Veteran NDP MP Nathan Cullen, one of the highest-profile members of the party’s national caucus, announced Friday his exit from federal politics – the latest in a series of New Democrats to rule out seeking re-election in October.

The British Columbia member, who will have served 15 years by the time he departs this fall, played down any suggestion that his decision not to seek re-election is a blow to the party.

Thirteen members of the caucus, which now has 41 MPs, have said they will not seek re-election, raising questions about party leader Jagmeet Singh’s management of the New Democrats, who are facing challenges in such areas as the polls, fundraising and policy.

Mr. Cullen, 47, is the second NDP MP from British Columbia to announce his departure this week, following Victoria-area MP Murray Rankin. Earlier on this term, Burnaby-South MP Kennedy Stewart left to run for and win the office of Vancouver mayor and Nanaimo-area MP Sheila Malcolmson was elected an NDP member of the provincial legislature.

But the MP for Skeena-Bulkley Valley said that after 15 years, five elections, a leadership bid in 2011-12 and with two 8½-year-old twin boys appealing for his attention, it was time to leave.

Mr. Cullen has no specific professional plans. Asked whether he would be interested in provincial politics, he said, “I am not ruling it out, but I don’t have that as my plan right now.” The provincial New Democrats govern B.C. under Premier John Horgan.

“When my family and I have been talking, it was just to decide whether we wanted to be in federal politics after October. Yes or no, not conditional on some other opportunity or offer. It was just, ‘Let’s just be clear and clean on this,’ not have something else waiting in the wings.”

Mr. Cullen placed third behind Thomas Mulcair and Brian Topp in the 2012 leadership vote. His roles in Parliament included House leader for the Official Opposition and Opposition finance critic. Following the 2015 election, he was environment critic as well as critic for democratic reform.

He said no one, himself included, is irreplaceable. “I’ve seen irreplaceable people leave, and then they get replaced,” said Mr. Cullen, adding that since he has been musing about his future, prospective NDP candidates have been in touch about vying to represent the party in his riding.

Mr. Cullen said New Democrats have had a good week with Mr. Singh winning a by-election in Burnaby-South and finally gaining a seat in the House of Commons. Mr. Cullen has been supportive of Mr. Singh, who succeeded Thomas Mulcair in 2017. “He is humble enough to know that he has got work to do,” he said.

He said the shine is off the federal Liberals under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau given the scandal surrounding the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair. And he said questions around the issue may even give the party traction in Quebec, the site of the party’s Orange Wave in 2011.

“Context is everything. I don’t want to harp too much on Mr. Trudeau’s troubles, but a sponsorship-like corruption scandal hits a note different in Quebec than in other parts of the country because they have seen this movie before,” he said.

To get ahead, he said the NDP will have to be authentic and “unapologetically progressive” as well as make a blunt appeal to govern Canada.

“The old NDP was about being the conscience of the Parliament, and not happy to lose, but comfortable with the idea of being third,” he said.

Germany's Alternative For Germany (AfD) party (previously) are an insurgent neofascist movement with ties to senior mainstream politicians and the country's super-wealthy would-be oligarchs; the party put on a hard push in the the 2018 Bavarian elections and their meme warfare was full of familiar voter-suppression tactics, from garden-variety disinformation to exhortations to stay home on election day.

Also prominent in the group's messaging: hashtags and tropes from the US far-right conspiracy theory Qanon (previously), an incoherent toxic stew of antisemitism, murder accusations, numerology, Islamophobia, and other pathologies of the moment.

The connection between Qanon and AfD comes from an unreleased report from the London School of Economics-affiliated Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which bills itself as an ""anti-extremist think tank""; some details of the study have been reported in the German and US press.

The researchers traced the inclusion of Qanon-affiliated hashtags in AfD social media, including German translations and adaptations of popular Qanon tags (e.g. #linksliegenlassen, #MerkelMussWeg); as with the US-based Qanon activists, the German Qanon phenomenon was driven by small numbers of incredibly prolific social media users -- not bots (Erin Gallagher's research found that Qanon tweeters posting 500+ messages/day were often ""older retired people with a lot of free time"").

There's evidence that US-based Qanon activists forged alliances with German neofascists; some popular fascist hashtags (""#ChemnitzIstDerAnfang"") originated with US Qanon accounts.

Qanon is becoming a kind of ideological signifier among far-right groups: members of the far-right who have adopted the yellow vest for street demonstrations in Canada and the UK have been spotted decorating the vests with Qanon memes and carrying Qanon-boosting signs. Qanon networks have also been used to boost the virality of racist videos.

I think far-right extremism is the intersection of garden-variety bigotry/xenophobia with economic precarity and a breakdown of the epistemological consensus about what constitutes a reliable indicator that something is true.

Xenophobia and bigotry are always around, but they surge when people feel afraid for their overall economic circumstances, and that surge has been supercharged by decades of both scientific denialism (well-funded campaigns to sow doubt about the motives of climate scientists, doctors who warn of the link between smoking and cancer, etc) and corruption -- for example, anti-vax builds on the assertion that experts have corrupt motives and that regulators are so captured that they let them get away with murder. The thing is, regulators really are that captured.

I can't say for sure that a more equitable economic system -- which would cut off the resources used by corporate influences to distort policy, and by ideological entrepreneurs to push expensive, profitable scientific denial -- would neutralize the far-right, but I think it's worth a try.

The crossover between QAnon and far-right German movements like the Chemnitz riots makes sense. Both movements are aggressively anti-Muslim and anti-refugee. And both make vague gestures toward a right-wing revolution. “At the time I got the impression that some people thought Chemnitz was going to be ‘Germany's great awakening,’” Gallagher said, referencing QAnon’s promise of a “great awakening” in America. It’s a trend she’s previously observed, as America’s alt-right moved on to trolling on behalf of their counterparts in Europe after Trump’s victory in 2016. “I've noticed crossover of US alt-right networks with European alt-right for a long time,” she said. “How QAnon fits into all that is a great question, but the international alt-right coordinated swarms—QAnon related or not—do not surprise me.”

Speaking in an interview with CBC News, Gould suggested that Google's decision to stop accepting political advertising during the upcoming federal election, instead of developing an online ad registry, may not be final.

""Ultimately, they could change their mind ... and we will encourage them to do so,"" she said. ""However, that's Google's decision as to how they comply with the law.""

Gould said Google did set up an ad registry for the U.S. midterm elections and is planning one for the upcoming European Union parliamentary elections.

'They could definitely do this'

""Let's be honest, they have significant resources, both financial and technical,"" Gould said. ""If they wanted to, they could definitely do this.""

Gould said she wants online platforms to start developing the ad registries called for in recent changes to Canada's elections law.

She also is still contemplating the prospect of regulating social media platforms if they won't make other changes she is seeking.

""Other things I think are important are labelling automatic and bot accounts,"" she said. ""Being more transparent in the activity of taking down accounts that they know to be either automated or coming from foreign sources, and to go even further in terms of political advertisements in general.""

Gould's comments came after Google announced that it won't run Canadian political advertising during the upcoming federal election — a decision the minister described as ""disappointing.""

""For the duration of the 2019 federal election campaign, Google will not accept advertising regulated by Bill C-76,"" Colin McKay, Google Canada's head of public policy, wrote in a statement. ""We're focusing our efforts on supporting Canadian news literacy programs and connecting people to useful and relevant election-related information.""

Under Bill C-76, election advertising is defined as ""an advertising message that promotes or opposes a registered party or the election of a candidate, including by taking a position on an issue with which a registered party or candidate is associated.""

Testifying in late November before a Senate committee examining the government's elections legislation, Google made it clear that it was troubled by the requirement to keep track of political ads in a registry, saying it would be difficult — if not impossible — for it to do so, given the way its system distributes ads.

Jason Kee, public policy and government relations counsel for Google Canada, said it would be particularly hard to ensure that advocacy ads are flagged, and a website that published such an ad might not even know it was supposed to be reported in the registry.

""The publisher might not even know they displayed a political ad and might find themselves unknowingly subject to the registry requirement,"" Kee told senators. ""Further, they may never see a copy of the ad that was displayed. Currently, there is no means for a publisher to retrieve political advertising that displayed on their site in a timely manner.

""So, for these systems to accommodate the new provisions, the entire infrastructure underlying online advertising would need to be changed. This is simply not achievable in the very short timelines contemplated.""

During the Senate hearing, Michele Austin, head of government, public policy and philanthropy for Twitter in Canada, expressed a number of concerns about the changes being proposed to the elections law, but said Twitter was prepared to obey them.

Kevin Chan, the head of public policy for Facebook in Canada, says his company plans to sell political ads during the election and will comply with the new elections law. (CBC News)

Among the company's concerns, she said, was the fact that Twitter already has set up its own ad transparency system and plans to expand it to markets around the world, but the scope of information in that system didn't match what was called for in Bill C-76.

""Requests by individual governments to re-engineer the existing Ads Transparency Centre structure for different markets may prove extremely difficult,"" she said. ""Twitter has to weigh the time, effort and cost of these individual requests and national models against changing our existing transparency centre model to deliver better, not just different, outcomes for users.""

Austin and Twitter did not respond Tuesday to messages from CBC News.

Facebook still plans to sell ads

Kevin Chan, head of public policy for Facebook Canada, said his company plans to sell election advertising and will respect the measures outlined in the new elections law.

""Understanding the significance of this legislation, we intend to meet the legal obligations of Bill C-76,"" Chan wrote in an e-mail response to questions from CBC News.

""Before the end of June 2019, we'll roll out additional protections by providing a set of transparency tools for advertisers here in Canada. These tools will help ensure that authenticity and transparency are at the core of paid political advertising on Facebook, continuing our efforts to prevent foreign interference and give people more information about the ads they see across our platforms.""

Google's decision eliminates a popular way for parties and interest groups to get their messages out in the upcoming election.

Braeden Caley, spokesman for the Liberal Party of Canada, said the new transparency measures introduced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government are important tools for preventing foreign interference and the spread of disinformation in the election campaign.

""In light of this, Google's decision is disappointing,"" he wrote. ""Positive engagement online, including with campaign advertising, continues to be an important way that the Liberal Party of Canada and our candidates work to involve more Canadians in our democracy.""

Caley said the Liberal Party will continue to look for new ways to connect with more voters.

The Conservative Party has not yet responded to questions from CBC News.

By CCN.com: Alphabet Inc.’s Google is banning political advertising in Canada just in time to apply to the 2019 Federal elections.

The prohibition came in the wake of the Elections Modernization Act, passed by the Canadian Senate this December, which requires online advertising platforms to monitor and report all political and partisan ads. The penalties for not adhering to the said Bill C-76 could slap offenders with fines and possibly, imprisonment.

Ruby Sahota, the liberal politician in Canada, said the Election Modernization Act would limit third-party influence on the outcome of the upcoming Federal elections.

“No foreign actors would be allowed to participate financially in our elections and also for all those who are advertising on platforms such as Facebook or any other platforms, all would be made transparent,” Sahota said while adddressing the senate.

Better Safe than Sorry

Nevertheless, achieving the kind of transparency the Canadian liberals seek could become a challenging task for online advertising companies. Colin McKay, Google Canada’s head of public policy and government relations, told TGAM that it was difficult for them to detect partisan ads, arguing that they may not feature the name of a political candidate or party.

In preparation for that, it passed legislation requiring online platforms to make a registry for political ads.

Due to new Canadian political advertising laws, Google Canada will not be allowing political ads on its AdEx platform during the country's upcoming federal elections. In December of last year, lawmakers passed a bill requiring online services to monitor and keep a record of all ""partisan"" ads shown either directly or indirectly.

According to the search giant, the rules are too difficult to implement under its current system of advertising. Google had asked legislators last year to amend parts of the bill so that it could comply, but those requests went denied.

The problem with the law for Google is that its current AdEx platform of real-time ad bidding does not allow a way for it to monitor the process. The whole system is automated. Web pages put space up for auction, and the highest bidding advertisement is placed in about two-tenths of a second with no human intervention.

With only a few months to come up with a different system, Google has decided that complying with the law is too much work.

""Even if [we] include all advertising from designated groups in [a] registry (which would be over inclusive), [the] broad definition of '[partisan] election advertising' and potential liability for error will make this extremely challenging,"" Google warned before the law was passed.

“We’ve come to the decision that the best way for Google to comply with the Elections Act in the 2019 election cycle is actually to stop accepting elections ads as defined in the legislation,” Google Canada’s Head of Public Policy and Government Relations Colin McKay told The Globe and Mail. “It is painful for us, [but] this isn’t a negotiating tactic. We’re four months out from the period prescribed in legislation.”

It is easier for Google to block ads than to create a whole new system to comply with one country's rules. It will only have to modify its current ad policies to have the system detect and exclude any ads that fall into the category of Canada’s ad registry regulations.

If the law only required Google to track candidates, there would be no issue. It already has a registry for tracking US candidates' ads. The problem is that the Canadian law also requires it to archive all “partisan ads,” a category that is too vague to nail down.

“The challenge for us is that that definition (of partisan) is extremely broad,” said McKay.

Canadian politicians are not entirely without options though. Facebook and Twitter are viable advertising platforms. Google also said it would not be blocking ads from any of its other services like YouTube. Political advertising will only be banned from the AdEx platform.",Google bans Canadian political ads during its 2019 election cycle,Techspot.com,https://www.techspot.com/news/79041-google-bans-canadian-political-ads-during-2019-election.html

Google won't run political ads during Canada's 2019 election, according to The Globe and Mail. Google made its decision in response to a new set of election advertising transparency rules, which Google said would be too difficult to comply with.

""We’ve come to the decision that the best way for Google to comply with the Elections Act in the 2019 election cycle is actually to stop accepting elections ads as defined in the legislation,” Colin McKay, Google Canada’s head of public policy and government relations, told the Globe and Mail. “It is painful for us.”

The decision highlights the different ways that tech giants are addressing election and content integrity issues. Banning, down-ranking, flagging, keeping track of, or removing content from search results are all tools in these companies' arsenals to make sure the information reaching their customers is accurate and transparent — and each tech company has its own approach. In fact, Google has been working on its own election ""integrity and transparency"" measures — but the Canadian requirements were apparently just... too transparent?

Canada will hold its federal elections in October 2019. A new law passed in December, Bill C-76, includes the provision that companies that distribute political advertisements must keep a written registry of all political ads that it shows to its customers.

That might sound simple enough. But because Google's advertising platform runs on a lightning fast, automated auction system, Google says that it does not necessarily know which ads it is showing. Which, hey, maybe that's part of the problem!

In any case, Google said it would be ""extremely difficult"" to comply with the regulations. So it is opting out of the political ads game in Canada in advance of the 2019 election.

Canadian officials are actually not pleased with Google's decision. Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould told the Globe and Mail that the move was “very disappointing.""

""We know that Google is enormously capable both technically and financially,"" Gould said. ""It should apply these resources to producing a registry in Canada that complies with Canada’s laws.""

Google's move in Canada is markedly different from Facebook's election integrity efforts. Facebook already keeps a registry of advertisements on the platform that is searchable by issue or name, although it does not provide one all-encompassing list.

Mark Zuckerberg recently wrote that Facebook did consider removing political ads altogether. But Facebook ultimately decided that ""giving people a voice"" was important enough to warrant keeping election ads on the platform. He noted that doing away with political ads would have actually been more cost effective, since all the tools Facebook is building out to promote election integrity are costly. Perhaps Google's calculations between building the list vs. reaping political ad dollars came to a different conclusion than Facebook — Minster Gould seems to think so.

""Google’s decision to opt out of political advertising during the regulated period appears to have been made for business reasons and does not reflect on the quality of our laws, which are designed to protect Canadian voters and our elections,” Gould told the Globe and Mail.

In the United States, House Democrats have introduced a package of legislation intended to strengthen voting, campaign finance, and elections ethics. Included in the bill is a national registry of political advertising, that would keep track of advertising requests for more than $500. The bill will likely face strong opposition as it advances, especially in the Republican-controlled Senate. But if an advertising database were to come to fruition, Google's move in Canada shows that the tech giant might not be so keen to comply with any similar future U.S. provision.

A related column zeros in on how the market for designer frames came to be so heavily dominated by Milan-based Luxottica, which owns and licenses brands including Armani, Chanel, Coach, Michael Kors, Oakley, Oliver Peoples, and Ray-Ban. “In 1995, Luxottica purchased LensCrafters’ parent company, US Shoe Corp., for $1.4 billion.

Burnaby South is a key test of both Singh’s hold on his left-leaning party and the popularity of Maxime Bernier’s new far-right populist party, focused on immigration and carbon taxes.

Burnaby South is historically a diverse, working-class riding. Its median income falls 18 per cent below the national average. It has a higher proportion of visible minorities than neighbouring Vancouver or Surrey — even higher than Toronto. It was previously an NDP stronghold.

“I think he will win,” said Moscrop. “But he doesn’t have federal experience as MP … Forget forming government: He needs to show he can hold the government accountable, with only months left until the election.”

So it may be Singh’s to lose.

And with Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada running its first big candidate in Burnaby South — former radio host Laura Lynn Tyler Thompson — the election has seen tense all-candidates debates devolve into audience heckling and allegations of racism and extremism.

“If she can nab even 10 per cent, Bernier will be crowing for months,” Moscrop argued. “This is the perfect time for his party to do well. It’s getting outsized media attention, and they can focus on locking down a smaller segment of the electorate.

“Plus, there’s enough disaffection, not to mention xenophobia, today that could express itself as support.”

Here’s what’s at stake in Burnaby South, what voters are saying their top issues are and why this byelection is being so scrutinized across the country.

Who is running?

Singh, a former Ontario provincial politician and lawyer, is facing off against three rival party hopefuls.

One of those rivals, Thompson of the People’s Party of Canada, has generated considerable controversy by tapping into public anxieties around immigration and refugees.

Also running is another former provincial politician, Richard Lee, with the Liberals. Jay Shin is carrying the flag for the federal Conservative party, mounting concerns over the Liberals’ more than three years in office, expressing particular opposition to certain taxes and drug policies.

There are also two independent candidates running.

What is at stake nationally?

It’s seen as a high-stakes byelection beyond the borders of B.C.’s Lower Mainland mainly because experts say it’s a key test of Singh’s hold on the leadership of his party — which he’s headed since 2017 despite not yet holding a seat in Parliament. Facing the Liberals in Ottawa is seen as essential to his party’s chances, and some have speculated he could face an internal coup if he fails his first ballot-box test.

It also remains to be seen whether Bernier’s right-wing populist party, the People’s Party of Canada, has the kind of broad appeal he claims. Burnaby South is the first chance to test that support in a largely working-class city.

Another dynamic is how well the Liberal brand performs, as the party is currently embroiled in allegations that staffers pressured the former attorney general to stop prosecuting Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid a high-profile campaign visit to Lee and faced cheering crowds, but Liberal support has fallen in recent polls across the country, including in B.C.

“Byelections are pretty silly tests of public mood,” Moscrop cautioned, “because they don’t really mimic the conditions of a general election.

“They’re a really strange one-off, or in this case, three. People try to read a lot into them but shouldn’t.”

What is the tone on the campaign trail?

Unusually bitter and divisive for a local riding byelection. Three all-candidates debates in a row have descended into audience members shouting accusations of racism, fascism and extremism against each other and candidates onstage.

The spark has been any conversation about immigration, refugees and people illegally crossing the border into Canada. The subjects have stoked anger at recent Yellow Vests rallies and from the People’s Party of Canada, which alleges all three rival parties are soft on screening people entering the country. The People’s party wants a tighter cap on immigration numbers and more prevention of irregular asylum-seekers.

That’s led to accusations of racism and xenophobia — but some in Burnaby South have cited the murder of a Chinese-Canadian teen, allegedly by a Syrian refugee, as evidence of a public safety risk. Meanwhile, the Liberal and NDP candidates have countered that the actions of one individual should not represent an entire group of people.

The People’s party candidate has accused her Conservative opponent of “smearing” her in a pamphlet delivered to constituents, which included pictures of marijuana leaves and empty syringes and alleged the party supports drugs.

The original Liberal candidate in Burnaby South was forced to resign by the party after the Star unearthed online posts in Chinese pointing out that Singh is South Asian.

What do locals say?

Despite Singh’s future hanging in the balance, when the Star hit the suburban city’s streets to find out what regular voters think, locals appeared more focused on anything but the NDP leader’s prospects in Ottawa.

By far, the most commonly cited issue in this byelection was affordable housing, followed by taxes, jobs, the environment and immigration.

Who are Burnaby’s voters?

Burnaby’s demographics are increasingly young and not white, the 2016 census found. Its average age is three years below B.C.’s average, and 69 per cent of its population identifies as a visible minority, more than triple Canada’s rate. (The Greater Toronto Area, by comparison, was 51 per cent visible minorities.)

Burnaby South is home to a sizable Chinese-Canadian community, followed in number by Caucasians, South Asians and Filipinos.

In fact, 54 per cent of Burnaby South residents say they are immigrants, according to the 2016 census, compared to the Canada-wide figure of 14 per cent. (Immigrants in the Greater Toronto Area make up 46 per cent of the population.)

It’s also a historically working-class riding, with the median income at just $28,183 per year, 18 per cent less than the national average. Burnaby South’s poverty rates are significantly higher than the national average, with 22 per cent of residents being defined by Statistics Canada as low income, compared to 16 per cent nationally.

How can eligible voters cast their ballots?

Polls are open to any eligible Burnaby South resident from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday. Since not all Burnaby residents are eligible — the city contains multiple federal ridings — you can find out if you can vote, and where, on Elections Canada’s website.

It could threaten the political future of the country's leader and the rule of the Liberal Party, seven months ahead of national elections.","(CNN) A scandal is swirling around Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party. It could threaten the political future of the country's leader and the rule of the Liberal Party, seven months ahead of national elections.

What happened?

Wilson-Raybould later alleged in testimony to the House Justice Committee that she faced ""veiled threats"" and ""sustained"" pressure to help Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin , a major employer in Canada. A conviction would keep the company from getting government contracts for a decade. It has 9,000 employees in Canada and thousands more worldwide.

Resignations

The allegations, denied by Trudeau, sparked national outrage and resignations.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from the Cabinet. She had been moved to minister of Veterans Affairs in January in a Cabinet shuffle and resigned in February.

Gerald Butts, Trudeau's top aide, also resigned in February amid accusations he pressured the former attorney general. He denied the accusations and said he stepped away from the office because ""it cannot and should not take one moment away from the vital work the Prime Minister and his office is doing for all Canadians.""

Jane Philpott , who had held several portfolios in Trudeau's Cabinet before becoming Treasury Board president, resigned Monday, saying she lost confidence in the government's handling of an inquiry into the allegations of pressure.

The latest

On Wednesday, Butts appeared before the House Justice Committee. He contradicted Wilson-Reybould's claims and said he believed she saw the Cabinet change as a demotion over ""her refusal to negotiate an out-of-court settlement with SNC.""

""I firmly believe nothing inappropriate occurred here and nothing inappropriate was alleged to have occurred until after the Cabinet shuffle,"" Butts testified.

Some of the meetings and events Butts testified about were not addressed by Wilson-Raybould, compelling some members of the Justice Committee to ask to hear from her again.

But that was opposed in a closed-door meeting, according to Conservative lawmaker Lisa Raitt, and the Liberals on the committee decided not to pursue a motion for her return.

""Canadians are going to be pretty ticked off, to be honest,"" she said. ""Liberal members of the committee decided, well we've heard enough. Nothing new to see here, nothing new can come of it, and I think that's atrocious.""

Trudeau's image

Trudeau, the son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, swept into power in November 2015 presenting a fresh-faced image. He disputed Wilson-Raybould's testimony to the House Justice Committee.

But because of the controversy, his image as a clean politician has taken a hit.

Daniel Beland , director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada, cites Philpott's stance about concern over the ""independence and integrity"" of the justice system. He's a professor of political science at McGill University.

""It's starting to hurt the Prime Minister and liberals in the polls,"" he said, with the opposition conservatives taking a slight lead in polling seven months before the election.

To the incomparable @janephilpott, truly the #MOC...For almost 4 years our country has witnessed your constant & unassailable commitment to always doing what is right & best for Cdns. You are a leader of vision & strength & I look forward to continuing to work alongside you. ❤️U. pic.twitter.com/bwL6ouQjSA — Jody Wilson-Raybould (@Puglaas) March 4, 2019

Trudeau has been seen as a figure who will do politics differently, but Beland said, ""You hear on social media that he's just a politician like any other."" The claim of pressuring and Trudeau's perceived lack of candor about what happened ""is very damaging"" since the issue centers around ""trying to undermine the rule of law.""

""He has not said much about this,"" Beland said. ""People have complained about the fact that the PM didn't give a strong account of the story.""

Beland said in recent days there are indications Trudeau was listening to the concerns of Canadian citizens. He canceled public events to seek counsel on the matter, for example.

""But it's not going well. You can't change the channel. This story is not going away. The public sympathy is on the side of Jody Wilson-Raybould.""

The resignation of the two Cabinet members hurts Trudeau's vision of promoting feminism and helping indigenous people, Beland said. Wilson-Reybould is an indigenous woman and Philpott had been minister of Indigenous Services.

The controversy also accentuates the belief among some that Trudeau cares more about Quebec, where SNC-Lavalin is located, than other regions and industries, such as the oil industry in the West.

There is strong support among people in Quebec to support SNC-Lavalin because of the jobs it provides.

What's next?

Beland said this could undermine Liberal Party prospects seven months from now. The Conservatives are leading slightly in polls but the parties have been neck and neck.

""There's still time for the liberals to catch up and bounce back,"" he said. ""I don't think they are finished.""

He said Trudeau's trip to India last year was mocked and criticized, but he and the Liberals rebounded.

The Conservatives, led by Andrew Scheer , are waiting in the wings. Scheer said Philpott's resignation ""clearly demonstrates a government in total chaos led by a disgraced Prime Minister.""

Beland said, ""The Conservatives and Liberals both have a shot at forming a government. It would probably be a close race.""

""I can't recall anything specific.""

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May asks Gerald Butts whether there was any evidence jobs were actually at stake, if SNC-Lavalin did not get a deferred prosecution agreement.

Canada could also face the prospect of a minority government, where neither party has a majority. That would be a weaker government. The New Democratic Party, a leftist party, could have more clout in that arrangement.

If this continues, it could tarnish Trudeau and also Canada's image as a clean and humane democracy.

China, already at odds with Canada over the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou , is now accusing Canada of not respecting the rule of law.

""The rule of law is a very important issue,"" Beland said.

""The independence of justice is very important in the US, it raises important issues about the independence of the judiciary and democracy.""",A political scandal in Canada. What's going on?,CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/06/americas/canada-politics-explainer/index.html
24,Empty,2019-03-04T15:16:40Z,"In business as well as international politics, the best and ideal agreement is one that is credible and expected to be complied with. Compliance often necessitates trade sanctions or other sufficiently severe consequences for those parties that do not comply …","In business as well as international politics, the best and ideal agreement is one that is credible and expected to be complied with. Compliance often necessitates trade sanctions or other sufficiently severe consequences for those parties that do not comply as promised.

So what explains the logic behind why most existing international environmental agreements are weak and without sufficiently strong sanctions? As an example, countries that emitted excessively under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol were asked to compensate by cutting emissions more in the future but faced no additional sanctions if they didn't. And in late December 2018, negotiators met in Katowice, Poland, to discuss the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change but failed to take advantage of the possibility to introduce sanctions on noncompliers.

Why does this continue to happen? A new political economy analysis forthcoming in the Journal of Political Economy shows that domestic policymakers may not have sufficient incentives to negotiate efficient treaties. In ""The Political Economy of Weak Treaties,"" authors Marco Battaglini and Bard Harstad explain that: ""When a treaty is weak and not fully enforced, voters are uncertain whether the obligations will be met and they forecast that compliance hinges on whether they elect the incumbent or a political challenger."" The political incumbent can always turn this contingency to their advantage, they show.

When the treaty is weak, a relatively ""green"" party with more environmentally friendly preferences than the median voter may prefer to comply, while a relatively ""brown"" party will not. Thus, a green incumbent prefers to negotiate a weak treaty that is attractive to the median voter, but not to the brown challenger, so that the voters must reelect the incumbent to see the treaty being implemented. Likewise, a brown incumbent prefers a treaty so weak and so costly that the median voter prefers to elect the brown party, which will not comply, rather than the more environmentally friendly green party, who would comply regardless. In either case, the incumbent improves the reelection chances by negotiating some kind of weak treaty, because only weak treaties differentiate the competing candidates.

This reasoning implies that state leaders who face elections (in contrast to dictators) prefer to sign many treaties as long as the treaties are likely to be weak and essentially ineffective. The study finds that democratic countries do sign more treaties but the effect of a treaty on emission cuts is smaller than for other countries.

When American Vice President Al Gore negotiated ambitious emission cuts on behalf of the US in the late 1990s, the commitments were not strongly enforced and the next president could easily walk away from the treaty, which he did. The authors explore similar stories from Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. ""In many of these cases, sacrificing the climate can have been motivated by reelection concerns,"" the authors note.",Sacrificing the climate for reelections,Phys.org,https://phys.org/news/2019-03-sacrificing-climate-reelections.html
25,Empty,2019-03-07T13:21:00Z,These cannabis growers offer the highest output per square foot.,"The past six months have been an absolute whirlwind for the marijuana industry. In October, we witnessed the industry gain the legitimacy it's sought for so long after Canada became the first industrialized country in the world to legalize recreational cannabis. Then, just weeks later, the U.S. midterm elections increased the number of states to have given the green light to medical cannabis to 33. A month later, President Trump signed the Farm Bill into law, legalizing hemp and hemp-derived cannabidiol products. At seemingly every turn, the outlook for the cannabis industry has been improving.

However, this is also a nascent industry -- at least from a legal perspective. With dozens of cannabis growers -- some public, some private -- duking it out for market share, differentiation has been difficult. Some growers have been able to stand out because of their peak production potential, while others have thrust themselves onto investors' radars by announcing a brand-name partnership. Ultimately, though, it's operating margins that'll separate the winners from the wannabes.

These pot stocks know how to grow

One of the most direct margin comparisons investors can make is by examining a pot grower's yield per square foot. Generally speaking, growers that offer an above-average yield should generate better margins than their peers. While not all growers are necessarily forthcoming with their growing capacity square footage or peak annual production estimates, four marijuana stocks stand out as being on track to be well above the industry average of 100 grams of yield per square foot of growing space.

Flowr Corp.: 300 to 450 grams per square foot

At the top of the mountain, overlooking all other cannabis growers, is small-cap Flowr Corp. (NASDAQOTH:FLWPF), which I doubt most investors have heard of and even fewer would guess leads the pack in crop yield. According to a previous investor presentation from Flowr, the company expects to produce up to 60,000 kilograms of peak output annually by 2021, with the company netting 300 to 450 grams per square foot at its Kelowna campus in British Columbia.

What's particularly exciting about Flowr is that it's chosen to focus on ultra-premium cannabis production. There's not a lot of competition for extremely high-grade cannabis, which is a plus. Additionally, premium pot comes with a considerably higher price point, which, when combined with its superior yield per square foot, should result in some very impressive operating margins, once at full capacity.

While not profitable at the moment with a current run rate of 5,000 kilograms per year, it's a pot stock worth keeping a close eye on.

OrganiGram Holdings: 230 grams per square foot

OrganiGram Holdings (NASDAQOTH:OGRMF), the only major Atlantic-based grower, should also dazzle in terms of yield per square foot. The company's CEO, Greg Engel, has been guiding investors to expect 113,000 kilograms of peak annual production. But this output will be generated from the company's Moncton campus in New Brunswick, which spans just 490,000 square feet. That's about 230 grams per square foot, or well over double the industry average.

One of the key reasons the company is able to outproduce its peers is its greenhouse setup. OrganiGram employs a three-tiered growing system, which helps maximize its 490,000 square feet of growing space. When combined with the fact that, unlike most top-tier producers, OrganiGram is only operating out of its Moncton campus and doesn't have other grow sites in Canada, the company is able to keep its supply chain costs down while its yields are substantially higher than other growers. That's an excellent combination for healthy profits.

Perhaps it comes as no surprise that OrganiGram's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23 is among the lowest in the marijuana industry.

Aurora Cannabis: 125 grams per square foot

You might also be surprised to learn that the largest projected producer in Canada, Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB), may also be one of the highest-yielding growers per square foot. Aurora, which has grown organically, inorganically, and via partnerships, could deliver 700,000 kilograms in peak annual output by 2021 or 2022, according to my calculations.

Admittedly, getting a complete picture of Aurora's square footage is difficult because of its numerous acquisitions and its presence in two dozen countries. However, what few organic projects we do have specifics on, the company has consistently projected output per square foot that would be nicely above the industry average. For example, the 800,000-square-foot Aurora Sky facility is expected to produce at least 100,000 kilos a year, or about 125 grams per square foot. Meanwhile, the Aurora Sun facility, which is under construction in Medicine Hat, Alberta, should produce 150,000 kilos over roughly 1.2 million square feet (i.e., the same yield as Aurora Sky).

Aurora's secret sauce appears to be its wholly owned subsidiary Larssen, which designs and constructs greenhouses. Larssen's knowledge of the industry will be paramount to Aurora Cannabis achieving superior crop yields.

The Supreme Cannabis Company: 114 grams per square foot

Last, but certainly not least, is The Supreme Cannabis Company (NASDAQOTH:SPRWF). Supreme Cannabis is leaning on its premium recreational brand known as 7Acres to drive growth. This is a brand that features a generally higher tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) potency than most growers -- THC is the cannabinoid that gets a user high -- which in turn should lead to higher per-gram sales prices to consumers and in the wholesale market.

According to Supreme Cannabis, the company's 440,000-square-foot 7Acres facility, which should be complete this month, will yield at least 50,000 kilos of premium pot on an annual peak basis. That's a yield of 114 grams per square foot, or about 14% above the industry average. These sort of ""junior growers"" in the range of 40,000 to 60,000 kilos that are using genetics to focus on premium product, branding, and yield could be surprisingly profitable and are thus worth watching very closely.",4 Marijuana Stocks With Superior Crop Yields,Fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/03/07/4-marijuana-stocks-with-superior-crop-yields.aspx

Venezuela has plunged into a major political crisis amid a growing dispute over President Nicolas Maduro's future as the country's leader.

Maduro took office for a second term on January 10 on the basis of what was by many condemned as a fraudulent election last May.

The opposition, alongside Juan Guaido, rejected Maduro's claim, and on January 23, Guaido self-proclaimed interim president.

The United States alongside Canada, and more than 20 other countries, have recognised Guaido's presidential bid. But China, Turkey, Iran, Russia and Cuba stand by Maduro.

'Reckless escalation'

The deployment by Russia of air force planes and personnel in Venezuela over the weekend is a ""reckless escalation of the situation,"" the US State Department has said.

""The United States condemns Russia's deployment of military aircraft and personnel to Caracas, which is another contradiction of both Nicolas Maduro's and Russia's calls for non-intervention in Venezuela and is a reckless escalation of the situation,"" a department spokesman says.

Second blackout hits Venezuela

Power outages have hit across Caracas and in other parts of Venezuela less than two weeks after power was restored following a prolonged blackout.

Power is out in much of eastern Caracas as well as downtown, where the Miraflores presidential palace and most government ministries are located. Authorities say the Caracas subway is shutting down due to the lack of power.

Shops across the country closed early to protect against possible looting.

Maduro has said a major shake-up will take place in his government in the coming days.

""I will in the coming hours announce a profound change in the entire government of Venezuela,"" Maduro says in a speech at a political rally broadcast on state television.

""We need to renew ourselves, refresh, improve, change.""

Maduro also says the police has dismantled a plot to assassinate him led by Guaido and announces new arrests.

""We have dismantled a plan organised personally by the diabolical puppet to kill me,"" Maduro tells thousands of supporters in Caracas.

""In the next few days there will surely be new captures of new terrorists,"" he adds.

US sanctions Venezuelan state-owned bank Bandes

The United States imposed sanctions on Friday on state-owned Venezuelan development bank Bandes in response to the arrest of an aide to opposition leader Juan Guaido, saying the government had used it to prop itself up by moving assets abroad.

""[President Nicolas] Maduro and his enablers have distorted the original purpose of the bank ... as part of a desperate attempt to hold onto power,"" US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement announcing the action.

Venezuela key topic between Trump and Caribbean leaders

US President Donald Trump is hosting the leaders of Jamaica, Bahamas, Haiti, Dominican Republic and St Lucia at his affluent Mar-a-Lago club to show his support for Caribbean countries that back democratic transition in Venezuela.

The five have either denounced President Nicolas Maduro or have joined more than 50 countries in recognising Juan Guaido as the rightful interim leader of the nation.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump will use the meeting to thank the leaders for their support for peace and democracy in Venezuela and discuss potential opportunities for energy investment.

Nations in the Caribbean, however, have been split on whether to interfere in Venezuela.

South American presidents announce creation of new regional bloc

A group of South American leaders signed a declaration to create a regional bloc of nations they say is open to any country, regardless of ideology, to collaborate on solving regional problems.

Venezuelan gov't accuses detained Guaido aide of planning attacks

Venezuela's interior minister said on Thursday that authorities had arrested opposition leader Juan Guaido's chief of staff for his involvement in an alleged ""terrorist cell"" that was planning attacks against high-level political figures.

Interior Minister Nestor Reverol, during an appearance on state television, showed an image of two rifles, which he called evidence collected against Roberto Marrero.

The opposition had said earlier that intelligence agents had planted weapons in Marrero's house during a pre-dawn raid, a move by President Nicolas Maduro that the Trump administration said would ""not go unanswered"".

Trump adviser Bolton vows action after Guaido aide detained in Venezuela

US President Donald Trump's national security adviser called for the immediate release of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido's chief of staff on Thursday, saying his detention would ""not go unanswered"".



White House national security adviser John Bolton said the government of Nicolas Maduro had ""made another big mistake"" with the ""illegitimate arrest"" of the aide, Roberto Marrero. ""He should be released immediately and his safety guaranteed,"" Bolton wrote in a Twitter post.

IMF still seeking member views on Venezuela leader recognition: Spokesman

The International Monetary Fund is still awaiting guidance from its members on whether to recognise Juan Guaido as Venezuela's leader, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said on Thursday, adding that there is no schedule for an IMF board meeting to decide the issue.



Rice told an IMF news briefing that there is still no clarity on Venezuela's leadership situation and any shift in the Fund's recognition of the government will be guided by its 189 member countries and the international community and ""views are still being formed"".



Another Washington-based multilateral institution, the Inter-American Development Bank, last week replaced the representative of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro with an economist backed by Guaido, a major setback for the Maduro government.

Venezuela's Guaido says intelligence agents detained his chief of staff

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido said on Thursday intelligence agents had detained his chief of staff following a pre-dawn raid, signaling that President Nicolas Maduro may be cracking down on the opposition's challenge to his rule.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a post on Twitter on Thursday, called for Roberto Marrero's immediate release and said ""we will hold accountable those involved"". The United States has repeatedly warned Maduro not to move against Guaido.

UN rights boss decries Venezuela crackdown

The UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said on Wednesday that Venezuelan security forces, backed by pro-government militias, have cracked down on peaceful dissent, with excessive use of force, killings and torture documented by her office.



Bachelet, addressing the United Nations Human Rights Council, also voiced concern that the latest US sanctions on financial transfers linked to the sale of Venezuelan oil ""may contribute to aggravating the economic crisis"".



Venezuelan authorities had failed to acknowledge the extent and severity of the health and food crisis that has driven more than 3 million Venezuelans to flee abroad and they had adopted ""insufficient"" measures, she told the Geneva forum.

Brazil foreign minister says US, Brazil share same view on Venezuela

Brazilian Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo said on Wednesday President Jair Bolsonaro's visit to Washington this week made clear that the United States and Brazil share the same view of how to deal with the Venezuelan crisis.

Araujo said at a news conference that Brazil will act diplomatically and politically, while the US could increase sanctions against the Venezuelan government.



Although US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday all options are open, Brazil's armed forces are opposed to any military intervention in Venezuela.

Venezuela doctors under Maduro pressure during UN visit

Venezuelan doctors have come under pressure from President Nicolas Maduro's government for trying to alert a visiting UN mission about the severe lack of hospital medicine and equipment, NGOs say.



Venezuelan authorities say that US sanctions freezing $30bn in assets have blocked imports of basic items including medicine.



But they have roughly stomped down on dissenting voices saying much of the resulting medical emergency is the fault of mismanagement, the NGOs allege.



According to Medicos Unidos (Doctors United), the repression has worsened over the past two weeks. ""We have drawn attention to our patients dying for lack of supplies and equipment. Doctors have been arrested without any reason at all,"" Jaime Lorenzo, executive director of the association said.

Trump: US has not yet imposed toughest sanctions on Venezuela

US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that his administration had held in reserve what he called ""the toughest of sanctions"" to try to cut off revenues to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

""We haven't done the toughest of sanctions, as you know,"" Trump said after discussing the crisis in Venezuela at the White House with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.

Trump in January slapped sanctions on state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA, the stiffest economic measure against Maduro to date. But Trump's administration has not yet tried to prevent companies based outside the United States from buying Venezuelan oil, a strategy known as ""secondary sanctions"".

The secondary sanctions were part of Washington's strategy to cut off revenue to Iran, which eventually helped force Tehran to negotiate a nuclear deal with six world powers in 2015.

Trump reaffirms US considering 'all options' in Venezuela

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday reaffirmed that ""all options"" are being considered in his drive to bring down Venezuela's hard-left President Nicolas Maduro.



""All options are on the table,"" he told reporters in the White House. ""It's a shame what's happening in Venezuela - the debt and the destruction and the hunger.""



Trump spoke at a meeting where he hosted Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has backed the US-led campaign to pressure Maduro.

US-Russia talks on Venezuela positive but no agreement on Maduro: Abrams

Talks between the United States and Russia over the crisis in Venezuela were positive and substantive but the two sides were still divided over the legitimacy of President Nicolas Maduro, US special representative Elliott Abrams said on Tuesday.

""No, we did not come to a meeting of minds, but I think the talks were positive in the sense that both sides emerged with a better understanding of the other's views,"" Abrams said, adding that both sides had agreed on the depth of the crisis.

Meanwhile, RIA news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying the talks over the crisis in Venezuela were difficult but frank.

Russia warned the US not to intervene militarily in Venezuela, a Moscow ally, and said it was increasingly concerned by US sanctions on the Latin American country, Ryabkov was quoted as saying.

US hits Venezuela with new sanctions on state-run mining company

The United States imposed sanctions on Tuesday against Venezuela's state-run mining company Minerven and its president, Adrian Perdomo, in a bid to further cut off funding to the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The announcement came days after Uganda said it was investigating its biggest gold refinery for importing Venezuelan gold. Washington has warned gold traders not to deal in Venezuelan gold or oil.

""The illegitimate Maduro regime is pillaging the wealth of Venezuela while imperiling indigenous people by encroaching on protected areas and causing deforestation and habitat loss,"" US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.

US backs Venezuela opposition to take UN disarmament role

A top US diplomat said her country wants an envoy of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido to take up the rotating presidency of a key UN disarmament body in two months.

Assistant Secretary Yleem Poblete said on Tuesday the US hopes a Guaido envoy ""will be in a position"" to take the conference presidency when Venezuela's turn comes in May.

Venezuelan ambassador Jorge Valero, who represents President Nicolas Maduro's government, called Poblete's comments ""absolutely absurd"" and accused the Trump administration of seeking to install a ""puppet president"" in Venezuela.

Venezuela suspends oil exports to India: Oil minister

Venezuela has suspended its oil exports to India and views Russia and China as its main export destinations, the Azeri energy ministry said on Tuesday, citing Venezuela's oil minister.

The Azeri ministry issued the statement on Tuesday following talks in Baku between Azerbaijan's energy minister and Venezuelan oil minister and president of state-run oil company PDVSA, Manuel Quevedo.

The Indian market has been crucial for Venezuela's economy because it has historically been the second-largest cash-paying customer for the OPEC country's crude, behind the United States.

Earlier this year, the US imposed heavy sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry and has pressed India to stop buying Venezuelan oil.

Colombia: 1,000 Venezuelan forces crossed border

About 1,000 members of the Venezuelan security forces have fled to Colombia since last month, giving up weapons and uniforms as they abandoned the government of Maduro, Colombian authorities say.

Colombia's foreign ministry released the updated number of Venezuelan police and military personnel who crossed the border, many around the time of a February 23 attempt by Guaido to deliver US-provided humanitarian aid to Venezuela.

US -sanctioned general defects to Colombia: sources

A Venezuelan general who is under US sanction for incompetent management of a state medicine programme has fled to Colombia amid growing pressure on Maduro, two sources familiar with the matter tell Reuters.

The US in 2018 sanctioned army General Carlos Rotondaro, former head of a government agency that provided medicine for chronic health conditions, as part of efforts to ""highlight the economic mismanagement and endemic corruption"" by Maduro's government.

Rotondaro has left for Colombia and has joined forces with former Venezuelan Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, who is working to have Maduro removed from office, one of the sources says.

Guaido launches new round of protests

Large crowds have gathered in the northern city of Valencia to greet Guaido, who plans to tour Venezuela as part of his campaign to oust Maduro.

Guaido post photos on Twitter showing him at a cathedral service and a market.

""Those who work here and those who come to buy what little they can are working people who deserve to live better,"" Guaido writes.

""And although now the market [is not a place of] bustle and joy, today our people filled it with a strong cry of hope and freedom,"" he adds.

Protests are also planned in the capital, Caracas, and other parts of the country as Guaido seeks to ramp up pressure on Maduro, who says he is the target of a coup plot directed from Washington.

Quienes trabajan aquí y quienes vienen a comprar lo poco que pueden son gente trabajadora que merece vivir mejor.

Netherlands, US agree to use Curacao as possible aid hub

The Netherlands and the US reached an agreement on Friday to use facilities on the Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao for possible distribution of aid to nearby Venezuela, Curacao's prime minister said.

The island will only be used for civilian operations to deliver aid, such as food and medicines, to Venezuela if the Venezuelan government explicitly allows it, the Dutch Foreign Ministry said last month.

Curacao Prime Minister Eugene Rhuggenaath said on Twitter the US and the Netherlands signed an agreement detailing the access and use of facilities in Curacao as a humanitarian hub for aid to Venezuela.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has refused to let foreign aid into Venezuela, despite a deep economic crisis marked by shortages of food and medicine and hyperinflation. Maduro has called US-led aid efforts a veiled invasion meant to push him from power.

IDB first multilateral lender to recognise Guaido's envoy

The Inter-American Development Bank on Friday voted to replace the representative of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro with an economist backed by opposition leader Juan Guaido, in a major setback for the Maduro government.

The decision makes the IADB, Latin America's largest regional lender, the first financial institution to recognise Guaido and would eventually free up development lending to Venezuela if Maduro steps down.

Guaido, who has been recognised as the OPEC country's legitimate leader by most Western countries, including the US and many in Latin America, named Harvard University economist Ricardo Hausmann as his representative to the IADB, forcing a vote by the lender's 48-member board of governors just two weeks before its annual meeting in China.

US envoy: Venezuela oil production dropping steadily

The US special representative for Venezuela said on Friday that Venezuela's oil exports have been dropping steadily by roughly 50,000 barrels per month and production is likely to dip below a million barrels a day within a ""month or two"".

""They are heading down toward a million now, and in a month or two will be below a million"" barrels per day, US envoy Elliott Abrams told a news briefing, adding that the decline seen in recent days could partly be attributed to the blackouts that had crippled the country. ""It's a steady decline,"" he added.

The OPEC member's oil production has dwindled in the last two decades, from more than 3 million bpd at the beginning of the century to between 1.2 million and 1.4 million bpd by late 2018. Most of the crude it produces now is heavy or extra heavy.

American Airlines pilots told by union not to fly to Venezuela

American Airlines Group Inc pilots should not fly to Venezuela, an influential pilots union said on Friday, following a travel advisory issued by the US State Department this week.

The department cited civil unrest, poor health and arbitrary arrest and detention of US citizens in Venezuela for issuing the advisory.

""Do not accept any trips to Venezuela,"" the Allied Pilots Association said in a statement.

A number of airlines have stopped their flights to the country because of security concerns and disputes over money they say the government owes them. United Airlines ended its flights to Venezuela in 2017.

Military intervention not an answer for Venezuela: Colombia president

Military intervention in Venezuela is not the way to resolve the crisis in the country, Colombia's President Ivan Duque said in an interview in Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore published on Friday.

""I do not think the solution is a military intervention,"" Duque told the newspaper when asked about any proposed intervention, especially by the US.

US President Donald Trump has taken steps to ratchet up pressure on Maduro and bolster Guaido, recognised by the US and more than 50 other countries, including Colombia. But Washington has dismissed as baseless suggestions it is planning to intervene militarily.

Bolivia's Morales: Venezuela needs dialogue, not foreign meddling

Bolivia's leftist President Evo Morales, a supporter of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, said on Friday that European nations should support a dialogue within the country.

Morales, who is on a visit to Greece, said meddling in the domestic affairs of another country never bodes well.

""History has taught that there have been many interventions from the outside, such as the case of Libya and Iraq, and they never offered a solution"", Morales said in translated comments after meeting Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. ""On the contrary it abolished democracy,"" he said.

Morales is one of a few Latin American leaders to support the embattled Maduro, whose country has been reeling from a humanitarian crisis.

US revoked more than 340 visas from Venezuelans since Monday

The US has revoked hundreds of visas from Venezuelans since Monday, nearly a third of which belonged to former diplomats from Venezuela and their families, and is urging US citizens in Venezuela to flee the country days after the US withdrew its diplomats from Venezuela, the State Department said on Thursday.

""Since this Monday ... we have revoked 340 visas, 107 of which include visas of Maduro's former diplomats and their families,"" State Department spokesman Robert Palladino told reporters.

US considering sanctions to restrict Visa, Mastercard in Venezuela: Official

The US is considering imposing financial sanctions that could prohibit Visa, Mastercard and other financial institutions from processing transactions in Venezuela, a senior Trump administration said on Thursday.

The move, which has not been finalised, would be a significant ratcheting up of pressure on the government of President Nicolas Maduro and his supporters.

""The purpose of these sanctions is to continue to deprive the illegitimate Maduro regime of access to funds and deny their ability to continue stealing from the Venezuelan people,"" the official said.

The US has withdrawn all remaining diplomatic personnel from its embassy in Caracas as the crisis in Venezuela deepens.

""Today, all US diplomats remaining in Venezuela departed the country. I know it is a difficult moment for them,"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on Thursday.

He said the US remains committed to supporting opposition leader Juan Guaido, who wants to remove Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and hold elections.

The embassy closure is set to worsen already tattered relations with US President Donald Trump, who has not ruled out military intervention to overthrow Maduro as Washington monitors rapidly unfolding events in the oil-rich but crippled South American nation.

House bills meant to step pressure on Venezuela's Maduro

The House Foreign Affairs Committee has approved bills intended to step up US pressure against Maduro's government.

The first bill would add new restrictions on the export of tear gas, riot gear and other ítems that can be used to control crime.

The second measure urges the Trump administration to provide up to $150m in humanitarian aid. Additionally, the State Department and intelligence agencies will be required to provide an assessment of a threat of Russian influence in Venezuela.

US diplomats in Venezuela prepare to head home

The last US diplomats in Venezuela are at the country's main airport, preparing to head home amid deteriorating ties between Washington and President Maduro, a US official said.

Earlier on Thursday, a convoy was seen leaving the US Embassy in Caracas.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted this week that the diplomats were being withdrawn because they had become a ""constraint"" on US policy.

The Venezuelan government disputed Pompeo's account, saying it had instructed the US diplomats to leave.

Diplomats walk out of UN conference

Diplomats walked out of a UN convention on drugs addressed by Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, saying his government was illegitimate and did not represent the country.



Dozens of officials from Latin America, as well as the US, Canada and some European countries, including France, left the room in protest as Arreaza took the podium for the meeting of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) in Vienna.



Multiple diplomats, including from Latin America and Europe, staged a walk-out last month during an Arreaza address to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva when he called for direct talks between Maduro and US President Donald Trump about the country's crisis.

Food supplier reports looting

Venezuela's largest private food supplier says massive looting and vandalism occurred at four facilities in the city of Maracaibo during nationwide power outages, complicating efforts to distribute food and drinks to people in the area.

Mogherini: Solution cannot be imposed from the outside

European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini says no military action from inside or outside Venezuela would be acceptable to resolve the ""dramatically"" deteriorating situation in the country.

She tells the UN Security Council in New York that ""a solution cannot be, and should never be, imposed from the outside.""

But she says that ""an international initiative can help build a peaceful and democratic way out of the crisis.""

US sanctions Russian bank for link to PDVSA

The US has sanctioned a Russian bank over its alleged dealings with Venezuela's state-owned oil company PDVSA.

Moscow-based Evrofinance Mosnarbank, which is jointly owned by Russian and Venezuelan state-owned companies, is now in a list of sanctioned individuals and entities due to its alleged attempts to circumvent US restrictions placed on PDVSA by offering the company financial, material and technological support.

""This action demonstrates that the US will take action against foreign financial institutions that sustain the illegitimate Maduro regime and contribute to the economic collapse and humanitarian crisis plaguing the people of Venezuela,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says in a statement.

Venezuelans scramble for food and water

Much of Venezuela, including parts of the capital Caracas, remains without power for a fifth day, crimping vital oil exports and leaving people struggling to obtain water and food.

Maduro again ordered the suspension of classes and the working day, as he had on Friday.

The lack of electricity has aggravated a crisis in Venezuelan hospitals, also lacking investment and maintenance in addition to the shortage of medicines.

Dr Julio Castro, of the non-governmental group Doctors for Health, said in a Twitter message on Sunday night that 21 people have died in public hospitals since the start of the blackout.

Jose oil port unable to resume exports - Reuters

Venezuela's state-run PDVSA oil firm has been unable to resume exports at Jose port, the nation's primary crude-export terminal, following last week's widespread power outage, according to people familiar with the matter.

PDVSA has launched a contingency plan to try and restore power, according to one of the people.

The country's crude upgraders, which convert up to 700,000 barrels per day of Orinoco Belt heavy oil into exportable grades, also are operating at minimum levels due to the lack of power, the people said.

NYT's report: Video contradicts claim that Maduro burned aid convoy

On February 24, the US administration accused Nicolas Maduro's government of torching a convoy of humanitarian aid amid a civil plight.

Senator Marco Rubio accused Maduro of ""committing a crime,"" while White House National Security Adviser John Bolton said the Venezuelan president had sent ""masked thugs"" to set the cargo alight.

The whole world saw the regime use security forces & gangs to injure & kill unarmed civilians.



The whole world saw them set fire to 3 trucks carrying food & other humanitarian aid.



They will soon realize just how badly they overplayed their hand today. — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) February 24, 2019

But the New York Times (NYT) has published footage that suggests that a Molotov cocktail thrown by an anti-government protester was the trigger for the blaze.

""At one point, a homemade bomb made from a bottle is hurled toward the police, who were blocking a bridge connecting Colombia and Venezuela to prevent the aid trucks from getting through,"" the report reads.

""But the rag used to light the Molotov cocktail separates from the bottle, flying toward the aid truck instead. Half a minute later, that truck is in flames,"" it adds.

The media outlet is not the first one to debunk the claim that Maduro was behind the fire.

On February 24, several independent journalists pointed out that a different situation took place:

I did not see any Venezuelan government forces set fire to US aid trucks on the Colombian side of the border. And neither did you. Actually, the evidence so far is pointing in the other direction. https://t.co/AVBPYtFMiR — Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) February 24, 2019

Guaido wants national emergency declared

Guaido says a state of emergency should be declared in the country over the ongoing power outages.

In parts of Venezuela, there has been no electricity since Thursday evening. The restoration of the electricity supply is progressing slowly and keeps suffering setbacks.

Guaido says the National Assembly, which is controlled by the opposition, should declare a national emergency in a special meeting.

""We can not turn our faces to the tragedy that our country is experiencing."" Guaido writes.

""I have called for an extraordinary session in the National Assembly tomorrow, where I will request, in my capacity as president, to decree a state of national emergency, based on article 338 of our constitution.""

Maduro seems set on staying put: US envoy

There are no signs Maduro is open to negotiations to end the political impasse with Juan Guaido, Washington's envoy for Venezuela says.

Abrams, however, plays down any possibility that the Venezuelan president was ready to talk about his exit. ""From everything we have seen, Maduro's tactic is to stay put,"" Abrams says.

Abrams has met with Russian representatives to the US about Moscow's support for Maduro.

""The Russians are not happy with Maduro for all the obvious reasons,"" Abrams says. ""In a couple of conversations, I have been told they have given advice to Maduro and he doesn't take it.""

""They continue to support him and there is no indication that I have seen that they are telling him it's time to bring this to an end,"" he says, adding: ""There could come a point where the Russians reach a conclusion that the regime is really unsalvageable.""

Fourth day of blackout

Venezuelans wake up to the fourth day of a nationwide blackout, leaving residents concerned about the impacts of the lack of electricity on the country's health, communications and transport systems.

The blackout, which began Thursday afternoon, keeps increasing frustration among Venezuelans already suffering widespread food and medicine shortages.

Food is rotting in refrigerators, people walk for miles to work with the Caracas subway down, and relatives abroad anxiously wait for updates from family members with telephone and internet signals intermittent.

Hospitals are also struggling, Julio Castro, who leads an NGO called Doctors for Health, says that at least 13 people have died amid the blackout. His statement could not be independently verified.

""What can you do without electricity?"" says Leonel Gutierrez, a 47-year-old systems technician, as he carried his six-month-old daughter on his way to buy groceries. ""The food we have has spoiled.""

Maduro blames blackouts on US weapons

Maduro says that his country's recent complete electrical failure was caused by ""an international cyber attack.""

""I will tell this for the first time,"" Maduro tells a crowd in Caracas.

""We are in the process of investigation, and correcting it all because there are many infiltrators attacking from within the electrical company.""

""The right wing, together with the empire, has stabbed the electricity system, and we are trying to cure it soon.""

The president also says Guaido is a puppet of Washington and dismisses his claim to the presidency as an effort by the administration of Trump to control Venezuela's oil wealth.

US gives time for Venezuela sanctions compliance

The Trump administration is granting US companies more time to comply with sanctions barring transactions with Venezuela's state-run oil company.

PDVSA was hit with US sanctions on January 28 in a step that caught some American companies by surprise. The sanctions had the effect of stranding several oil tankers at and near Venezuelan ports because their cargoes were unable to be legally paid for.

Treasury said on Friday the extension will allow certain financial contracts agreed upon before January 28 to be completed.

Venezuela hit by major blackout, government blames act of 'sabotage'

A major power outage hit crisis-stricken Venezuela on Thursday, according to Reuters witnesses, a problem the government of President Nicolas Maduro quickly blamed on ""sabotage"" at a hydroelectric dam that provides much of the country's power.

Electricity outages are frequent in Venezuela, where the economy is collapsing under hyperinflation, with chronic shortages of food and medicine and mass emigration of more than three million citizens.

Critics say corruption and underinvestment have left the country's power grid unable to function, while Maduro said the problems are intentionally created by political adversaries.

Local media and Twitter users reported that the outage was affecting the capital of Caracas as well as 15 of the country's 23 states. A reporter for state television described it as a ""national blackout.""

Trump's Venezuela envoy vows sanctions on banks supporting Maduro

German minister: Envoys helped prevent Guaido arrest

Heiko Maas said on Thursday he expressly asked Germany's ambassador to Venezuela, Daniel Kriener, to join other envoys at the airport.

He told reporters in Berlin on that ""there was information that [Guaido] was meant to be arrested there, and I think the presence of various ambassadors contributed to helping prevent this arrest.""

On Wednesday, the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced it was giving Kriener 48 hours to leave the country, a move seen as a response to Germany's support for Guaido.

PDVSA declares maritime emergency: Reuters

""This situation has been exacerbated by sanctions, and the resulting current political, economic, social and institutional crisis is alarming ... I will be further discussing this human rights situation, among other countries, on March 20,"" she adds.

Maduro says he will defeat 'minority of opportunists and cowards'

Nicolas Maduro said he would defeat a ""crazed minority"" determined to destabilise the country in his first public comment since Guaido returned to the country.

Maduro called on supporters to attend ""anti-imperialist"" demonstrations on March 9, coinciding with an opposition march announced by Guaido.

He expressed defiance towards opposition forces, belittling a ""minority of opportunists and cowards"" and vowing to ""stop them in their tracks"".

""The crazed minority continues in their bitterness. We are going to defeat them, be absolutely sure,"" said Maduro.

""We are on the right side of history,"" he added, using the same words previously used by Guaido referring to the opposition.

The president says Venezuela is a victim of a US-led economic war and accuses Guaido of leading a coup orchestrated by the American government. He has vowed the opposition leader will ""face justice"".

""It is extremely difficult to see how he could play a positive role in a democratic election,"" he said, adding that it was ultimately up to Venezuelans to decide Maduro's future role.

Abrams also said that imposing US secondary sanctions against non-US citizens or entities tied to the Maduro government was ""clearly a possibility"", although he said a decision had not been made on taking such a step.

The Trump administration is in the process of discussing proposals to grant Venezuelans Temporary Protected Status (TPS), US Special Envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams told reporters on Friday.

While no decision has been made, Abrams said the US will continue to take ""appropriate actions"" against the government of President Nicolas Maduro, including restricting travel visas for dozens of Maduro's associates.

He added that the US did not expect Russia or China to provide significant additional funds to Maduro's government, but acknowledged that their political support was a ""help"" to Maduro.

Abrams also voiced concerns over whether opposition leader Juan Guaido, who is currently in Paraguay, will be able to return safely to Venezuela.

US 'to impose more sanctions' on Venezuela this week and next week

US Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams said on Tuesday that Washington would impose more sanctions on Caracas this week and next week to bring about additional pressure on the government of President Nicolas Maduro, whose legitimacy Washington has challenged.

Speaking ahead of a Security Council meeting on Venezuela sought by the United States, Abrams said he hoped the UN Security Council will vote this week on a resolution calling for Venezuela to allow the entry of humanitarian assistance into the country.

Abrams denied Russian accusations that the US is preparing for military intervention in Venezuela, but repeated that all options are on the table.

US asks UNSC to meet on Venezuela: diplomats

The United States has asked the United Nations Security Council to meet to discuss the situation in Venezuela on Tuesday, said diplomats after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's troops repelled foreign aid convoys at the weekend.

The United States has been pushing the 15-member council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections in Venezuela with international observers, a move that prompted Russia to propose a rival draft resolution. It was unclear if or when either draft text could be put to a vote.

Moscow and Washington have been at loggerheads over a US-led campaign for international recognition of Venezuelan opposition leader and head of the country's elected National Assembly Juan Guaido over Maduro. Guaido last month declared himself interim head of state.

According to a new report from The Globe and Mail, Alphabet’s Google will ban all political ads in Canada ahead of its federal elections this year after the country introduced stringent transparency rules.

“We’ve come to the decision that the best way for Google to comply with the Elections Act in the 2019 election cycle is actually to stop accepting elections ads as defined in the legislation,” said Colin McKay, Google Canada’s head of public policy and government relations. “It is painful for us.”

In December, the federal government passed a bill requiring online platforms, like Facebook and Google, to keep a record of all political and partisan ads published during this year’s election season. For its part, Google asked for amendments on the bill, warning the federal government that the bill would be too difficult to comply with.

Google then decided that significant alterations to its system will simply require too much work. Colin McKay, the head of public policy and government relations at Google Canada, said that the best way to make sure that the company doesn’t break the bill’s rules is to stop accepting political ads altogether.

“For the duration of the 2019 federal election campaign, Google will not accept advertising regulated by Bill C-76,” McKay said in a statement. “We’re focusing our efforts on supporting Canadian news literacy programs and connecting people to useful and relevant election-related information.”







Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould said the decision was disappointing. “Google’s decision to opt out of political advertising during the regulated period appears to have been made for business reasons and does not reflect on the quality of our laws, which are designed to protect Canadian voters and our elections,” she said.

“We know that Google is enormously capable both technically and financially,” she continued. “It should apply these resources to producing a registry in Canada that complies with Canada’s laws.”

Canada’s advertising transparency requirements will take effect on June 30th or earlier, reads the report, so Google will likely modify its system to block political and partisan ads very soon, if it hasn’t already done so.",Google Canada Will Ban All Political and Partisan Ads During This Year’s Election Season,Iphoneincanada.ca,https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/google-canada-elections/
32,Empty,2019-03-05T01:36:42Z,The Observer newspaper published a story quoting internal Facebook documents that detailed the U.S. company’s efforts to influence hundreds of politicians in a “secretive global lobbying operation.”,"OTTAWA—Members of Parliament are voicing concerns about Facebook’s corporate behaviour after a British newspaper reported the social media giant tried to influence governments around the world — including Canada’s — by dangling the possibility of major investments. The Observer newspaper published a story Saturday quoting internal Facebook documents that detailed the American company’s efforts to influence hundreds of politicians in a “secretive global lobbying operation” to ensure data privacy laws are favourable to the company. The reported documents referenced an internal Facebook memo that described how the company’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, pushed the Canadian government on an unspecified “jurisdiction issue” as Facebook was deciding where to build a new centre to house data servers.

The interaction occurred around April 2013, when the previous Conservative government was in power, Facebook confirmed Monday. In response to the report, NDP MP Charlie Angus called on Canada’s lobbying commissioner to investigate the company’s conduct in this case, as well as long-standing concerns about Facebook’s “larger pattern” of avoiding transparency in its efforts to influence Ottawa. Angus has previously accused Facebook of failing to register meetings with Liberal government officials as official lobbying interactions. “What you’re seeing is Facebook’s operating culture of complete disregard for domestic laws of the countries in which they operate,” Angus told the Star by phone Monday.

“I am not surprised by this at all. This is a company that around the world has exerted enormous backroom pressure on governments to get their way,” he said. Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, the Liberal MP for Beaches—East York, said the House of Commons privacy committee needs to “get to the bottom of this,” especially given the Observer reported that the Facebook memo said Ottawa acted to dispel Facebook’s concerns about housing its data centre in Canada. The Star was not able to verify the documents reported by the British newspaper. However, Facebook confirmed the data centre in Canada was being considered around the same time the company decided to build one in Iowa in 2013. The Des Moines Register reported in 2017 that the data centre brought thousands of construction jobs to the area and created 200 full-time positions. Christian Paradis, who was the Conservative industry minister when Facebook considered a data centre in Canada, said by email Tuesday that he “neither promised nor delivered any guarantee whatsoever” to Facebook. “It’s outrageous on the one hand, but it’s unsurprising on the other,” said Erskine-Smith of Facebook’s alleged pressure on the Canadian government.

“If the allegations are true, then this is an unacceptable level of deference to the Facebook corporation.” Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains’s office said in a statement that the Liberal government can’t speak for their Conservative predecessors, but that “we can say unequivocally” that privacy laws in Canada apply equally to all companies collecting personal data for commercial purposes.

Facebook Canada spokesperson Erin Taylor said in a statement Monday that the company always tries to understand a country’s laws and privacy protections before opening a data centre. “This is not a threat to withhold investment, but part of our duty to protect people’s data,” Taylor said, adding that the documents reported by the Observer were “cherry-picked and released in violation of a court order” and “omit important context.” “These documents have been sealed by a Californian court so we’re not able to discuss them in detail,” Taylor said. The questions about Facebook’s conduct come as pressure has mounted on the Liberal government over the past year to address the influence of internet companies. Concerns about privacy protections were raised in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, when it was revealed that the British firm used Facebook to mine personal data from users to predict their political leanings. Others have raised red flags about the integrity of elections and fairness in Canada’s cultural sector, where companies like Netflix sell subscriptions but aren’t subject to sales tax applied to similar services from Canadian providers. Internet giants have also investing hundreds of millions in Canada — including $500 million from Netflix for Canadian productions, the creation of 3,000 jobs by Amazon in British Columbia, and Google’s $50-million Sidewalk City proposal in Toronto. Angus, the NDP MP, said such investments show these online giants have massive economic clout on top of their influence as avenues of communication in the 21st century. “I think what we’re seeing around the world is a growing frustration of legislators,” towards Facebook, Angus said, calling for stronger regulations of the company and other social media giants. “They need to be really held to a much higher standard.” With files from Alex Boutilier Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

33,Empty,2019-03-06T06:00:00Z,The Czech Republic’s complicated relationship with the Chinese giant Huawei offers a lesson in the benefits and pitfalls of courting Beijing.,"That tension is now set to play out in a very public fashion: The Czech Republic’s prime minister, Andrej Babiš, is to meet with President Donald Trump in the White House this week, just weeks before Zeman heads to Beijing for talks with the Chinese leadership.

“The Czech Republic and many other countries are now sitting in two chairs that are pulling apart,” said Martin Hala, the director of Project Sinopsis, a Prague-based think tank specializing in Chinese relations. “This schizophrenic position—when one part of the political establishment is looking east and the other west … will eventually need a resolution. Something will have to give.”

Fifth-generation wireless technology, which is in the early stages of being rolled out around the globe, promises to transform entire industries and economies, and would form the backbone of countries’ communications infrastructures. Few companies have both the technical know-how and the global reach to build such systems, though, and Huawei is one of them. The company insists it is a private enterprise, with no official links to China’s government, but officials in an array of countries—including the United States, but also India, New Zealand, and elsewhere—are skeptical. In Canada, Huawei’s chief financial officer, who is also the daughter of its founder, faces extradition to the United States on fraud charges.

In Europe, the divisions over Huawei are stark. British authorities have said they can manage any risks presented by Huawei, but Germany is eyeing tougher controls on the company. Indeed, even within the Central European countries known as the Visegrád Four—the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia—views differ. Hungary and Slovakia have said they do not see Huawei as a threat, but Prague and Warsaw have been more cautious, with Poland arresting a company employee in January on allegations of spying. (Underlining the stakes, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to the region last month, to warn that China was targeting Central Europe in an effort to divide the West.)

Here in the Czech Republic, intelligence officials warned last year that the company and ZTE, another Chinese technology firm, posed risks to national security and were tools of Chinese espionage. Zeman—whose position has limited scope beyond some foreign-policy duties and the appointment of certain officials—dismissed that assessment, arguing that the national cybersecurity agency, NUKIB, has resorted to “ dirty tricks ” to undermine Chinese business ties that he had worked to cultivate. But Babiš, a populist billionaire, ordered his office to discard any Huawei equipment being used and has tried to court American investment instead.

“We put a lot of pieces together, and if we see a threat, we are obligated by law to report it,” Radek Holy, a NUKIB spokesman, told me. “When the risk is so high, we have to report it.”",The U.S.-China Tech War Is Being Fought in Central Europe,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/03/czech-zeman-babis-huawei-xi-trump/584158/

Stand for America, a social welfare group that cannot endorse candidates or make political donations, vows to help every American accomplish the “American dream” and claims Americans’ success is “being threatened by socialist schemes of higher taxes, burdensome job-destroying regulations, government-run health care, and unsecure borders.” The group also says numerous rogue regimes internationally are jeopardizing U.S. national security.

""As U.S. Ambassador to the UN, I was able to see firsthand the challenges we face around the globe. Iranian-backed radical Islamic terrorism threatens the lives of innocent Americans,” Haley said in a statement Monday. “Communist China is spreading its influence throughout the world and engaging in unfair and illegal trade practices. North Korea still has nuclear weapons that can hit us. Russia meddles in our elections and invades its neighbors with no regard for their sovereignty. In our own backyard, socialist dictators in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua oppress their own people and support narco-trafficking that invades America.”

Haley, a former governor of South Carolina and daughter of immigrants, said her life story is evidence the American dream is still alive, due to “hard work, determination, and the incredible support of the people of South Carolina.”

""My story is proof positive that the American dream is alive and well,” Haley said in a statement Monday. “America’s greatness comes from our freedom and our values and they must be protected for future generations.”

On 5 January, lawmaker Juan Guaido was elected as the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which all other Venezuelan government branches have refused to recognize. On 23 January, two days after the Venezuelan Supreme Court annulled his election, Guaido declared himself the country's ""interim president"". Incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, who was sworn in for his second presidential term on 10 January after winning reelection in a contest partially boycotted by the opposition in May, qualified Guaido's move as an attempt to stage a coup orchestrated by Washington.

The United States immediately recognized Guaido, after which some 50 other countries followed suit. Russia, China, Cuba, Bolivia and a number of other states have, in the meantime, voiced their support for the legitimate government of constitutionally elected Maduro. Mexico and Uruguay have refused to recognize Guaido, declaring themselves neutral and promoting crisis settlement via dialogue.

US Vice President Mike Pence said in Colombia on Monday that the Trump administration was mulling new sanctions against Venezuela's government. Pence also urged Monday all Lima Group members to freeze the assets of Venezuela's oil giant PDVSA and restrict visas for Venezuelan officials. The US vice president also called on these countries to immediately transfer the ownership of Venezuelan assets from the government of incumbent President Nicolas Maduro to self-proclaimed Interim President Juan Guaido.

Earlier on Monday, the US Treasury Department sanctioned four Venezuelan governors.

The United States has imposed numerous rounds of sanctions on Venezuela. In January, Washington blocked around $7 billion in assets belonging to Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA. Maduro said that the restrictions were tantamount to illegal seizing.

The Lima Group of 14 countries was created in 2017 and currently seeks to end the political crisis in Venezuela. The group includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Guyana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Saint Lucia.

Though political ads will still be able to run on other Google services, namely YouTube, McKay called it a ""painful"" decision for the company.

""We’ve come to the decision that the best way for Google to comply with the Elections Act in the 2019 election cycle is actually to stop accepting elections ads as defined in the legislation,"" McKay said. The Globe and Mail first reported this news.

It's easier for Google to ban political ads because of the automated nature of its AdEx platform, which makes it difficult for publishers to know what ads are being displayed, especially with multiple campaigns running at once.

BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — The latest on Venezuela’s political crisis (all times local):

10:35 p.m.

The U.N. Security Council has scheduled an open meeting Tuesday on the latest events in Venezuela at the request of the United States.

U.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo is expected to brief the afternoon meeting.

The Security Council is divided over Venezuela. The U.S. and many Western and Latin American nations back opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president, while Russia, China and other countries support President Nicolas Maduro and oppose any interference in Venezuela’s internal affairs.

The U.S. call for the meeting follows a widely publicized effort by Guaido to deliver humanitarian aid to the economically devastated nation that met strong resistance from security forces loyal to Maduro.

The Trump administration announced new sanctions on Maduro’s allies Monday.

4:45 p.m.

Colombia’s foreign minister says Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido and his family face “serious and credible” threats on their lives that if carried out would lead to a forceful international response against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

Carlos Holmes Trujillo’s accusation came at the conclusion of a Monday meeting of regional diplomats and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence to discuss Venezuela’s crisis. He provided no details about the alleged plot against Guaido and his family, saying only that Maduro will be held responsible if any of them are harmed.

The Lima Group of nations and Guaido issued an 18-point declaration Monday in which they reiterate their call on the Venezuelan military to recognize Guaido as their commander in chief. They also ask the International Criminal Court to consider Maduro’s blocking of emergency food and medical supplies a crime against humanity and urge the United Nations to play a bigger role in resolving the crisis.

2:15 p.m.

Brazil’s vice president says his nation will maintain its strategy of avoiding military intervention when it comes to neighboring Venezuela.

Monday’s tweet by Vice President Hamilton Mourao came as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence met with regional leaders about Venezuela and said that “all options are on the table.”

Mourao said Brazilian officials “believe in diplomatic and international economic pressure.”

Pence, Mourao and several other top leaders were in the Colombian capital of Bogota for a meeting of the so-called “Lima Group.”

The group is a 14-nation coalition of mostly conservative Latin American nations and Canada that has joined together to pressure President Nicolas Maduro to leave power.

The meeting comes two days after a U.S.-backed effort to deliver humanitarian across the border from Colombia and Brazil ended in violence.

12:30 p.m.

Vice President Mike Pence says the United States is sending another $56 million to neighbors of Venezuela to help them cope with migrants fleeing that nation’s deepening crisis.

Pence said Monday that the United States has already provided more than $139 million in aid to help Venezuela.

He spoke in Colombia’s capital at a meeting of The Lima Group, a coalition of mostly Latin American nations formed to address Venezuela’s turmoil.

Pence also met with opposition congressional leader Juan Guaido, who has declared presidential powers, arguing that the re-election of socialist President Nicolas Maduro was invalid.

Pence said the U.S. has sent five military transport planes with 400 tons of food and medicine to Colombia and Brazil.

Deadly clashes erupted over the weekend when Maduro refused to allow the aid cross, calling it part of a U.S.-led coup.

___

12:05 p.m.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is asking a coalition of mostly Latin American nations to freeze assets of Venezuela’s state oil company following a weekend of violent clashes over blocked humanitarian aid.

Pence met in Colombia’s capital on Monday with regional leaders in the Lima Group after President Nicolas Maduro’s security forces blocked U.S. aid from crossing Venezuela’s borders.

At least four protesters died while more than 300 were injured in nationwide clashes.

Pence called on regional leaders to freeze PDVSA assets — a measure taken earlier by the U.S.

He repeated President Trump’s threat that “all options are on the table” to push out Maduro, whose re-election the United States and dozens of other countries consider invalid.

Pence says the U.S. is also slapping financial sanctions on officials loyal to Maduro who blocked emergency aid and another in his inner circle.

11:50 a.m.

The United States is imposing new sanctions against allies of President Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela.

The Treasury Department on Monday announced the measures against four governors: Omar Prieto of Zulia, Ramon Carrizales of Apure, Jorge Garcia Carneiro of Vargas and Rafael Lacava of Carabobo state.

The move blocks them from financial or commercial transactions with U.S. citizens or entities.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said they had blocked humanitarian aid shipments backed by the United States and opposition leader Juan Guaido, who is recognized by some 50 nations as Venezuela’s legitimate leader.

___

11:45 a.m.

Germany is calling for greater pressure against the Venezuelan government of President Nicolas Maduro to bring about fresh elections.

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Adebahr said Monday that Germany believes “the pressure on Maduro needs to be increased so as to move in the direction of free, fair and democratic presidential elections.”

Adebahr said Germany is consulting with fellow European countries, but would seek to have additional EU sanctions target those close to Maduro “and of course not worsen the dramatic hardship experienced by the citizens of Venezuela.”

Government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer condemned violence at points on the Venezuelan border where opposition figures have been trying to bring in aid shipments.

Demmer said Germany was particularly concerned by “the apparent deployment of militias and groups of thugs to intimidate the population.

10:30 am.

The United States is planning new ways to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to give up power and to provide assistance to the people of the economically devastated South American nation.

Vice President Mike Pence arrived in the Colombian capital on Monday and immediately met with Colombian President Ivan Duque. He’ll also meet with members of a regional coalition and Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido to discuss the next steps aimed at ousting Maduro.

Pence’s appearance before the Lima Group comes two days after a U.S.-backed effort to deliver humanitarian across the border from Colombia ended in violence.

The gross domestic product (GDP) figure was lower than the 1.0 percent expected by analysts, following 2.0 percent growth in the previous quarter.



This slowing pace closed out the year with a total annualized economic growth rate of 1.8 percent, slightly more than half the previous year’s 3.0 percent and the United States’s 2.9 percent growth in 2018. “The ‘R’ word (for recession) will be on minds as Canada’s economy barely skirted the start of a recession in Q4,” CIBC Capital Markets chief economist Avery Shenfeld said in a research note.



He pointed to a “weak handoff” from December to the new year, that he said will likely prompt the Bank of Canada to back off plans to raise interest rates in the short term. “If not for a huge employment gain in January (+67,000 jobs) we’d be worried about an outright recession, but at this point, its best described as a stalled engine,” Shenfeld concluded.



Either scenario is bad news for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals as they head into elections in October looking to hold onto their parliamentary majority. The Trudeau Liberals’ popularity slipped amid allegations by his former attorney general of political interference in the criminal prosecution of engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

GDP grew by just 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter, or 0.4 percent annualized, Statistics Canada said ' ADVERTISEMENT — Monica Henry (@chevymo) March 1, 2019

The Montreal-based company was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Moamer Kadhafi’s reign. For the first time, the ruling Liberal Party has found itself trailing the opposition Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer in the most recent public opinion polls.



Statistics Canada said the nation’s slowing economic growth mainly reflected a drop in investment spending and lower exports. Household spending slowed for a second consecutive quarter, with spending on life insurance and financial services up and on motor vehicles down.



Purchases of cannabis — after recreational use was legalized in October — totalled Can$5.9 billion (US$4.5 billion) or 0.5 percent of household spending. Business investment on non-residential structures, and machinery and equipment fell sharply, but that plunge was moderated by an uptick in investment in intellectual property products. The latter was “mainly attributable to mineral exploration and evaluation, which can be influenced by anticipated prices and potential new reserves,” said Statistics Canada.



Exports volumes edged down, led by lower exports of forestry products, building and packaging materials, metal and non-metallic minerals, and energy products. Imports also fell on lower shipments of industrial chemicals, plastic and rubber products, motor vehicles and parts, and metal and non-metallic mineral products. Imports of energy products were flat while aircraft, engines and parts rebounded a whopping 17.1 percent.

The Conservatives have owned this vast riding along Lake Simcoe — which includes Georgina, East Gwillimbury, King, Bradford West Gwillimbury and the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation — dating back five elections. It’s a political juggernaut that, for the past 14 years, has featured Conservative MP Peter Van Loan, a Tory stalwart who triggered Monday’s byelection with his retirement announcement last September. The Tory bid to fill Van Loan’s shoes against a slate of eight contenders from all major federal parties rested with Davidson, a Georgina businessman and political newcomer.

The married father has lived in the riding his entire life, serving on the Georgina Medical Health Board, the Georgina Waterways Advisory Committee, and the Lake Simcoe Fisheries Stakeholder Committee, according to his bio. His wife, Suzanne, is a member of Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation, which makes him “keenly aware of their major issues and challenges,” it reads. The strongest threat to Tory dominance was expected from second-time Liberal candidate Shaun Tanaka, an articulate University of Toronto and Queen’s University geography professor and mother of twin sons who declares in a video on her website: “I know in my heart that this is a Liberal riding.”

Tanaka trailed in second on Monday night, followed by NDP candidate Jessa McLean, but by a wide gap. The byelection in York-Simcoe is historic in this way: It marks the first-ever candidate running for Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada. The newly minted party — it launched in September — announced last month that Toronto lawyer Robert Geurts would carry it into its first political contest. “Take a stand, make a difference!” Geurts posted on his Twitter feed Monday. “It’s time to stop the lies and the corruption.” Bernier joined Geurts for a rally in Bradford two weeks ago. The riding’s NDP candidate is community organizer Jessa McLean. In her nomination acceptance speech, McLean pitched an alternative vision to past elected representatives who don’t “reflect who we are, and who appear to be completely out of touch with most peoples’ lived reality,” the Georgina Advocate reported last month. “People are working harder, but are not getting ahead ... We deserve better.” York-Simcoe has a population of 104,000 with about 83,000 registered voters, according to Elections Canada. Robert Cribb is a Toronto-based investigative reporter.

43,Empty,2019-02-27T12:21:00Z,An under-the-hood look at the share price at which Cronos Group would offer intriguing value to investors.,"Marijuana stocks can seemingly do no wrong lately, and it's not hard to see why. Since October, we've seen Canada legalize recreational marijuana, had a handful of U.S. states approve medical or recreational weed during midterm elections in November, witnessed President Trump sign the Farm Bill into law, and heard of rumors that Mexico may choose to legalize recreational marijuana in 2019. Not shockingly, the first-ever marijuana exchange-traded fund in Canada, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF, is up more than 50% this year.

But even with rapid global sales growth of up to 38% expected in 2019, not all pot stock valuations make sense. While yours truly has been critical of mid- and large-cap marijuana stock valuations in recent months, no company has stood out as more overvalued recently than Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) -- this year's top-performing pot stock.

However, just because I view Cronos Group as a stock worth avoiding now, it doesn't mean I don't see value in the business or the stock. There is a share price at which I believe Cronos Group becomes attractive to investors. But before I divulge that price point, let me walk you through my thought process from both the buy and sell sides of things.

The Cronos Group buy thesis

Make no mistake about it, the clearest reason to be excited about Cronos Group is the $1.8 billion equity investment from tobacco giant Altria (NYSE:MO), announced in early December. Altria, which has faced years of declining cigarette demand in the U.S., is looking for ways to reignite growth, without having to continuously raise tobacco prices. By taking a 45% equity stake in Cronos Group, Altria is getting its foot in the door in the high-growth cannabis industry.

Furthermore, Altria's equity stake in Cronos Group, which has yet to close, comes with warrants that could be exercised at a later date. If Altria were to exercise all the warrants it'll be receiving, it could become a majority stakeholder (55%) in Cronos. Given its $3.6 billion market cap, Cronos could easily be gobbled up by Altria and its still-substantial free cash flow. Thus, premium is being paid to the likelihood that Altria will eventually buy the remainder of Cronos Group that it doesn't already own.

On the flip side, once the deal closes, Cronos Group will have north of $1.8 billion in cash on hand to execute on its long-term strategy. No longer having to worry about raising capital, Cronos will be focused on expanding internationally, diversifying its product portfolio to feature high-margin items, and growing its production capacity. This also means that dilution becomes less of a concern, with the company not having to turn to bought-deal offerings to raise capital.

Partnerships are another key selling point for Cronos Group. In September, it and Ginkgo Bioworks entered into a deal that'll cost Cronos up to $100 million. It will, however, give Cronos access to Ginkgo's microorganism development platform. This platform should allow for the creation of yeast strains capable of producing eight types of cannabinoids. These cannabinoids, some of which are rare, could be produced at commercial scale, presumably for a cheaper cost than traditional extraction methods.

Why avoiding Cronos Group makes sense

On the other hand, there are also a number of reasons why this $3.6 billion valuation (soon to be $5.4 billion once the Altria deal closes) makes little sense.

To begin with, Cronos' production isn't all that impressive, relative to its market cap. The top three projected growers -- Aurora Cannabis, Canopy Growth, and Aphria -- are on track for 700,000 kilos, 500,000 kilos, and 255,000 kilos, respectively, at peak production in my estimate. Aurora, Canopy Growth, and Aphria carry respective market caps of $7.2 billion, $15 billion, and $2.4 billion (albeit Aphria has had a crisis of confidence with management of late).

By comparison, Cronos Group should net 70,000 kilos from its joint venture, 40,000 kilos from Peace Naturals, about 7,000 combined kilos from its international grow farms, and some smaller amounts from other grow sites. That's squeezing every last drop of blood from the proverbial turnip for maybe 120,000 kilograms of peak annual production. Investors could purchase about a half dozen other pot stocks that should net between 100,000 kilos and 138,000 kilos at their peak for anywhere from a third to a tenth of Cronos' post-Altria investment market cap (i.e., $5.4 billion).

Cronos Group has also done a pretty poor job of moving into overseas markets like its peers. As we've witnessed from recreationally legal states in the U.S., dried cannabis flower has a tendency to be oversupplied and commoditized over time. By the early part of the next decade, it wouldn't be surprising if domestic Canadian supply far outpaced demand, leading domestic growers to seek foreign outlets to sell their excess supply. Aurora Cannabis is nearing a presence in two dozen countries, whereas Canopy Growth has a presence in more than a dozen foreign markets. As for Cronos, it's made little foreign impression beyond Israel and Australia, which could threaten its margins if dried flower oversupply does hit, as expected.

Lastly, with marijuana now legal to our north, fundamentals and earnings reports actually matter now. Even though Cronos Group is receiving a very welcome cash infusion from Altria, and the duo may work on joint products (pun intended) in the future, the company isn't expected to generate much in the way of profits anytime soon. The four analysts covering Cronos are calling for just CA$0.06 per share (that's six cents in Canadian dollars) for fiscal 2019, and it's unclear if that includes a number of one-time benefits that have been helping pot stocks like Cronos Group. Even assuming Cronos Group is profitable, which is far from a guarantee, its forward price-to-earnings ratio might be north of 400!

Here's the price at which Cronos Group offers real value to investors

Now that you've heard both sides of the argument, I can walk you through the share price at which I feel Cronos Group offers value, which for me is $9 per share. And yes, I'm aware that this is 55% lower than where Cronos is currently trading, which also backs up my thesis of the company as being the most overvalued pot stock.

Just how the heck did I pull $9 out of the hat? Well, on the positive side, I'm factoring in that about a third of the postinvestment market cap of this company will be in cash. Of course, Cronos Group will be actively using this capital to hopefully expand overseas and make complementary acquisitions. Thus, this $1.8 billion in cash might be more like $1 billion in 12 to 18 months.

I'm also counting on Cronos Group to focus on higher-margin products and medical cannabis patients. Its partnership with Ginkgo is a good example of the company aiming for high-margin sales.

Then again, Cronos Group will probably be lucky to turn a profit in 2019, and it's unlikely to even cross $100 million in annual sales until fiscal 2020. That's a lot of premium that investors are giving a company with a triple-digit forward price-to-earnings ratio.

Ultimately, a share price of $9, post-Altria deal closing, assumes a forward cash value of around $1 billion and assigns a value of an additional $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion to its 120,000-kilo production, its high-margin cannabinoid output with Ginkgo, and the intangible value that a name like Altria brings to the table. While still not traditionally cheap, a $9 share price would likely give Cronos a PEG ratio less than 2, which could offer modest upside and represent a potentially attractive entry point for investors.",At What Price Is Cronos Group Worth Buying?,Fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/02/27/at-what-price-is-cronos-group-worth-buying.aspx

“Of course, this temporary economic boost does not come free because stimulus measures are causing the budget deficit to widen & government debt to increase, things that will have to be addressed by Congress, probably after the 2020 elections.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Assailed by his ex-lawyer at every turn, President Donald Trump nevertheless claimed a measure of vindication from Michael Cohen's statement that he possessed no direct evidence of collusion with Russia from his time serving the boss. But contrary to Trump's words, Cohen did not exonerate him on the matter in his testimony to lawmakers.

Trump also put the best face on his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, claiming he had a ""really productive time"" in Hanoi, Vietnam, despite the collapse of talks and cancellation of a planned signing agreement. More substantively, he claimed the talks broke down because North Korea insisted on the lifting of all sanctions — an assertion contradicted by the State Department as well as by the North Koreans.

On other recent rhetorical fronts, the president credited his daughter with creating jobs that don't exist and Democrats persisted in their distorted accusation that the Trump administration confined migrant children in cages.

A review:

COHEN TESTIMONY

TRUMP: ""He said no collusion. And I was, you know, a little impressed by that, frankly. Could've — he could've gone all out. He only went about 95 percent instead of 100 percent."" — Hanoi news conference Thursday.

THE FACTS: He takes Cohen's comment too far. Cohen did not clear his former boss on the question of whether his campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election. In the course of implicating Trump in other alleged criminal activity, Cohen said he did not witness or know directly of collusion ""but I have my suspicions."" He didn't say ""no collusion.""

Cohen told lawmakers: ""So, as I stated in my testimony, I wouldn't use the word 'colluding.' Was there something odd about the back-and-forth praise with President Putin? Yes, but I'm not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion. I was not part of the campaign. I don't know the other conversations that Mr. Trump had with other individuals. There is just so many dots that all seem to lead to the same direction.""

And: ""The questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. I do not, and I want to be clear. But I have my suspicions.""

___

REP. JIM JORDAN, top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee: ""Remember how all this started. The Clinton campaign hired Perkins Coie law firm who hired Glenn Simpson who hired a foreigner, Christopher Steele, who put together the fake dossier that the FBI used to go get a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign."" — remarks Wednesday at hearing with Cohen.

THE FACTS: He's repeating a false claim by Trump that special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe is based on a ""fake dossier."" The FBI's investigation actually began months before it received a dossier of anti-Trump research financed by the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign. The FBI probe's origins were based on other evidence — not the existence of the dossier, which has not been discredited.

Last year, the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee found the Russia probe was initiated after the FBI received information related to Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, not the dossier. The committee's final report was praised by Trump.

___

NORTH KOREA

TRUMP, on his summit: ""We had a really, I think, a very productive time."" — Post-summit Hanoi news conference

THE FACTS: The talks fell apart, lunch was canceled, a signing ceremony scrapped and Trump said another meeting with Kim ""may not be for a long time"" before he left to come home two hours early. Moreover, they came away disagreeing about what they had disagreed about.

___

TRUMP: ""Basically, they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety, and we couldn't do that."" — Hanoi news conference.

THE FACTS: A senior State Department official said North Korea demanded Trump's support for the lifting of U.N. Security Council sanctions imposed since March 2016 — not other sanctions. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss the private negotiations.

Although North Korea wants all sanctions erased, the official said, Kim was pressing for relief from ones that impede the civilian economy and was not demanding an end to sanctions on armaments. Altogether, Kim was seeking substantial relief, insisting bans be lifted on trade in goods and commodities such as metals, raw materials, luxury items, seafood, coal exports, refined petroleum imports and raw petroleum imports. But he did not insist that sanctions be ""lifted in their entirety,"" as Trump asserted.",AP FACT CHECK: Trump twists Cohen's words on collusion,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ap-fact-check-trump-twists-cohens-words-collusion-130808633.html

The House of Commons scheduled an emergency debate Thursday on the deepening controversy, the most serious faced by Trudeau since assuming office in 2015.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer accused the Liberal prime minister's inner circle of possibly attempting to obstruct justice, in a letter to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Brenda Lucki -- which the RCMP confirmed to AFP it has received.

""The matter at hand appears, on its face, to be a gross violation of the law,"" Scheer wrote.

He pointed to ""explosive testimony"" by former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, who told the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday that Trudeau's staff and other senior officials applied undue pressure on her to settle a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin.

The Montreal-based company was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Moamer Kadhafi's reign.

Wilson-Raybould, after resigning from cabinet, testified that she experienced a ""consistent and sustained effort"" to politically interfere in the prosecution of one of the world's top engineering firms.

She added that she faced ""veiled threats,"" and described the intense pressure on her to comply as ""inappropriate,"" but stopped short of suggesting it was illegal.

In the end, Wilson-Raybould refused to ask prosecutors to settle, and the trial is set to proceed.

Trudeau has rejected her characterizations of events, saying Wednesday that he had made clear to his former attorney general that the ""decision around SNC-Lavalin was Jody Wilson-Raybould's and hers alone to make.""

Thursday morning, dodging calls to resign, he said: ""My team and I have always acted in a professional manner.""

""Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy, and that's exactly what we've done every step of the way ... in a way that has respected our laws and respects the independence of the judiciary,"" he added.

For weeks, Trudeau's Liberal government has been rocked by the allegations first reported by The Globe and Mail newspaper, only eight months before elections.

COSTA MESA, Calif. – A false claim bubbled up from the internet last month that Sen. Kamala Harris, the recently announced presidential candidate, wasn’t eligible for election because she had immigrant parents and spent part of her childhood in Canada. The claim, an echo of the “birther” conspiracy that trailed President Barack Obama, was widely debunked but still addressed seriously by mainstream news pundits, including CNN’s Chris Cuomo.

Even better for Jacob Wohl, the 21-year-old Californian who ignited the Harris birther claim with a tweet, some people actually seemed to accept it as fact.

“The believability stuck at about 15 to 18 percent by my measurement,” Wohl said in an interview shortly afterward, declaring it “not a bad campaign.”

Kamala Harris is NOT eligible to be President. Her father arrived from Jamaica in 1961—mother from India arrived in 1960



Neither parent was a legal resident for 5 years prior to Harris’s birth, a requirement for naturalization

Wohl, a self-professed “political and corporate intel consultant” and supporter of President Donald Trump, is dedicated to plying the malleable fringe of the electorate with dubious claims and disinformation schemes.

Amplifying him in that quest are his links to the world’s loudest Twitter cheerleader, Trump. Wohl’s father, attorney David Wohl, says that as a Trump surrogate he was on calls with the 2016 presidential candidate daily. David Wohl has regularly appeared on cable news networks to promote the president and his policies.

Trump has retweeted Jacob Wohl’s praise – of the president’s economy, or just general “WINNING”-ness that the “left-wing media can’t stand” – at least three times. They appear to have met at least once, as evidenced by a photo of father, son and president together, and the younger Wohl says he has spoken to the president “several” times. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on their relationship.

On Twitter, where he has 186,000 followers and is adept at quickly responding to Trump’s tweets to gain many more eyeballs, Wohl has claimed, without evidence, that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg is secretly dead or in a vegetative state and that pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats and media outlets were a left-wing “false flag” operation.

He flew to Minnesota last week to “investigate” the rumor that Somali-American Rep. Ilhan Omar married her brother, a mission for which he tried to fund-raise $25,000 from his online followers. Wohl’s trip to the heartland devolved into bizarre tweets in which he suggested that Minneapolis was so overrun by Somali jihadists that he had to wear a bulletproof vest and travel with a team of “security professionals.”

In the coming days, I will be traveling to Ilhan Omar's district with @Ali and Laura Loomer to gather evidence of the SHAM MARRIAGE to her brother

🚨FUND THE FIGHT at https://t.co/QkUCkLaox5🚨https://t.co/lhGOJJPsqh — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) February 17, 2019

Wohl’s most prominent gambit was also his most disastrous: an apparent sloppy attempt to accuse Trump's nemesis special counsel Robert Mueller of sexual misconduct days before the midterm elections in November. His actions were referred to the FBI for potential criminal investigation. The woman he named as a credible accuser of the special prosecutor, Carolyne Cass, recently told USA TODAY that Wohl “made it up,” deceived her with a false identity and tried to coerce her to appear at a news conference against her will.

Wohl initially maintained that Cass's allegations were credible. When told that Cass said they were inaccurate, Wohl then claimed that he couldn’t speak about the situation because of a legal non-disclosure agreement with Cass, who denied that such an agreement exists. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment on whether the agency was investigating the episode.

Deciphering the Mueller saga is characteristic of how difficult it is to grasp at the truth with Wohl, who represents a political moment in which even the most basic facts are in dispute.

In some ways, Wohl is simply carrying on the dubious American tradition of deceit in politics, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author of “Cyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President.” Jamieson described 19th-century political operatives who would secretly buy newspapers to dictate coverage, and the dissemination of false accounts about President Andrew Johnson being a murderer.

The difference now, she said, is that the internet has democratized that deceit. It’s more difficult online to determine the source of a claim, a major factor in deciding whether to believe it. Being repeatedly bombarded with a claim – social media’s specialty –increases its perceived accuracy, even if it’s false and has been publicly debunked. People are more likely to believe a false claim that fits their ideology, and the internet naturally facilitates people like Wohl finding and communicating with like-minded groups.

“It takes a real talent to figure out what kind of deceptions will gain traction,” Jamieson said, and to have both the knowledge of their demographic and technical ability to “figure out what will resonate as opposed to what will be laughed at.”

Wohl disclosed a raft of schemes he says are in the works that he hopes will resonate in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election.

He says he plans to create “enormous left-wing online properties” – such as deceptive Facebook and Twitter accounts – ""and use those to steer the left-wing votes in the primaries to what we feel are weaker candidates compared with Trump.” It’s a plot similar to what Mueller has charged in indictments that the Russians crafted in an effort to boost the 2016 campaigns of Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein and hobble Hillary Clinton.

Another stated scheme: seeking to collect damaging information on left-leaning non-profits including Media Matters for America, the Southern Poverty Law Center and Right Wing Watch by offering their insiders “moral reconciliation,” and if that doesn’t work, “things of worth” – such as money.

Or perhaps those stated plans themselves are a ruse to fool the mainstream media, which he calls a “band of lying goblins.”

Wohl stressed that the accuracy of the information he spreads is “not the important part.” All that matters is how far those claims travel, and how many people believe them.

Wohl said he yearns for the days – before he was born – when conservatives would join in outrage over a scene in a sitcom and funnel that unity into other pursuits, like support for unchecked military actions. “You think about these incredibly large-scale wars that were just launched without congressional approval, and they were pretty damn good at carrying out the conservative torch, whatever it happened to be at the time,” Wohl said.

In the spread of information, he said, truth is an obsolete concept. “It’s something that can’t be thought about in a linear, binary true-false, facts-non-facts – you can’t do that anymore,” Wohl said. “It’s just not the way it works.”

Packing heat at the hipster coffee shop

Wohl chose to meet at Coffee Nature, probably the closest thing to a hipster coffee shop in his resident Orange County, in a nod to the tweets that gained him fame and derision before he was best known for allegedly trying to catfish the special counsel.

Since last year, Wohl has more than a dozen times claimed on Twitter to have overheard liberals in hipster coffee shops sharing pro-Trump secrets with one another, such as that they were actually overjoyed by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation. The tweets conjure up the image of Wohl furtively eavesdropping on surrounding patrons from behind the foam of an oat milk cappuccino.

He arrived at the Orange County cafe in a black Corvette with new-car paper license plates and extended a rigid hand but did not shake when a reporter grasped it. Sipping a free cup of ice water, the thin, severe-featured Wohl, who speaks in clipped verbiage, quickly worked into conversation that he was carrying a concealed firearm in response to the “voluminous left-wing threats” he has received.

Wohl explained that he picks on bohemian coffee shops because he sees them as the “Temple Mount” of liberalism and calculated that “if you in any way impugn the sanctity of the hipster coffee shop, it’s going to be something that gets them really charged up.” In describing his methods, Wohl casually explained that he makes it up: “I’ll literally hear one thing and I’ll flip it 180 degrees.”

I was sitting in a hipster coffee shop in Downtown LA this morning and couldn't help but overhear the 6 college age women seated at a table who were clamering with excitement and joy over the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) October 5, 2018

Wohl said he was eager to correct the record on the Mueller episode, in which his apparent efforts to disgrace Trump’s foremost adversary ended up unraveling into one of the weirdest major news stories in a cycle full of them.

It started with emails received by several news outlets in which the sender claimed an intelligence company had tried to pay her to accuse Mueller of sexual misdeeds. A professor produced emails showing that she had also been approached for information by the company. Reporters followed a bizarre online trail to reveal that Wohl was behind the intelligence company, which seemed to be staffed by an office full of imagined employees. Wohl and his partner in the episode, Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist Jack Burkman, then announced a news conference devolving into farce when a woman who they said was going to make allegations against Mueller didn’t show up.

The result of the Elmore Leonard-esque plot was a media cycle of ridicule for Wohl. One outlet’s headline read: “Fabricated Mueller Smear Appears to Have Come From Comically Inept Far-Right Internet Person.” The special prosecutor’s office broke its customary silence to announce that it had referred the scheme to the FBI for criminal investigation.

Wohl claimed at the coffee shop, however, that a goal of his scheme had been to trick journalists into thinking that he had offered to pay for dirt on Mueller, so he made up a person and sent those allegations to media outlets. On his phone, he scrolled through emails from reporters at major outlets like The Washington Post, The New York Times and Buzzfeed who had tried to garner more information from a person who he says did not actually exist.

He described these emails-- of reporters doing their due diligence-- as trophies from a logic-stretching plan that had as the ultimate goal getting reporters to go to a news conference at a D.C.-area Holiday Inn. “The real allegations against Mueller would have been ignored … had we not roped the media into attending the press conference,” Wohl said.

Someone inside Mueller’s office likely sent out the hoax email claiming to be a woman offered payment to make an accusation against Mueller!



They know that Mueller’s real victims are coming forward!



Tick tock... — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) October 31, 2018

But those “real allegations” appear to be even more problematic. At the news conference, Wohl distributed a document that was digitally signed, purportedly by the absent accuser Carolyne Cass, in which she said she had been sexually assaulted by Mueller in New York in 2010. In the interview this month, Wohl referred to Cass as a “real accuser” and called her allegations credible.

But when reached by USA TODAY, 34-year-old Carolyne Cass of Los Angeles said Wohl, whom she met on Craigslist, had tricked her by pretending to be an investigator named Matthew Cohen who was trained by Israeli intelligence forces and agreed to help her with “unscrupulous characters ripping me off.”

Cass said she paid the man she knew as Cohen $2,000, for which he did no work but instead offered her the prospect of employment at his intelligence agency and had her speak on the phone to people whose identities she now believes Wohl fabricated.

Cass said it ultimately became clear that Cohen and his associates, imaginary or otherwise, “needed a credible female to put on the line” for false allegations about Mueller. “They made it up,” Cass said of the document accusing Mueller, which was passed around at the news conference. “They wrote it and docu-signed it.”

She claimed Cohen tried to get her to speak at the news conference but she “escaped” and learned only as the scheme exploded that Cohen was in fact Wohl. “He completely lied to me,” Cass said.

Wohl had as recently as this month referred to Cass while speaking in detail about the Mueller episode. But when asked about Cass’s version of events, Wohl said he could not speak further because he had signed a non-disclosure agreement with her and “can’t violate any confidences.” Cass said no such agreement existed.

Burkman also refused to discuss his role in the Mueller scheme.

Both Wohl and Cass say they have not been contacted by the FBI. Stanford Law School professor Robert Weisberg said Wohl’s actions could be construed by a federal prosecutor as wire fraud, obstruction of justice or conspiracy – or as possibly violating various state statutes – but likely fell into a legal “gray zone.”

“The whole thing smacks of illegality and nefariousness and deception, but it still needs to have an anchor in criminal statute,” Weisberg said.

Tax liens and exotic birds

Wohl said he didn’t decide to fully apply his “talents” to politics until the rise of Trump, who he describes as a political soulmate in both ideology and tactics. But he said his political awakening came in 2008, when he was in fifth grade and watched Obama’s inauguration with great trepidation for what it meant for the national debt.

Despite his stated concern for fiscal responsibility, public records suggest that both Jacob and his television pundit father have had their own turbulent financial histories.

A search of television appearances shows that David Wohl – who was admitted to the California bar in 1989 and works largely in criminal defense – has been an analyst on Fox News and other cable stations for more than a decade, and his appearances have shifted from that of a legal expert to a fervent defender of the then-candidate and president.

Like his son, David Wohl has promoted conspiracy theories including that the pipe bombs sent to Democrats and media outlets, for which a Trump supporter in Florida was arrested, were a hoax.

In a brief interview, David Wohl said he had daily conference calls with Trump to hone messaging during the campaign. A spokesman for Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment on the elder Wohl’s role.

A search of public records shows that at least a dozen times since 1995, David Wohl has been the subject of state and federal tax liens in California’s Orange and Riverside Counties. Most recently, the IRS named him and his wife in a property lien for $22,002.31 for back income taxes. Though several of the past liens were marked as released, or paid off, the most recent lien was not shown to have been released.

In divorce filings last year, David Wohl’s wife, Michelle, said that he spends money on guitars, watches, firearms, tickets to concerts and sporting events and a recently purchased “exotic bird"" costing $8,000 to $10,000 while “I struggle to make ends meet and live from paycheck to paycheck.”

David Wohl said he had no knowledge of tax liens against him and called this article a ""hit piece. ... Trump calls you guys out for (stuff) like this.""

He said that he and his wife have since reconciled and that her claims in the divorce were ""extreme exaggerations"" and ""garbage.""

""I don't have my lawyer file documents that are garbage,"" Michelle Wohl said when reached for comment, adding that her filings were under penalty of perjury.

Jacob Wohl’s own history with money got off to a rocky start when, as a teenage hedge fund trader, he was investigated by multiple regulatory bodies in 2016.

The Arizona Corporation Commission and National Futures Association (NFA) investigated allegations including that Wohl and his partner had failed to pay back an investor, did not accurately present the risk of their investments and claimed that they had been in business for 35 years when neither of them had been alive that long.

Wohl father and son teamed up to fend off the regulators. David Wohl said he called the Los Angeles Police Department to report financial investigators for stalking them. Jacob Wohl declared in filings that his treatment by NFA investigators was evidence of the organization’s “broader culture of harassment, stalking and thuggery.”

The Arizona Corporation Commission ordered Wohl to no longer trade securities or provide investment advisory services in the state and to pay just under $33,000 in restitution. The NFA permanently barred Wohl. According to Wohl, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also investigated him and declined to pursue enforcement action. The commission declined to comment.

Wohl said he ultimately sold his half of his financial business to his partner. He maintained that there was “nothing even remotely illegal” about his financial enterprise, saying his father “wasn’t going to let me run a rogue hedge fund.”

As he has in his political schemes, Wohl displayed glee for high stakes, calling his financial career “a good experience” and remarking: “Who gets to go through a SEC investigation at age 18?”

A threat from Avenatti

While describing his recent professional work – a vague resume involving doing “corporate intelligence” for a Los Angeles businessman he won’t name and helping Republican lobbyists “butt out other lobbyists” by gathering information for them – Wohl’s phone began buzzing with the screen reading “Dad.”

He learned in the ensuing phone conversation that Michael Avenatti, the California attorney who has turned his representation of porn star Stormy Daniels into full-time work as a Trump antagonist, had tweeted at Wohl: “I am coming for you.”

Avenatti had been under investigation by Los Angeles authorities for an alleged domestic violence incident and had suggested that Wohl was involved in setting him up. Upon learning that criminal charges would not be forthcoming, Avenatti celebrated with the vengeful tweet.

Wohl responded by retreating to the bathroom of the hipster coffee shop, where he retweeted his father’s message that they would be reporting Avenatti’s threat to the authorities.

It’s not clear why Avenatti has suggested Wohl was involved. In a later interview, Avenatti said he was “not at liberty” to expound on Wohl’s role. Wohl said Avenatti has “accused me of putting a GPS device on his car” and “sending thugs after him to taunt him in public,” both of which he denies.

Avenatti’s response: “I have no idea what this idiot is talking about. This child is so stupid and so hungry for attention that he will say anything.”

Like a drawn-out pro wrestling feud, the duel between Avenatti and Wohl will surely have many chapters, each one more convoluted than the previous. Avenatti vowed that ultimately, Wohl “is going to find himself in a penitentiary somewhere.”

When Wohl came back from the bathroom, he bristled at a reporter’s suggestion that Avenatti – who is prone to melodrama, has scads of detractors and is skilled at intertwining himself in the major events of a bizarre political era – is the closest thing to his foil on the left.

“Kind of,” Wohl protested. “But he’s a loony tune because he’s making provably false accusations.”

In a joint statement yesterday, the international group voiced deep concern: ""In particular, President Al Bashir's recent decisions to declare a national State of Emergency, to appoint military and security members to senior government positions, and to issue emergency orders criminalising peaceful demonstrations and allowing security forces to act with impunity will further erode human rights, governance and effective economic management.""

'Return to military rule'

The statement asserts that ""the return to military rule does not create a conducive environment for a renewed political dialogue or credible elections. We note the ongoing detention of political leaders, activists and journalists, and call upon the Government of Sudan to abide by its public commitments to free them as well as others who have been arbitrarily detained. We also note continuing reports of unacceptable use of live fire, beating of protestors and mistreatment of detainees.""

The statement suggests that ""there remains a clear need for political and economic reform in Sudan that is fully inclusive, and which addresses the legitimate grievances expressed by the protestors. Economic stability cannot be achieved without first reaching political consensus. Political consensus cannot be achieved by imprisoning, shooting, and criminalizing peaceful protesters.""

Troika countries and Canada say they will continue to monitor the situation closely, and to emphasise that ""the government of Sudan's response to these protests and the actions of the military-led government will determine our countries' future engagement"".

Restraint

In a statement in January, the Troika and Canada warned that ""the government of Sudan's actions and decisions over the coming weeks will have an impact on the engagement of our governments and others in the coming months and years,"" and urged the government of Sudan ""to respond to the current challenges by implementing the necessary political reforms, to allow the Sudanese people to exercise their constitutional rights to peacefully express their political, economic and social views freely and without any fear of retaliation or persecution.""

She cited four occasions on which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or senior aides—even Canada’s top civil servant—brought up a forthcoming election (Quebec’s or their own) during a discussion of a potential deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin, which Wilson-Raybould did not support.

From her explosive half-hour opening statement:

Sept. 6, 2018: Ben Chin, chief of staff to Finance Minister Bill Morneau, to Jessica Prince, Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff

He wanted to talk about SNC and what we could do, if anything, to address this. He said to her that if they don’t get a DPA, they will leave Montreal, and it’s the Quebec election right now, so we can’t have that happen. He said that they have a big meeting coming up on Tuesday and that this bad news may go public.

Sept. 16: Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques, senior advisors to the Prime Minister, to Jessica Prince

They said that they think we should be able to find a more reasonable resolution here. They told her that SNC’s next board meeting is on Thursday (Sept 20). They also mention the Quebec election context.

Sept. 17: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, to Wilson-Raybould

The PM again cited potential loss of jobs and SNC moving. Then to my surprise—the Clerk started to make the case for the need to have a DPA—he said ‘there is a board meeting on Thursday (Sept 20) with stock holders’ … ‘they will likely be moving to London if this happens’… ‘and there is an election in Quebec soon’…

At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that ‘and I am an MP in Quebec—the member for Papineau.’

I was quite taken aback. My response—and I remember this vividly—was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye—I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.’ The Prime Minister said, ‘No, no, no—we just need to find a solution.’

Oct. 26: Mathieu Bouchard to Jessica Prince

My COS (chief of staff) said that this would obviously be perceived as interference and her boss questioning the DPP’s decision. Mathieu said that if—six months from the election—SNC announces they are moving their headquarters out of Canada, that is bad. He said “we can have the best policy in the world, but we need to be re-elected.

Either scenario is bad news for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals as they head into elections in October looking to hold onto their parliamentary majority.

The Trudeau Liberals' popularity slipped amid allegations by his former attorney general of political interference in the criminal prosecution of engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The Montreal-based company was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Moamer Kadhafi's reign.

For the first time, the ruling Liberal Party has found itself trailing the opposition Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer in the most recent public opinion polls.

Statistics Canada said the nation's slowing economic growth mainly reflected a drop in investment spending and lower exports.

Household spending slowed for a second consecutive quarter, with spending on life insurance and financial services up and on motor vehicles down.

Purchases of cannabis - after recreational use was legalized in October - totalled C$5.9 billion (US$4.5 billion) or 0.5 per cent of household spending.

Business investment on non-residential structures, and machinery and equipment fell sharply, but that plunge was moderated by an uptick in investment in intellectual property products.

The latter was ""mainly attributable to mineral exploration and evaluation, which can be influenced by anticipated prices and potential new reserves"", said Statistics Canada.

Exports volumes edged down, led by lower exports of forestry products, building and packaging materials, metal and non-metallic minerals, and energy products.

Imports also fell on lower shipments of industrial chemicals, plastic and rubber products, motor vehicles and parts, and metal and non-metallic mineral products.

Imports of energy products were flat while aircraft, engines and parts rebounded a whopping 17.1 per cent.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States said on Tuesday it wants the United Nations Security Council to vote this week on a draft resolution calling for elections in Venezuela and the delivery of humanitarian aid, but the move is likely to be opposed by Russia and other states.

Speaking ahead of a council meeting on Venezuela, the U.S. special envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, also told reporters Washington would impose more sanctions on ""high-ranking members of the regime and their financial affairs"" this week and next.

Russia and the United States have been at loggerheads over a U.S.-led campaign for international recognition of Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader and head of the country's elected National Assembly, over President Nicholas Maduro. Guaido last month declared himself the interim head of state.

Earlier this month the United States proposed a draft Security Council resolution, which prompted Russia to propose a rival text that makes no reference to elections or aid. A resolution needs nine votes in favor by the 15-member council and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to pass.

""I would not like to predict what the Russians are going to do. I think it would be shameful to veto a resolution that calls for more humanitarian aid,"" Abrams told reporters.

The Security Council met on Tuesday at the request of the United States, days after Maduro troops violently drove back U.S.-backed foreign aid convoys from Venezuela's border with Colombia on Saturday, killing two protesters and prompting Guaido to propose that Washington consider ""all options"" to oust Maduro.

Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Security Council that a U.S.-led campaign to oust Maduro had failed. ""That was the last chapter in the coup on Saturday,"" he said. ""Read my lips - it failed. Now is the time for us to return to sanity.""

""FORCE-FEEDING""

Guaido crossed into Colombia on Saturday in preparation for efforts to move aid over the border to Venezuela. He then met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada, on Monday in Bogota. Abrams told the Security Council he was concerned for Guaido's safety upon his return to Venezuela.

""What took place on Saturday was reminiscent not of assistance but what is called force-feeding in the United States,"" Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council. ""The U.S. authorities now decided to force feed a whole country.""

Nebenzia also questioned what other countries would have done if confronted with ""an attempted illegal state border crossing for the delivery of unknown cargo.""

""One country even wants to build a huge wall on the border of another country to prevent an illegal border crossing,"" he said, referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.

China said it opposed the use of humanitarian aid for political purposes.

U.N. political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo said the world body was concerned by Venezuela's serious humanitarian problems.

""Available information depicts a grim reality with the economy continuing to deteriorate, people dying of preventable causes and leaving the country in search of assistance,"" she told the council.

Abrams denied Russian accusations that the United States is preparing to intervene militarily in Venezuela, but reiterated that Trump has said all options are on the table in dealing with Venezuela.

Abrams said that U.S. policy was ""to use as much diplomatic and economic and political pressure as we can ... to support the Venezuelan people's desire for democracy, that's our policy.

""We call on member states to consider what resources and tools they have to contribute to Venezuelan democracy and pressure the illegitimate Maduro regime to peacefully step down,"" he told the Security Council.

55,Empty,2019-02-25T14:05:19Z,"Burnaby South was vacated by former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart, who was voted in as Vancouver's mayor in October 2018.","NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has won his place in the House of Commons with a win tonight in the Burnaby South byelection.

Singh addressed his supporters, saying “My friends, it’s a new day. It’s a new day,” and promising to take the issues of Burnaby residents to Ottawa.

Singh said many Canadians are falling behind, despite working hard, and they are starting to become fearful for themselves and their children.

He said some people will use that fear to “point at your neighbours, the people you live with, the people you work with.”

Singh said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was trying to protect his “friends at SNC-Lavalin” and subsidizing big oil. He said Canadians are drowning in debt, as he attacked corporations, saying the Liberals and Conservatives are not helping Canadians.

“Times up,” Singh said. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”

The results

Singh has 38.7 per cent of 20,346 votes counted, enough to be declared the winner.

There are 76,204 registered voters in the riding. 181 of 196 polls have been counted so far, representing 92 per cent of the vote.

Singh was up against Liberal Richard T. Lee, Conservative Jay Shin, independent candidates Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu, and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson.

In the 2015 federal election, the NDP won with 35 per cent of the vote, with the Liberals taking 33.9 per cent, the Conservatives 27.1 per cent, Greens 2.8 per cent and 1.1 per cent for the Libertarian party.

Lee has 26 per cent of the votes counted so far. The right-wing vote appears to be split, with Shin so far holding 22.7 per cent of the vote and Thompson with 10.9 per cent. Thompson is the first candidate seeking a seat for former Conversative Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC.

“Singh, Singh, Singh!”

Postmedia News reporter Matt Robinson said Singh supporters broke out into spontaneous chants of “Singh, Singh, Singh”, prior to Singh taking the podium at the election night party at the Metrotown Hilton.

Vancouver-Kingsway MP Don Davies has earlier taken the mic with an optimistic: “Welcome to the victory party.”

Peter Julian, MP for New Westminster-Burnaby, said with voters giving Singh the seat, “they’re saying they want a fighter. They’re saying they want someone who will stand up when the government makes bad choices.”

Jenny Kwan, a former and longtime MLA and now MP in Singh’s party, said “it’s a very exciting night. It’s one we’ve been waiting for for a long time. I know that Jag is so looking forward to going to Ottawa.

“We need a voice in the House of Commons that is on the side of the people and we haven’t had that with the Liberals and not with the Conservatives.”

Second place for Lee

Postmedia reporter Dan Fumano was with supporters of Liberal candidate Lee at the Delta Hotel.

Harjit Sajjan, the Liberal MP for Vancouver South an the Minister of National Defence, was at Lee’s event Monday night. Sajjan said he was happy to support Lee, who he described as a “humble, great person” and “I’ve had the opportunity to go door-knocking with him as well,” Sajjan told Postmedia.

“His compassion that he has for his community, that’s what really, I think, sets him apart.”

The Greens did not run a candidate in this byelection in order to improve the chances of an NDP win.

Burnaby South was vacated by former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart last October, when he was voted in as Vancouver’s mayor.

Quick things to know

• In the 2015 election, the New Democrats beat the Liberals in this riding by just over 500 votes.

• Lee announced he would be running after Karen Wang stepped down earlier this year after singling out Singh’s ethnicity in an online post.

• Tyler Thompson, who ran unsuccessfully for a school trustee position on the Burnaby school board, was the first candidate to seek a seat for Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC. She has been vocal against SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity) education in B.C.’s education curriculum.

• Green party Leader Elizabeth May had said her party will respect the “leader’s courtesy” by not running a candidate against Singh.

56,Empty,2019-03-05T04:45:00Z,US State Department deputy spokesperson Robert Palladino announced in a Sunday statement that the US had merged its new embassy in Israel with its consulate serving Palestinians into a single diplomatic mission. Sputnik has spoken about it to Ambassador Alan …,"US State Department deputy spokesperson Robert Palladino announced in a Sunday statement that the US had merged its new embassy in Israel with its consulate serving Palestinians into a single diplomatic mission. Sputnik has spoken about it to Ambassador Alan Baker, a former legal adviser to Israel’s Foreign Ministry and former ambassador to Canada.

Sputnik: The decision of a merger was announced back in October. Why is it being implemented now?

I presume bureaucratically these things take time, to make all the arrangements, to arrange the divisions of the departments within the embassy that will deal with consular issues.

Sputnik: How can this impact the upcoming elections in Israel?

Alan Baker: I don't think it has any impact whatsoever. The Israeli election campaign is going ahead, very dynamic, extremely interesting. And I don't think this will have any impact whatsoever — it won't make any change. The issues on the agenda of the Israeli public for the elections are domestic issues and security issues. So I don't think this particular issue would have any influence.

Sputnik: Announcing the move, the US has reiterated its commitment to achieving a lasting and comprehensive peace that offers a brighter future to Israel and Palestine. These were the words of the United States. What impact does this merger then have on the issue of Israeli-Palestinian peace? Is it going to be beneficial to the peace process? Or is it going to cause further consternation?

Look, whether it is beneficial or causes further consternation is dependent upon the extent of the Palestinian dramatization of the situation. If they decide that they want to turn it into a big deal, they will do that and that is, in fact, what they are doing, the major spokesman and the head of their negotiating team is conducting a hysteric Twitter campaign, attacking Israel, attacking the United States. But in actual fact, it won't make any difference to the peace relationship. When the Palestinians decide that they want to sit down and negotiate with the Israelis, the Israelis will be open to negotiate with them with or without a consulate in the embassy in Jerusalem.

Sputnik: You have mentioned the response from the Palestinian side. How well is the decision being received domestically in Israel?

Alan Baker: For many, many years Israel has tried to persuade its friends to acknowledge the fact that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. And the Americans did so, as you said, in October. Merging the consulate is more a bureaucratic, administrative function. It doesn't really change the situation. It is a realisation of a logical situation. If the centre of American diplomatic and consular activity is their embassy in Jerusalem, then it is only natural that they merge what used to be the old consulate together with the embassy. This doesn't change anything, as the Americans have said.

© AFP 2019 / SAID KHATIB How US Embassy Transfer Risks Driving a Wedge Between Israel, Arab World

Sputnik: What is your comment with regard to the Palestinians' concerns that the move could potentially reduce the level of the US representation in the Palestinian Authority? Are their concerns valid?

Alan Baker: Every two or three days, whenever there is any development, the Palestinian leadership shouts that this will affect the US relationship with them. But in actual fact, it is only the United States that is trying to come up with a peace plan that is intended to benefit both the Israelis and the Palestinians. So I think it is a matter of biting their nose to spite their face. They don't really mean it. Ultimately, if and when they decide to come back to a negotiating mode, the negotiations will take place with American assistance, with European assistance, with Egyptian assistance, and Jordanian assistance. Whoever can contribute positively to this will be very welcome, including Russian assistance.

Canada's leader is under increasing pressure after allegations emerged that he pressured the government to drop an investigation into alleged bribes paid by multinational engineering company SNC-Lavalin to Libya.

Treasury Board president Jane Philpott resigned on Monday – the second minister to step down over a scandal that has shaken the government.

In her resignation letter she said it was ""untenable"" for her to continue because she had lost confidence and could not defend the government and its handling of the investigation.

Mr Trudeau thanked Ms Philpott for her service in a short statement that said he ""understands"" the resignation but is ""disappointed"" by it.

""Concerns of this nature must be taken seriously and I can ensure you that I am,"" he added.

SNC-Lavalin is accused of having paid $47.7m Canadian dollars in bribes to Libyan officials in order to gain contracts there, and ultimately defrauded the Libyan government out of $129.8m Canadian dollars.

Ms Philpott's friend, former attorney general and justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, testified last week that Mr Trudeau and senior members of his government inappropriately and tried to pressure her to avoid prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Mr Trudeau’s and others have been accused of pressuring Ms Wilson-Raybould to drop the investigation because pressing forward with the enquiry could have potentially cost Canada thousands of jobs.

The then justice minister refused to drop the investigation, and was later removed from her post and reassigned to a lesser position in the Canadian cabinet.

Ms Wilson-Raybould resigned from the cabinet last month.

The scandal has rocked Mr Trudeau's government. Gerald Butts, his closet adviser, also resigned last month and is scheduled to testify on 6 March before a parliament justice committee in Mr Trudeau's defence.

Mr Trudeau has denied any political meddling even as pressure has mounted, and members of the opposition party have called for his resignation.

The leader of the opposition, Andrew Scheer, said the ""government [was] in total chaos"", called for Mr Trudeau to resign and for a police investigation of the affair.

If convicted criminally, SNC-Lavalin would be banned from receiving any federal government business for a decade.

The Montreal-based company is an economic force in Canada, with 9,000 employees in the country and about 50,000 worldwide.

Read Full Article at RT.com","Justin Trudeau has dismissed calls to resign amid explosive allegations from Canada’s ex-attorney general, who testified that the prime minister tried to pressure her to drop a bribery probe into a Quebec-based firm.

Former minister of justice and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould told parliament’s justice committee on Wednesday that senior officials “barraged” her with requests to drop criminal charges against SNC Lavalin, a Canadian engineering company accused of using bribes to secure government contracts in Libya. Wilson-Raybould testified that the intense political pressure included “veiled threats” and even attempts by Trudeau to persuade her to shut down the proceedings in favor of a wrist-slap fine.

“I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada in an inappropriate effort,” she said in her opening statement.

The prime minister, Wilson-Raybould claimed, had expressed concern that the probe could endanger jobs in Quebec and asked her to “help out” with the case. In total, the former attorney general recounted 10 meetings and 10 phone calls she had with Trudeau and top government officials urging leniency for the firm.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed her refusal to abandon the prosecution was the reason she was abruptly demoted to the position of veteran affairs minister.

Her testimony has led to calls from Canada’s conservative opposition for Trudeau to step down.

“I was sickened and appalled by [Wilson-Raybould's] story of inappropriate and, frankly, borderline illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest levels of Justin Trudeau's government,” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said.

Trudeau has dismissed demands for his resignation, insisting that he has “always acted appropriately and professionally.”

The alleged attempt to pressure Wilson-Raybould to drop the case against SNC Lavalin was first reported by the Globe and Mail in early February, creating a major headache for Trudeau’s Liberal Party ahead of federal elections in October.

SNC-Lavalin was accused of issuing $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials in the decade leading up to the NATO-led overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi's government in 2011. The company was also charged with defrauding Libyan companies of about $130 million.

The scandal has shaken Trudeau’s image as a poster boy for progressive government. His support for a controversial pipeline in British Columbia has also left some Canadians questioning Trudeau’s ‘eco-friendly’ credentials.

59,Empty,2019-02-26T04:16:00Z,The byelection has been a test of the NDP’s leadership ahead of the national campaign — but also the appeal of a new far-right populist party.,"BURNABY, B.C.—New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh has won a bitter byelection race in Burnaby South just months before a federal election. He will be the first person of colour to lead a federal party in the House of Commons. With all polls reporting, Singh earned 39 per cent of the vote.

He took to the stage at the Metrotown Hilton and said, “We made history today,” as jubilant supporters chanted “NDP! NDP!” “I want to promise you something. I will be your champion. I will take each and every one of you to Ottawa where I will fight for you in the House of Commons,” he said to roaring cheers. Political scientists say Burnaby South’s unusually divisive byelection has been a test of Singh’s hold on his party, which has campaigned on bread-and-butter issues like housing and health after electing him leader in 2017.

Experts said that even a tenth of Burnaby South’s electorate casting a ballot for People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Thompson would signal an appetite for far-right policies against carbon taxation and at least some forms of immigration. Such arguments had found support even among Burnaby’s sizable minority populations. After the final tally, Lee earned 26 per cent of votes, Shin had 22.5 per cent and Thompson earned 10.6 per cent of votes.

In his concession speech at the Liberal’s election night celebration, Lee asked the more than 200 supporters present to congratulate Singh on his victory. There was no half-hearted applause; the crowd cheered enthusiastically. “We are very fortunate to live in a democratic society in Canada,” Lee said. “Congratulations to Mr. Singh. He has the opportunity to serve the best community in Canada.” But Lee reminded Singh that he must defend his seat when a federal election comes before Oct. 21 — a remark that garnered more cheers from the party faithful. “I and the community expect him to serve with intregity and grace — before running again in Burnaby South in October.” Asked if Lee would carry the Liberal flag in the general election just months away, Lee told the Star, “I plan to.”

As for what kind of campaign voters might expect in October, Lee said the strategy will be “a fair and transparent politics that is positive.” Lee had replaced the original candidate for the Liberals, Karen Wang, who resigned after the Star unearthed her online posts in Chinese making reference to Singh’s ethnicity. The mostly suburban community where the conflict played out is diverse and historically working class, with a median income 18-per-cent below the national average. It has a higher proportion of visible minorities than neighbouring Vancouver or Surrey — even higher than Toronto. In recent days, all-candidates debates had devolved into audience heckling and allegations of racism and extremism. Some in Burnaby South have cited the murder of a Chinese-Canadian teen, allegedly by a Syrian refugee, as evidence of a public-safety risk connected to immigration. The Liberal and NDP candidates countered that the actions of one individual should not represent an entire group. The tension spread beyond the podium as well. The People’s Party candidate accused her Conservative opponent of “smearing” her in a pamphlet delivered to constituents, which included pictures of marijuana leaves and empty syringes and alleged the party supports drug use. Singh promised to address the uncertainty and fear among his constituency and said he wants to give people hope. Residents of Burnaby South were “left behind” by a housing crisis and the Canadian government purchasing a pipeline they didn’t want, he told reporters on Monday, referring to the Trans Mountain project that runs through the riding.

The federal riding was previously an NDP stronghold. However, in the last 2015 election, former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart squeaked by with a surplus of roughly 600 votes over the Liberals, while the Conservative candidate was a close third. Stewart vacated the seat to become the current mayor of Vancouver. Yearly donations to the federal NDP have tanked from $18.6 million in 2015 to about $5 million last year, according to fundraising returns filed with Elections Canada. The party subsequently mortgaged its Ottawa headquarters — the Jack Layton building — for $12 million. Former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair has been critical of Singh, publicly chiding his political acumen and the direction of the party under his leadership. But Jenny Kwan, MP of Vancouver East, said the NDP under Singh’s leadership has resonated with voters dissatisfied with affordability under both the Liberal and Conservative governments. “We need a strong voice in Ottawa — one who can challenge Trudeau and hold him accountable,” she told the Star on Monday. Political observers were keen to watch how the Liberal brand performed in Burnaby South, as the party is currently embroiled in allegations that staffers pressured the former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop prosecuting engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid a high-profile campaign visit to Lee to cheering crowds, but Liberal support has fallen in recent polls across the country, including in B.C. The PPC has carved out space for itself to the right of the Conservative Party of Canada since Leader Maxime Bernier announced the party’s formation last year. It represents the first real challenge the federal Conservative Party has faced from the right since its own formation in 2003 out of a merger between the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance.

Jagmeet Singh, a practising Sikh, shot to prominence in October 2017 when he became the first ethnic minority leader of a major federal political party in Canada.

At 40, his win in a by-election in a Vancouver suburb on Monday sets the stage for the NDP to steal votes on the left and hurt Liberal hopes of hanging onto their majority in parliament in the upcoming general election.

In the lead up to Monday's special ballot, Singh struggled with low national visibility and insider criticism of his leadership.

Now, with eight months to go before the general election, he will face off almost daily against Trudeau in the House of Commons.

The third-ranked NDP, however, lost another seat in Montreal held by Singh's predecessor to the Liberals.

Meanwhile, the main opposition Tories -- which are neck and neck with the Liberals in recent public opinion polls -- held onto a seat in the Toronto area.

Pundits were watching to see if an upstart People's Party, led by former Tory foreign minister Maxime Bernier, would split away significant votes from the Conservatives on the right -- which would help the Liberals in October.

But it barely registered in all three special ballots held Monday.

“IT FEELS LIKE WE’RE ONLY able to call the use of anti-Semitic language by a colleague of ours -- any colleague of ours -- if we’re addressing all forms of hatred and it feels like we can't say it's anti-semitism unless everyone agrees that it's anti-semitism. Who gets to define what counts as stereotypes and discrimination?

“‘It’s going to say that we are against bigotry, we are against prejudice, we’re against hate, against whomever that is directed,’ Hoyer told reporters after the meeting. … Pelosi confirmed the resolution will not mention Omar by name, as some Jewish lawmakers had privately demanded, and will broadly address several forms of hate speech, including anti-Semitism.” POLITICO

“Mr. Kelly also broke with Mr. Trump on key aspects of his approach to immigration and the NATO alliance, and said that his top concern about decisions made by the president was whether they were objectively right for the country when divorced from political concerns. … Asked specifically about whether he had ever created memos for the record, Mr. Kelly said, ‘I’d prefer not to talk about that.’” NYT

And that’s causing concern not only in the embassy but also among members of Congress, according to three individuals with direct knowledge of the matter.

“On his trip to the Middle East, Kushner stopped in Riyadh. While there, he met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and King Salman to discuss U.S.-Saudi cooperation, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and economic investment in the region, according to the White House. But no one from the embassy in Riyadh was in the meetings, according to two sources.

TRADE WARS -- SABRINA RODRÍGUEZ and ANDREW RESTUCCIA: “White House tries to charm Democrats on new NAFTA”: “Administration officials have been organizing dozens of meetings with rank-and-file lawmakers to try to build bipartisan support for the deal, which restructures trade terms with Canada and Mexico. They’re hoping to recapture the success of criminal justice reform legislation, which marked a rare high-point for White House-Hill relations and passed Congress last year following a monthslong behind-the-scenes campaign led by Jared Kushner.

“Their goal is to get a vote on the pact by late summer. But their efforts still may come to nothing: While Pelosi hasn’t yet staked out a definitive position on the agreement, factions of Democrats are already saying they’re not going to vote for it unless there are changes to key provisions, possibly requiring new negotiations with the two U.S. trading partners. Plus, Democrats and GOP lawmakers alike are telling the president they won’t consider the deal until he lifts lingering tariffs on steel and aluminum from Mexico and Canada.” POLITICO

ON THE WORLD STAGE -- “Huawei sues U.S. government in growing counteroffensive against purchasing ban,” by WaPo’s Gerry Shih in Shenzhen, China: “In a lawsuit filed in federal district court in Texas, Huawei argued that a section of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act passed into law in August, which prohibits federal agencies and contractors from buying Huawei equipment on national security grounds, unfairly punished the Chinese company without due process and without providing proof that Huawei posed an espionage threat to the United States.

“The complaint adds a new subplot — in American courts — to the sprawling standoff between the Trump administration and a tech firm seen as an icon of China’s rise into a world power. The lawsuit comes at a time when decades-old Chinese policies locking out American companies — from the financial to automotive to Internet sectors — lie at the heart of the current bilateral trade dispute.” WaPo

“Federal records show that Amazon.com Inc. lobbied more government entities than any other tech company in 2018 and sought to exert its influence over more issues than any of its tech peers except Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Last year, Amazon spent $14.2 million on lobbying, a record for the company, up from its previous high mark of $12.8 million in 2017. … Amazon is also showing a new level of assertiveness in advancing its corporate interests, though largely out of the public eye.” Bloomberg

In January, the U.S. State Department took notice, telling Aro she would be honored with the prestigious International Women of Courage Award, to be presented in Washington by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

“Weeks later, the State Department rescinded the award offer. A State Department spokesperson said it was due to a ‘regrettable error,’ but Aro and U.S. officials familiar with the internal deliberations tell a different story. They say the department revoked her award after U.S. officials went through Aro’s social media posts and found she had also frequently criticized President Donald Trump.” Foreign Policy

The c…","(Bloomberg) -- The spike in tensions between India and Pakistan couldn’t have come at a worse time for assets in the world’s fastest-growing major economy, which is battling headwinds from a rebound in oil prices to the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming elections.

The rupee has gone from being the best-performing Asian currency last quarter to the worst this year, sovereign bonds are set for a second month of declines and equities have sat out the rally that’s driven Asian stocks to a four-month high.

The nervousness ratcheted up Wednesday after Pakistani fighter jets struck at targets inside Indian-controlled Kashmir, prompting both nations to close down large swathes of airspace as tensions between them reached their highest point since a 1971 war. The conflict came a day after India bombed a major terror camp inside Pakistan.

“Further geopolitical tensions will increase the premium in the rupee assets,” said Eugene Leow, a rates strategist at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “This is already reflected in the increasingly divergent forex and bond performance between the two high-yielders in Asia -- Indonesia and India.”

The rupee lost 0.3 percent to 71.2475 dollar at the close and the yield on most-traded 2028 bonds surged nine basis points to 7.68 percent. The S&P BSE Sensex index of stocks erased almost all of its intraday gain of 1.1 percent to end marginally in the red. Across the border, Pakistan’s main equities gauge fell 0.3 percent to the lowest level since Jan. 7.

The modest reaction prompted some analysts to say that markets are underestimating the impact of a further flare up.

Optimism about the U.S.-China trade talks and the Brexit delay are “distracting traders and investors from the broader point that military escalation between two nuclear powers has huge implications,” said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at Royal Bank of Canada.

This week’s skirmish represents the worst escalation since 2001, when the countries moved ballistic missiles and troops to their border following an attack on parliament in New Delhi that was also blamed on Jaish-e-Mohammad. The two nations have fought three major wars since partition and independence in 1947.

“If India responds again there will a problem in the short term,” said Aneesh Srivastava, chief investment officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co. “This issue may continue to simmer until elections.”

Poll Prospects

Facing a general election due by May, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is under pressure after blaming Pakistan for the worst attack on security forces in Kashmir in decades earlier this month. There’s a possibility for this event to unite the nation behind Modi at the polls, which could help support markets, analysts including Saktiandi Supaat at Maybank wrote in a note, advising clients to buy the rupee on declines.

Maybank’s not alone in recommending the buy-the-dips strategy. Global funds bought a net $487.5 million of shares so far this week, taking the month’s purchases to $2.3 billion. That’s set to be the biggest inflow since November 2017, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

“India is still a good place to pick good stocks, and yesterday we saw foreigners coming back to buy,” said Sameer Kalra, president at Mumbai-based advisory Target Investing. “There will be short-term pain if this escalates but the outcome of an escalation helps India prove that Pakistan is being used as a terror ground. We remain a buyer.”

The US vice-president, Mike Pence, has repeated a veiled threat of military intervention in Venezuela, but Washington appeared increasingly isolated in its willingness to contemplate using force to oust President Nicolás Maduro.

European powers and some of Donald Trump’s key Latin American allies – all of whom have recognised the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as Venezuela’s legitimate leader – warned that they would oppose sending troops into the country.

Guaidó had for weeks insisted his movement was focused on peaceful, democratic change. But after the opposition failed in a weekend bid to defy Caracas and bring aid into the country, he called on the international community to “keep all options open”.

That hint at the use of military force won an enthusiastic response from hawks like US senator Marco Rubio, but sparked alarm elsewhere, particularly as Trump has previously mooted ordering an invasion.

Speaking at an emergency summit of regional leaders in the Colombian capital Bogotá, Pence renewed the threat of intervention, describing Maduro as “a usurper”, and calling for a global push to oust him.

“To leaders around the world: it’s time. There can be no bystanders in Venezuela’s struggle for freedom,” he said. “We hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But beyond the US, few appear willing embrace the prospect of violence. In Latin America, there is a painful and bloody history of US interventions, and the terrible fallout from the 2003 invasion of Iraq is another deterrent to the use of military force.

An invasion would be complicated and bloody, with a strong chance of sliding into protracted civil war. Venezuela has armed forces that are more than 300,000 strong, thousands more members of pro-government gangs or guerrilla groups, complex terrain – and a government that still has some support from international partners including China and Russia.

Brazil’s vice-president, retired general Hamilton Mourão, said on Monday that under no circumstances would his country allow the United States to intervene militarily from Brazilian territory, even though the country’s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro has previously vowed to do “everything for democracy to be re-established” in Venezuela.

Colombian president Iván Duque has also now ruled out intervention, according to sources in his administration. Chile and Peru were among other regional powers opposing military action on Monday.

There was similar concern across the Atlantic, where European nations including Spain and Germany made clear they considered the deployment of troops a line that should not be crossed.

“Not every option is on the table,” the country’s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, told the Spanish news agency Efe on Sunday, in a blunt rebuke to both Guaidó and US supporters of intervention.

The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, insisted there could be no military solution to a political crisis.

“The origins of the ongoing crisis in Venezuela are political and institutional, hence the solution can only be a political one,” she said in a statement. “We reiterate our firm rejection and condemnation of violence and of any initiatives that can further destabilise the region.”

Before the meeting of the Lima group of Latin American powers and Canada, Pence told Guaidó, attending as Venezuela’s interim president: “We are 100% with you.”

The Lima group also said credible threats have been made against the life of Venezuelan opposition leader Guaidó and his family, adding that President Nicolas Maduro was responsible for Guaido’s safety.",'Maduro must go': Pence bids to ramp up effort to oust Venezuelan leader,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/apos-maduro-must-apos-pence-193214527.html
66,Empty,2019-03-05T16:25:35Z,The two cities at the top and bottom of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives ranking are only about a three-hour drive apart in southern Ontario The post The best and worst places to be a woman in Canada in 2019 appeared first on Macleans.ca.,"“The Best and Worst Places to be a Woman in Canada”, an annual report published since 2014 by the Ottawa-based Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives is, by definition, a bittersweet endeavour. The “bitter” is the enduring need to gauge gender inequities in Canada, coupled with the fact these inequities are themselves unequally experienced by women across the country. The “sweet” is the underlying optimism that improvement is possible; this is borne out in the study’s profiling of numerous community initiatives across the country making a difference in the lives of women.

“The Best and Worst Places to be a Woman in Canada” 2019 report, released Tuesday, is particularly bittersweet: its initial architect, the brilliant policy analyst Kate McIntuff, died last year at age 49. The work she began carries on under the able stewardship of the centre’s senior economist, Katherine Scott, who is also the director of its gender equality and public policy work.

This year’s analysis once again offers an incisive, bracing snapshot of life for women in 26 of the country’s biggest cities based on five measures: access to economic security, personal security, education, health and leadership positions. This year’s top-ranked city is Kingston, Ont., with St. John’s ranked No. 2; the lowest-ranked is Barrie, Ont. with Quebec City ranked No. 25. Before Barrie residents consider high-tailing it 344 kilometres east to Kingston, however, it’s worth noting that the differential between the two cities is 7.1 percentage points. This, the study notes, “suggests that there is not a very large difference between the best place to be a woman in Canada and the worst.”

As always, the report identifies areas of strength and weakness, and the fact that cities can be highly rated by one metric, and lowly rated by another. Scott points to the enduring gendered leadership gap: women are more likely to vote in local elections, but make up only one-third of city councillors in big cities, and only one-fifth of mayors. While woman comprise 48 per cent of employees, they account for only one-third of managers, with most of these positions in middle management, a statistic that hasn’t changed in five years. Certain other trends hold fast: for one, Quebec cities do well in the economic domain, a reflection of access to universal, low-cost child-care in that province. All cities also suffer from “stubbornly” high rates of sexual and domestic violence; yet the study points to improvements arising from post-#MeToo initiatives coordinated between women’s organizations, media and police.

The wage gap between men and women also persists, with the biggest discrepancies seen in western Canada, Barrie, and Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge. That latter region (rated No. 17), known for its educational institutions, contained concerning anomalies. It scored highly in leadership metrics, yet poorly on the wage gap. It also ranked at the very bottom in terms of intimate partner violence and high rates of police-reported sexual assault cases that end up classified as “unfounded.”

Another big “gap” identified in this year’s report is a “data gap” that precludes a complete picture of gender inequities and also renders many women, particularly those in marginalized communities, invisible. As Scott puts it: “we don’t have the evidence to flag important problems, to make good decisions, to evaluate the impact of different policies and programs, or to take action to eliminate life damaging disparities.”

Canada has a limited number of public sources of data, compared to the U.S., Scott told me. The reinstatement of the long-form census is good news for data-gathering, but more funding from all levels of government is needed: “Data is expensive,” she says. The biggest challenge, Scott notes, is access to numbers at the community level. She cites the example of data that captures the experience of immigrant women: “It exists at the national level but not the city level,” she says. Scott speaks more optimistically about other trends, such as efforts to assert “data sovereignty” among Indigenous peoples through the work of organizations such as the First Nations Information Governance Centre.

One of the initial purposes of the “Best and Worst Cities” report was to provide a platform for organizations in cities to talk to their communities, and raise issues with municipal governments. It’s a mandate Scott clearly relishes: “I love doing the community profiles,” she says. “That’s where change happens.” And that, in turn, is why access to statistics at this level is so important: without them change, and its absence, cannot be measured.

Why Globalists are Obsessed with Artificial Intelligence

Several readers suggested a recent essay by Brandon Smith: The Real Reason Why Globalists Are So Obsessed With Artificial Intelligence. Here is a key quote:

“The globalists have long held AI as a kind of holy grail in centralization technology. The United Nations has adopted numerous positions and even summits on the issue, including the “AI For Good” summit in Geneva. The UN insinuates that it’s primary interest in AI is in regulation or observation of how it is exploited, but the UN also has clear goals to use AI to its advantage. The use of AI as a means to monitor mass data to better institute “sustainable development” is written clearly in the UN’s agenda.

The IMF is also in on the AI trend, holding global discussions on the uses of AI in economics as well as the effects of algorithms on economic analysis.

The main source for the development of AI has long been DARPA. The military and globalist think tank dumps billions of dollars into the technology, making AI the underlying focus of most of DARPA’s work. AI is not only on the globalist’s radar; they are essentially spearheading the creation and promotion of it.”

68,Empty,2019-03-03T19:00:56Z,Penny ante corruption fuels purchases of voting machines in Georgia and Pennsylvania,"By Lambert Strether of Corrente.

Readers will recall that H.R. 1, the Democrat’s flagship bill for the 116th Congress, gestures in the direction of paper ballots, but in fact allows ballot marking devices that rely on OCRs for the count and emit paper receipts for voters (often called ballots for marketing purposes, falsely, since the actual count is performed in the internals of the device). I am sure I do not need to remind readers that hand-marked paper ballots, hand-counted in public are the international standard for elections; and that they are used in the Canada, the UK, Germany, and many other countries. The United States, as in so many other ways, is exceptional aberrational in that it has managed to commit itself to systems that are both more expensive and much more dysfunctional MR SUBLIMINAL For whom? than those used in the rest of the world). In other words, the Democrats, with HR1, have lent their official support to a horrid industry that enables election fraud, an industry that has acted with intent to corrupt state and local officials to win its contracts. In this post, I’ll define “ballot marking devices” (BMDs), explain generic problems with the architecture of all BMDs, and finally look at the entertaining forms of corruption that preceded the choice of BMDs in Pennsylvania and Georgia.

“Ballot Marking Devices” Defined

Jennifer Cohn at Bradblog explains:

A Ballot Marking Device (“BMD”) is a touchscreen computer that generates a computer-marked paper ballot or printout, which is then tallied on a computerized optical scanner. (Those computer-marked ballots can also, in theory, be counted by hand, but generally are not, as most election officials rely on optical scanners instead.) [BMDs] introduce a second unnecessary and insecure computer system in the polling place above and beyond already insecure optical scanners, creating twice as many opportunities for electronic programming errors, paper jams, and hacking. For example, some BMD systems have already had problems with: Vote flipping (when election integrity advocate and journalist Brad Friedman used such a device in Los Angeles in a 2008 election, the device flipped 4 out of 12 of his selections on the computer-marked paper ballot); Inability to display all candidates on one screen (a problem reported by the state of Maryland, which had acquired such systems for all voters, but changed its mind even though the screen problem was eventually fixed); and Vendor breach of certification requirements (as occurred with vendor Election Systems & Software, “ES&S”, the nation’s largest voting system vendor). Meanwhile, two of the most popular BMD’s — the ES&S ExpressVote and the Dominion ImageCast — produce bar-coded (or QR-coded) printouts, which cannot be read by human beings, in lieu of traditional, hand-marked paper ballots.

What could go wrong? Meanwhile — it may help to think of BMDs, and indeed electronic voting machines generally, as a very early version of the Internet of Things — there’s no reason to thing that electronic voting machine vendors will fix their software, or have any inclination to do so. Wired:

Many of the machines participants analyzed during the [DefCon security conference’s Voting Village event] run software written in the early 2000s, or even the 1990s. Some vulnerabilities detailed in the report were disclosed years ago and still haven’t been resolved. In particular, one ballot counter made by Election Systems & Software, the Model 650, has a flaw in its update architecture first documented in 2007 that persists. Voting Village participants also found a network vulnerability in the same device—which 26 states and the District of Columbia all currently use. ES&S stopped manufacturing the Model 650 in 2008, and notes that “the base-level security protections on the M650 are not as advanced as the security protections that exist on the voting machines ES&S manufactures today.” The company still sells the decade-old device, though “We didn’t discover a lot of new vulnerabilities,” says Matt Blaze, a computer science professor at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the organizers of the Voting Village, who has been analyzing voting machine security for more than 10 years. “What we discovered was vulnerabilities that we know about are easy to find, easy to reengineer, and have not been fixed over the course of more than a decade of knowing about them. And to me that is both the unsurprising and terribly disturbing lesson that came out of the Voting Village.” Many of the weaknesses Voting Village participants found were frustratingly basic, underscoring the need for a reckoning with manufacturers. One device, the “ExpressPoll-5000,” has root password of “password.” The administrator password is “pasta.”.

A root password of “password.” This is security somewhat below the security you get with the router you get from Best Buy. And we’re only running elections on it! But what if the software engineering was perfect?

Architectural Probems with Ballot Marking Devices

Software engineering can never be shown to be perfect. As computing science pioneer Edgers Dijkstra famously said: “Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!” (True for any firm, not just firms that use “password” for the root password!) Since the presence of bugs is one precusor to election fraud via hacking (the other being social engineering), it follows that ballot marking devices create a phishing equilibrium, best summarized as the idea that if fraud is possible in a system, it has already occurred and will occur again. Of course, that’s true for all systems, in general (see North Carolina’s problems with ballot harvesting), but one would think, would one not, that election officials in a functioning democracy would try to level-set the equilibrium to minimize the chances of fraud, not maximize them. No such luck. Politico, of the barcode BMDs both George and Philadelphia are about to purchase. “State election officials opt for 2020 voting machines vulnerable to hacking“:

The dispute over the ballot-marking devices centers on the fact that they use barcodes, which can be read by scanners but not by humans. Though the paper records also display a voter’s choices in plain text, which the voter can double-check, the barcode is the part that gets tallied. The danger: Hackers who infiltrate a ballot-marking device could modify the barcode so its vote data differs from what’s in the printed text. If this happened, a voter would have no way of spotting it. In a landmark report published last year, the National Academies recommended against voting devices that tally barcodes. “Electronic voting systems that do not produce a human-readable paper ballot of record raise security and verifiability concerns,” it said. “Additional research on ballots produced by BMDs will be necessary to understand the effectiveness of such ballots.”

But the issue isn’t simply barcodes; the issue is that wherever software infiltrates the voting “supply chain,” a phishing equilibrium exists. Dolly back from the electronic voting machine proper to the entire digital system that grows up around it. Jenny Cohn in the New York Review of Books:

The memory cards or USB sticks used to transfer the pre-election programming from the election management system to the voting machines, scanners, and ballot-marking devices constitute another potential attack vector. In theory, the person who distributes those cards or USB sticks to the precincts could swap them out for cards containing a vote-flipping program. Memory cards are also used in the reverse direction—to transfer precinct tallies from the voting machines and scanners to the election management system’s central tabulator, which aggregates those tallies. Problems can occur during this process, too. During the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, for example, a Global/Diebold machine in Volusia County, Florida, subtracted 16,000 Gore votes, while adding votes to a third-party candidate. The “Volusia error,” which caused CBS news to call the race prematurely for Bush, was attributed to a faulty memory card, although election logs referenced a second “phantom” card as well.

Holy moley, the integrity of our election system depends on USB sticks. That’s peak phishing equilibrium! I mean, your firm’s IT department has absolutely no problem with you sticking a random USB stick into your PC, right? (“Their central finding is that USB firmware, which exists in varying forms in all USB devices, can be reprogrammed to hide attack code.” ZOMG.) Paper ballots, needless to say, don’t require “pre-election programming,” except possibly in the form of a three-ring binder, for which the phishing equilibrium is very low.

Corruption in States that Chose Ballot Marking Devices

So why on earth would any responsible election official choose BMDs over paper ballots? Well, we don’t have a smoking gun (no prosecutions) but we certainly have situations that give off the stench familiar from other cases of corruption. Entertainingly, the techniques of corruption differ by jurisdiction, which I suppose is a blessing of our wonderful Federal system. First, Pennsylvania.

Granted, Pennylvania is in a bad way, from the broken HAVA act of 2002 that encouraged electronic voting systems that weren’t verifable in any way. Associated Press:

Pennsylvania is one of 13 states where some or all voters use machines that store votes electronically without printed ballots or another paper-based backup that allows a voter to double-check how their vote was recorded. Better than 4 in 5 Pennsylvania voters use electronic voting machines that lack an auditable paper trail, according to election security analysts.

As a result:

Replacing voting machines ahead of 2020’s presidential election has been a priority for [Governor Tom] Wolf, and he is proposing $15 million a year for five years — $75 million total — to help counties pay for machines that leave a voter-marked paper trail, machines viewed as more secure and auditable.

(Of course, “more” “secure and auditable” does not mean “secure and auditable”; see above.

So, given this vital task, how did the vendor selection process go? From the Delco Times:

Pennsylvania’s elected auditor said Friday that officials in 18 of the state’s 67 counties reported accepting gifts, meals or trips from firms competing to sell or lease new voting machines ahead of the 2020 elections. Auditor General Eugene DePasquale said accepting the gifts is wrong, even though it’s a legal practice and officials may have taken no action in return. “Anyone who took them, period, could be swayed by the perks,” he said. Public officials, he said, should not “accept this nonsense.” The gifts included expense-paid travel to destinations including Las Vegas, tickets to a wine festival and private distillery tour, dinners at high-end restaurants, tickets to an amusement park and an open bar at a conference for elections officials, DePasquale said. A promotional folding chair, doughnuts and candy, were among other gifts.

That’s what you call “the appearance of corruption,” right there. Of course, it’s penny ante stuff, for a penny ante $75 million contract, which I guess might not be penny ante if you were a penny ante firm whose engineers used “password” for the root password.

In Georgia, the vendors didn’t go the perks route; they went the crony route. From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution:

When Gov. Brian Kemp hired an election company’s lobbyist this month, the move raised alarm bells about one company’s influence on Georgia’s upcoming purchase of a new statewide voting system. Concerns from government accountability advocates only grew days later, when a commission created by Kemp recommended that the state buy the type of voting machines sold by the lobbyist’s company, Election Systems & Software. Several other vendors also offer similar voting machines.

But it gets better. It’s not just one hire; the voting machine vendor infested the entire state government:

The latest moves fueled suspicions that cozy connections between lobbyists, Kemp and other elected officials will lead to ES&S winning a rich contract to sell its computerized voting products to the state government. Kemp and Georgia election officials have supported ES&S for about 10 years: The ES&S lobbyist, former state Rep. Chuck Harper, now serves as Kemp’s deputy chief of staff. Prior to lobbying for ES&S, Harper was a lobbyist for the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office under Kemp from 2012 to 2017.

Kemp’s new executive counsel, David Dove, was a member of ES&S’ advisory board when he attended a Las Vegas conference hosted by the company in March 2017. Dove served as Kemp’s chief of staff when he was secretary of state.

Kemp chose ES&S’ voting system for a test run during a Conyers election in November 2017. ES&S is Georgia’s current election company, responsible for providing technical support and repairs of the state’s 27,000 direct-recording electronic voting machines, which the state originally purchased for $54 million from Diebold Election Systems in 2002.

Everything really is like CalPERS, isn’t it?

Conclusion

See what HR1 enabled? The electronic voting industry shouldn’t even exist. Why does it? And how did it get itself written into HR1?","Corruption Fueling Choice of “Ballot Marking Devices,” not Paper Ballots, in Georgia, Pennsylvania Debacles",Nakedcapitalism.com,https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/03/corruption-fueling-choice-ballot-marking-devices-not-paper-ballots-georgia-pennsylvania-debacles.html

Reserve Bank of India’s new chief Shaktikanta Das cut interest rates l…","(Bloomberg) -- A barrage of bad news has taken the sheen off India’s rupee lately. And Royal Bank of Canada says the currency may suffer more pain.

The rupee may weaken to 80 per dollar by September as a dovish turn by the central bank lowers the currency’s yield appeal, said Sue Trinh, head of Asia forex strategy at RBC in Hong Kong. The prediction is way more bearish than the 71.25 median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, and implies a drop of more than 11 percent from current levels.

Reserve Bank of India’s new chief Shaktikanta Das cut interest rates last month to support the economy, and kept the door open for more easing citing growth concerns. Data on Thursday showed expansion in the three months ended December slowed to the weakest pace in five quarters, just as the outlook gets clouded by growing tensions with Pakistan.

“The combination of consumer inflation undershoots and dovish policy bias of Governor Das suggests big rate cuts could be around the corner,” Trinh said. The challenge of funding the widening budget deficit will also weigh on the currency, she said.

The rupee is already the worst performer this year in Asia ex-Japan amid the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming elections, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seen facing a tight contest. This week’s military skirmish with Pakistan added to the anxiety, though the currency did rally hard late Thursday as Pakistan said it will release a captured Indian pilot as a gesture of peace.

“It is not specific to India, but everywhere you look there are potential flashpoints that can flare up at the drop of a dime in the context of slowing global growth, massive levels of debt and increasingly desperate governments,” Trinh said. This risk is being “under-priced” by markets, she said.

The draft resolution is likely to be opposed by Russia, the diplomats said. A resolution needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain and the United States to pass.

Russia and the United States have been at loggerheads over a U.S.-led campaign for international recognition of Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader and head of the country’s elected National Assembly, over President Nicholas Maduro. Guaido last month declared himself the interim head of state.

Earlier this month the United States proposed a draft Security Council resolution, which prompted Russia to propose a rival text that makes no reference to elections or aid. A revised U.S. draft, seen by Reuters, was circulated on Wednesday. It was unclear if Russia planned to put its text to a vote as well.

The U.S. draft asks U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to help ensure there is a free, fair and credible presidential election with international observers. It stresses the need to ensure the safety of all the members of Venezuela’s National Assembly.

The U.S. envoy on Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that he was concerned for Guaido’s safety upon his return to Venezuela.

Guaido crossed into Colombia on Saturday in preparation for efforts to move aid over the border to Venezuela. He then met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada, on Monday in Bogota.

The United States and dozens of other nations have recognised Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president, but Maduro still controls the military, state institutions and oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA [PDVSA.UL], which provides 90 percent of the country's export revenue.

The United States targeted Venezuela's government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of state-owned PDVSA after deadly violence blocked humanitarian aid from reaching the country over the weekend.

In Geneva, Venezuela Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council, suggested on Wednesday that Maduro and U.S. President Donald Trump meet to ""try to find common ground and explain their differences.""

Maduro also ""stands ready for dialogue"" with the Venezuelan opposition, he said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council is due to vote on Thursday on rival U.S. and Russian draft resolutions on Venezuela, diplomats said, with Washington's proposal calling for free and fair presidential elections and unhindered aid delivery.

The Russian draft text, seen by Reuters, expresses support for a political solution to the crisis and backs the Venezuelan government as the primary coordinator of international assistance efforts in the country.

A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to pass. Diplomats said the U.S. draft is likely to gain the minimum nine votes to force a likely Russian veto, while the Russian draft is expected to fail without the need for a U.S. veto.

74,Empty,2019-02-26T04:00:54Z,The win returns the riding to its Liberal roots after 11 years under NDP’s Tom Mulcair.,"MONTREAL—The NDP era in Outremont came to a close Monday as voters in this diverse urban riding returned to their long-standing tradition of electing Liberals to the House of Commons. Months after former NDP leader Tom Mulcair resigned the seat he held for 11 years, residents of this central swath of Quebec’s biggest city were on track to be represented again by a Liberal, according to late night results from Elections Canada.

Rachel Bendayan, a lawyer who ran as the “Team Trudeau” candidate here, thanked her family and campaign supporters in a victory speech at a Mile End lounge late Monday night. With all polls reporting, results showed she won just over 40 per cent of votes. The NDP came second with 26 per cent. “This victory wouldn’t be possible without you,” Bendayan said in French. “Today our voices were heard,” she said, stating that voters “spoke loud and proud in favour of Liberal values.”

Outremont is home to some 100,000 Montrealers in a riding that comprises the Côtes-des-Neiges neighbourhood, part of Mile End and portions of downtown Montreal near the centre of the island where the city is located. But while the riding was a Liberal stronghold for most of the 20th century, its more recent history has made it significant for New Democrats as well. Outremont became the party’s symbolic toehold in Quebec, when Mulcair won a 2007 byelection and successfully defended the seat the following year, marking the first time the NDP ever won a riding in the province in a general election.

Article Continued Below

Three years later, the “orange wave” surge of support in the province lifted the NDP to its best election result ever. Now that Mulcair is retired from political life — almost three years after he was turfed as leader following the party’s 2015 election defeat — local NDP candidate Julia Sanchez hoped to maintain the party’s grip in this diverse central Montreal riding. Polls in the province suggested her main foe in the byelection was Bendayan. A few hours before the polls closed Monday evening, Sanchez canvassed voters at a local metro station, and introduced herself to people in cafes and shops in the riding. “I got into this race because of how hugely important it is — Outremont — for the NDP,” she said. “All of that made it super exciting and important to me ... It’s not just any byelection.” David Coletto, chief executive officer of Abacus Data, said Monday’s result could be a bellwether for the party’s standing in the province, given that it is the first test in “the heart of the rise of the orange wave” since the last federal election. Their performance in Outremont — a multicultural district in the urban heart of Montreal — may signal whether the NDP’s allure to Quebec voters has faded under Jagmeet Singh’s leadership. Monday’s byelection was also the first time voters in Quebec cast ballots since the Bloc Québécois new leader, Yves-François Blanchet, took over last year. Michel Duchesne, an author who is the party’s candidate in Outremont, campaigned for the separatist party on a push to protect Quebec culture in the digital era. His background could help lift the Bloc in a riding that many artists call home, one NDP insider suggested. “If they come third or fourth, that’s a big problem,” Coletto said of the NDP, pointing out that more than a third of the party’s MPs in the Commons are from Quebec. “That’s something they’re going to have to somehow explain.” The Conservative candidate in the race was Jasmine Louras, a University of Ottawa law student. Daniel Green ran for the Green Party and James Seale campaigned for Maxime Bernier’s upstart People’s Party. Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

Sputnik News

00:43 26.02.2019(updated 01:40 26.02.2019)

The Lima Group on Monday asked the International Criminal Court (ICC) to make an assessment of the situation in crisis-torn Venezuela, proposing that Venezuela's partners help organize ""free elections"" in the country.

""We have decided to turn to the International Criminal Court with a request to take into account the grave humanitarian situation in Venezuela, the criminal violence of [Venezuelan President] Nicolas Maduro's regime against civilians and the denial of access to international aid, which is a crime against humanity"", the statement said.

Participants at the Lima Group meeting also stressed that the transition to ""democracy"" must be performed by Venezuelans themselves without the use of force and in line with the country's constitution.

""We call on the countries that continue to maintain partnership relations with Nicolas Maduro's illegitimate regime, to help find solutions that would open the way to a democratic transition and the holding of free, fair, transparent and credible elections"", the statement added.

Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called on the international community to join the Lima Group on the situation in Venezuela.

""It is important to invite more and more members of the international community, those who will participate with us in the expanded dialogue, so that they will join the actions that are made by us as the Lima Group and will support Venezuelans' efforts aimed at restoring democracy and hope"", the foreign minister said Monday.

On 5 January, lawmaker Juan Guaido was elected as the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which all other Venezuelan government branches have refused to recognize. On 23 January, two days after the Venezuelan Supreme Court annulled his election, Guaido declared himself the country's ""interim president"". Incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, who was sworn in for his second presidential term on 10 January after winning reelection in a contest partially boycotted by the opposition in May, qualified Guaido's move as an attempt to stage a coup orchestrated by Washington.

The United States immediately recognized Guaido, after which some 50 other countries followed suit. Russia, China, Cuba, Bolivia and a number of other states have, in the meantime, voiced their support for the legitimate government of constitutionally elected Maduro. Mexico and Uruguay have refused to recognize Guaido, declaring themselves neutral and promoting crisis settlement via dialogue.

US Vice President Mike Pence said in Colombia on Monday that the Trump administration was mulling new sanctions against Venezuela's government. Pence also urged Monday all Lima Group members to freeze the assets of Venezuela's oil giant PDVSA and restrict visas for Venezuelan officials. The US vice president also called on these countries to immediately transfer the ownership of Venezuelan assets from the government of incumbent President Nicolas Maduro to self-proclaimed Interim President Juan Guaido.

Earlier on Monday, the US Treasury Department sanctioned four Venezuelan governors.

The United States has imposed numerous rounds of sanctions on Venezuela. In January, Washington blocked around $7 billion in assets belonging to Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA. Maduro said that the restrictions were tantamount to illegal seizing.

The Lima Group of 14 countries was created in 2017 and currently seeks to end the political crisis in Venezuela. The group includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Guyana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Saint Lucia. The majority of the organization's member states are backing Guaido.

Last week, the German foreign ministry indicated its support for sanctions against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his inner circle, adding that the European Union, like the US, had already ""taken measures targeting certain members of the regime."" A government spokesman clarified that Berlin supported the extension of ""further sanctions"" against Caracas, and was ""in close contact"" with other European states on the issue.

Earlier, Germany condemned Venezuelan authorities' decision to block US humanitarian aid from entering Venezuela from Colombia and Brazil. In recent weeks, Caracas has repeatedly voiced fears that such 'aid' could be used as a Trojan horse with which the opposition could carry out a coup d'etat against the government.

In late January, Juan Guaido, leader of the semi-defunct National Assembly, proclaimed himself interim president shortly after Maduro's inauguration for a second term in office following elections in May 2018. The US, Canada, and several of Washington's regional allies immediately recognised Guaido as Venezuela's leader. Germany and several other European powers gave Caracas an eight-day deadline to hold snap elections, after which they too joined the US in recognising Guaido.

Glob…","NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is on his way to the House of Commons, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals are poised to make further gains in Quebec and Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives need to keep an eye on Maxime Bernier’s splinter movement, after by-elections Monday that took the political temperature in the country’s three largest provinces.

Mr. Singh won the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South with 39 per cent of the vote. Only a few months ago there were rumours that the NDP was trailing the Liberals in the riding; had he lost, Mr. Singh would have become the answer to an embarrassing trivia question.

But things ultimately went his way. The first nominated Liberal candidate, Karen Wang, was forced to withdraw, after predicting Chinese-Canadian voters would prefer her over a candidate of “Indian origin.” And the furor surrounding the resignation of Jody Wilson-Raybould from Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet dissipated whatever wisps of wind remained in Liberal sails.

Story continues below advertisement

The Grits took 26 per cent of the vote, Monday, well down from the 34 per cent they garnered in the 2015 election. How much did Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s resignation, and that of principal secretary Gerald Butts, push down the vote? That is a very large question.

The results in Burnaby South were worrying for the Conservatives, as well. At 23 per cent, they were down 4 percentage points from 2015, and the People’s Party, a new populist right-wing party led by the disaffected Tory Mr. Bernier, came in at 11 per cent. Had even some of the People’s Party vote gone to the Conservatives, they would have been in a strong second place, instead of trailing the Liberals.

But the Tories could feel much more reassured by the results in York-Simcoe. The riding, which sits on the northern edge of Greater Toronto, has been reliably Conservative since 2004, and Monday was another solid win.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh wins Burnaby South by-election, clearing key hurdle ahead of federal campaign

Conservative Scot Davidson held the vote at 54 per cent, while the Liberal vote slumped from 38 per cent in 2015 to 29 per cent Monday night. Even more encouraging for Mr. Scheer, the People’s Party sat at only 2 per cent, suggesting Mr. Bernier won’t be a factor in the fight for the 905, the large belt of suburban ridings surrounding the city of Toronto, named after its area code. The 905 almost always votes for the party that forms the government.

But there was also good news for the Liberals on Monday night – very good news indeed. The Montreal riding of Outremont had been a Liberal bastion before Thomas Mulcair snatched it away in a 2007 by-election for the New Democrats, foreshadowing the rise of the NDP and the collapse of the Liberals in Quebec.

But the Liberals surged back in Quebec in 2015, and their convincing victory in Outremont on Monday – they had 40 per cent of the vote – means not one of the NDP’s remaining 14 seats in the provinces is safe.

Did allegations of political interference by Mr. Trudeau and his advisers in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin help the Liberal cause in Quebec, where many jobs could be lost if the company suffered, and hurt it in English Canada? Expect a lot of entirely speculative punditry on this in the days ahead.

The Greens polled at 13 per cent in Outremont, half the NDP’s 26 per cent. Make of that what you will.

Story continues below advertisement

For the NDP, the news is both bitter and sweet. Sweet: Mr. Singh will finally be in the House of Commons. He will arrive with Justin Trudeau’s government staggering over the SNC-Lavalin affair, giving him a perfect opportunity to reboot his troubled leadership, only eight months before the next election.

Bitter: The New Democrats are no longer in the game in Quebec. The NDP appears destined to become again what it was before: a rump, a third place-place party in English Canada, and soon to be only a memory in Quebec.

Under Jack Layton and Tom Mulcair, New Democrats had hoped for so much more. Monday night’s results suggest that hope is lost.

It’s a hit that Hill is willing to take for now, but his understanding also comes with a caution flag for the president.

“We have patience, but we don’t have unlimited patience,” says Hill, who raises about 7,000 hogs a year near the central Iowa town of Cambridge.

The president’s willingness to pick trade fights with multiple trading partners at once has set off volleys of retaliatory tariffs, driving down the price of pork, corn and soybeans in political bellwether Iowa and elsewhere, and contributing to a 12 percent drop in net farm income nationally last year.

At issue are trade talks with China over intellectual property theft and a new U.S. deal with Canada and Mexico to replace NAFTA that is awaiting congressional approval. Those efforts could take months to complete. So scores of farm and business groups are pressing for quicker relief, a stopgap step to help them out until the more comprehensive trade agreements are resolved. They’re urging the administration to remove Canada and Mexico from the list of nations hit with a 25 percent tariff on steel shipped to the U.S. and a 10 percent tariff placed on aluminum. Their hope is that action would give the U.S. neighbors cause to remove retaliatory tariffs they placed on U.S. goods, such as a 20 percent levy Mexico placed on U.S.-produced hams.

So far, the administration hasn’t bit on that idea, but it dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Iowa this week to assure farmers that help is on the way.

For now, Trump is walking a political tightrope: Going to bat for steel and aluminum makers has endeared him to many voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania, where steel production is a matter of economic pride and legacy, but it could end up hurting him in ag-heavy states like Iowa and Wisconsin that backed him in 2016.

In Iowa, which casts the first votes of the presidential campaign season, state Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kauffmann said he’s surprised by how patient farmers have been with Trump. The Trump Agriculture Department did approve up to $12 billion in assistance to help compensate farmers caught up in the tariff battle.

“They all say it’s hurting,” Kauffman said of the trade disputes. “They’re all saying the stopgap relief was definitely not a cure-all, but they all understand what the president is trying to accomplish. It’s quite an interesting phenomenon.”

But the defeat of two Republican House lawmakers in last year’s midterm elections hints at some of the anxiety in farm country.

State Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price said the political climate in the state has changed since Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by 9 percentage points in 2016, in part because of trade.

“These tariffs are kind of a slow burn. People are getting more and more frustrated,” Price said. “It’s one of the reasons Donald Trump is going to lose Iowa in 2020.”

Some of the Democratic candidates for president are starting to differentiate themselves from Trump on trade when talking to Iowa voters. Sen. Kamala Harris of California has criticized the president’s “go it alone” attitude. Former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland says “we’re not going to succeed in the global economy by enacting protectionist policies.”

Still, some Democrats could have trouble seizing on the issue. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont spent much of the 2016 campaign railing against the very trade deals that Trump denigrated, calling them “disastrous” for blue-collar workers.

Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is among the lawmakers urging the Trump administration to lift the steel and aluminum tariffs on products brought in from Canada and Mexico. He said it’s a first step to getting the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement through Congress. He also said it would improve the financial picture for farmers.

“Unfortunately we’re starting to see more and more warning signs that farmers are running out of leeway with their bankers and landlords,” Grassley said.

Pompeo sought to calm some of those nerves Monday even as he warned that Chinese theft of technology affects agriculture, too.

“The good news is this — help is on the way,” Pompeo said. “American producers and Chinese consumers will both be better off. The outcome of President Trump’s trade negotiations currently under way will pay dividends for people in each of our two countries.”

Hill said he was encouraged by Pompeo’s remarks.

“I think people recognize, particularly with China, they have not been playing by the rules for a long time,” Hill said. “I think producers are supportive of trying to correct these issues. On the other hand, we don’t want it to go on forever.”

The American Farm Bureau Federation reports that Chapter 12 farm bankruptcies in the U.S. went down in 2018 compared with prior-year levels. But it also noted that farm debt is at a record high, and that lending standards are tighter and the cost of credit is rising.

“Certainly many farmers have liquidated assets to discharge debt. How much longer can many others endure remains a question,” the farm group said.",Farmer patience on tariffs comes with caution flag for Trump,Seattletimes.com,https://www.seattletimes.com/business/farmer-patience-on-tariffs-comes-with-caution-flag-for-trump/

US broadcaster Univision says its team was briefly detained in the Venezuelan presidential palace where they had been interviewing President Nicolás Maduro.

The incident happened after award-winning journalist Jorge Ramos showed Mr Maduro images of Venezuelans eating from a bin lorry, the network says.

Their equipment was confiscated.

Venezuela's Information Minister Jorge Rodríguez said the government had welcomed hundreds of journalists but it did not support ""cheap shows"".

The team was deported on Tuesday.

Univision, the leading Spanish-language TV network in the US, said the six-member crew had been released after almost three hours but that their recording and personal belongings had not been returned.

Speaking on Univision, Mr Ramos said Mr Maduro ""had not liked"" some of the questions about ""the lack of democracy in Venezuela, torture, political prisoners and the humanitarian crisis"".

""He got up after I showed him videos of young people eating out of a bin lorry,"" he said of the interview at the Miraflores palace in the capital, Caracas.

""What I told Nicolás Maduro is that millions of Venezuelans and many governments around the world don't consider him a legitimate president but a dictator.""

During their detention, Mr Ramos and Univision Vice President María Martínez were kept for ""a few minutes"" in a separate room where the lights were turned off, the broadcaster said.

Mr Ramos, a veteran Mexican-born American journalist, is known for his confrontational style of questioning. In 2015, he was thrown out of a news conference of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.

Natalie Southwick, Central and South America programme co-ordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said: ""By shutting down an interview and censoring one of Latin America's most high-profile reporters, Nicolás Maduro has demonstrated his fundamental disregard for the press.""

Last month, several local and foreign journalists were briefly detained while working in Caracas. Some ended up being deported.

On Twitter, Mr Rodríguez added: ""Hundreds of journalists have come through Miraflores who have received decent treatment that we always give to those who do journalistic work.""

Earlier, a group of Latin American countries and Canada said Mr Maduro was a threat to peace and security in the region and called for his immediate exit, a democratic transition and free elections.

Meeting in the Colombian capital, Bogotá, the Lima group urged the International Criminal Court to consider whether Venezuela was guilty of crimes against humanity for refusing to allow aid into the country.

At least two people died in Saturday's clashes between civilians and troops loyal to Mr Maduro that blocked the entrance of foreign aid organised by opposition leader and self-declared interim President Juan Guaidó.

Mr Maduro says the aid efforts are part of a US-orchestrated coup.

Following President Nicolás Maduro's inauguration for a disputed second term in January, the speaker of the opposition-dominated parliament, Juan Guaidó declared himself ""interim president"" of the country.

Guaidó was immediately recognised by the US, Canada and a group of Latin American conservative governments, who called upon the Venezuelan military to rise up against Maduro. The UK, France, Spain, Germany and other European countries also recognised Guaidó after Maduro rejected their demand for fresh elections. Paredes, who presented his credentials to President Hage Geingob at State House last week, said the situation is normal, while accusing external forces for attempting to cause political instability in Venezuela.

""If you visit the main cities in Venezuela, you can see people going to work, the kids going to school. Unfortunately, foreign forces are trying to create instability in the country,"" he told New Era and NBC in an interview.

""One of the topics I discussed with President Hage Geingob, who is also the Chairperson of Sadc [Southern African Development Community] was to thank him on behalf of the government of President Nicolás Maduro and the people of Venezuela for his brave and strong support,"" Paredes said.

Last month, Namibia added her voice to growing international concern over the situation in Venezuela, calling on the international community to allow the Venezuelans to resolve their internal issues in an amicable and peaceful manner.

Namibia's Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah at the time said the international community should allow the people of Venezuela to resolve their internal issues within the confines of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

""Namibia has been following with great concern the political developments in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The concern is that the political developments are arising from the unwarranted interference in the domestic affairs of Venezuela by foreign powers,"" Nandi-Ndaitwah said.

Paredes noted that Namibia's support is well received by the democratic institutions in Venezuela as it supports the truth, adding Maduro last year was elected with more than 67 percent of the voters in a process where more than a million people participated in the elections.

He said the African Union (AU) also send a delegation who validated the results. Hence, he said the position of the African countries was very important for the true democratic processes and respect of the international law and the United Nations charter. Since Guaidó's declaration, US President Donald Trump's administration has imposed new sanctions on Maduro's government, seized billions-worth of Venezuelan oil-related assets on US soil, and started making barely veiled threats of military intervention.

Paredes admitted that the country is experiencing hyperinflation due to economic blockade and sanctions imposed by unilateral position of the government of the United States.

According to him, the Venezuela economy has lost more than U$30 billion in the last few years. ""So please tell me which country in the world can resist an impact on their economy with such criminal blockade against our financial institutions and oil industry. That is why we are seeing the challenges in our economy. Despite, this situation, our government never stopped providing assistance to the poor people through social programmes in education, health, housing and in other sectors to stabilise our country,"" he noted.

Because of challenges emanating from the hyperinflation, more than three million Venezuelans are said to have fled the country, causing consternation across the continent.

On Saturday, clashes broke out in Venezuelan border towns, as government allegedly blocked humanitarian aid from crossing from Colombia and Brazil.

House homeland security committee chair Bennie Thompson said he wanted to use the hearing in part to give Nielsen the opportunity to start a ""serious discussion,"" rather than echoing Trump's claims of a security crisis at the border.

Nielsen, in her opening statement, called the situation at the border ""a real serious and sustained crisis.""

""No rational person would design an immigration system like we have today — it's dangerous for Americans, it's dangerous for migrants, it undermines our nation's values and it fails to uphold our fundamental obligations to the American people,"" she said.

Nielsen engendered controversy last year after denying the government was separating migrant children from their families. Her denials came even weeks after then Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in April 2018 that adults who crossed between ports of entry would be arrested and recommended for prosecution for illegally crossing, which is a misdemeanour, with their children held at separate facilities, many run by for-profit private companies.

The policy was panned by Democrats and some Republicans and rescinded by Donald Trump via executive order, but a flurry or lawsuits resulted. Previous congressional hearings have painted a picture of confusion and chaos at the border, with myriad agencies with a stake in the process — including Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services — not properly tracking who had been separated and or instituting a process on how to eventually reunite them.

Protests interrupt session

New York Democrat Kathleen Rice asked Nielsen why her first implementation guidelines as DHS secretary came a month after the Sessions announcement. Nielsen said the delay owed to the complexity of implementing the policy and the number of agencies involved.

""Kids should be with their families,"" Nielsen admitted, to a battery of questions from Illinois congresswoman Lauren Underwood about the traumatic effects for children of being separated from parents, but said the primary trauma being suffered was due to the arduous journey of hundreds of miles to the border.

The session Wednesday was interrupted twice within its first two hours by protesters.

Customs and Border Protection released Tuesday that indicated more than 76,000 migrants crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in February, more than double the number from the same period last year. Most were families coming in ever-increasingly large groups.

The system ""is well beyond capacity, and remains at the breaking point,"" U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said during a news conference Tuesday.

(Susan Walsh/Associated Press)

The new figures reflect the difficulties Trump has faced as he tries to cut down on illegal immigration, his signature issue. But it could also help him make the case that there truly is a national emergency at the border — albeit one built around humanitarian crises and not necessarily border security. The Senate is expected to vote next week and join the House in rejecting his national emergency declaration aimed at building border walls, but Trump would almost certainly veto the measure and the issue is likely to be settled in the courts.

Critics argue the administration's own policies are exacerbating the situation. Border officials have been limiting, or ""metering,"" the numbers who can submit an asylum claim at ports of entry, with the unintended consequence some then attempt to cross between border points.

Nielsen said metering was designed to ""ensure a safe and orderly flow"" of migrants given that facilities aren't equipped for large families, but New Mexico congresswoman Xochitl Torres Small, whose district includes the border with Mexico, suggested the approach may be diverting some migrants to the more dangerous routes between the ports of entry.

At one point, Thompson and Nielsen clashed over whether children had been put in cages.

Increase, but not historically high

Democrat Jim Langevin of Rhode Island produced a chart tracking the data since the 1970s. The number of apprehensions was about 400,000 over the last budget year, for example, compared with the high of 1.6 million in 2000.

Langevin called it ""inaccurate and deceitful to inflate numbers.""

""The president is just wrong,"" he said.

Nielsen said the overall number wasn't the only factor to consider, but the changing demographics of who's coming to the border.

Those apprehended used to be mostly single men from Mexico, but are now mostly families from Central America – since October, more than 130,000 families have been apprehended between ports of entry. From October through September 2018, about the same number of families was apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border. Tens of thousands of children illegally cross the border alone. While single men used to evade capture, the families are seeking out agents.

Nielsen said the administration would soon be announcing a compact on irregular migration with the Northern Triangle countries that are the source of most of the people — El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

Republicans on the committee sought to support Nielsen's contention there is a crisis, focusing many of their questions on drug seizures at the border, people-smugglers who prey on vulnerable migrants, and the MS-13 gang, which has its roots in El Salvador and the U.S.

To ease the migration burden, the administration has convinced Mexico to take in a few dozen migrants per day who are awaiting an answer to their U.S. asylum claims.

Mexico's ministry has said the actions taken by the Mexican and U.S. governments do not constitute a ""safe third-country"" scheme as exists between the U.S. and Canada. Mexico's ability to guarantee migrant safety are doubted given the country's issues with drug cartel and gang violence.

The so-called ""remain in Mexico"" approach the administration is trying to employ has been challenged in court.

""What you all are doing is not in the confines of the law,"" California congresswoman Nanette Barragan charged.

Trump has derided the process often followed by previous administrations, where those waiting on a decision for their asylum claim were released into the community. Many stayed on illegally in the U.S., staying in the country after an adverse ruling on their case or not showing up at all for their immigration court date, a process that can take months or even years.

Customs and Border Protection has said in the wake of the deaths of two children in custody that it has stepped up medical screenings. The agency also announced sweeping changes including more rigorous interviews as migrants come into the system.

Nielsen said the deaths of the two children were still under investigation.

Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh won a seat in the House of Commons, clearing a critical hurdle for his troubled leadership and triggering the start of an urgent effort to renew his caucus.

In his victory speech, Mr. Singh derided the Liberals and the Conservatives for presiding over a series of governments with a goal of enriching corporations while neglecting ordinary Canadians. He urged his supporters to hang on to the energy that they put into his winning campaign, noting they will need it for the upcoming federal election.

“I know it’s been a long slog, but I hope you have more left in the tank. We have just eight more months to let the people know they can choose a government that stands up for people and not corporations, that doesn’t give handouts to SNC-Lavalin,” Mr. Singh said in reference to the scandal currently enveloping the Liberals.

Mr. Singh secured 39 per cent of the vote, comfortably ahead of Liberal Richard T. Lee’s 26 per cent and Conservative Jay Shin’s 22 per cent.

Mr. Singh’s victory will help quell rumblings within his party over his future. Previous NDP leader Tom Mulcair said in January that it would be difficult for Mr. Singh to stay on as leader if he lost Burnaby South.

The former Ontario provincial politician has faced criticism about his seeming unfamiliarity with federal issues and his handling of internal caucus matters − particularly his decision to kick Saskatchewan MP Erin Weir out of caucus for alleged misconduct, which infuriated many NDP stalwarts in the province seen as the cradle of the party.

Under his leadership, the NDP has plunged to its lowest standings in public opinion polls since 2000, when it won just 13 seats. The party is mired in debt and its fundraising is sluggish. At least 11 of the 44 MPs who won seats for the party in 2015 have announced they won’t seek re-election this fall.

Despite Mr. Singh’s win, the party’s troubles were evident in another by-election result Monday: In a loss heavy with symbolism, the NDP was defeated in the Outremont riding they had held since 2007.

Liberal contender Rachel Bendayan held more than 42 per cent of the vote with two-thirds of the riding’s polls reporting results, with the NDP’s Julia Sanchez running second with just over 25 per cent.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Mr. Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 by-election. His victory turned Outremont into a beachhead for the NDP, which helped to launch the Orange Wave that swept the province in 2011 and boosted the party to Official Opposition status for the first time in its history. While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

Mr. Mulcair won the riding, but resigned in 2018 almost a year after Mr. Singh became NDP Leader.

Mr. Singh, brushed aside the loss in Outremont, saying the party “always knew” that contest was going to be tough.

But he said he will be heading to Quebec next week to talk about the NDP environment agenda, which he suggested may resonate in the province.

He also said voters in Quebec are as concerned as voters elsewhere in Canada about offshore tax havens, the government purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline and the access corporations like SNC Lavalin have had to the federal government.

“No one believes this is a good way to run a country,” he told a news conference following his victory speech.

Mr. Singh had said he was comfortable not being in Parliament while he worked on managing the party. But his view changed amid the party’s troubles. Earlier this month, the president of the Canadian Labour Congress said the NDP is struggling to reach members of the labour movement and Canadians in general.

Hassan Yussuff told The Canadian Press that Mr. Singh might find a “better groove” if he won a seat in the House of Commons.

Brad Lavigne, who helped orchestrate Jack Layton’s Orange Wave in 2011 as NDP campaign chief, said Sunday that victory in the by-election would be crucial for Mr. Singh’s efforts to unite the NDP before the federal election in the fall.

Mr. Lavigne said Mr. Singh poured considerable personal energy into the riding through extensive door-knocking and meetings with constituents. The riding has voted NDP in the past both federally and provincially.

With a win in hand, Mr. Lavigne said there is a lot of work in a short amount of time before the next federal election. Fundraising will be key, as well as building a team of candidates. Mr. Lavigne said Mr. Singh will have to “reintroduce himself” to the country and focus on key issues to form the underpinnings of the NDP campaign.

Mr. Singh’s Burnaby South win comes as the Liberals have been under fire over the scandal involving SNC-Lavalin and the cabinet resignation of former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould. Mr. Singh had called for a public inquiry into the situation.

Burnaby South was one of three by-elections called Jan. 9 by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In addition to Outremont, there was a by-election in York-Simcoe, north of Toronto.

Story continues below advertisement

The seat was left vacant by the retirement of Peter Van Loan, who had held the seat for the Conservatives since 2004. Conservative candidate Scot Davidson captured just over 50 per cent of the vote with a majority of polls reporting results to Liberal Shaun Tanaka’s 30 per cent.

In Burnaby South, Mr. Singh overcame challenges from Tory Mr. Shin, a corporate lawyer, and the Liberal Mr. Lee, a former Burnaby member of the provincial legislature representing the BC Liberals.

Mr. Lee replaced daycare operator Karen Wang, who stepped down after her campaign circulated social-media material highlighting Mr. Singh’s ethnic background.

The breakaway People’s Party of Canada, created last summer by one-time Tory leadership contender Maxime Bernier, faced its first electoral test in the by-elections and the results suggest it could be a spoiler that deprives the Conservatives of victory in tight contests.

While the fledgling party won less than two per cent of the vote in Outremont and York-Simcoe, it did surprisingly well in Burnaby South, where Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson won nearly 11 per cent of the vote after running on a campaign denounced as anti-immigration by her critics.

In the end, they did not have to wait long at all. Less than 90 minutes into the rally, the word came via Twitter.

“Already in our beloved country!” Mr Guaidó posted. “Venezuela, we have just passed immigration and we are heading to where our people are!”

Even to the faithful, the ease with which the self-declared president had entered Venezuelan territory had a sense of the miraculous. Having violated a travel ban when he left the country to lead the attempted entry of aid from Colombia, Mr Guaidó faced the threat of almost certain arrest by Nicolas Maduro's forces on his return.

Speculation had been rife as to how he would slip in - perhaps smuggled over a remote border in the boot of a car, or even through one of the notorious trenches used by coyotes and desperate refugees.

In the end, he took a commercial flight from Panama into Caracas's military-controlled Maiquetia airport, had his passport stamped, and walked out unchallenged to an arrivals hall erupting into cries of ""Yes we can!""

Speaking to the jubilant crowds in Caracas, Mr Guaidó seized on his smooth passage back to the capital as evidence that the chain of command was now broken.

Stern warnings from the US and others of consequences for Mr Maduro's government may also have had an effect. So too may have the presence at Maiquetia airport of 13 ambassadors, including those of France, Spain, the United States, Brazil, Chile and Canada.

But, despite Mr Maduro's insistence on Sunday night that the world would be witness to ""a Venezuela that confronts imperialist aggression"", his forces were notably absent from the Caracas rally.

After more than two months of near-daily protests in Khartoum and across Sudan, President Omar al-Bashir announced on the evening of February 22 a year-long state of emergency and dissolved the government. He postponed constitutional amendments allowing him to run for office again in 2020 but did not offer to step down.

In the following days, al-Bashir issued additional decrees outlawing protests, setting up emergency courts, and appointed loyal military men in key roles. Significantly, he appointed Ahmed Haroun, former governor of Northern Kordofan, as acting head of the ruling National Congress Party. Both Haroun and al-Bashir are wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged atrocity crimes in Darfur.

While the new government was purportedly established to help address Sudan’s economic crisis and appease critics, it has not ended the protests, nor the government’s abusive response. On the night of al-Bashir’s announcement, security forces raided a doctors’ residence in Khartoum, looted property, and arrested more than 50 people, according to the independent doctor’s syndicate. Two days later, they raided the University of Medical Studies and Technology, shot tear gas into the building, and beat and arrested students. On February 25, government forces shot at protesters, injuring three, the syndicate said.

Such reports are hardly a surprise. Since protests started in mid-December, security forces have consistently used excessive force, shooting live bullets and tear gas canisters at protesters, killing and injuring protesters, violently raiding homes, and brutally beating protesters and detainees. Many opposition figures, rights defenders, and activists are languishing in national security detention.

Now al-Bashir’s emergency courts are another tool for repression. Hastily-formed courts set up by chief justice Abdelmajid Idris on February 25 have convicted hundreds of people in summary trials – for crimes such as protesting and disseminating anti-government information – without due process or access to lawyers in many cases, witnesses told us.

And by courting them, the GOP can demonstrate that their principles are universal

In November 2015, then-radio-host Stephen Bannon was interviewing then-presidential-candidate Donald Trump. During the interview, Trump expressed concern that, owing to American immigration laws, many foreign students attending elite American universities were being forced to return home after graduation. “We have to be careful of that, Steve,” said Trump. “You know, we have to keep our talented people in this country.”

“Um,” Bannon replied.

“I think you agree with that,” Trump added. “Do you agree with that?”

Bannon paused, and said, “When two-thirds or three-quarters of the CEOs in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia, I think . . . A country is more than an economy. We’re a civic society.”

The Bannon–Trump exchange highlights the most significant division within the conservative movement today.

In one camp are demographic pessimists such as Bannon. They presume that Americans of non-European heritage are hostile to conservatism and think we should oppose the increasing racial diversification of America because it will move the country to the left.

In the other camp are demographic optimists. They believe that conservative values are universal values, shared by people of all races, and that non-European immigrants can add substantial value to America. They argue that the conservative movement must find a way to attract members of minority groups if it is to live up to its universal moral claims and thrive in a more diverse America.

One oft-ignored group will determine who wins this debate: Asian Americans.

Asian Americans are a diverse lot, representing many different nationalities, races, cultures, and religions. But in general, they favor free enterprise, traditional family values, and a vigorous foreign policy. And yet Asians are increasingly turning away from the Republican party and identifying with the Left. Why?

The loyalty of blacks — and the growing allegiance of Hispanics — to the Democratic party is widely discussed in conservative and Republican circles. Some conservatives have concluded that it is futile to court these voters because, it is said, prevailing trends in their communities are culturally and economically incompatible with conservative values.

Black and Hispanic voters suffer from higher rates of poverty, goes the theory, and therefore have an economic interest in supporting the expansion of the welfare state. Furthermore, illegitimate births have become more common in black and Hispanic households, a trend that — again, according to the theory — makes blacks and Hispanics uninterested in conservative family values.

“Illegitimacy has become completely normalized among [social workers’] Hispanic clients,” wrote Heather Mac Donald, author of The Diversity Delusion, in a 2006 article for National Review. “Far from exercising a brake on the erosion of traditional values, . . . the growing Hispanic population will provide the impetus for more government alternatives to personal responsibility.”

A related — but somewhat contradictory — argument made by the pessimists is one of civilizational incompatibility: that non-European immigrants are fundamentally ill equipped to uphold American values. By this logic, it doesn’t matter whether families are intact or incomes are low. As Steve Bannon put it in his radio interview, it’s not merely the non-European immigrants from broken or low-income homes who undermine “civic society,” but also the wealthy, married, capitalist ones.

Similarly, Michael Anton, writing under a pseudonym for the Claremont Review of Books, has argued that “the ceaseless importation of Third World foreigners with no tradition of, taste for, or experience in liberty means that the electorate grows more left, more Democratic, less Republican, less republican, and less traditionally American with every cycle.”

Laura Ingraham, on her Fox News show, said, “In some parts of the country, it does seem that the America that we know and love doesn’t exist anymore. Massive demographic changes have been foisted upon the American people. And they’re changes that none of us ever voted for and most of us don’t like. From Virginia to California, we see stark examples of how radically in some ways the country has changed. . . . This is exactly what socialists like [Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez want: eventually diluting and overwhelming your vote with the votes of others, who aren’t — let’s face it — too big on Adam Smith and the Federalist Papers. . . . This is a national emergency.”

These two ideas are powerful in conservative circles in part because they are self-flattering. Our inability to attract minority groups, we tell ourselves, is due to the moral superiority of our values and their lack of interest in self-reliance, hard work, and family formation.

Demographic pessimists of the 19th and early 20th centuries made similar arguments about German, Irish, Italian, and Eastern European immigrants. Back then, those countries were not suffused with democracy or individual liberty or economic freedom; that is, after all, why millions left for America in the first place. The same holds true today for so many immigrants to the U.S. who flee authoritarian countries precisely because they crave political and economic liberty.

But plenty of Asians come to America from democratic countries. South Korea and Japan rank higher than the United States on The Economist’s “Democracy Index,” which grades countries on civil liberties and tolerance for political opponents. India has been a parliamentary democracy since 1948 — that is to say, for significantly longer than Spain, Portugal, East Germany, and Poland. Hong Kong, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and Taiwan all rank higher than the United States on the Heritage Foundation’s 2019 “Index of Economic Freedom.”

Indeed, Asian Americans provide a test case for the claims of the demographic pessimists. Is Bannon right that Asians are too different from Europeans to contribute to our society? Or are conservatives in part responsible for the Left’s growing appeal among Asians?

In just two generations, Asian Americans have become America’s most successful ethnic group. As a share of the U.S. population, Asians have grown from barely 1 percent in the early 1960s to more than 6 percent today. Between the 2000 and 2010 censuses, the Asian-American population grew by nearly 50 percent. The Asian vote is now large enough to swing elections in Virginia and Nevada.

If conservative values really are the values of family, personal responsibility, education, and hard work, the most conservative demographic group in America is Asians. The divorce rate for non-Hispanic whites is 40 percent; for Asians, it is 21 percent. The teen birth rate for whites is 17 percent; for Asian Americans, it is 8 percent. The illegitimacy rate for whites is 29 percent; for Asian Americans, it is 16 percent.

Asians also value merit and hard work, just as conservatives do. Take educational attainment: Thirty-six percent of white Americans have a college degree, while 54 percent of Asian Americans do. Asian families push their children hard to score at the top of standardized tests and achieve sterling grade-point averages. They rightly prize the great benefits of being educated at our world-beating universities. Opposition to race-based affirmative action at Harvard University, the University of California, and New York City schools has brought out Asians in support of conservative arguments for meritocracy and against race-based quotas.

Asian Americans are among the most successful participants in the American economy; they compose the highest-earning ethnic group in the United States, and one of the highest-educated. In 2015, median household income for whites was $63,000 a year. For Asians, it was $77,000.

Asians are more likely than whites to run a small business. When Asian families immigrate to the United States, they may at first lack proficiency in the English language or American social skills. They will not have immediate entrée into our elite cultural institutions or corporate networks. So they will often run motels, dry cleaners, convenience stores, and restaurants as a way to support themselves and their families. If the natural home of hard-working, tax-paying, family-forming Americans is the GOP, Asians should be voting overwhelmingly for Republicans.

And yet Asians have become a loyal component of the Democratic party. In the 1980s and 1990s, Asian Americans voted Republican. George H. W. Bush won the Asian vote in 1992 over Bill Clinton, 55–31. Bob Dole also beat Bill Clinton for the Asian vote, 48–43. But during the era of Barack Obama, Asians turned decisively away from the Republican party. In the 2012 elections, 76 percent of Asian voters turned out for President Obama: a higher proportion than did so among Hispanics, Jews, or single women, and second only to that of African Americans. In 2016, two-thirds of all Asian voters supported Hillary Clinton, again the second-highest proportion among demographic groups.

Democrats have rewarded this overwhelming support with an intransigent defense of policies that explicitly or implicitly discriminate against Asians. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the disheartening use of race by elite universities to suppress Asian achievement.

In the early 20th century, Ivy League schools found that the use of admissions tests was leading to a rise in Jewish matriculants. By 1922, Jewish students constituted nearly 22 percent of Harvard College, up from 7 percent in 1900. This led to alarm among university administrators. Harvard president Abbott Lawrence Lowell sought to rectify this “problem” by developing a “holistic” admissions process that deemphasized test scores. “We can reduce the number of Jews by talking about other qualifications than those of admission examinations,” Lowell wrote, expressing the view that the ideal proportion of Jews was about 15 percent.

Harvard and other universities changed their attitude toward Jews after World War II. As Americans learned of the Holocaust, it became untenable for universities to continue to discriminate against Jews in their admissions practices. But elite universities never dropped the “holistic” admissions system. Today, that system is used against Asian Americans.

Under the pressure of a lawsuit, Harvard disclosed in summer 2018 that Asians would make up 43 percent of the student body if academic considerations alone dictated admissions. This seems about right, given external statistics. In 2012, Asians represented 13 percent of California’s population but 59 percent of California’s National Merit semifinalists: those whose scores on the PSAT were in the top 0.5 percent of all test-takers. In Texas, in 2010, Asians were 3.8 percent of the population but more than 25 percent of the National Merit semifinalists.

But even though, on average, Asians rated the highest in Harvard’s admissions system for academics and extra-curricular activities, they also had the lowest score for “personality,” which includes traits such as “humor, sensitivity, grit, [and] leadership.” This is “holistic” admissions at work.

By dinging Asian applicants’ personalities, Harvard was able to limit Asians to 26 percent of the class; the college then made “demographic” adjustments, which further limited the Asian proportion to 23 percent.

Moreover, Asians are a rapidly growing share of the U.S. population and of the highest-achieving college applicants. But their share of the Harvard freshman class has remained magically constant for decades, ranging from 17 to 19 percent. In other words, if Harvard is not discriminating against Asians, Asians’ personalities have deteriorated over time to make up for their rising academic achievement.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld Harvard’s racially discriminatory “holistic” system; every Supreme Court justice appointed by Bill Clinton or Barack Obama has voted to support race-based admissions programs in the name of “diversity.” These Democratic appointees have been joined by enough Republicans to maintain the anti-Asian status quo.

Democratic legislators have also supported anti-Asian policies, especially in education. Democrats in California, for example, have sought repeatedly to overturn Proposition 209, which is the only law preventing state universities such as Berkeley and UCLA from resuming the use of race to suppress Asian admissions. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has proposed ending the sole use of standardized testing to determine entrance into magnet schools such as Stuyvesant and Bronx Science, where Asians now constitute more than two-thirds of the student body. Calling the racial demographics of these schools a “monumental injustice,” the mayor declared: “Can anyone defend this? Can anyone look the parent of a Latino or black child in the eye and tell them their precious daughter or son has an equal chance to get into one of their city’s best high schools?” When Asian groups protested, Richard Carranza, the city’s schools chancellor, responded, “I just don’t buy into the narrative that any one ethnic group owns admissions to these schools.”

While school admissions is a top-tier issue for Asians, disregarding it is not the only way in which Democratic leaders take Asian voters for granted. Although Asians earn high incomes and run the small businesses that suffer the most from growing government, Democrats have aggressively resisted Republican tax cuts and the Trump administration’s deregulation initiative.

But Republicans deserve much of the blame for this state of affairs. Like past immigrants, many Asians first land in our largest cities: the ones that conservative pundits sometimes exclude from “the real America.” The Republican party no longer seriously contests elections in the inner cities as it did in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when many Irish, Italians, and Eastern Europeans immigrated to the U.S. Asian Americans who rely on municipal government for safe streets, business licenses, and good schools may never meet a serious Republican politician. At naturalization ceremonies throughout the U.S., where new citizens pledge their allegiance to the flag, representatives from the Democratic Party are usually waiting outside to register them to vote. Republicans rarely are. It would come as no surprise if these immigrants — especially those who have fled authoritarian governments — got involved in local Democratic parties that appear to be their only avenue for civic engagement.

But the tension between Asians and conservatives may run deeper. For half a century, opponents of the Right have alleged that, while conservatives and Republicans claim to support universal values, in reality the Right’s agenda is racist and sectarian.

Immigrants from Korea and China are among America’s most fervent Evangelical Christians, but immigrants from India are more likely to be Hindu or secular in background. It is quite apparent to these communities that there are conservatives who view them with suspicion because their ancestry is not European or their faith not Christian, or simply because their rapid success has surpassed that of other Americans whose families have been here longer.

For demographic optimists within the conservative movement — those who wish to show that ordered liberty is a universal principle that can make life better for everyone — Asian Americans represent an ideal opportunity. A conservative and Republican coalition that includes Asians will gradually learn how to talk about its principles in a way that appeals to both nonwhites and non-Christians. Asians, in this way, could help Republicans learn how to appeal to all minorities.

On the flip side, it is hard to see how, if they cannot bring Asian Americans into their coalition, conservatives will ever rise above the perception — or reality — that their movement is solely a vehicle to advance white interests.

But if conservatives and Republicans are to win back the Asian vote, they must refresh their policy agenda and reform their political culture.

First, they should go beyond simple distaste for race-based affirmative action and prioritize the enactment of a workable replacement. It would be far more faithful to the Constitution to give an advantage to university applicants with lower socioeconomic status than to employ race-based quotas. It would also be more fair. While socioeconomic preferences might adversely affect high-income Asians relative to a purely academic standard, Asians would recognize that such an approach does not discriminate against their children on the basis of skin color. It would also not insult them, as does race-based affirmative action, by assuming that all Asians are monolithic in their views or experiences. Socioeconomic-status-based affirmative action would reinforce America’s openness to merit and hard work and better reward those who overcame obstacles presented by poverty or family breakdown. Conservatives should be the ones upholding the principle that hard work and talent are more important than accidents of birth, wealth, or social networks.

Second, conservatives should learn from Canada and Australia and embrace a skills-based approach to immigration. Many Asians oppose illegal immigration for the same reasons that conservatives do: Most Asians came here legally and see illegal immigration as unfair — to them. But Bannon-style restrictionists who seek to suppress all immigration — both legal and illegal — drive Asians away.

Conservatives may disagree about what the right scale of legal immigration would be. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the United States admits roughly 1 million people a year as permanent resident aliens. While some pessimists want to reduce that number to zero, many optimists ask: Would the character of a country of 325 million people really change if we admitted 2 million instead of 1?

Since pessimists and optimists still have to live together in the conservative movement and the Republican party, it would be best not to argue over the scale of legal immigration to the U.S. but rather to at least maintain it at current levels. Such a compromise would allow conservatives to focus on improving the quality of the immigrants the U.S. legally admits.

As Reihan Salam argues in his recently published book Melting Pot or Civil War: A Son of Immigrants Makes the Case against Open Borders, conservatives should urge a shift away from family-based immigration — which currently dominates federal policy — and toward an emphasis on immigrants’ ability to support themselves and their families without relying on the safety net. This would help improve the economic welfare of those already here.

President Trump was on to something when he told Bannon that the U.S. ought to change policy to persuade foreigners who receive advanced degrees at American universities to stay. In his book, Salam reviews evidence showing that the most self-sufficient immigrants are those with college and graduate degrees. Conservatives should support offering permanent residence, with a pathway toward citizenship, to every law-abiding foreigner who graduates from a U.S. college or university.

Conservatives could similarly advance preferences for those who serve in the U.S. armed forces, help our troops or diplomats abroad, or offer important economic skills. The Association of American Medical Colleges predicts that we will have a shortage of 40,000 to 120,000 doctors by 2030; the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a shortage of 1.1 million nurses; placement firms estimate that 3 million available STEM jobs are going unfilled. If our nation suffers from shortages of doctors, nurses, engineers, computer scientists, teachers, and emergency responders, conservatives should deploy the immigration system to help meet those needs. Otherwise, that knowledge and skill will stay abroad, where it may even benefit our foreign rivals.

In purely demographic terms, both the optimists and the pessimists are right. A Republican party composed solely of white voters will not survive the 21st century. Even if the U.S. were to enact what many pessimists fantasize about — a total moratorium on future immigration — it would make little difference. Since 2013, the majority of new births in America have been to minority or mixed-race parents. Generation Z and whatever we end up calling the generations that follow will all grow up in an ethnically and racially diverse America, as Millennials already have.

If the conservative movement and the Republican party want to attract Asians, the most important thing is to want to include Asians in their coalition. Playing hard-to-get doesn’t work in politics the way it does in romance. Conservatives often act as if it were up to members of minority groups to realize how wonderful conservatism is on their own. In the real world, it is conservatives’ job to make the case to black, Hispanic, and Asian voters that conservative policies will improve their lives.

Canada provides a roadmap for how the Right can build a coalition that includes Asian immigrants. In 2006, Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper convinced one of his deputies, Jason Kenney, to take on the party’s immigration portfolio in Parliament. Kenney’s orders: Help integrate new immigrants into Canadian culture and into the Conservative party. “I understood that I would have to be everywhere at all times,” Kenney has recalled. “Personal contact is crucial for new immigrants.”

Kenney spent the next decade crisscrossing the country, meeting with Korean community leaders in Vancouver one day, Sikh celebrants in Ontario the next, and Chinese immigrants in Ottawa the day after that. In 2009, a Chinese shopkeeper caught a shoplifter in the act and tied him up before calling the police. After the thief was arrested, he had the gumption to file assault charges against the shopkeeper, for tying him up. Kenney learned about the controversy by reading Chinese-language newspapers. In response, he helped draft a bill allowing shopkeepers to use “reasonable force” against thieves and intruders.

The newest Canadians, Kenney learned, were culturally more conservative than the average Canadian of European stock. And they wanted, above all, to be heard: to be treated as if their concerns were of equal importance to those of other voters. Because the natural predisposition of politicians is to focus on existing constituencies rather than new ones, those such as Kenney, who did focus on new constituents, won their loyalty. Immigrants in Toronto’s suburbs drove Conservatives to a sweeping victory in Canada’s 2011 federal elections.

The addition of immigrants to the Canadian conservative coalition didn’t hand Tories a permanent majority. Harper and company lost in 2015 to Justin Trudeau’s Liberals. But the Conservative party of Canada has shown how, contrary to claims of pessimists in America, non-European immigrants can strengthen conservatism in a Western nation. Kenney and colleagues didn’t appeal to Asians by moving left but by applying conservative principles to the problems that Asian Canadians were facing.

Just as with the Conservatives in Canada, the survival of the GOP hinges on its ability to attract a more diverse electorate. But as we have seen, American pessimists are not persuaded by arguments of practical politics. They argue that it will not profit the GOP to gain the minority vote but lose its European soul.

The Republican party, however, was founded in 1854 to establish the principle of liberty and justice for all Americans, regardless of race. It was a remarkable principle, given the practical politics of the time. Republicans, in effect, were promising to diminish the economic and political power of whites — that is to say, voters — in order to liberate nonvoting blacks from slavery.

In recent years, Republicans have lost their connection to that tradition. It is a problem they can overcome with a well-considered reform agenda and by doing the humble and uncomfortable work of courting people who are different from them. But most of all, it requires the conviction that conservative values can improve the lives of Americans of all races and creeds, and that Americans of non-European ancestry have just as much at stake in the survival of liberty as do the sons and daughters of the American Revolution.

As recently as the 1980s, these views were conventional among Republicans. Ronald Reagan, in his last speech as president, said, “I think it’s fitting to leave one final thought, an observation about the country which I love. It was stated best in a letter I received not long ago. A man wrote me and said: ‘You can go to live in France, but you cannot become a Frenchman. You can go to live in Germany or Turkey or Japan, but you cannot become a German, a Turk, or Japanese. But anyone, from any corner of the earth, can come to live in America and become an American.’”

This is the principle that once made America exceptional. Is it still?

""We can make adjustments to that each year as we see the progress of the stores opening,"" she said.

James said the discrepancy was due to delays in legalization from the federal government and municipal elections across B.C. which put new permits for pot shops on hold.

""We've seen a delay in opening of stores and that obviously impacts the revenue,"" she said.

Venezuela is currently going through a political crisis. On 5 January, lawmaker Juan Guaido was elected as the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which all other government branches have been refusing to recognize in 2016. On 23 January, two days after the Venezuelan Supreme Court annulled his election, Guaido declared himself the country's ""interim president"". Incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, who was sworn in for his second presidential term on 10 January after winning the May election, which part of the opposition boycotted, qualified Guaido's move as an attempt to stage a coup orchestrated by Washington.

The United States immediately recognized Guaido, after which some 50 other countries followed suit. Russia, China, Cuba, Bolivia and a number of other states have, in the meantime, voiced their support for the legitimate government of Maduro. Mexico and Uruguay have refused to recognize Guaido, declaring themselves neutral and promoting crisis settlement via dialogue.

AT THE BORDER -- “Border Patrol Facilities Put Detainees With Medical Conditions at Risk,” by NYT’s Sheri Fink and Caitlin Dickerson in McAllen, Texas: “An average of 2,200 migrants a day are now crossing the nation’s 1,900-mile border with Mexico, many after grueling journeys that leave them injured, sick or badly dehydrated. Yet most of the nation’s Customs and Border Protection facilities along the border lack sufficient accommodations, staffing or procedures to thoroughly assess health needs or provide more than basic emergency care, a situation that has led to dangerous medical oversights.

“Six adults died in C.B.P. custody in the fiscal year ending in October, at least three of whom had a medical emergency shortly after being apprehended. … A New York Times review of records and dozens of interviews with migrants, agents, researchers and health workers suggest that some of these deaths were not anomalies, but rather signs of entrenched problems that have repeatedly put detainees with medical conditions at risk.” NYT

SPY GAMES -- “Chinese Hackers Target Universities in Pursuit of Maritime Military Secrets,” by WSJ’s Dustin Volz: “Chinese hackers have targeted more than two dozen universities in the U.S. and around the globe as part of an elaborate scheme to steal research about maritime technology being developed for military use, according to cybersecurity experts and current and former U.S. officials.

“The University of Hawaii, the University of Washington and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are among at least 27 universities in the U.S., Canada and Southeast Asia that Beijing has targeted, according to iDefense, a cybersecurity intelligence unit of Accenture Security. The research, to be published this week, is the latest indication that Chinese cyberattacks to steal U.S. military and economic secrets are on the rise.” WSJ

CLIMATE FILES -- NPR’S REBECCA HERSHER and ROBERT BENINCASA: “How Federal Disaster Money Favors The Rich”: “Disasters are becoming more common in America. … According to the 2018 National Climate Assessment, climate change is already driving more severe droughts, floods and wildfires in the U.S. And those disasters are expensive. The federal government spends billions of dollars annually helping communities rebuild and prevent future damage.

“But an NPR investigation has found that across the country, white Americans and those with more wealth often receive more federal dollars after a disaster than do minorities and those with less wealth. Federal aid isn't necessarily allocated to those who need it most; it's allocated according to cost-benefit calculations meant to minimize taxpayer risk. Put another way, after a disaster, rich people get richer and poor people get poorer. And federal disaster spending appears to exacerbate that wealth inequality.” NPR

2020 WATCH -- MICHAEL GRUNWALD in POLITICO MAGAZINE: “How the 2020 Democrats Learned To Love Ethanol”: “Democrats still seem to think they can revive their brand in farm country by pledging allegiance to the government’s longstanding efforts to prop up ethanol. Iowa is America’s top ethanol producer, with 44 plants that help support more than 40,000 jobs, and so far none of the Democrats competing there have broken the faith. …

“It might seem counterintuitive that Democratic candidates would focus more on rural voters who are trending Republican than environmental voters who are key to their base. But support for ethanol is a top priority for agricultural communities, while opposition to ethanol is far down the list of priorities for environmental groups. And Iowa political operatives believe that because Democrats have done so badly in the economically depressed rural areas that helped Trump flip their state red in 2016, they feel even greater political pressure to embrace ethanol in 2020.” POLITICO Magazine

Pakistan was not invited for the lunch in view of the current India-Pakistan tensions. …","New Delhi: Ahead of Lok Sabha elections, top Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh shared the party's economic and political vision with ambassadors of G20 member-countries at a meet, during which the Pulwama attack and the subsequent developments were also discussed.

The Pakistan high commissioner was not invited to the meet in New Delhi which was attended by the ambassadors of the United States and China, the UK high commissioner among others, Congress leaders said.

They said the Congress president met the ambassadors of G20 countries in India, besides those of neighbouring countries, and discussed with them issues of regional, global, strategic and economic importance.

Sources said the Pulwama attack and the consequent air strikes were also learnt to have been discussed during the meeting, as the diplomats were curious about how the developments will play out in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. They also sought to know its effect on the stability of the region.

The meet, held at a local hotel, was earlier slated for 15 February and had been cancelled in the wake of the Pulwama terror attack on 14 February.

Rahul later tweeted that he enjoyed the exchange of ideas and looked forward to continuing the dialogue with the envoys.

Senior Congress leader and former minister Anand Sharma — who heads the Congress' foreign affairs department, and was the host — said there were requests from heads of various missions for a meeting with the Congress leadership and this was the best structured way to engage. ""It was a meaningful engagement and a good meeting where global, regional, political and economic matters were discussed,"" Sharma said after the meeting.

Rahul, Manmohan and other senior leaders held discussions with the ambassadors on the current geopolitical situation, he said. Pakistan was not invited for the lunch in view of the current India-Pakistan tensions, the sources said.

However, the sources said, the envoys of various countries did talk about the Pulwama attack and its implications and the government's response.

The Congress chief is learnt to have responded by saying that while the party stood with the government on the issue, it was opposed to politicisation of national security issues, the sources said.

The Congress president also shared his party's vision, including its economic and industrial policies, for revival of agriculture sector and jobs creation, ahead of general elections, Sharma said.

Rahul is learnt to have first interacted with the ambassadors jointly for half an hour and then sat down at each table and shared his thoughts with them separately. The meeting lasted for almost three hours.

The Congress chief also made it clear to the diplomats that the party is committed and united in carrying forward the fight against terrorism.

Among the neighbouring countries whose diplomats were present at the luncheon meeting were Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

The ambassadors of the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey attended the meet.

Senior Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and some other like former Union minister Manish Tewari and Bhubaneshwar Kalita were also present besides former national security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon, former Indian ambassador to the US and Germany Meera Shankar, former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Sharat Sabharwal and former high commissioner to Bangladesh Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty.

The ambassadors of Brunei, Dominican Republic and Romania, who head regional groups of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Group of Latin America and the Caribbean (GRULAC) and Europe, also attended the meet.

93,Empty,2019-03-04T05:00:00Z,"In business as well as international politics, the best and ideal agreement is one that is credible and expected to be complied with. Compliance often necessitates trade sanctions or other sufficiently severe consequences for those parties that do not comply …","In business as well as international politics, the best and ideal agreement is one that is credible and expected to be complied with. Compliance often necessitates trade sanctions or other sufficiently severe consequences for those parties that do not comply as promised.

So what explains the logic behind why most existing international environmental agreements are weak and without sufficiently strong sanctions? As an example, countries that emitted excessively under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol were asked to compensate by cutting emissions more in the future but faced no additional sanctions if they didn't. And in late December 2018, negotiators met in Katowice, Poland, to discuss the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change but failed to take advantage of the possibility to introduce sanctions on noncompliers.

Why does this continue to happen? A new political economy analysis forthcoming in the Journal of Political Economy shows that domestic policymakers may not have sufficient incentives to negotiate efficient treaties. In ""The Political Economy of Weak Treaties,"" authors Marco Battaglini and Bard Harstad explain that: ""When a treaty is weak and not fully enforced, voters are uncertain whether the obligations will be met and they forecast that compliance hinges on whether they elect the incumbent or a political challenger."" The political incumbent can always turn this contingency to their advantage, they show.

When the treaty is weak, a relatively ""green"" party with more environmentally friendly preferences than the median voter may prefer to comply, while a relatively ""brown"" party will not. Thus, a green incumbent prefers to negotiate a weak treaty that is attractive to the median voter, but not to the brown challenger, so that the voters must reelect the incumbent to see the treaty being implemented. Likewise, a brown incumbent prefers a treaty so weak and so costly that the median voter prefers to elect the brown party, which will not comply, rather than the more environmentally friendly green party, who would comply regardless. In either case, the incumbent improves the reelection chances by negotiating some kind of weak treaty, because only weak treaties differentiate the competing candidates.

This reasoning implies that state leaders who face elections (in contrast to dictators) prefer to sign many treaties as long as the treaties are likely to be weak and essentially ineffective. The study finds that democratic countries do sign more treaties but the effect of a treaty on emission cuts is smaller than for other countries.

When American Vice President Al Gore negotiated ambitious emission cuts on behalf of the US in the late 1990s, the commitments were not strongly enforced and the next president could easily walk away from the treaty, which he did. The authors explore similar stories from Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. ""In many of these cases, sacrificing the climate can have been motivated by reelection concerns,"" the authors note.

REUTERS/Luisa Gonzalez

The United States targeted Venezuela’s government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of its state-owned oil company PDVSA after deadly violence blocked humanitarian aid from reaching the country over the weekend.

As Colombia’s foreign minister warned about “credible threats to the life” of Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaido, the Trump administration also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking it to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the United States.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogota as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Guaido met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the political and economic crisis in Venezuela.

Pence said the United States would stand by Guaido until freedom was restored. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA’s assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Maduro’s “henchmen” to Guaido’s government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming against the OPEC member.

“In the days ahead … the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime’s corrupt financial networks,” Pence said. “We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.”

While the day presented a united regional front against Maduro, who is widely accused of coming to power through fraudulent elections, there was no clear sign that the latest measures would succeed in pushing him toward the exit.

‘CREDIBLE THREATS’

On a day that began with Guaido urging “all options” to be considered to remove Maduro, the threat of military intervention seemed if anything weaker after the meeting.

Guaido, sitting next to Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the “massacre” of the weekend.

Guaido himself could be in danger from the Maduro regime, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said, speaking on behalf of the Lima Group.

“There’s information about serious and credible threats to the life and integrity of Juan Guaido and his family, as well as to his wife’s family. From Bogotá, we want to hold the usurper Maduro responsible for any violent action against Guaido, against his wife and against their relatives,”

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during protests and clashes on Saturday as U.S.-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

In a joint statement at the close of the meeting, the Lima Group said Maduro was a threat to peace and security in the region and called for his immediate exit, a democratic transition and free elections.

Guaido, recognized by most Western nations as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider “all options” in ousting Maduro.

But the Lima Group said it “reiterates the conviction that the transition to democracy must be conducted by the Venezuelans themselves peacefully and within the framework of the Constitution and international law,” the statement said.

CALL FOR AMNESTY

Pence repeated an earlier statement that there would be an amnesty for members of the armed forces who throw their support behind Guaido. He said he hoped Maduro and those supported by his “corruption and his brutality” will leave Venezuela peacefully.

“We make clear to them that we will support the interim president’s call for amnesty, an inclusive government, an inclusive future for members of the armed forces, who have laid down their arms and stand with the Guaido government,” Pence said.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the United States is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela Martinez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region’s other powers in embracing Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful president.

“We believe there can be no bystanders, no one on the sidelines of this, particularly in our hemisphere,” Pence said.

Washington wants the 15-member U.N. Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela’s energy sector and back Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Soldiers and armed groups loyal to Maduro blocked a convoy of trucks with food and medicines during the weekend. Maduro says the aid efforts are part of a U.S.-orchestrated coup.

At least 167 members of Maduro’s armed forces have deserted since Saturday and more are expected to flee across the border to Colombia.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Maduro’s government last week. Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighboring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has suffered years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as “trochas” generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as “trocheros.”

“We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,” said Belkis Garcia, 34, walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. “We have to pay (to cross), so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don’t know what will happen if the border continues closed.”

The Lima Group said it would ask the International Criminal Court to consider “the serious humanitarian situation in Venezuela, the criminal violence of Nicolas Maduro’s regime against the civilian population, and the denial of access to international assistance.”

According to Canadian media, among other accusations, SNC-Lavalin is under investigation into alleged payments of nearly $48 million to public officials in Libya between 2001-2011 to influence local government decisions.

Canada's opposition leader, heading the Conservative Party, Andrew Scheer called on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resign. The scandal around the Trudeau administration has resulted in an uproar among lawmakers who held emergency debates on the situation late Thursday.

© AP Photo / Evan Vucci Canadian PM Trudeau Rejects Calls to Resign Over SNC-Lavalin Case

The prime minister denied allegations against him, saying that he sought to protect jobs and acted with respect to Canada's laws and institutions. Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has supported Trudeau, saying that the prime minister would ""never apply improper pressure"" on an attorney general.

Sputnik has discussed the issue with Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto.

Sputnik: What do you make of the way the way the Trudeau administration’s responded to the situation?

Nelson Wiseman: The Trudeau administration made the error of not being open and transparent about why they did not want a criminal trial against SNC-Lavalin to proceed. What the Liberals want to do is perfectly legal, but they thought the optics about being transparent would hurt them.

They were right. However, subsequent events including Trudeau’s evasive and narrow legalistic pronouncements and the resignation of the minister previously responsible for the SNC-Lavalin file made him look even worse in much of the public’s mind.

Sputnik: The scandal was followed by the resignation of his adviser Gerald Butts. How much impact did this development have on the situation in general?

© REUTERS / Remo Casilli Author on SNC-Lavalin Scandal: Whole Affair Raises Question of Corruption in Canada Butts hoped that his resignation would help the government, but the resignation has not made much difference. Indeed, it suggested malfeasance on his part although he denies it.

He says he did nothing wrong but that his continued presence working for the prime minister would be a distraction from the government’s agenda.

Sputnik: Trudeau has been touted as a ‘progressive’ Prime Minister and has long received positive coverage in mainstream media. What impact could the recent allegations have on his image and his credibility?

Nelson Wiseman: His image and credibility have been shaken.

Sputnik: What consequences can this issue have on the upcoming elections in Canada?

Nelson Wiseman: There is no upside for Trudeau and the Liberal government in this affair. However, the election is still months and months away and there will be a number of factors influencing how people vote, this affair being just one.

He sat down Tuesday morning with The Early Edition host Stephen Quinn to discuss his election victory.

You have been the federal leader of the NDP for about a year-and-a-half now, but you haven't held a seat in Parliament until now.

What is it going to mean to the party that you have finally been elected as a member of Parliament?

It gives us a chance to put some more pressure on the Liberal government in Ottawa to answer the question: why is it that they're so concerned with helping the wealthy and powerful, whether it's SNC-Lavalin or pharmaceutical companies or oil and gas?

There's been a lot of talk in this byelection that your position as the leader of the NDP rested on the outcome of the election last night.

Did you feel that way?

I never had any doubts.

We run campaigns in a way [that] we connect directly with the people, and our offer was better than the other parties.

Did you have any worries at all about the confidence that your own MPs had in you as leader of the party without an elected seat?

Well, when it comes to what we care about as New Democrats, every New Democrat is committed to fighting for the people that don't have a voice.

Our job is to take their concerns and their values and what they're worried about to Ottawa and represent them.

And we're all unified on that front.

We're all unified in building a better Canada that invests in housing, that invests in a green economy, that transforms the way we've envisioned things in the past and moves us towards investing in green technology, that creates great jobs and reduces emissions. And also an opportunity to invest in our health-care system, to expand it for medication coverage for all.

The question was: do you believe your MPs have confidence in you?

Absolutely. No question.

You're a new resident of Burnaby. How do you balance your responsibilities as leader of the NDP with representing the concerns of your constituents?

This is the struggle of all MPs: being able to take the concerns of your constituents to Ottawa, but also being able to have time on the ground to hear people's concerns.

I'll be spending my time across Canada but the Lower Mainland is incredibly important to me.

Elections are expensive. The NDP are trailing the Conservative and the Liberals when it comes to fundraising.

How prepared financially is your party to fight an election in October?

Oh, we will be ready to fight a strong election.

99,Empty,2019-03-06T18:26:14Z,The scandal surrounding Prime Minister Justin Trudeau shows just how cozy the country’s elite really is.,"Mr. Trudeau came to power in 2015 on the promise of a new, revitalized Liberal Party, removed from the stale old boys’ club of yore. The party, though it imagines itself as representing the quintessential ideals of Canadiana, has a long track record of corruption and chicanery, particularly in Quebec.

With an electoral base in the country’s most heavily populated regions, like Quebec, the Liberals have enjoyed many decades in power. It is not without merit that they are referred to, derisively, as Canada’s Natural Governing Party.

Power brings with it certain habits. This is true everywhere, but in a democratic country with a population the size of California spread across a gigantic landmass, influence runs in a geographic network that we describe in shorthand as the Laurentian Elite, after the St. Lawrence River that runs through eastern Canada. Mr. Trudeau, the son of former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, is very much a creature of this elite.

And so is SNC-Lavalin. Not just any company gets its calls taken by the prime minister’s office. Founded in 1911, SNC-Lavalin is a crown jewel in the Quebec corporate firmament. The company’s lobbyists have long ties in both Conservative and Liberal governments. Its lawyers include a former Supreme Court justice. A retired senior federal official is on its board. One of its corporate directors also sits on the board of the Trudeau Foundation. Quebec’s public pension funds own about 20 percent of SNC-Lavalin’s shares.

The decision about SNC-Lavalin’s case was being made in the lead-up to Quebec’s Oct. 1 provincial election — and that was apparently on the prime minister’s mind. According to Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, senior staff members from Mr. Trudeau’s office said the company was threatening to relocate to London if it did not get the plea deal. One such staffer, she said, told her “if they don’t get a D.P.A., they will leave Montreal, and it’s the Quebec election right now, so we can’t have that happen.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould recounted a conversation with Mr. Trudeau: “At that point the prime minister jumped in, stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that ‘I am an M.P. in Quebec — the member for Papineau,’” she said. When she asked if he was trying to override her independence as attorney general, she said, the prime minister replied, “‘No, no, no, we just need to find a solution.’ ”",Canadian Politics Aren’t Cute.

Scheer told reporters Wednesday that Trudeau has ""lost the moral authority to govern"" and called on the RCMP to open an investigation into the controversy.

The Conservative leader said he was ""sickened and appalled"" by Jody Wilson-Raybould's testimony before the justice committee, which detailed the political interference she claimed to have experienced as the former attorney general.

Watch: Wilson-Raybould says she faced pressure, 'veiled threats' over SNC-Lavalin

In more than three hours of testimony, Wilson-Raybould alleged that she faced ""consistent and sustained pressure"" for four months from Trudeau, his senior staff, Canada's top public servant and the finance minister's office to halt the criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering giant.

Wilson-Raybould told MPs was repeatedly pressed to overturn a decision not to negotiate a remediation agreement, also known as a deferred prosecution agreement, with SNC-Lavalin. Such a deal would have allowed the company, facing fraud and bribery charges from its dealings in Libya, to avoid a trial that could damage the company and spur layoffs.

Scheer said it is clear now that Wilson-Raybould was being bullied to ""bend the law"" for a well-connected corporation. He accused Trudeau of allowing a ""systemic culture of corruption to take root in his office"" and said the episode marked the final stages of his government.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""That is why I'm calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and resign.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh did not echo Scheer's call for the prime minister's resignation. He said the testimony heard at justice committee reaffirms his party's call for an independent inquiry.

""He may need to resign because of this,"" Singh said.

Wilson-Raybould testified that between Sept. 4 and Dec. 19, there were at least 10 different phone calls and 10 meetings about the SNC-Lavalin case between her or key members of her staff and 11 people in the Prime Minister's Office and other departments. Emails and text messages were also exchanged, she added.

Wilson-Raybould said that in a meeting with Trudeau on Sept. 17, the prime minister said SNC-Lavalin could cut many jobs and possibly move from Montreal without a remediation deal. She said Trudeau also stressed there was a provincial election in Quebec at the time and that he was an MP for the Quebec riding of Papineau.

Wilson-Raybould said she was ""taken aback"" and asked the prime minister if he was politically interfering in her independent role and decision as the attorney general, and that she would ""strongly advise"" against that.

""The prime minister said, 'No, no, no, we just need to find a solution,'"" she said.

The Canadian Press Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould appears at the House of Commons Justice Committee on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Feb. 27, 2019.

She also accused Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick of issuing ""veiled threats"" during a phone call on Dec. 19, in which she alleges he referenced how Trudeau wanted to know why a remediation deal wasn't being pursued. Wilson-Raybould said Wernick told her Trudeau would ""find a way to get it done one way or another.""

In a January cabinet shuffle, Wilson-Raybould was demoted to veterans affairs minister and replaced as attorney general and justice minister by David Lametti. She resigned from cabinet earlier this month.

Wilson-Raybould also testified the pressure she felt did not cross the line, in her opinion, from ""inappropriate"" to illegal.

PM 'completely disagrees' with Wilson-Raybould's account

Speaking to reporters in Montreal, Trudeau said he ""completely disagrees"" with his former attorney general's version of events.

""Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy. We,of course, had discussions of the potential loss of 9,000 jobs in communities across the country, including the possibly impact on pensions,"" he said in reference to SNC-Lavalin's woes.

""My job as prime minister has always been to stand up for Canadians and Canadian workers.""

Trudeau distanced himself from Wilson-Raybould's claim that he politically interfered in the prosecution case against SNC-Lavalin. He said the decision about a deferred prosecution agreement related to Quebec company ""was Ms. Wilson-Raybould's and hers alone.""

""I strongly maintain as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,"" the prime minister said.

Ryan Remiorz/CP Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks at a media availability in Montreal on Feb. 27, 2019.

He responded to Scheer's call for his resignation by mentioning the upcoming election, saying Canadians will have a ""clear choice"" to make in a few months. He pointed to his government's economic record as a reason for Canadians to re-elect a Liberal government.

The Conservative party, Trudeau said, remains ""the party of Stephen Harper that continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues.""

Trudeau sidestepped a question when asked if he would allow Wilson-Raybould, currently the MP for Vancouver Granville, to run under the Liberal banner this fall. He said that he has yet to listen to the entirety of his former attorney general's testimony.

""I will do that before making any further decisions,"" he said.

Wilson-Raybould asked if she has confidence in PM

Wilson-Raybould, meanwhile, will likely face questions about whether she can stay in the Liberal caucus in light of her explosive testimony.

At the committee, Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault asked his caucus colleague if she still has confidence in the prime minister.

""I'm not going to get into any conversations about why I resigned other than to say this. I resigned from cabinet because I did not have confidence to sit around the cabinet table,"" Wilson-Raybould said.

Natural Resources Canada says there has been a 4.6 magnitude earthquake in central Alberta.

The federal department's website says the quake occurred around 5:55 a.m. local time Monday and was lightly felt in Red Deer and in the town of Sylvan Lake to the west.

It says the quake was about a kilometre beneath the surface.

There were no immediate reports of damage but Joanne Gaudet, communications officer for Sylvan Lake, says the power went out in most of the town.

The utility company Fortis was expected to restore full service by mid-morning.

The U.S. Geological Survey website says an earthquake similar to the one that struck Alberta has a sensation like a heavy truck striking a building that can rattle windows and may break some dishes or windows.

Gaudet said there has been seismic activity in the past between Sylvan Lake and the community of Rocky Mountain House.

A new poll puts Andrew Scheer's Conservatives seven points ahead of the Liberals, gaining the favour of 38 per cent of voters, putting them in majority government territory, compared to 31 per cent for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's party, according to an Angus Reid Institute report.

The majority of Canadians, 66 per cent, believe the SNC-Lavalin affair points to a deeper scandal in the Prime Minister's Office, the poll found. And two-thirds of Canadians believe SNC-Lavalin should be prosecuted, potentially resulting in a 10-year ban on the Quebec-based engineering company receiving public contracts.

""It's about perceived and real lack of transparency that the Trudeau government has been scrambling, unsuccessfully, to fix,"" said Angus Reid executive director Shachi Kurl. ""The lack of detail enables people's speculation.""

Trudeau has faced ongoing political backlash for his role in the SNC-Lavalin affair since late last week, when the online poll was conducted. Sixty per cent of Canadians have an unfavourable opinion of him and over the last month, 59 per cent of respondents said their opinion of Trudeau has worsened.

But it appears no party leader is particularly popular. Fifty-four per cent of Canadians think Scheer is unfavourable, and 64 per cent think the NDP's Jagmeet Singh is unfavourable. It is standard for party leaders not to be very well known or popular until weeks before the election, Kurl said.

Over the past month, how Canadians view Scheer and Singh has not drastically changed — 55 per cent and 64 per cent of respondents, respectively, feel the same way about each leader.

""What we see now is Scheer has been able to make swings that hit Trudeau but that hasn't translated to his own gains,"" Kurl said. ""Six months is eons in an election, and the question becomes can Scheer translate the general anger and dissatisfaction towards Trudeau into successfully offering himself up as an alternative to the prime minister-ship?""

Highlights

Free to speak for the first time about the SNC-Lavalin affair, Jody Wilson-Raybould delivered dramatic testimony in Ottawa on Wednesday, alleging “inappropriate” and sustained pressure from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his office to save the engineering firm from a trial that could damage the Liberals’ political future in Quebec.

In her lengthy opening statement and three hours of questioning by the House justice committee, she gave a detailed timeline of contentious conversations between her, her staff, the Prime Minister’s Office and other officials. In some of those exchanges, she says she faced “veiled threats” that an SNC trial would allow the firm’s headquarters to leave Quebec, costing thousands of jobs.

Afterward, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau – who left Ottawa for Montreal shortly before the testimony began – faced calls from the opposition to resign or face a public inquiry. On Thursday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer wrote to RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki asking for an investigation, citing a provision of the Criminal Code making it illegal to “provoke a state of fear” to impede the criminal justice system.

Mr. Trudeau said Wednesday that he “completely disagreed” with Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s version of events and denied any wrongdoing. Asked about the issue again on Thursday, Mr. Trudeau said neither he nor the RCMP had contacted him about SNC.

What we knew before Wednesday

On Feb. 7, The Globe and Mail reported for the first time that Jody Wilson-Raybould had faced pressure in her previous job as justice minister to intervene in the federal corruption case against SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec engineering firm accused of bribing Libyan officials to win construction contracts. That first Globe report was based on information from confidential sources, who said the Prime Minister’s Office sought to avoid a costly trial last fall by reaching an out-of-court settlement with SNC. But Ms. Wilson-Raybould refused. Months later, she was shuffled into the Veterans Affairs portfolio.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau denied he had “directed” Ms. Wilson-Raybould on the matter, but dodged questions on whether he had pressed her. He later acknowledged that they had discussed SNC’s case, and that when she asked in September whether he was ordering her to make a particular decision, he told her no. But Ms. Wilson-Raybould, who quit as veterans minister on Feb. 12, didn’t have a chance to tell her side of the story because she said she was bound by solicitor-client privilege. Mr. Trudeau partly waived that privilege on Feb. 25, but only for matters relating to her time as justice minister. That set the stage for Wednesday’s hearings at the House justice committee, which is looking into the SNC issue in general.

‘Veiled threats’ to 'politically interfere’

Open this photo in gallery Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks to supporters in Montreal on Feb. 27, 2019. Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press

In her opening statement, which ran more than 5,000 words, Ms. Wilson-Raybould described “consistent and sustained” political pressure from Mr. Trudeau and top officials urging her to settle the SNC case quietly by urging the Director of Public Prosecutions to reach a deferred prosecution agreement, or DPA, so that SNC could admit wrongdoing and pay compensation without a more costly trial:

Story continues below advertisement

For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin. These events involved 11 people (excluding myself and my political staff) – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance.

On several occasions, she says, “veiled threats” were invoked that SNC would move its head office out of Quebec if its legal woes continued, losing thousands of jobs in the province. She cited several times when Mr. Trudeau or other officials brought up the then-upcoming Quebec provincial election, which the provincial Liberals ultimately lost on Oct. 1 to the Coalition Avenir Québec.

Here’s what she said about one such meeting, where she spoke with Mr. Trudeau and Michael Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council, on Sept. 17. At this point, the Director of Public Prosecutions had already informed SNC that there would be no DPA, according to court documents obtained by The Globe:

The Prime Minister asks me to help out – to find a solution here for SNC – citing that if there was no DPA there would be many jobs lost and that SNC will move from Montreal. In response, I explained to him the law ... I told him that I had done my due diligence and made up my mind on SNC and that I was not going to interfere with the decision of the DPP.

... At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that “and I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau.” My response – and I remember this vividly – was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye – I asked: “Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.” The Prime Minister said “No, No, No – we just need to find a solution.”

The names named

Michael Wernick

Michael Wernick is head of the Privy Council Office, a wing of the public service that supports the PMO and cabinet. He was present at Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s Sept. 17 meeting with Mr. Trudeau. She describes him supporting Mr. Trudeau’s argument that job losses in Quebec were a sufficient reason to intervene in the SNC case:

Then to my surprise – the Clerk started to make the case for the need to have a DPA – he said “there is a board meeting on Thursday (Sept 20) with stock holders” ... “they will likely be moving to London if this happens” ... “and there is an election in Quebec soon” ...

On Dec. 19, after more conversations between Mr. Wernick and her staff, Ms. Wilson-Raybould had a phone call with him:

The Clerk said that the PM is quite determined, quite firm but he wants to know why the DPA route which Parliament provided for isn’t being used. He said “I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.” I warned the Clerk that we were treading on dangerous ground here – and I issued a stern warning because as the AG, I cannot act in a manner and the prosecution cannot act in a manner that is not objective, that isn’t independent, I cannot act in a partisan way and I cannot be politically motivated. And all of this screams of that.

Gerald Butts and Katie Telford

Gerald Butts, the Prime Minister’s best friend, spent more than three years at his side as principal secretary. But on Feb. 18 he quit, saying the accusations of PMO meddling were a distraction from the government’s work. That left Katie Telford, Mr. Trudeau’s chief of staff, as the most senior person in the PMO.

In her testimony, Ms. Wilson-Raybould described both of them playing a key role in the SNC discussions. On Dec. 18, she says he challenged her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, to get an external legal opinion of the DPP’s decision not to reach a DPA:

Gerry said “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.” At least they are finally being honest about what they are asking you to do! Don’t care about the PPSC’s independence. Katie was like “we don’t want to debate legalities anymore.” … They kept being like “we aren’t lawyers, but there has to be some solution here”.’

Bill Morneau

Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony also added some new characters to the SNC drama: Bill Morneau, the Finance Minister, and his chief of staff Ben Chin. Ms. Prince talked with Mr. Chin on Sept. 6, two days after SNC was notified there would be no DPA. He, too, pressed on the issue of jobs and the Quebec election:

He wanted to talk about SNC and what we could do, if anything, to address this. He said to her that if they don’t get a DPA, they will leave Montreal, and it’s the Quebec election right now, so we can’t have that happen. He said that they have a big meeting coming up on Tuesday and that this bad news may go public.

David Lametti

When Ms. Wilson-Raybould was shuffled out of her job in January, Mr. Trudeau chose MP David Lametti to replace her as justice minister. Days before the shuffle, discussions were set in motion to make the SNC file a priority for Mr. Lametti, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said, citing directives given to the deputy justice minister by Mr. Wernick:

My former Deputy Minister is called by the Clerk and told that the shuffle is happening, and that she will be getting a new Minister. As part of this conversation, the Clerk tells the Deputy that one of the first conversations that the new Minister will be expected to have with the PM will be on SNC Lavalin. In other words, that the new Minister will need to be prepared to speak to the PM on this file. The Deputy recounts this to my Chief of Staff who tells me about the comment.

The spectre of Nixon

One of the biggest corruption scandals in U.S. history, Watergate, got an unexpected cameo in Wednesday’s hearings when Ms. Wilson-Raybould mentioned the Saturday Night Massacre, when president Richard Nixon’s attorney-general quit in 1973 rather than fire the Watergate special prosecutor. She brought up the comparison in her Dec. 19 conversation with Mr. Wernick, when he pressed her again on reaching a settlement with SNC:

The Clerk acknowledged that, but said that the PM does not have the power to do what he wants… all the tools are in my hands, he said. I said that I was having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre – but that I was confident that I had given the Prime Minister my best advice to protect him and to protect the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence. The Clerk said that he was worried about a collision because the PM is pretty firm about this…He told me that he had seen the PM a few hours ago and that this is really important to him.

Here’s a primer from The Globe’s Washington correspondent, Adrian Morrow, on the legacy of Mr. Nixon’s Saturday Night Massacre.

What wasn’t said

Open this photo in gallery Ms. Wilson-Raybould prepares to testify on Feb. 27, 2019. Blair Gable/The Globe and Mail

For all her candour on Wednesday, Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s reprieve from solicitor-client privilege only went so far. Mr. Trudeau’s order-in-council only covered her time as justice minister, so her timeline of events ends with her exit from the job. Ahead of her testimony, she wrote to the justice committee’s chair, Anthony Housefather, saying she was disappointed that she couldn’t address events after that:

[The order-in-council] addresses only my time as attorney-general of Canada and therefore does nothing to release me from any restrictions that apply to communications while I served as minister of veterans affairs and in relation to my resignation from that post or my presentation to cabinet after I had resigned.

How Trudeau responded

Open this photo in gallery Mr. Trudeau speaks at a media availability in Montreal on Feb. 27, 2019. Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press

Mr. Trudeau wasn’t in Ottawa during Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s committee hearing, instead going to Montreal soon after an appearance in Question Period. Afterward, Mr. Trudeau told a late news conference that he “completely disagreed” with Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s version of events, that neither he nor his staff had done anything wrong and that he had faith in an investigation of the matter by the Ethics Commissioner. Asked if he would resign, he said Canadians would get a choice in October’s federal election about who should lead the nation.

How the opposition responded

After Wednesday’s hearing, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Mr. Trudeau had lost moral authority to govern and should step down. On Thursday he wrote to the head of the RCMP asking for an investigation. Meanwhile, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called for a public inquiry and condemned the Prime Minister for appearing to side with “rich corporations who need favours.”

How Indigenous people responded

Ms. Wilson-Raybould – whose traditional name, Puglaas, means “a woman born to noble people” in the Kwak’wala language – is descended from the Musgamagw Tsawataineuk and Laich-Kwil-Tach peoples of British Columbia. When she got the justice minister job in 2015, she was the first Indigenous woman to hold the post, and identified with a traditional role – Hiligaxste, or One Who Corrects the Chiefs’ Path – in her career as a lawyer and politician. She acknowledged that cultural heritage again in the conclusion to her Wednesday testimony:

I come from a long line of matriarchs and I am a truth teller in accordance with the laws and traditions of our Big House – this is who I am and who I will always be. Gilakas’la / Thank you.

Afterward, Indigenous leaders across the country expressed support for her and anger at the Trudeau government. Here’s what Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs said:

It makes one more angry about how terribly she was treated, how she was coerced, how she was browbeaten. But at the same time, we’re elated that she’s been vindicated and has had an opportunity to speak her truth.

The Quebec Court of Appeal has upheld a landmark judgment that ordered three tobacco companies to pay billions of dollars in damages to Quebec smokers.

Imperial Tobacco, JTI-Macdonald and Rothmans-Benson & Hedges had appealed a ruling that found the companies chose profits over the health of their customers.

Philippe Trudel, a lawyer for smokers who brought the class action, called today's appellate court decision a complete victory and excellent news for victims.

In June 2015, Quebec Superior Court Justice Brian Riordan ordered the companies to make payments of more than $15-billion to smokers who either fell ill or were addicted. At the time, the ruling was believed to be the biggest class action award in Canadian history.

One lawsuit was started by people who were addicted to cigarettes and couldn't quit, and the second was brought by those who had suffered from cancer or emphysema.

Some 76 witnesses testified at the Superior Court trial and nearly 43,000 documents were deposited as evidence, including internal tobacco company documents that showed smokers didn't know or understand the risks associated with cigarettes.

The three cigarette companies argued their customers knew the risks of smoking. Moreover, the firms claimed their products were sold legally under strict regulation by the federal government.

Trudel estimated that after the appeal ruling, the total damages owed by the companies would be more than $17-billion.

""It is excellent news for victims who have been waiting for this day for a long time. We're very happy with the result, clearly,"" he said.

Quebec's highest court, which began hearing the appeal in 2016, struck down almost all of the tobacco companies' grounds for appeal and upheld the judge's decision.

The court did find the judge erred in several minor aspects, including how the interest was calculated. Trudel called the change a ""technicality"" that would have little effect on the overall damages.

""Out of all the billions, I don't think they'll call it a victory,"" he said. ""But we call it a total victory on all fronts.""",Big Tobacco to pay billions - Canada News - Castanet.net,Castanet.net,https://www.castanet.net/news/Canada/250512/Big-Tobacco-to-pay-billions

In her testimony before the House of Commons justice committee, the former justice minister and attorney-general said she was “hounded” to negotiate a settlement with SNC-Lavalin, the Quebec-based engineering giant facing charges of fraud and corruption.

Mostly freed by an order-in-council from the confines of solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence, Ms. Wilson-Raybould laid out a cast of characters that she said were involved in the controversy between September and December of last year.

“These events involved 11 people – excluding myself and my political staff – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance,” she told the committee. “This included in-person conversations, telephone calls, emails and text messages.”

The Globe and Mail confirmed the names with her office and takes a closer look at the 11 people – who they are and what Ms. Wilson-Raybould said in her testimony about their alleged involvement.

Justin Trudeau: Prime Minister of Canada

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing his largest scandal since taking office in 2015. In her testimony, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she had a meeting with the Prime Minister on Sept. 17 regarding another matter.

But, she said he raised the SNC-Lavalin issue “immediately,” asking her to find a solution for the company, repeatedly citing risks of job losses and that the engineering firm would move its headquarters away from Montreal. Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she had decided not to issue a directive to the director of public prosecutions in this case, as it was not appropriate.

She said Mr. Trudeau then stressed that there is a provincial election in Quebec and said he is an MP in the province. Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she outright asked if he was politically interfering with her role and decision as attorney-general, to which he replied, “No, no, no, we just need to find a solution.”

In a December conversation with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said Mr. Wernick repeatedly invoked the Prime Minister’s name, saying Mr. Trudeau was concerned. To her, these amounted to “veiled threats.”

On Jan. 7, the Prime Minister informed Ms. Wilson-Raybould that she was being shuffled to minister of veterans affairs; she said she believed the reason was because of the SNC case. In response to her testimony, Mr. Trudeau said he disagreed with her characterization of events and that he and his staff acted appropriately in the matter.

Bill Morneau: Minister of Finance

Minister of Finance Bill Morneau was an experienced businessman and a political newcomer when he successfully ran as a Liberal candidate for the Toronto Centre riding in 2015. Mr. Morneau came under scrutiny after The Globe reported in October of 2017 that he had not placed his substantial personal holdings into a blind trust, an approach the Prime Minister had held up as the gold standard for avoiding conflicts of interest. Mr. Morneau said he was not doing anything against the rules, but subsequently said he would sell his shares in his family’s human-resources firm and put other assets in a blind trust.

In her testimony, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said Mr. Morneau raised concerns about potential job losses should SNC-Lavalin not receive a deferred prosecution agreement, describing a conversation she had with Mr. Morneau on Sept. 19 in the House of Commons.

“He again stressed the need to save jobs, and I told him that engagements from his office to mine on SNC had to top – that they were inappropriate,” she said. “They did not stop,” she said, adding that her chief of staff subsequently received calls from Ben Chin and Justin To, both from the Minister of Finance’s office, regarding SNC-Lavalin and deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs).

On Thursday, Mr. Morneau denied doing anything improper, saying it was “entirely appropriate” for his staff to speak with the Justice Minister’s staff about the economic effects of their decisions.

Ben Chin: Chief of staff to the Minister of Finance

Ben Chin began his career as a broadcast journalist, moving to politics in 2005 as a communications adviser to former Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty. He unsuccessfully ran for the Ontario Liberals in the Toronto-Danforth by-election in 2006. Mr. Chin was vice-president of communications for the Ontario Power Authority between 2009 and 2011, and in 2013 was called to testify before a provincial legislative committee looking into a decision by the government to cancel plans to build two gas-fired power plants before the 2011 election.

Mr. Chin served as communications director for former B.C. Liberal premier Christy Clark from December, 2012, until July, 2017, later that year moving to federal politics as a senior adviser to Mr. Morneau. In May of 2018, he became the minister’s chief of staff. Lobbying records show SNC-Lavalin representatives met with Mr. Morneau and Mr. Chin on Sept. 18, to discuss subjects including “justice and law enforcement.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s statement said one of the first communications she had about a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin came on Sept. 6, when Mr. Chin told her chief of staff that if the company did not get a DPA, “they will leave Montreal, and it’s the Quebec election right now, so we can’t have that happen.”

In another reference to Mr. Chin, Ms. Wilson-Raybould described a follow-up conversation between him and a member of her staff on Sept. 11, in which she says Mr. Chin noted that “SNC’s legal counsel was Frank Iacobucci, and further detailed what the terms were that SNC was prepared to agree to – stating that they viewed this as a negotiation.”

Mathieu Bouchard: Senior adviser, Prime Minister’s Office

Mathieu Bouchard is a senior adviser to the Prime Minister, with a particular focus on Quebec and legal issues. Prior to joining the PMO in November of 2015, he was a lawyer with Montreal firm Irving Mitchell Kalichman LLP, where he worked in corporate and civil litigation as well as human-rights law.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony had numerous references to SNC-related communications with Mr. Bouchard. She said her then-chief of staff, Jessica Prince, had a phone call with Mr. Bouchard and Elder Marques, also from the PMO, on Sept. 16.

In this call, they said her office should get external advice on the SNC-Lavalin matter and they mentioned the context of a Quebec election. On Sept. 19, they had another call with Ms. Prince, in which they suggested an “informal reach out” to the director of public prosecutions. Ms. Prince said Ms. Wilson-Raybould was not comfortable with that and this likely constituted political interference.

On Oct. 18, Mr. Bouchard called Ms. Prince and asked that the Attorney-General consider seeking an external legal opinion on the prosecutor’s decision not to offer a deferred prosecution agreement. Mr. Bouchard repeated this request to Ms. Prince on Oct. 26. Ms. Wilson-Raybould said he told Ms. Prince that there could be negative consequences should SNC-Lavalin announce it is moving its headquarters out of Canada.

“We can have the best policy in the world, but we need to get re-elected,” he allegedly said. On Nov. 22, Ms. Wilson-Raybould met with Mr. Bouchard and Mr. Marques. She said it was a lengthy meeting where Mr. Bouchard said Ms. Wilson-Raybould needed to find a solution, even though she said she had already made up her mind not to intervene.

Amy Archer: Policy adviser, Prime Minister’s Office

Amy Archer has a BA in political studies from Queen’s University and a law degree from the University of Western Ontario, according to her LinkedIn profile. The profile says she articled at McCarthy Tétrault and worked there as a litigation associate for two years, then moved to a job at Lerners LLP.

She became a senior adviser to Ontario’s government House leader in 2014. From there, she took a post as senior policy adviser with the attorney-general of Ontario in 2017. She went on to become a policy adviser in the PMO, joining several other former Ontario Liberal staffers who found jobs on Parliament Hill after the Progressive Conservatives won the June provincial election.

In Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s opening statement, she says she got a note from her staff on Sept. 7 on the role of the attorney-general; she said the note was shared with Elder Marques and Ms. Archer.

Michael Wernick: Clerk of the Privy Council Office

A 61-year-old career civil servant, Michael Wernick ascended through the bureaucracy to the top job of Clerk of the Privy Council in 2016. In the role, he is tasked with helping to implement the vision of the government of the day. Mr. Wernick testified before the justice committee on Feb. 21, where he maintained that Ms. Wilson-Raybould – whom he described as a partner, ally and friend – was not subjected to “inappropriate pressure.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould detailed several occasions when she spoke with Mr. Wernick about the SNC-Lavalin matter. She said she met with the Prime Minister and Mr. Wernick on Sept. 17 on an unrelated issue, but that Mr. Trudeau immediately brought up the SNC-Lavalin case, flagging the potential economic consequences if there is no deferred prosecution agreement.

“Then, to my surprise, the Clerk started to make the case for the need to have a DPA,” Ms. Wilson-Raybould told MPs, adding that Mr. Wernick referred to a coming SNC-Lavalin board meeting and an election in Quebec. Ms. Wilson-Raybould said that at meeting two days later, the Clerk brought up potential job losses.

On Dec. 19, Mr. Wernick called Ms. Wilson-Raybould and told her the Prime Minister is “quite determined, quite firm” on the SNC-Lavalin matter, according to her testimony. “He said: ‘I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another,’” she said.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould said that on Jan. 11, Mr. Wernick told her deputy minister that a cabinet shuffle is happening and that the SNC-Lavalin matter will be one of the priorities for the new minister.

Elder Marques: Senior adviser, Prime Minister’s Office

Elder Marques is a former top commercial litigator and trial lawyer from McCarthy Tétrault. Mr. Marques, who once served as the law clerk to now-retired Supreme Court chief justice Beverley McLachlin, joined the Liberal government in 2016 as chief of staff to Minister of Innovation Navdeep Bains.

In 2017, he became a senior adviser in the PMO and was named by The Hill Times as one of the 15 most influential unelected people in federal government. Since 2017, SNC-Lavalin lobbied federal officials – including Mr. Marques – a total of more than 50 times on the topic of “justice” and “law enforcement,” according to the federal lobbyists registry.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould said that on Sept. 16, her then-chief of staff, Ms. Prince, had a call with Mr. Marques and Mr. Bouchard, another senior PMO adviser.

Story continues below advertisement

“They said that they think we should be able to find a more reasonable resolution here,” Ms. Wilson-Raybould testified, adding that the two mentioned the coming SNC-Lavalin board meeting and the Quebec election. Ms. Wilson-Raybould said they asked Ms. Prince if the office was open to suggesting to the Public Prosecution Service of Canada that it get outside advice. The men told Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff that “they didn’t want to cross any lines.”

In a Sept. 19 call with Ms. Prince, Mr. Marques and Mr. Bouchard raised the idea of “an informal reach-out” to the director of public prosecutions, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said. They asked if it would still constitute political interference if Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s staff or her deputy minister reached out to the director, she said.

On Nov. 22, after Ms. Wilson-Raybould had told various officials that SNC-Lavalin would not be getting a DPA, she had a “quite long” meeting with Mr. Marques and Mr. Bouchard, she said. They “continued to plead their case,” she said.

Gerald Butts, former principal secretary to the Prime Minister

Gerald Butts and Mr. Trudeau have a long history. They met as university students when they were both English majors at McGill University. Mr. Butts, a two-time university debating champion, was a top adviser to former Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty and formerly the CEO of the World Wildlife Fund’s Canadian office.

He was principal secretary to Prime Minister Trudeau – and one of the PM’s most trusted advisers – from 2015 until his abrupt resignation on Feb. 18. In his letter of resignation, he said any accusation that he put pressure on Ms. Wilson-Raybould is “simply not true.”

In her testimony, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she met with Mr. Butts on Dec. 5, a meeting in which she says she stressed that she had made up her mind on SNC-Lavalin and that further engagements were inappropriate; he said he needed her to find a solution. According to Ms. Wilson-Raybould, he said the statute involved in the matter was one passed under the previous Harper administration and that he did not like the law.

On Dec. 18, Mr. Butts and Katie Telford, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, met with Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff, where they again asked for a solution. In a text conversation, her chief of staff cited Mr. Butts as saying “there is no solution here that does not involve some interference.” On Thursday, Mr. Butts said he asked the Justice committee that he be allowed to testify.

Justin To: Director of policy and deputy chief of staff to the Minister of Finance

Justin To is director of policy and deputy chief of staff to Finance Minister Bill Morneau, a department where he has worked since September, 2017. Before that, he was a deputy director of policy along with finance and economic adviser to Prime Minister Trudeau; he also worked as a senior policy adviser to the former Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff.

According to Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, her chief of staff spoke with Mr. To and Mr. Morneau’s chief of staff on Sept. 20, in their capacity as members of the Finance Minister’s office, about SNC and deferred prosecution agreements. This occurred the day after she said she had told the Finance Minister that engagements on the matter from his office were inappropriate and needed to stop.

Katie Telford: Chief of staff to the Prime Minister

Katie Telford cut her teeth in the Ontario Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty, where she quickly rose through the ranks and served as chief of staff to then-education minister Gerard Kennedy. She managed Mr. Kennedy’s unsuccessful 2006 federal leadership bid, served as deputy chief of staff to former Liberal leader Stéphane Dion and was a senior consultant at the lobbying firm StrategyCorp.

Ms. Telford managed Mr. Trudeau’s winning bid for party leadership in 2012-13, and served as national campaign director in the 2015 federal election that brought Mr. Trudeau to power. Ms. Telford, who cemented her relationship with Mr. Butts when the two were at Queen’s Park, became Mr. Trudeau’s chief of staff and a central figure in the PMO.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould testified that on Dec. 18, her then-chief of staff, Ms. Prince, was “urgently summoned” to meet with Ms. Telford and Mr. Butts to discuss SNC-Lavalin. She described this meeting as part of the “final escalation in efforts by the PMO to interfere in this matter.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould read from text messages exchanged with Ms. Prince after the meeting, in which Ms. Prince said the PMO officials wanted Ms. Wilson-Raybould to seek outside counsel on whether she should review the SNC-Lavalin decision and recounted Ms. Telford as saying “we don’t want to debate legalities anymore.”

According to Ms. Wilson-Raybould, Ms. Prince says in the text messages that Ms. Telford believed outside advice would “give us cover in the business community and legal community.” Ms. Telford also offered to line up “all kinds of people to write opeds saying that what [Ms. Wilson-Raybould] is doing is proper.”

Nathalie Drouin: Deputy minister of justice and deputy attorney-general

Nathalie Drouin was previously deputy attorney-general for the Quebec government, and has been a member of the Quebec Bar since 1992. Before joining government, Ms. Drouin held senior positions in Quebec’s Autorité des marchés financiers, which regulates the financial sector in the province. She was named deputy minister of justice and deputy attorney-general of Canada in June of 2017. She had previously served as senior associate deputy minister at the justice department.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould testified that on Sept. 7, her then-deputy minister said her department was working on the issue and provided a list of what some options would be – for example, “informally call [director of public prosecutions] Kathleen Roussel, set up an external review of their decision, etc.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould said that on Sept. 16, her chief of staff had a conversation about SNC-Lavalin with Mr. Bouchard and Mr. Marques, from the PMO.

“They said they understand that there are limits on what can be done, and that they can’t direct, but that they hear that our Deputy Minister (of Justice) thinks we can get the PPSC to say, ‘We think we should get some outside advice on this,’” Ms. Wilson-Raybould said.

She also said she had a number of discussions with her deputy in which she raised concerns about the “appropriateness of communications” they were receiving from outside the department, and concerns about some of the options she was suggesting.

109,Empty,2019-02-28T14:49:47Z,His former attorney general detailed a campaign by Trudeau's office to quietly end a legal problem for an iconic Quebec construction firm.,"Justin Trudeau is facing the most explosive crisis of his administration after his former attorney general detailed a months-long campaign by the Canadian prime minister’s office to quietly end a legal problem for an iconic Quebec construction firm.

In dramatic testimony that lasted nearly four hours, Jody Wilson-Raybould broke her silence with a detailed account of efforts by Trudeau and top aides to persuade her to step in and end prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. She argues it amounted to interference in the judicial system, though concedes it wasn’t illegal, while Trudeau says he was trying to prevent job losses in his home province of Quebec.

“I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere,” the former attorney general said Wednesday afternoon. Wilson-Raybould, who quit cabinet this month, also said she faced “veiled threats” about what might happen if she refused to order an out-of-court settlement.

Her testimony shook the core of the Trudeau’s team, naming him, his finance chief and his most senior aides. The Conservative leader trying to unseat Trudeau in this fall’s election called for his resignation, but the prime minister stood his ground and rejected Wilson-Raybould’s version of events.

The public airing of grievances will inflame the scandal, which has driven the governing Liberals lower in national polls. The ordeal dredges up ghosts of the party’s past, which is marked by hand-in-glove ties with corporate Canada — particularly in Quebec. The political fallout, however, is difficult to predict. Trudeau’s path to re-election runs through the largely French-speaking province, where his defense of SNC-Lavalin is being applauded.

“I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau said Wednesday night in Montreal, where he was celebrating a Liberal Party by-election victory. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy.”

SNC-Lavalin had been pushing for what’s known as a deferred prosecution agreement to end a criminal case dating back more than a decade, related to corruption charges. The company’s stock plunged the most in six years Oct. 10 when it revealed that the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ruled out a negotiated settlement that would have staved off a trial. Settling out of court would also help the company, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada, avoid a ban on bidding for federal government contracts.

Wilson-Raybould pulled back the curtain on the effort to change that decision and help the company, in testimony that was aired on national television in its entirety. She spoke to lawmakers only after Trudeau waived privilege to allow her to do so, and believes she wasn’t even legally able to intervene.

She said the prime minister and his aides wanted to end the case in part to prevent the company’s relocation — and also to avoid electoral fallout for both the federal Liberals and the party’s provincial wing. Wilson-Raybould said she resisted intervening because she wanted to uphold the principle of judicial independence and the rule of law, but officials ignored her repeated instructions to stop raising the issue.

The former attorney-general identified a series of phone calls and meetings between her or her staff, and Trudeau or several of his top advisers. They include chief of staff Katie Telford; former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who resigned this month; and senior aides Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques. She also cited communications with Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his chief of staff Ben Chin.

One of the meetings was with Trudeau himself, in September. “The prime minister raised the issue immediately. The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC,” Wilson-Raybould said. She said she’d told him she had made up her mind.

“The prime minister again cited the potential loss of jobs and SNC moving,” while also stressing that he represents an electoral district in Quebec. She said Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, the country’s top bureaucrat, also warned her the company “will likely be moving to London” without her intervention.

Discussions continued. Wilson-Raybould said Bouchard at one point said bluntly: “We can have the best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected.”

She met Butts in December in Ottawa, and was already frustrated by what she called “the barrage of people hounding me and my staff.” She pushed back. “I raised how I needed everybody to stop talking to me about SNC, as I had made up my mind and that the engagements were inappropriate.”

She read a text-message conversation with her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, who was relaying a conversation with Butts and Telford. Wilson-Raybould said Prince was told by Butts “there is no solution here that does not involve some interference.” She said Prince told her Telford said: “We don’t want to debate legalities anymore.”

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, who is Trudeau’s top rival, demanded the prime minister step down over the revelations. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the third-place New Democratic Party, called for a full public inquiry.

Wilson-Raybould was ultimately moved in a cabinet shuffle last month, before the scandal broke. Trudeau at first sought to downplay it by saying Wilson-Raybould’s presence in cabinet should speak for itself. She resigned the next day.

To be sure, she said she didn’t believe Trudeau or his aides broke the law, but that their interventions were inappropriate. Wilson-Raybould also said no one ever flatly directed her to intervene. Trudeau has echoed that. The former attorney general said she didn’t think it was inappropriate to discuss the potential of job losses early on, but became inappropriate to continually do it, and to raise the political ramifications of the situation.

SNC-Lavalin has said it’s no longer focused on getting a remediation agreement, but instead on fighting the case. It’s also facing legal proceedings that allege it delayed disclosing that it would not get an offer of a deferred prosecution agreement, from Sept. 4 to Oct. 10. SNC-Lavalin said Wednesday the prosecutor’s “final decision” was only made Oct. 9.

110,Empty,2019-02-26T09:00:00Z,The fledgling People's Party of Canada got off to an uneven start in its first electoral test Monday in a trio of federal byelections.,"The fledgling People's Party of Canada got off to an uneven start in its first electoral test Monday in a trio of federal byelections.

The party, founded last fall by former Conservative leadership contender Maxime Bernier, captured some 11 per cent of the vote in the Vancouver-area riding of Burnaby South but failed to make much of a splash among voters in the rural Ontario riding of York—Simcoe or the urban Montreal-area riding of Outremont where the party had less than 2 per cent of the final tally.

Bernier tweeted early Tuesday that the poor Ontario and Quebec numbers were ""disappointing"" and said he ""expected more"" from those ridings while praising the more favourable Burnaby result as ""great.""

""Our party was born only 5 months ago!"" Bernier wrote. ""This is only the beginning of our journey. We are in it for the long haul ... Let's work even harder now to find the best candidates and be ready for the general election.""

3/ We are addressing crucial issues the other parties won’t touch.<br><br>We have the clearest principles and the best platform. <br><br>There is no alternative. <br><br>CANADA NEEDS US.<br><br>Let’s work even harder now to find the best candidates and be ready for the general election. —@MaximeBernier

Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson, a former Christian talk show host who had some name recognition before launching her candidacy, was tapped by Bernier to represent the People's Party in Burnaby South. She delivered the best result of the night for the new political outfit.

While she was a source of controversy because of some past remarks, Thompson peeled away enough votes from the more established parties to place fourth overall.

Thompson, whose slogan was of ""Canada for Canadians,"" ran a decidedly populist campaign for Parliament. Thompson has said her base was heavily comprised of evangelical Chinese-Canadian churchgoers in the diverse B.C. riding.

The comparatively strong showing by Thompson — in a riding ultimately won by NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh — appeared to cut in to the Conservative party's results in that riding.

Conservative Burnaby candidate, Jay Shin, captured about 23 per cent of the vote — five points less than what the previous Conservative candidate there managed to achieve in the 2015 federal election. Shin placed third behind Singh and Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee.

In central Canada, meanwhile, the People's Party proved to be a marginal political force.

For example, in York—Simcoe, Ont., People's Party candidate Robert Geurts, a criminal defence lawyer, placed a distant sixth out of nine candidates.

Geurts, best known for his past role as a prosecutor during the Paul Bernardo trial, was even outpaced by Dorian Baxter a candidate for the minor centre-right PC Party, an entity with a name similar to the now-defunct Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

Scot Davidson ultimately held the rural seat for the Conservative party with a 20-point margin over Liberal Shaun Tanaka.

Fewer than 20 per cent of registered voters in York—Simcoe bothered to vote in Monday's contest.

Even before the results were finalized, Bernier tweeted Monday that volunteers should be proud of what they accomplished so soon after the party was founded.

""The hundreds of volunteers who helped our candidates in Burnaby South, York–Simcoe and Outremont can be proud of what they achieved. They blazed a trail that thousands of others will follow across the country in October,"" he said.

In Outremont, People's Party candidate James Seale, a Canadian Army veteran, also failed to post a result better than 2 per cent of the vote.

Seale was a member of the armed forces for more than 30 years, and served overseas stints in Israel, Germany, Haiti and Bosnia before later becoming a military instructor and civil servant.

He said he was attracted to the party because of Bernier's promise to increase investment in Canada's defence.

While Bernier's party disappointed in the Quebec riding, Green party candidate Daniel Green placed third — among the party's best ever showing in la belle province.

“I don’t think I’ve ever seen a minister strafe her own government like this,” said Andrew MacDougall, who was the spokesman for Stephen Harper, the Conservative prime minister Mr. Trudeau replaced in 2015. “It just reinforces people’s perception that all politicians are kind of bent.”

During nearly four hours of testimony before the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday evening, the former minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, repeatedly contradicted and undermined Mr. Trudeau’s assertions that neither he nor his staff acted improperly in trying to settle a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin, a multinational construction and engineering company based in Montreal.

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould dramatically deepened the biggest crisis of Trudeau’s tenure just months ahead of an October election in which his Liberals face a tough fight.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that she had confronted Trudeau over what she called inappropriate pressure to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade a corruption trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, demanded the resignation of what he called a disgraced prime minister. “He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,” Scheer told reporters, calling for police to immediately probe the matter. Trudeau is due to address reporters later on Wednesday.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed “consistent and sustained pressure” on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

“In my view, these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter and that this pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,” she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould, who named several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister. Trudeau and other officials deny inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould. But the case forced the resignation of Trudeau’s principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

""I have been confirmed as the LPC [Liberal Party of Canada] candidate for Vancouver Granville for the federal election 2019,"" Wilson-Raybould told CBC News in an email.

She would not comment further, and said she isn't conducting interviews right now.

Previously, she had said her intention was to remain in caucus and continue to serve as the representative for Vancouver Granville. She told the Vancouver Sun earlier that she had been confirmed as the Liberal candidate in that riding last year.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he is still considering whether Wilson-Raybould can remain in the Liberal caucus after her explosive testimony Wednesday in front of the Commons justice committee, where she confirmed she had faced continuous pressure over four months from high-ranking government officials to interfere in the legal proceedings against Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

""I haven't yet had the opportunity to review her entire testimony,"" Trudeau said earlier this week. ""I will do that before making any further decisions.""

For some Democrats, it will seem obvious that Sanders inhabits the latter pole, back on the left flank of the Democratic field, where he is seeking to rein in billionaires, corporations, and a hawkish military-industrial complex, via a mass movement funded by small donations from a big donor pool. Some of his supporters perceive him as the only credible reformist outsider.

But other Democrats more prone to judging individuals based on their immutable traits see Sanders as yet another old, straight, cisgender white man seeking an office held by similarly privileged sorts for most of U.S. history.

That renders him more “establishment” in their view than a black woman like Kamala Harris, who represents progress in terms of diversity and representation, even if she substantively exacerbated the injustices that the carceral state inflicts on the wrongly accused, arguably harming people at the bottom of socioeconomic and racial hierarchies more than any other candidate.

In sum, one cannot draw any easy conclusions about how Democrats will understand Sanders’s candidacy—or assess his chances of beating President Donald Trump—merely by knowing whether they want a more centrist or leftist party.

While I’m an independent, not a Democrat, I don’t know where I personally stand on Sanders. Perhaps my uncertainty can further illuminate relevant complications.

I value Sanders’s opposition to corporate rent-seeking, his anti-war credentials, and his universalist approach to our wonderfully diverse democracy, while I dislike the ideological socialism that caused a younger, hopefully more naive Sanders to praise murderous regimes in Cuba and Nicaragua and to spin Sandinista bread lines as a sign of economic health, as Michael Moynihan documents. (“Vermont could set an example to the rest of the nation similar to the type of example Nicaragua is setting for the rest of Latin America,” Sanders once declared.)

The most indefensible of his bygone comments didn’t stop me from preferring an older, hopefully wiser Sanders to Hillary Clinton in 2016—the least defensible parts of her record included support for catastrophic wars in Iraq and Libya. While the next president will be unnervingly free to start wars of choice abroad without securing the lawfully required permission from Congress, he or she has no chance of imposing anything close to “democratic socialism.”

Still, I want to see Sanders grapple with the occasions when he has prioritized his commitment to socialism above his commitment to civil liberties. And I want him pressed on what Kmele Foster smartly flagged as the most interesting line in the speech when he announced his 2020 candidacy: “We are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world,” Sanders declared in order to highlight the unacceptability of U.S. failures to provide for the least well-off.",Is Bernie Sanders a Leftist or a Moderate?,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/sanders-democrats/583519/

Kelly back in jail over unpaid child support CANOE R. Kelly taken back into custody after hearing on unpaid child support Global News R.…","Photo: CTV News

R. Kelly was taken back into custody Wednesday after appearing at a child-support hearing, authorities said, hours after the broadcast of an interview in which the R&B star cried and ranted about being ""assassinated"" by allegations of sexual abuse that led to criminal charges last month.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's Office said Kelly would not be released from jail until he pays $161,000 in back child support.

Kelly's publicist, Darryll Johnson, said Kelly came to the hearing prepared to pay $50,000 to $60,000, but the judge wanted the whole amount. He said Kelly did not have the whole amount because he has not been able to work.

""He came here expecting to leave. He didn't come here to go to jail,"" Johnson said.

Addressing the court's refusal to accept the smaller amount, he said ""in the end nobody wins. The kids still don't have any money.""

The singer's next hearing is scheduled for March 13, sheriff's spokeswoman Sophia Ansari said.

Kelly was charged last month with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse and has pleaded not guilty. He spent a weekend in jail before someone posted his $100,000 bail. His defence attorney said at the time that Kelly's finances were ""a mess.""

The interview with ""CBS This Morning"" was Kelly's first since he was charged . Kelly called his accusers liars and alleged that people are after him for his money. He told interviewer Gayle King that he never sexually abused women or controlled their lives.

The 52-year-old singer is accused in Chicago of sexually abusing four females dating back to 1998, including three underage girls.

""All of them are lying,"" Kelly said in segments of the interview broadcast Wednesday. ""I have been assassinated.""

At one point during the interview, Kelly angrily stood up and started pacing, his voice breaking as he yelled: ""I didn't do this stuff! This is not me!""

He cried as he hit his hands together. ""I'm fighting for my (expletive) life,"" he said.

Kelly, who is out on bail following his Feb. 22 arrest in Chicago, said earlier in the interview that he had done ""lots of things wrong"" in relationships with women, but said he has apologized. He denied doing anything against their will. The songwriter said he believes social media is to blame for fueling the allegations.

""I have been buried alive, but I'm alive,"" he said, later adding that he needed someone to help him ""not have a big heart.""

When pressed about whether he was attracted to younger women, Kelly said: ""I'm an older man who loves all women."" He acknowledged being in a relationship with two young women who live with him.

The recording artist has been trailed for decades by allegations that he violated underage girls and women and held some as virtual slaves. Kelly has consistently denied any sexual misconduct and was acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008. Those charges centred on a graphic video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a girl as young as 13.

He and the girl allegedly seen with him denied they were in the 27-minute video, even though the picture quality was good and witnesses testified it was them. She did not take the stand. Kelly could have gotten 15 years in prison.

As part of the current case, prosecutors have described a witness who had access to videotapes showing Kelly having sex with a 14-year-old girl. The witness turned the tape over to authorities and identified the girl, who repeatedly states her age on the footage, according to court documents.

Interviews with the two women who live with Kelly will air Friday, including one young woman whose parents say she is being held against her will. Kelly suggested during the interview that the woman's parents were in it for the money and blamed them for his relationship with their daughter, saying they brought her to watch him perform when she was a teenager.

A lawyer for the couple bristled at the allegation, saying Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage never asked for or received money from Kelly. The couple said they have not spoken to their 23-year-old daughter for two years and asked Kelly to make her available to talk to them.

""At no point did this family sell their daughter to anyone or provide their daughter for anything for money,"" attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday during a news conference.

CBS said it interviewed Kelly for 80 minutes. More of the interview is expected to air Thursday.",R Kelly back in custody - World News - Castanet.net,Castanet.net,https://www.castanet.net/news/World/250802/R-Kelly-back-in-custody

According to Thompson, the populist party has mobilized the socially conservative Chinese-Canadian vote.","BURNABY—When Ivan Pak went to Maxime Bernier’s first rally in Vancouver last November, he says he was “inspired” by the new party leader’s clear platform and policy commitments. That’s the kind of leader Canada needs, he told Star Vancouver.

Maxime Bernier, leader of the new People’s Party of Canada, meets supporters on Thursday at an event prior to Monday’s federal byelection in Burnaby, B.C. ( Jesse Winter / Star Metro )

Bernier announced the “death of political correctness” via a Tweet last fall to his then 65,000 followers and launched the People’s Party of Canada, which has been gaining rapid traction. Widely viewed as aiming further right of the Conservative party, the PPC has been criticized for being anti-immigrant and espousing anti-globalist values and rhetoric. But Pak, a first-generation immigrant from China, dispels those critiques as myths. “Some people accuse the PPC of being a white people’s party of Canada, but for myself ... I learned to speak English here. I’ve been here 22 years,” he said on Thursday, holding up PPC signs waiting for Bernier to make his first appearance in Burnaby South since Monday’s byelection was called in the riding.

“PPC welcomes people like me to be part of their party as long as we share the same Canadian values.” But experts say core Canadian values are now divided and there’s very little common ground. Michael Valpy is a senior fellow in public policy at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy and a former Globe and Mail journalist who has been tracking the rise of ordered populism in Canada — or what economists refer to as “drawbridge-up” thinking.

Nathaniel Allen, who supports the People's Party of Canada, drove from Mission, B.C., to attend a campaign event in Burnaby on Thursday. Allen, a former member of the BC Liberals, says he was disillusioned with politics for years until Maxime Bernier's party came along. ( Jesse Winter / Star Vancouver )

Its proponents are often hostile toward immigration, deeply pessimistic about their economic future, mostly male and mainly white, he said. At Bernier’s event on Thursday in Burnaby South, this demographic was also present. Nathaniel Allen, 30, told the Star he was a BC Liberal — the provincial party widely known to embrace conservative policies — 12 years ago until he lost interest. It wasn’t until the PPC came along that he found himself civically engaged.

“It just felt like the most pragmatic decision I could make,” he explained. Read more:

How Canadian populism is playing out in the Burnaby South byelection Burnaby South People’s Party of Canada candidate alleges Conservative Party is ‘smearing’ her Liberal candidate’s WeChat post draws criticism for singling out race of byelection opponent Jagmeet Singh A Star investigation found that far-right supporters have called on their members to infiltrate the PPC, whether the party is willing or not. As the extreme right has done elsewhere, they hope to move on a new party, bit by bit, to bring the political extreme toward the mainstream. Meanwhile, the yellow vest faction — which started as a labour movement in France but has expanded in Canada beyond economic concerns, delving into anti-globalism, nationalism, anti-government sentiment and xenophobia — looks like it’s here to stay. Bernier was there to greet the United We Roll convoy when it arrived in Ottawa last Tuesday. The former federal Conservative cabinet minister, standing beside a man in a yellow vest, told the crowd he was there to promote Canadian unity. Canadians are increasingly opposed to more immigration — and it remains to be seen how that will play out in October’s federal election, Valpy said. Anti-immigrant sentiments often depend on the makeup of neighbourhoods, he added, pointing to the suburban area surrounding Toronto, known as the 905 because of its area code, which is “quite strongly” anti-immigrant despite not being a white majority community. That’s because if communities are homogenous — for instance, predominantly white, brown or Asian — anti-immigrant views can emerge. However, Valpy said, if neighbourhoods are mixed, anti-immigrant views are unlikely. “Ethnic attachment is declining and has declined quite rapidly,” he explained in an interview, citing data from Ottawa-based pollster EKOS Research Associates. “It’s no longer important to us that all our friends are all white, or we live in a brown community.” Valpy said unless there is some shift in inequality or people’s sense that progress is lost, ordered populism is here for the long haul. According to Ivan Pak and the PPC, the principles guiding Canadian values are freedom, personal responsibility, respect and fairness. Pak was a vocal opponent of the provincial education inclusion program for sexual identity and gender fluidity. He ran unsuccessfully on that platform for school trustee in Richmond in last fall’s municipal election. As president of the PPC Richmond Centre EDA, he isn’t eligible to vote in Monday’s byelection. The PPC has promised to lower taxes, abolish corporate welfare and stop supply management. On Thursday, Bernier also said he would privatize Canada Post and abolish the CRTC. The party has formed electoral district associations in all of Canada’s 338 ridings and Bernier has said he will run a full slate of candidates in October’s general election.

Pak said he was no longer keen on the Conservatives because the party has a “lack of leadership ability” (referring to its leader, Andrew Scheer) and “no clean platform.” He also slammed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “When you ask a question in the House of Commons, he never answers it. Is the question period just a joke? It looks like drama,” he said. “Our country is in debt and that debt has to be paid somehow. It will be my children and grandchildren suffering.” Pak was one of many other Chinese-Canadians greeting Bernier when he visited his Burnaby South byelection candidate — and one of his first picks under the new PPC banner — Laura-Lynn Thompson. She is a former Christian radio host, anti-abortion activist and a vocal opponent of B.C.’s student education plan on sexual orientation and gender fluidity, with ties to several community churches. Thompson told the Star last week she’s been able to mobilize the socially conservative Chinese-Canadian vote — and those ties may explain why. During each byelection debate, Thompson directly appealed to prevalent anxieties in the riding about public safety as she repeatedly brought up the case of Marrisa Shen, a 13-year-old girl killed in a Burnaby South park in July 2017. A Syrian refugee has been charged with murder in her death.

Meanwhile, several PPC supporters at the event on Thursday told the Star they were “sick” of identity politics at play in Canada. Sherolinnah Eang said she became a full-fledged PPC supporter after hearing the messaging about “family values and free speech.” “This is the first time I’ve come out for something like this, and I’ve lived in Canada for 45 years,” she said. Burnaby has four distinct town “centres,” a long working-class history and a population density triple that of the region. Its demographics are increasingly young and non-white, according to the 2016 census, and the average age is several years below B.C.’s average, while 64 per cent of its population identifies as a visible minority. On Thursday, Bernier argued diversity is not Canada’s strength — it’s unity. Asked how that message would land in such an ethnically diverse riding, he responded: “Yes, but they are Canadians first.” The response prompted cheers from PPC supporters, with several shouting: “I’m an immigrant.” Thompson, who uttered “Canadians first” at every byelection debate, will face off against federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh — vying for his first seat in the House of Commons — Liberal Richard Lee, Conservative Jay Shin and independents Valentine Wu and Terry Grimwood on Monday in Burnaby South. Byelections will also be held that day in York—Simcoe, Ont. and in Outremont, Que. David Moscrop, author of the new book Too Dumb for Democracy? Why We Make Bad Political Decisions and How We Can Make Better Ones, and a post-doctoral fellow in the University of Ottawa’s communications department, told the Star that while feelings of anti-globalism and xenophobia have always existed, they haven’t always had an electoral home. Moscrop said this is the perfect time for the PPC to do well because it can focus on locking down a smaller segment of the electorate. And there’s enough disaffection, which could express itself as support for the right-wing party. “This party didn’t even exist 15 minutes ago, so if (Laura-Lynn Thompson) can nab even 10 per cent, Bernier will be crowing for months,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there are more likely PPC voters than would self-report ... because sometimes people won’t admit something to a pollster. But behind the privacy of the voting screen? Many may mark an X for that candidate.” Melanie Green is a Vancouver-based reporter covering food, culture and policy.

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks during Question Period in the interim House of Commons in the West Block on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, February 27, 2019. REUTERS/Chris Wattie

The remarks by Jody Wilson-Raybould, made during almost four hours of sometimes dramatic testimony to the House of Commons justice committee, deepened the worst crisis of Trudeau’s tenure months before an October election.

Wilson-Raybould said she had confronted Trudeau over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

“I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau told a televised news conference in Montreal.

“I therefore completely disagree with (Wilson-Raybould’s) characterization of events,” he added, brushing off a demand from Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer that he step down.

The case forced the resignation of Trudeau’s principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed “consistent and sustained pressure” on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

“This pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,” she said, adding that some officials had made veiled threats unless she cooperated.

The head of the federal civil service, she said, told her that Trudeau would “find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kind (of) mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.”

Wilson-Raybould said those exchanges prompted her to think of the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when the U.S. attorney general and his top deputy quit rather than obey an order from President Richard Nixon to fire an investigator probing the Watergate scandal.

She added, however, under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly demoted in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She said she was convinced the SNC-Lavalin case had prompted her demotion.

‘NEED TO FIND A SOLUTION’

SNC-Lavalin was seeking a so-called deferred prosecution agreement to allow the firm to escape with a fine. Wilson-Raybould had the power to scrap the decision to go to trial but decided against it. A trial is pending for the company.

SNC-Lavalin has said it had sought to avoid a trial because the executives accused of wrongdoing had left the company and it had overhauled its ethics and compliance systems.

SNC-Lavalin is based in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals have said they need to pick up seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government.

Wilson-Raybould said officials cited the danger that the firm might cut jobs or move its headquarters out of Quebec if found guilty.

She cited several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau as among those weighing in. A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould said that during a Sept. 17 meeting with Trudeau, he asked her “to find a solution” for SNC-Lavalin.

“I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering with my role? ... I would strongly advise against it.’ The prime minister said: ‘No, no, no, we just need to find a solution.’”

Trudeau told the news conference that “our government will always focus on jobs” and said officials had discussed the implications of SNC-Lavalin cutting its workforce.

Wilson-Raybould said that in mid-December, her chief of staff expressed concerns about possible political interference during a chat with Butts.

Citing her chief of staff’s account of the exchange, Wilson-Raybould quoted Butts as saying: “There is no solution here that does not involve some interference.”","Ex-Canada minister to discuss ethics issues, may not tell all",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-politics-snc-lavalin-idUSKCN1QG2Q3

Two United Steelworkers Union (USW) locals issued a news release Wednesday saying some steelworkers went to Bratina's Ottawa office to talk about worker benefits and pensions.

They say, in a letter sent to Bratina, that he shouted ""f--k the steelworkers"" and ""f--k those Stelco pensioners"" before ""demanding they leave [his] office"" and ""violently"" slamming the door behind them.

The union is demanding an apology from Bratina, a former mayor of Hamilton.

The Hamilton East-Stoney Creek MP didn't address the specific details, but he acknowledged the Tuesday meeting was tense.

In an emailed statement, Bratina said he met with the Canadian Labour Congress Tuesday, including members of the steelworker locals.

""During the course of this meeting, the conversation became personal,"" said Bratina, who chairs an all-party steel caucus.

""It was clear that a productive conversation was not going to take place and I ended the meeting. As they were leaving, I assured them that we would continue to work hard for steelworkers and their employers despite this meeting.""

USW Local 1005 president Gary Howe said the members questioned Bratina about bankruptcy and insolvency laws.

""When they asked him why he hasn't kept his promise to advocate on behalf of Hamilton steelworkers to get the laws changed, he lost his temper and started shouting obscenities and saying very nasty things about steelworkers,"" Howe said in a news release.

Tony Ciaramella, president of Local 5328, said in the release that the steelworkers asked ""a legitimate question.""

""Not once has he stood in the house and said anything about changing the laws and protecting current or retired steelworkers,"" Ciaramella said.

​In an email, Howe and Ciaramella demand that Bratina ""do the right thing and publicly apologize immediately and unreservedly.""

Current and retired steelworkers have faced a wave of uncertainty in recent years. That wave has included recent tariffs imposed by the Trump administration in the U.S. that had some fearing for their jobs. In 2016, U.S. Steel Canada went into Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) protection, and steelworker pensioners' health-care benefits were temporarily paused.

Bratina, like other Hamilton MPs, campaigned on helping steelworkers, and has attended rallies both as an MP and when he was mayor of Hamilton.

Bratina said in the email that he respects unions, which ""play a key role in upholding the rights and protections of Canadian workers.""

""Canada's labour movement has led the way on work-life balance, safe working conditions and employment equity and diversity. Our government shares many of the same values and beliefs as the labour movement, and we need to continue working together to build on the success of the past three years.""

Scott Duvall, NDP MP for Hamilton Mountain, also serves on the all-party steel caucus. He's also a retired steelworker who recently introduced Bill 384, which would see pensioners become secure creditors when a company liquidates.

Duvall said news of the clash between Bratina and the steelworkers rippled through a Canadian Labour Congress social he attended.

""When I heard it, I was shocked,"" he said.

Duvall served on Hamilton city council when Bratina was mayor, he said, and ""he's had a few outbursts before.""

David Sweet, Conservative MP for Flamborough-Glanbrook, is vice-chair of the caucus.

He agrees more needs to be done for steelworkers and pensioners, although he wants to see a ""full hearing"" into the three acts that impact pensions.

He declined to comment on the incident. ""I'll let Mr. Bratina defend himself on that.""

The truth about Styrofoam

Is the right to repair ready for prime time?

(Michaela Rehle/Reuters)

When Michael Coteau's daughter dropped his Samsung Galaxy S8 this past fall, cracking it all over, the Ontario Liberal MPP kept using it for a while.

""But then it started irritating my ear, because the glass was kind of breaking apart,"" he said.

It's greener to repair such a device than recycle it and buy a new one — Nicole Mortillaro has pointed out how environmentally damaging it is to manufacture mobile devices. Recycling and disposal is also energy intensive, and many parts end up in the landfill.

But as CBC reported last fall, manufacturers often make it expensive and difficult to get devices repaired. They force customers to use ""authorized"" shops that often charge more than it would cost to buy a new device, restrict access to spare parts and manuals or even use software to render devices unusable if they've undergone ""unauthorized"" repair.

Coteau wanted to repair his Samsung, but given the aforementioned challenges, he ended up replacing it with a new phone. ""It's a waste,"" he said. ""It was a working device.""

These repair issues don't apply just to mobile devices, but increasingly to vehicles and smart appliances, from TVs to washing machines.

The good news is governments are starting to fight back with ""right to repair"" legislation. Last week, Coteau introduced a private member's bill amending Ontario's Consumer Protection Act that represents the first right to repair legislation ever proposed in Canada.

The bill would force brands to:

Provide consumers or electronics repair shops with replacement parts, software and tools for diagnosing, maintaining or repairing their products, for a fair price.

Provide electronic documents such as repair manuals for free.

Reset any electronic security that may disable the device during diagnosis, maintenance or repair.

Coteau said the goal is to reduce environmental waste, allow repairs to be made locally and encourage innovation.

The ""right to repair"" movement is picking up around the world for different kinds of products. Similar legislation for electronics is being considered in 18 U.S. states. A bill passed in Massachusetts in 2012 after a public referendum already requires car manufacturers to provide documents to allow anyone to repair their vehicles.

The U.S. also modified rules last fall allowing consumers to legally hack software in their devices as needed for repair and maintenance. In Europe, proposed right to repair legislation covers appliances such as fridges and washing machines.

Because Coteau isn't a member of Ontario's ruling party, his private member's bill may be stuck in debate for awhile.

In the meantime, here's some good news: ""Dumb"" devices — i.e. gadgets that don't contain a computer chip, like radios or blenders — can often be fixed for free at volunteer-run ""repair cafes"" across the country.

Meet a 12-year-old Canadian climate striker

(Andrew Gage)

If you've been following the news at all, you've likely heard about the youth-led protests worldwide in favour of greater climate action. The best-known participant is Sweden's Greta Thunberg, who has been skipping school every Friday since August to ""strike for climate."" The forthright 16-year-old, who has chastised adults at both the COP24 climate conference in December and the World Economic Forum in January, has inspired many young people — including 12-year-old Rebecca Wolf Gage (above).

Wolf Gage attends Shoreline Community Middle School in Victoria, and on the first Friday of every month, she and other students leave class and march down to the mayor's office to discuss local green initiatives.

What first inspired you to become involved in raising awareness of climate change?

My dad is very environmental, and he taught me about climate change from a young age. He inspires me almost every day, but didn't tell me to take on activism. Greta Thunberg also inspires me so much. If you have time to watch her interviews, please do. They are amazing! When I was five, I decided to support the Green Party even though my parents usually voted for a different party. That was when I realized that I was an environmental activist.

What has been the reaction of your teachers?

My teachers aren't supportive of me striking, but they're not unsympathetic. I have heard that some of the other strikers have less sympathetic teachers, and I'm lucky to have good ones at Shoreline Community Middle School.

Do you think your fellow students understand the importance of stopping climate change?

I find that most of my classmates either don't think that climate change is a big deal, or don't think there's any way to stop it. But I have a lot of friends who I strike with that are as passionate as I am about stopping climate change.

What sorts of climate-friendly ideas have you pitched to the mayor?

We started meeting with the mayor two months ago. Lisa Helps is the best mayor I've ever met around environmental issues. Many of us have addressed the CRD [Capital Regional District] board, where they announced the climate emergency resolution, brought forward by Mayor Helps. We have also set a goal of getting free bus passes for kids 18 and under throughout the CRD.

What are you planning in the coming months to keep this issue on people's minds?

For the coming months, we're going to try to advertise the climate strike as much as possible. On May 3, it's a huge national climate strike. In the summer, we are thinking about holding an environmental summer camp for youth to come learn about climate change and the climate strike. We have done a one-day enviro school before, and it was a success.

If you could do one thing to take this fight to the next level, what would it be?

If I could convince the Canadian government to set high climate targets and actually meet them, my dream would have come true. I think for now, an easier thing to do is to get 1,000 climate strikers in Victoria.

The Big Picture: Tidal power

In seeking ways to generate electricity, jurisdictions around the world inevitably look at their natural endowments. For countries with especially choppy waters, that has included tidal power, which exploits the kinetic energy of changing tides. Here's a look at the biggest tidal power projects in the world.

(CBC)

What's on your mind?

Nicole Mortillaro's story last week on OOM, a Canadian company that has created a standalone, off-grid power unit for large buildings, stirred a lot of interest — both positive and negative.

One reader wrote in to say, ""I started to get a little concerned when I learned that it takes companies off the grid, which in Ontario largely provides energy from clean sources, and will be providing electricity from natural gas.""

Another reader had this suggestion: ""The country does not need OOM or anything else. What it needs is reliable electricity hidden underground!"" The idea of burying power lines has been bandied about for a while — with the acknowledgement that it is a very expensive undertaking.

Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web

A new study suggests that the expansion of our urban environment is leading more animals to ingest ""human food,"" which is affecting their biology and behaviour. One example: Some bears are hibernating for shorter periods.

Canadian political watchers know that the popularity of the federal NDP has been flagging, notably in Quebec. This column suggests that in order to win back a large number of (environmentally minded) Quebecers, Jagmeet Singh's party should propose a Canadian version of the Green New Deal.

One big takeaway from this week: Government policies to reduce carbon emissions work. That was the finding of a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change, which revealed that between 2005 and 2015, CO2 levels in 18 countries (including many European countries and the U.S. — but not Canada) declined.

In what seems like poetic environmental justice, a research team led by RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, has figured out a carbon capture process that sucks CO2 out of the air and turns it into … coal.



Styrofoam and the environment: It's complicated

(Emily Chung/CBC)

Amid all the recent talk of banning plastic, many environmentally conscious consumers wonder: What about Styrofoam?

Also known as plastic foam, the scientific term for it is expanded polystyrene foam (EPS), and it can be found in everything from takeout containers to helmets to car bumpers.

The worldwide production capacity of polystyrene in 2016 was 14.7 million tonnes, according to industry group Plastics Insight. It is estimated that 80 per cent of Canada's foam packaging ends up in the garbage, contributing to the eight million tonnes of plastic annually discarded in oceans.

According to Science Learning Hub, it can take up to 500 years for one foam cup to break down.

Indianapolis-based plastic manufacturing expert Kelvin Okamato points out that there are two common versions of polystyrene: expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) and extruded polystyrene foam (XPS). EPS is used to create foam cups and takeout containers, whereas XPS is used to make packing material as well as insulation board for buildings.

The main reason polystyrene is so ubiquitous is that it is lightweight, rigid, versatile and able to withstand dramatic temperature changes. According to a 2016 study, 40 per cent of polystyrene is made for the food packaging industry — and EPS foam containers in the industry are at an all-time high.

Food Safety Magazine has noted that polystyrene foam trays are economically beneficial because they are cheap to produce and dispose of, and the fact that they're single-use helps with food safety.

While styrofoam has long seemed like an environmental villain, a recent European-based study found that manufacturing EPS containers has a lower environmental impact — minimal material and electricity requirements for manufacture — than two other common takeaway containers, which are made of aluminum and polypropylene.

Alberta-based manufacturing expert Odessa Ingarfield said the main problem is that polystyrene isn't manufactured to be recycled. In many places around the globe, polystyrene is difficult to recycle because its petroleum base is hard to break down, while the lightweight and clunky shape makes it expensive to transport.

So much of it gets thrown out.

""Designers now are asked to design a product, but not the recyclability of that product,"" said Ingarfield.

She believes that rather than banning EPS production, companies should be finding a way to repurpose it through a closed-loop recycling process, where waste is collected, processed and recycled back to its original material, or a two-stage processing facility.

Okamato and Ingarfield both believe changes to consumer behaviour will improve the environmental impact of polystyrene, and plastics more generally.

""If you want to use plastics, then make sure you know what you are using it for,"" said Ingarfield. ""If you plan on leaving [the item] behind to degrade, then don't use plastics.""

The former federal justice minister told the Commons justice committee yesterday that she faced ""veiled threats"" from the Prime Minister's Office this fall to ensure the Montreal-based company avoided prosecution on bribery and corruption charges.

In her testimony, Wilson-Raybould said officials repeatedly invoked potential job losses, and the context of the recent Quebec election, as reasons for offering a deferred prosecution agreement to SNC-Lavalin.

Premier François Legault, whose Coalition Avenir Québec party swept to power in that election, reiterated Thursday his support for an out-of-court settlement.

Legault campaigned on a promise to do more to keep Quebec companies from leaving the province. Since the election, he has said repeatedly that a protracted court case could make SNC-Lavalin vulnerable to a foreign takeover.

""There was already a risk. Is the risk heightened now? Yes,"" Legault told reporters in Quebec City. ""The company currently has no controlling shareholder.""

Premier François Legault reiterated on Thursday his support for an out-of-court settlement. (Jacques Boissinot/Canadian Press)

But Legault's own justice minister, former anti-corruption prosecutor Sonia Lebel, said her main concern was Wilson-Raybould's allegations of political interference.

""If what was said is true, it's troubling because we have to put our institutions [first], to protect them, and make sure there is no undue pressure,"" Lebel said.

""What is troubling is that it may have happened.""

Lebel pledged to never interfere with the decisions of the provincial prosecutors working under her. Court documents indicate they too could be called upon soon to decide whether to prosecute SNC-Lavalin.

The RCMP is working with the Quebec Crown in an ongoing investigation into a bribery scandal at the Federal Bridge Corporation.

Michel Fournier, the former head of the bridge corporation, pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped SNC-Lavalin secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge.

""I have no intention whatsoever to intervene in this matter,"" Lebel said. ""The rule of law is very important and we all live under it.""

'Why should I not believe her​?'

Wilson-Raybould's testimony also elicited mixed reactions on the other side of the aisle. At least two Liberal MNAs pointed out that the federal Liberal Party is a separate entity from its provincial namesake.

""Why should I not believe her,"" said Marwah Rizqy, who represents the Montreal riding of Saint-Laurent and who ran unsuccessfully for the federal Liberals in the 2015 election.

""If she said she faced pressure, then now the prime minister of Canada has to answer for that.""

Her colleague Gaétan Barrette, though, sounded more sympathetic to Justin Trudeau's position.

""I can say one thing: If I would have been in his place, the issue of maintaining those jobs would have been very significant for me,"" said Barrette, a cabinet minister in the last Liberal government.

He also pointed out that Wilson-Raybould herself said nothing illegal had been done, a detail he felt was being lost amid the controversy.

In a statement posted to Twitter, the member for Whitby, Ont., explained she had informed the prime minister and party whip of her ""tremendously difficult"" decision on Feb. 12.

She also stressed that her choice wasn't related to the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair and the testimony of her caucus colleague Jody Wilson-Raybould, who this week described interference by the prime minister and high-level government officials over her decision not to offer a deferred prosecution deal to the Quebec company.

She added she had immense respect for the former justice minister and attorney general and that would never change. The MP had commented several times on Twitter in support of Wilson-Raybould during the unfolding events surrounding her resignation from cabinet.

""Factors influencing this decision started long before Feb.12,"" the statement says. ""It is a personal decision, based on a number of factors.""

Caesar-Chavannes said her mind had been made up for months, dating back to before she decided not to continue as a parliamentary secretary in September.

Thank you Whitby and to the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/HereForCelina?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#HereForCelina</a> family. Please see my statement below: <a href=""https://t.co/VFN7omm7eU"">pic.twitter.com/VFN7omm7eU</a> —@MPCelina

She thanked her colleagues on both sides of the aisle for continuing to ""fight the good fight"" for Canadians.

Understanding some might be upset by her decision to step back from federal politics, she encouraged others —especially those who feel underrepresented — to run for public office.

""I will continue to push boundaries, dismantle the status quo and break glass ceilings, and I hope you will expect no less from me.""

Caesar-Chavannes had been a strong advocate for fighting the stigma around mental health. She was open about her own struggles with depression.

Twitter stand-off with Maxime Bernier

She also was known for calling out people for offensive remarks, including now-leader of the People's Party of Canada Maxime Bernier.

For months, the two were locked in a social media battle about identity politics.

In the spring of 2018, Bernier tweeted that Caesar-Chavannes believes ""the world revolves around"" her ""skin colour."" That was in response to Caesar-Chavannes chiding him in an interview with the Globe and Mail.

The feud began in March, when Bernier criticized the Liberal government's promotion of funding for ""racialized Canadians"" and said he thought the goal of anti-racism policy was to create a ""colour-blind"" society.

Caesar-Chavannes fired back, suggesting Bernier ""do some research ... as to why stating colour blindness as a defence actually contributes to racism.""

""Please check your privilege and be quiet,"" she added — provoking Bernier to invoke ""free speech.""

Elected in 2015, she served as the parliamentary secretary to the prime minister and to the minister of international development.

That's the advice from Ian Brodie, Stephen Harper's former chief of staff, following the shocking resignation of Jane Philpott from cabinet on Monday in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

On Monday, Philpott stepped down from her post as Treasury Board president, saying in a statement that she had ""lost confidence"" in how the government has dealt with the SNC-Lavalin case and in ""how it has responded to the issues raised.""

Philpott's resignation was the second high-profile departure from Trudeau's cabinet since this story first broke in the Globe and Mail. Former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, whose allegations against the prime minister and senior government officials are at the centre of the controversy, resigned from her cabinet position as veteran affairs minister on Feb. 12.

Brodie said Canada hasn't seen this kind of cabinet crisis since the closing years of the John Diefenbaker government. (Diefenbaker had three cabinet ministers resign over his nuclear arms policy in 1963.)

""Mr. Trudeau must now move quickly to shore up his cabinet support with a new Treasury Board minister while holding his caucus together,"" Brodie said in an email. ""He should hold an emergency caucus meeting as soon as possible to see if he has the support to continue on.""

Watch below: Trudeau comments on Philpott's resignation

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to a Liberal Party rally in Toronto Monday evening 2:46

Among cabinet members at least, Trudeau seems to be holding support. CBC News reached out to the remaining 33 members of cabinet, who all said they support the prime minister.

But with an election looming this fall and ongoing investigations, continued support is far from certain.

​The prime minister's political opponents, meanwhile, are already calling for further inquiry, with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer calling for Trudeau to quit and the RCMP to investigate. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who will soon take a seat in the House of Commons, wants a full public inquiry.

'It's big'

Last week, Wilson-Raybould testified in front of the parliamentary justice committee that when she was attorney general, she faced a ""consistent and sustained effort"" from several top government officials, including the prime minister, to intervene in a corruption and fraud case against SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.

Wilson-Raybould, who was later shuffled out of her justice portfolio to veterans affairs, said she resisted the pressure.

The resignation of Philpott, a key and highly respected cabinet minister in Trudeau's government, has significantly escalated this political crisis for the prime minister, said David McLaughlin, a former chief of staff to Brian Mulroney.

""It's big. A three-alarm fire for the Liberals just became a five-alarm fire,"" McLaughlin told Power & Politics host Vassy Kapelos.

Jane Philpott stepped down from her post as Treasury Board president, saying in a statement that she had ""lost confidence"" in how the government has dealt with the SNC-Lavalin controversy. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)

Trudeau's personal brand was already being ""corroded"" by the controversy, McLaughlin said. What's particularly damaging for Trudeau, he said, is that in her resignation letter, Philpott raised questions about the competency of the government.

Philpott has delivered a ""body blow"" to the government, McLaughlin said, making it worse by refusing to stick around before hearing the testimony from Gerald Butts, Trudeau's former principal secretary, who also resigned following the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

""She has helped destabilize the government."" McLaughlin said. ""It may not be a torpedo through the waterline that sinks the government but it is certainly destabilizing and it's listing more badly now.""

'Serious blow'

Penny Collenette, an adjunct professor of law at the University of Ottawa and a former Liberal campaign director, said the resignations of both Philpott and Wilson-Raybould are a ""serious blow to the Liberal Party and to politics in general.""

Collenette said in an email that the symbolic loss of two high-profile, hard-working female cabinet ministers is disappointing — particularly after the party worked so hard to recruit women into politics.

What the resignations will mean for Trudeau, who was out giving campaign-style speeches on Monday night, is an open question.

But Collenette noted that ""resignations are not politically fatal but the aftermath has to be handled wisely and elegantly.""

McLaughlin offered a similar take, citing former Manitoba NDP premier Greg Selinger, who lost five cabinet ministers in 2014 in a revolt against his leadership, but remained leader. (Until 2016, when he resigned as leader after losing big to the Progressive Conservatives).

A more recent example, he said, is that of British Prime Minister Theresa May, who had members of her cabinet resign over the Brexit deal, and even faced a leadership challenge.

""She's still standing,"" McLaughlin said. ""Now she's wounded and she may not be certain how much longer she will stand. But you can survive this provided you have a way of managing this inside and showing your colleagues there is a path forward.

""That's the part I don't think the prime minister or his office has yet shown their party.""

Former Liberal cabinet minister Sheila Copps said while Wilson-Raybould and Philpott had policy experience, they lacked political experience. She said in an email that both ""are doing their best to destroy their leader"" and should be booted from caucus.

The prime minister, Copps said, needs to ""surround himself with some wizened political people who can staunch the bleeding.""

Collenette also said Trudeau may need to do some work within the Liberal Party and make some changes to his inner circle.

""Most importantly, he must find a way to explain to Canadians what has happened, change the dial.""

Not very well. I think he has made this problem bigger than it may actually be. When the national newspaper here in Canada, The Globe and Mail, first broke this story three weeks ago the government immediately denied it and they've had an evolving storyline since then. They have seemingly now settled on the storyline that, ""Look, maybe there was pressure, but we were acting to save a leading Canadian business SNC-Lavalin.""

In the process of getting to this decision three weeks later they've lost a federal cabinet minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, they've lost the prime minister's principal secretary Gerald Butts, and they've potentially damaged the brand of the Liberal Party of Canada; and that's challenging for them given that we will be having an election here this October.

Sputnik: Mr Trudeau said that he sought to protect jobs and acted with respect to the country's laws and institutions, were you convinced by his response?

Tim Powers: Well, I'm sure it won't surprise you or your listeners to hear me say no. Look it's certainly the first job of a prime minister, particularly a Canadian one, I suspect any around the globe to stand up for jobs. That's not an unfair response, but the way this process unraveled and based on what Ms Wilson-Raybould said in her public testimony, the degree of interference that she felt she was being subject to, political interference, was quite high and maybe a bit uncommon, particularly, given that she had argued her department, the Department of Justice here in Canada had made a decision on September 4th.

She herself had come to the conclusion that it was the right decision on and around September 16th and she was still receiving pressure from the prime minister and his official dating up until December 18-19. So I think they couldn't take no for an answer, and I don't think it's mutually exclusive that you can adhere to both the rule of law while at the same time be out to protect jobs. So I think that's the public relations problem the prime minister now has, trying to explain how the two cannot coexist equally, when Ms Wilson-Raybould, who proved to be a very credible witness when she appeared before the Canadian Justice Committee, made the points that she did.

Tim Powers: All manner, I suppose. I suppose the most pressing one for him is that it could impact his re-election chances in 2019 when that vote takes place in October. A year ago people would've said he would have a cakewalk to re-election, I would say today he's still in the frontrunner's position, but it's been made a little bit tougher. So electoral consequences — one. The federal opposition leader here in Canada — Andrew Scheer — the leader of the Conservative Party, has called on him to resign and has also a called for the national police force — RCMP — to investigate him. One of our other leading political parties the New Democratic Party has asked for a public inquiry. If there were a police investigation, if there were a public inquiry depending what either of those endeavours discovered there could be legal consequences, criminal consequences, but neither of those things to the best of our knowledge are happening at the moment.

Sputnik: Why would the Trudeau office be interested in intervening in this corruption case?

Tim Powers: Because as the Canadian electoral map works, Quebec is a significant jurisdiction. The prime minister himself is from the province of Quebec. The liberals believe if they're going to get re-elected in 2019 they're going to need to win more electoral districts in Quebec than they currently have. There's opportunity there for them to do that as two of the parties that have done well traditionally in Quebec are losing support quite rapidly, and the Liberals have been picking it up.

SNC-Lavalin, the company in question, is a major Canadian business headquartered in Quebec, though it should be noted that only about 15% of its business is actually still in Canada. Nonetheless, they symbolize, and generally despite their corruption scandals, a long and important commercial history in the province. So Trudeau for all of those factors and his officials decided that an extra effort, perhaps, an unprecedented effort at least in the eyes of the former Attorney General Ms Wilson-Raybould was undertaken to save those jobs; to be very specific, if they are criminally convicted in Canada under our current legislation they would be banned from working on federal projects, government of Canada projects in Canada for the next 10 years. So that's what the Liberal government through the prime minister's office was trying to intervene in and change.

Tim Powers: I don't see that happening because we are so close to the election. When that call was made the other evening after Ms Wilson-Raybould's testimony, the prime minister made the point, ""Look, Canadians will have the opportunity to decide my fate this fall."" I don't envision him stepping down, unless there's something new that emerges. I think he still believes, and he's probably not wrong based on the public opinion research that we have done, to believe he still has a lot of credibility in key pockets of the Canadian electorate. So I don't see him stepping down. I think he'll continue to make the argument that, ""Look, I was standing up for jobs and this is fair and right, and besides that no decision was actually made to change the course of the legal actions that are pending on SNC-Lavalin.""

Trudeau, who disputed Wilson-Raybould’s allegations and rejected an opposition call that he resign, got the support on Thursday of a top ally inside his Cabinet, indicating there was no immediate pressure inside his Liberal Party to oust him over the scandal.

SNC-Lavalin has about 9,000 employees in Canada, including about 3,400 in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up seats in a federal election this October to stand a chance of retaining a majority government.

Here are some key facts about the case and the company at the center of the controversy.

WHAT IS SNC-LAVALIN’S INVOLVEMENT?

Montreal-based construction and engineering firm SNC-Lavalin was charged in 2015 by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada with bribing Libyan officials to influence the awarding of contracts between 2001 and 2011.

The company had tried unsuccessfully to avoid trial, arguing instead for a negotiated settlement since it had cleaned shop by changing executives and overhauling its ethics and compliance systems in recent years. The preliminary hearings in the case are ongoing, SNC-Lavalin spokeswoman Daniela Pizzuto said on Thursday.

Neil Bruce, who took over as SNC-Lavalin’s chief executive in 2015 and led its C$3.6 billion ($2.7 billion) acquisition of British engineering and consultancy WS Atkins two years later, said the firm had done “nothing wrong” in the political crisis. and that “we have never asked for charges to be dropped.”

WHAT IS AT STAKE?

Canadian government officials said they were concerned about the potential for job losses, especially in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec.

“The consequences for the economy are always very important and my staff are always talking to other people in government to ensure that we consider the need to protect jobs,” Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters on Thursday.

Wilson-Raybould told a hearing on Wednesday that officials in the offices of Trudeau and Morneau had cited the risk of SNC-Lavalin cutting jobs or moving its headquarters out of Quebec if found guilty. The company faces being barred from bidding on Canadian contracts for 10 years.

In 2016, SNC-Lavalin admitted that some former executives had illegally arranged donations of more than C$80,000 to the Liberals from 2004 to 2011.

The company is also facing pressures on its bottom line as an August 2018 dispute between Canada and Saudi Arabia weighs on its contracts in the Middle East kingdom. SNC-Lavalin also wrote down C$1.2 billion in oil and gas assets, which resulted in a C$1.6 billion fourth-quarter loss.

COMPANY SNAPSHOT

The company generated total revenue of C$10 billion ($7.6 billion) in 2018. About 10 percent of total revenues came from Saudi Arabia. It employed 52,435 at the end of December, with over 15 percent working in Saudi Arabia.

As of year’s end 2018, SNC-Lavalin reported a total backlog of C$14.9 billion and had $634.1 million of cash and cash equivalents.",Factbox: Political storm engulfing Canada's Trudeau puts SNC-Lavalin in focus,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-politics-snc-lavalin-factbox-idUSKCN1QH2ZT
127,Empty,2019-02-26T09:00:00Z,"Scheer ought to have made a distinction between his support for Canadian oil workers, and support for the racism and violence that has been associated with United We Roll.","Many of the participants in last week's United We Roll convoy said they were there to unite Canadians around a pipeline. Others had more specific goals: to see the Liberal government cancel bills C-69 and C-48, which critics charge will act as enormous industry obstacles.

But as several observers noted watching the convoy make its way to Ottawa from Alberta, United We Roll had also become a space for far-right groups to spew racism and xenophobia. Signs denouncing open borders, protesting Canada signing on to the global migration pact and accusing the prime minister of treason hung alongside signs supporting pipelines. Some convoy participants wore hats that said ""Make Canada Great Again,"" a nod to U.S. President Donald Trump's slogan that has become associated with denigrating Mexicans, asylum seekers and banning Muslims from entering the U.S.

Because the convoy has become affiliated with such unsettling rhetoric, unwavering support from high-profile Conservative politicians — such as Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who addressed the group last week — is troubling, and could potentially hurt the party's chances in the upcoming fall election.

Tapping into frustration

It's clear why Conservative politicians would want to support the rally. With seemingly endless controversy swirling around Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his role in pressuring (or not) former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould over SNC-Lavalin, the Conservatives surely want to seize the opportunity to marry new political scandal with longstanding frustration over pipeline inertia. And with Maxime Bernier trying to make inroads with the further right areas of the party's base, Conservatives need to show unwavering support for western Canada, pipelines and the oil and gas industry.

But Scheer ought to have made a distinction between his support for Canadian oil workers, and support for the racism and violence that has been associated with United We Roll. Conservative Senator David Tkachuk even told the crowd to ""roll over"" Liberals across the country, and he has since refused to apologize.

The rally has also been associated with Yellow Vests Canada, a group whose Facebook page is rife with racist and xenophobic views, particularly towards Muslims and immigrants. In fact, the United We Roll convoy was originally named the Yellow Vest Convoy, but was changed due to the obviously problematic association.

Members of the Yellow Vests Canada Facebook group have advocated for MP Iqra Khalid to be deported, called visible minorities sub-human and scum, and made death threats against the prime minister. Despite that, United We Roll lead organizer Glen Carritt implied that everyone would be welcome to attend (""It doesn't matter — you can wear a yellow vest, or blue coveralls or black hardhat or suit and tie,"" he said) and Yellow Vest organizer Mark Friesen was indeed in attendance.

One of the speakers at the rally was Faith Goldy, who was fired from Rebel Media after appearing on a neo-Nazi podcast, and who regularly bemoans the erosion of ""white identity."" Scheer spoke on the same platform that she did, ignoring what should be a toxic association.

On Tuesday a convoy of trucks arrived in Ottawa. The rolling protest is driven by Canadians who want pipelines, hate carbon taxes and are calling for more help for the Alberta economy. But there is another element: some in the group have also been protesting immigration and using hateful, racist, language. Today on Front Burner, CBC's David Common and Rosemary Barton explain the complicated politics around this protest. 25:58

With recent polls showing the Conservatives are in a position to form government, the party needs to start clarifying what, exactly, it stands for.

Before the last federal election in 2015, Conservatives were riding high in the polls and a renewed government was within reach. But in late September and early October, the Conservatives doubled-down on their previous decision to ban the niqab in citizenship ceremonies and pledged to implement a tip line for ""barbaric cultural practices."" Almost a week after this announcement, Conservatives declined in the polls and never recovered.

The unwillingness to address — or even acknowledge — these racist and xenophobic undercurrents in United We Roll plays right into progressive messaging that the party is too cozy with the far-right. It also puts the party at risk of alienating centrists in swing ridings who would otherwise be open to voting for Conservatives, but are hesitant to align themselves with a party that refuses to even acknowledge (never mind denounce) hateful views.

It could also point to an absence of political courage. During the presidential election in 2008, Republican John McCain defended Barack Obama against racist questions from audience members during a town hall event. Scheer could just as easily have spoken at the United We Roll rally by telling protestors he supports their efforts with regards to the oil and gas industry, while simultaneously chastising the racist and xenophobic rhetoric that was circulating.

Instead, Scheer simply stated: ""We're standing with you.""

That made it easy for critics to paint Conservatives as bowing to pressures of the far-right. The question for Canadians now becomes, are the Conservatives out of touch, or willfully ignoring this rhetoric? And if elected prime minister, would Scheer remain silent if people continue to publicly spew this hate?

The Conservatives' failure to draw a line in the sand between legitimate grievances about the oil and gas industry and illegitimate grievances about immigrants, Muslims and minorities will ultimately hamper the party's ability to reconnect with voters in diverse urban and suburban communities across the country. Voters they will desperately need to win October's election.

128,Empty,2019-03-06T09:00:00Z,"Three weeks after his resignation, Gerald Butts, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's former principal secretary, is returning to the political playing field today to give testimony and answer questions about the ever-widening SNC-Lavalin scandal.","When Gerald Butts announced his resignation as Justin Trudeau's principal secretary, his reasoning suggested he feared allegations springing from the then-burgeoning SNC-Lavalin controversy might be a distraction for the prime minister.

""My reputation is my responsibility and that is for me to defend,"" he wrote in a statement. ""It is in the best interests of the office and its important work for me to step away.""

The scandal centres around one key question: whether the prime minister and senior members of his team tried to pressure the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to step in and resolve the corruption and fraud case against SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.

This pressure is alleged to have come in an effort to spare the Montreal-based engineering and construction giant from criminal prosecution and potentially save thousands of jobs that could be lost from a guilty verdict. If convicted, the company could be blocked from competing for federal government contracts for a decade.

Now, just over three weeks later, Butts is returning to the political playing field, his apparent act of political self sacrifice seeming to have had no effect on quelling the drama unfolding in Ottawa. As Trudeau struggles to get ahead of the controversy, Butts can only hope his testimony at the House of Commons justice committee will help counter the fallout that has sparked a political crisis within the Liberal government.

Indeed, since Butts's departure from Trudeau's inner circle of key aides, the ramifications from this — one of the biggest federal political scandals in years — have continued to escalate. If social media is any indication, the controversy is being keenly observed by the Canadian public.

Based on data shared with CBC News by Twitter Canada, on the day Wilson-Raybould testified, the volume of conversation using the #cdnpoli hashtag was the second highest ever, exceeded only by the October 2015 election.

Hottest ticket

Last week's testimony of Wilson-Raybould before the justice committee was the hottest ticket in Ottawa in recent memory, and certainly since the SNC-Lavalin scandal broke. But Butts's appearance today is a close runner-up. While the committee will hear again from Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, and Nathalie Drouin, deputy minister of justice and deputy attorney general, Butts is the main event.

His appearance comes just two days after the shocking resignation of Jane Philpott, a key and highly respected minister, who stepped down from her post as Treasury Board president, saying she had ""lost confidence"" in how the government has dealt with the SNC-Lavalin case and in ""how it has responded to the issues raised.""

Trudeau's principal secretary expected to bring documents and talk dates before House judiciary committee. 2:17

Butts had informed committee chair, Liberal MP Anthony Housefather, that after watching the testimony of Wilson-Raybould, he believed his evidence ""will be of assistance to the Justice and Human Rights Committee in its consideration of these matters.""

As principal secretary, Butts remained behind the scenes, speaking to reporters on background but not for attribution. However, he was particularly outspoken on Twitter, where he would engage with, or lash out at critics and journalists, promote and champion the Liberal Party and defend his former boss.

Trudeau has repeatedly stated that he disagrees with Wilson-Raybould's characterization of events, and that he makes no apologies for trying to save jobs. But some Liberal MPs have expressed concerns that Butts, to defend his actions and those of the prime minister, may revert to his attack dog Twitter persona, the ever loyal political servant launching a full throttled counter-attack.

'Categorically' denies political interference

In his resignation statement, Butts ""categorically"" denied the claims of any attempt at political interference, saying that ""any accusation that I or the staff put pressure on the attorney general is simply not true.""

On Feb. 27, Jody Wilson-Raybould testified that when she was attorney general, she was pressured by top government officials, including the prime minister, to step in and resolve the corruption and fraud case against SNC-Lavalin. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)

These words, however, are at odds with the testimony of Wilson-Raybould, who claimed that Butts, along with the prime minister and other senior government officials, were involved in the ""consistent and sustained effort"" to pressure her to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

Butts will have to answer, or want to clarify, accusations that within those conversations there were ""express statements regarding the necessity of interfering in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential of consequences, and veiled threats"" if Wilson-Raybould didn't acquiesce to the prime minister's wishes.

SNC-Lavalin had hoped that its fraud and corruption charges could be resolved with what's known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), which would spare the company a trial and possible criminal conviction. But in October, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada determined SNC-Lavalin had not met the criteria for a DPA.

Wilson-Raybould testified that despite pressure from top government officials, she had made up her mind on SNC-Lavalin and was not going to interfere.

Butts will likely address, or face questions, about at least three meetings Wilson-Raybould raised during her testimony.

'He does not like the law': The ​Château Laurier meeting

Butts will likely give his side of events regarding a meeting he had with Wilson-Raybould on Dec. 5, 2018, at the famous Château Laurier hotel in Ottawa. She had met with Butts, she testified, to speak with him, in part about ""the barrage of people hounding me and my staff"" over the SNC-Lavalin case.

She said she raised with Butts how she needed everyone to stop talking to her about SNC-Lavalin, that she had made up her mind on the issue and that ""the engagements were inappropriate.""

But Butts, she said, stressed how they needed a solution on the SNC-Lavalin file and that she ""needed to find a solution.""

As well, Butts, she said, talked to her about how ""the statute was a statute passed by Harper and that he does not like the law. I said something like, 'That is the law that we have.'""

Wilson-Raybould was referring to the Harper government's 2006 Director of Public Prosecutions Act, which, in an effort to quash political interference stated that an attorney general can overrule a decision by the director of public prosecution, but it must be made public.

'Some interference': Meeting with Wilson-Raybould's chief of staff

​Butts is also likely to give testimony about a meeting he, along with Katie Telford, Trudeau's chief of staff, had on Dec. 18 last year with Wilson-Raybould's then-chief of staff Jessica Prince.

At the committee hearing, Wilson-Raybould read from what she said was a text conversation between herself and Prince following the meeting.

Prince, according to Wilson-Raybould, said that Butts and Telford were looking for a solution, wanted external counsel, preferably a former Supreme Court of Canada judge, to give the then-attorney general an opinion on whether she could review her decision.

Wilson-Raybould said that Prince told them that would be interference. Butts is said to have responded: ""Jess, there is no solution here that does not involve some interference.""

Butts may also be able to comment, or explain, remarks alleged to have been made by Telford, in which she said that if Wilson-Raybould was nervous about revisiting her decision, ""we would of course line up all kinds of people to write op-eds saying that what she is doing is proper.""

'Are you questioning the integrity of the prime minister?'

Butts may also be asked whether Wilson-Raybould was shuffled out of her role as attorney general because of her intransigence on SNC-Lavalin. Wilson-Raybould said she raised those concerns with both Trudeau and Butts about this issue but they denied that was the case.

In a conversation with Butts, she said she ""specifically said that 'I know this has to do with SNC and a decision that I wouldn't take,' to which he said: 'Are you questioning the integrity of the prime minister?' I didn't say anything to that.""

The federal government is providing $37.5 million through its Strategic Innovation Fund. Of that, $15 million is a grant and $22.5 million is a conditionally repayable loan, according to BioVectra president Oliver Technow.

It is part of a $144.6 million, five-year project to expand the company's facilities in Charlottetown and Windsor, N.S. Over the course of the expansion, the company expects to create 110 jobs in Windsor and 40 in Charlottetown.

BioVectra manufactures pharmaceutical products used in the treatment of cancer, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and multiple sclerosis. The project will support active pharmaceutical ingredient production in Charlottetown, and expand the biologics capabilities in Windsor.

At the news conference, Technow said adding mammalian cell culture capability to the Windsor plant will make BioVectra a powerhouse in the international biologics space.

""Don't underestimate us only because we are not located in one of the major population centres of the country. I would not want to be located anywhere else,"" said Technow.

""What has been built here with tremendous vision and commitment and pride over the last 40 plus years has put us in a position here to compete on the highest global level.""

'Don't underestimate us,' says BioVectra president Oliver Technow. (Laura Meader/CBC)

In his remarks Trudeau echoed that sentiment.

""Innovation doesn't just happen in Toronto or Montreal. Ground-breaking discoveries are made from coast to coast to coast,"" he said.

""We're investing so that parents can rest easy about paying their bills and young people don't have to move away to start their career. Our government is committed to building new opportunities for people everywhere, including in rural communities.""

After his remarks on BioVectra, Trudeau opened up the floor to general questions from the media.

He addressed concerns about two Canadians who are being detained in China.

He also briefly addressed the question of whether ex-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould would be allowed to remain in the Liberal caucus, saying it was still under consideration. Trudeau's visit comes at a difficult time for his government, with allegations that he and members of his staff acted inappropriately in conversations with Wilson-Raybould about the potential prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

He emphasized the importance of preserving jobs in regards to the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Breakfast fundraiser

Trudeau had several events scheduled in the Charlottetown area Monday morning.

His morning started with a Liberal Party fundraising breakfast at the Delta Prince Edward.

Speaking at the breakfast, Trudeau outlined what he saw as some of the accomplishments of his government.

They included the lowest level of unemployment in decades and a decrease in poverty levels. He noted housing is a massive priority on P.E.I.

He also outlined the difference between how his party deals with the anxiety Canadians have about the future, and how he believes the Conservative Party will deal with it.

""Conservatives are going to keep trying to scare people about the future, and we're going to be showing people how we're going to build a stronger future together,"" he said.

Toronto, Canada - A leading Cabinet minister in Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Prime Minister Trudeau's government resigned Monday, becoming the second minister to step down over a scandal that has shaken the government in an election year.

Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, considered a star minister, said in a resignation letter that it was ""untenable"" for her to continue in the Cabinet because she lost confidence and could not defend the government.

Philpott's friend, former Attorney General and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, testified last week that Trudeau and senior members of his government inappropriately tried to pressure her to avoid prosecution of a major Canadian engineering company in a case involving allegations of corruption in Libya.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from Cabinet last month after being demoted to veteran affairs minister the month before.

The scandal has rocked Trudeau's government. Gerald Butts, his closest adviser and best friend, also resigned last month and is scheduled to testify Wednesday before a Parliament justice committee in Trudeau's defense.

Preview: Prime Minister Trudeau

""I know Philpott has felt this way for some time. And while I am disappointed, I understand her decision to step down. I want to thank her for her service,"" Trudeau said at a campaign-style event.

Trudeau said he takes the concerns very seriously and said the matter has generated an important discussion.

""But at the same time, we need to keep in mind the bigger picture,"" Trudeau said.

Trudeau has acknowledged raising the issue with Wilson-Raybould, but has said that was appropriate.

""I have concluded that I must resign as a member of Cabinet,"" Philpott wrote. ""Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised.""

Philpott, a physician, is a former minister of health and minister of indigenous services and was widely viewed as of one of Trudeau's most competent Cabinet ministers.

""The evidence of efforts by politicians and/or officials to pressure the former Attorney General to intervene in the criminal case involving SNC-Lavalin, and the evidence as to the content of those efforts have raised serious concerns for me,"" Philpott wrote.

""I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities and constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one's principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.""

Philpott said she would continue as a Parliament member for Trudeau's Liberal Party.

Wilson-Raybould said the same last week but declined to say she had confidence in Trudeau. Trudeau said earlier Monday he was still deciding whether Wilson-Raybould could remain a member of his party in Parliament.

Trudeau thanked Philpott for her service in a short statement that said he would have more to say later in Toronto.

The leader of the opposition Conservative Party, Andrew Scheer, said at a news conference that Philpott's resignation demonstrates ""a government in total chaos"" and called again for Trudeau to resign and for a police investigation of the affair.

Wilson-Raybould testified last week she was pressured to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin. The agreement would have allowed the company to pay reparations but avoid a criminal trial on charges of corruption and bribery. But Wilson-Raybould said the pressure was not illegal and said she was not instructed to interfere.

If convicted criminally, the Montreal-based company would be banned from receiving any federal government business for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is an economic force in Canada, with 9,000 employees in the country and about 50,000 worldwide.

""This is a spectacular blow to the government"" said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. ""It has become rare that ministers resign on principle in Canada. And now we've had two in such a short time. It reveals deep division in the Cabinet about how to deal with Jody Wilson-Raybould.""

He said he thinks that most ministers and Liberal lawmakers want to kick her out of the party and that Philpott does not agree with them.

Wiseman said the last time he can recall something like this was in 1963 when three Cabinet ministers resigned over then Prime Minister John Diefenbaker's opposition to the stationing of American nuclear weapons on Canadian soil.

""This blow won't bring down the government, and Trudeau, like Diefenbaker, will survive and fight back,"" Wiseman said.

Robert Bothwell, a professor at the University of Toronto, said the resignations speak to Trudeau's failure to connect with his own troops.

""His failure to give a vigorous but reasoned response at the beginning of this pseudo-scandal allowed it to grow into Godzilla,"" Bothwell said.

Bothwell said Trudeau is not like his father, the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who swept to office in 1968 on a wave of support dubbed ""Trudeaumania"" and governed for most of the next two decades.

""Previous prime ministers benefited from experience and seniority, or respect, or fear, or just the feeling that they knew the way better than anybody else. Trudeau the father had all these attributes,"" Bothwell said.",Canadian PM Justin Trudeau faces election year corruption scandal,CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/canadian-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-election-year-corruption-scandal/

And, as Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau seems to be finding out, being a politician known for high ethical standards is often like being Batman. Trudeau — the blue-eyed boy of Western liberals, the diversity-loving, immigrant-welcoming anti-Trump — is caught in the middle of a script that threatens to tarnish the carefully curated image.

The SNC-Lavalin scandal involves bribes allegedly paid to Libyan government officials during the Muammar Gaddafi era to secure contracts, as well as defrauding the Libyan government. Trudeau and his staff have been accused of scuttling the investigation into the matter by pressuring the justice minister at the time, Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Trudeau probably understands more than most the power of a narrative, of image and personal brand in politics. He has consistently presented himself as a feminist. Now the appearance of trying to professionally intimidate a woman colleague, and being accused of demoting her when his office didn’t get its way, is bound to hurt the Liberal Party in an election year. Of course, leading politicians in democracies older and larger than Canada have been accused of batting for particular companies. But strongmen can power through scandals in a way that those presenting themselves as the answer to the immoralities of their time cannot.

MONTREAL—Justin Trudeau was damaged goods before Treasury Board President Jane Philpott followed her friend and former colleague Jody Wilson-Raybould out of his cabinet.

Until late Monday, most Liberals believed that now that Wilson-Raybould had laid her cards on the table and described what she called sustained attempts of high-level political interference in the legal handling of SNC-Lavalin’s legal file, the worst was behind them.

With Philpott’s resignation — offered in support of Wilson-Raybould — the SNC-Lavalin affair enters a new lethal phase for the prime minister. Until further notice, all bets are off as to its outcome.

For a government leader to lose one leading minister to a battle of wills is unfortunate but usually manageable. To lose two over the same crisis is both extremely rare and potentially politically fatal. It certainly screams ineptitude at crisis management on the part of a prime minister.

They stand to be more shaken by this second resignation than they were by anything they heard over the course of the former attorney general’s testimony last Wednesday.

They initially worked together on the medically assisted death legislation and subsequently on the Indigenous file.

Over the past three years, both have butted heads with the PMO over various files. There is no doubt that they have often compared notes.

And yes, there are probably not enough fans of the ex-attorney general left at the cabinet table for this latest resignation to be the start of a chain reaction.

But the former treasury board president was also widely considered both one of the top performers in the Liberal cabinet and one of the government’s steadiest hands. She is a popular member of the Liberal caucus. Like the former attorney general, she plans to remain in that caucus.

Both may well believe they will outlive Trudeau’s leadership. Monday’s events make that more plausible.

Philpott did not have a dog in the Wilson-Raybould/Trudeau battle over whether to offer SNC-Lavalin a negotiated plea in lieu of a criminal trial.

In her resignation letter she wrote that she was leaving because in conscience and even in the name of cabinet solidarity, she could not stand behind the prime minister.

A lot of voters will be tempted to set their watches in the SNC-Lavalin saga on this moment when in her judgment Trudeau’s actions were indefensible.

It is not as if the prime minister has so far offered the electorate much to chew on in his own defence. If he was waiting for his government to be on the brink of implosion before rising to the challenge of making his case in the SNC-Lavalin matter, Trudeau now has his work cut out for him.

This crisis is entering its fourth week and every single one of them has featured an escalation that has brought it closer to the point of no return for the government, or at least for its current leader.

Over that time, Canadians have caught glimpses of their prime minister with each of his appearances managing to make things if not worse, at least not much better.

Trudeau spent the first week climbing down from a total denial of what were then anonymous allegations of political interference in the judicial file of the engineering firm.

Since Wilson-Raybould put her name to those allegations — and presented documentation to back up her claim — Trudeau still has offered little more than boilerplate statements to counter her narrative.

It has been as if he did not believe voters were worthy of a substantial explanation from the mouth of their prime minister.

This is the biggest crisis of Trudeau’s tenure and Canadians should probably be thankful that the issue at its epicentre is not a very complex one.

At the end of the day, the consequences of mismanaging the SNC-Lavalin affair are ultimately most damaging for the government itself.

The same ineptitude applied to a unity crisis of the kind Jean Chrétien faced after he nearly lost the 1995 Quebec referendum, or to a global financial crisis like the one Stephen Harper had to navigate Canada through in 2008, would have resulted in more than damage to the Liberal brand.

If Trudeau still wants to be prime minister; if he wants his Liberal party to have a fighting chance at re-election with him as leader this fall, he’s going to have to raise his game awfully fast. It is not clear from his conduct over the past three weeks that he can.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The leader of Canada's main opposition party demanded on Wednesday that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau quit after a former justice minister said government officials inappropriately pressured her to help a major firm avoid a bribery trial.

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould dramatically deepened the biggest crisis of Trudeau's tenure just months ahead of an October election in which his Liberals face a tough fight.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that she had confronted Trudeau over what she called inappropriate pressure to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade a corruption trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, demanded the resignation of what he called a disgraced prime minister.

""He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,"" Scheer told reporters, calling for police to immediately probe the matter. Trudeau is due to address reporters later on Wednesday.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed ""consistent and sustained pressure"" on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

""In my view, these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter and that this pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,"" she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould, who named several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister.

Trudeau and other officials deny inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould. But the case forced the resignation of Trudeau's principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

Opinion polls show the affair is starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of what looks set to be a tightly contested federal election in October.

Politics is about ‘conflicting interests’

I regret that as a lifelong fiscal conservative I find myself writing to defend Justin Trudeau.

Once elected, a government must balance many conflicting interests, and a prime minister should be able to expect that the party, the caucus and especially the cabinet understands these issues. If a cabinet minister cannot deal with the fact that they will be lobbied to the bitter end, they have no place in cabinet. If they insist that they are correct beyond the wishes of their peers they can resign or they can accept a different portfolio.

That is what politics, government and governing is all about. It’s not always pretty or fair, but that is what it is. Jody Wilson-Raybould decided she could play above the cut and thrust of politics. I think not. Goodbye and good luck.

Dick Mackin, Burnaby

Change bidding law

I hope all the legalistic truth-tellers don’t precipitate us back into Harperism, or even Jagmeet Singhism.

Why should Canadian companies have to maintain a higher standard than those in the U.S. or Britain? I guess Jody Wilson-Raybould has no idea of the historical realities of this country. If the law barring companies convicted of criminality from bidding on public project for 10 years is the stumbling block, change it.

Lesley Bohm, Vancouver

She’s just being ethical

I have listened to several political commentators puzzle over what might be Jody Wilson-Raybould’s “end game.”

I can only conclude that they are missing the obvious. She is standing by her integrity.

Committee should have homeowners

It appears Karen Sawatzky, past chair of Vancouver’s renters’ advisory committee, may have blinders on when describing homeowners as “having that level of wealth.” Owning a home is not cash in your pocket — in fact, it is quite the opposite when you consider the property purchase tax, property taxes, utility bills, and maintenance. In most cases, renters aren’t responsible for those.

Sawatzky may be a model tenant, but not every landlord or tenant is. Renters assume zero risk. A renter may well be the wealthy person as they are free to invest any residual money as they see fit. If the council wants to include homeowners in the new affordable housing advisory committee, I welcome it.

Good-paying jobs good for B.C.

I disagree with columnist Vaughn Palmer’s concerns about union jobs creating contracts that are more expensive.

I find it strange that when this type of business is done, that the perks of the wages that union workers get always comes into question. The tax base that good-paying jobs creates for both the provincial and federal governments is extensive. The ripple effect for the province in general from good-paying jobs is also extensive.

John McNiff, Surrey

Still lots of poverty

It’s been a long time since I can remember reading any good news about poverty, so thanks to columnist Andrew Coyne for drawing attention to the recent declines in Canadian poverty rates.

Nevertheless, according to the latest Statistics Canada numbers, there are still 3.4 million Canadians living in poverty, including more than 600,000 children and more than 200,000 seniors. While overall numbers are declining, particularly for children, the numbers for seniors are unfortunately on the rise.

As fewer than half of Canadians, and even fewer younger workers, have an employer pension plan, it is likely that without government intervention the number of poor seniors will continue to climb.

Ex-justice minister and ex-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould called it ""incredibly inappropriate"" but said she didn't think it was illegal because she wasn't instructed to seek a settlement. She said 11 people tried to interfere in her prosecutorial discretion including Trudeau.

In a meeting with Trudeau, the prime minister raised the issue and asked her to ""help out"" with the case, she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she asked Trudeau if he was politically interfering with her role as attorney general and told him she would strongly advise against it.

""No, no, no. We just need to find a solution,"" she said Trudeau responded.

She said Trudeau told her that if Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin didn't get a deferred prosecution there would be jobs lost and the company would move its headquarters from Montreal to London and noted he was a lawmaker from Quebec. Wilson-Raybould said she was ""barraged"" and subjected to ""hounding"" by members of the government.

Trudeau disputed her view of events.

""I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally, and therefore I completely disagree with the characterization of the former attorney general about these events,"" he said at a news conference.

Trudeau said the decision on whether to forgo prosecution and enter a plea agreement with the company was hers and hers alone.

He also welcomed the investigation of the ethics commissioner while he rejected calls by the leader of the opposition Conservative Party to resign, saying Canadians will have a choice later this year in parliamentary elections.

""My job as prime minister is to stand up for jobs. I have done that and will continue to do that. That is a fundamental role of a Canadian prime minister,"" Trudeau said.

Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer also said police should investigate and called Trudeau a disgraced prime minister. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the opposition NDP, said there should be a public inquiry but stopped short of calling for Trudeau to step down.

""He may need to resign because of this,"" he said. ""What we heard today was explosive.""

Trudeau's government has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Feb. 7 that Trudeau or his staff pressured her to try to avoid a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin over allegations of corruption involving government contracts in Libya. Critics say that would be improper political meddling in a legal case.

""For a period of approximately four months, between September and December of 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada,"" she told a Parliament justice committee.

The scandal has been a significant blow to Trudeau, who is facing an election this year.

Gerald Butts, Trudeau's closet adviser, resigned last week but denied that he or anyone else pressured Wilson-Raybould. Michael Wernick, the top civil servant in the government, has also said that no inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from the Cabinet on Feb. 12 as veteran affairs minister but gave no reasons. She had been unexpectedly demoted from justice minister last month, and was furious, releasing a 2,000-word statement after that.

""I was concerned I was shuffled because of a decision I would not take with SNC, I raised those concerns with the PM,"" she said. ""Those concerns were denied.""

Wilson-Raybould compared the situation to President Richard Nixon's ""Saturday Night Massacre"" firing of the independent special prosecutor overseeing the Watergate investigation in 1973.

The Globe and Mail's report this month said Trudeau's office pressured her to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin. The agreement would have allowed the company to pay reparations but avoid a criminal trial on charges of corruption and bribery.

With the sound defeat of his five opponents, the New Democratic Party leader put to rest murmurs within his party that a defeat at the polls could throw the NDP into a leadership crisis scant months from the next federal election.

“My friends, it’s a new day. It’s a new day,” Singh told jubilant supporters at a Hilton hotel in Burnaby during his victory speech.

“Guess what? We just told a lot of kids out there that yes, you can.”

Singh, a former lawyer who had served as a provincial politician in Ontario, became the first member of a visible minority to lead a national political party in Canada when he won the NDP leadership in 2017, but Monday’s byelection gives him his first seat in the House of Commons.

Singh’s victory was marred by the NDP’s loss in Outremont, the Montreal riding that served as a launching pad for the orange wave that swept Quebec in 2011.

Lawyer Rachel Bendayan reclaimed the riding for the Liberals with 42 per cent of the vote, even as the governing party struggles with the fallout from allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to halt criminal proceedings against Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

In a third byelection Monday, the Conservatives handily hung on to the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe, which had been held since 2004 by former Conservative cabinet minister Peter Van Loan. Scot Davidson took 53 per cent of the vote for the Tories, well ahead of Liberal Shaun Tanaka with 30 per cent.

Singh jumped out to an early lead and never looked back, finishing with about 39 per cent of the vote, beating Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee who finished second with about 26 per cent. Conservative Jay Shin finished in third place with roughly 23 per cent, while Laura-Lynn Thompson finished fourth with about 11 per cent, running with the People’s Party of Canada, the nascent party launched last year by failed federal Conservative leadership candidate Maxime Bernier. A pair of independent candidates, Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu, rounded out the ballot.

Singh thanked his competitors for contributing to the democratic process.

Lee, speaking after his concession speech, said he didn’t think the SNC-Lavalin controversy had a major impact on the Burnaby byelection.

“I didn’t hear anything (about SNC-Lavalin) on the doorsteps,” Lee said. “All we heard was the local issues, and transportation, and how to support our young people so they can stay and work in our community. Those are the local issues, I believe, that are in people’s minds.”

Lee was a longtime MLA representing Burnaby North for the B.C. Liberals for four consecutive terms until he was defeated soundly in the 2017 provincial election, by the NDP’s Janet Routledge. He took over as the Liberal candidate from day-care operator and political hopeful Karen Wang, who bowed out after writing an online post that singled out Singh’s ethnicity.

Stakes were high for Singh and the NDP. Former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair said in a television interview on CTV last month that it would be “extremely difficult” for Singh to stay on as leader if he lost in Burnaby.

The Burnaby South seat had been vacated by former MP and now Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart. Stewart told Postmedia last Friday that he had been out door-knocking with Singh last week, and “it felt really good on the ground.”

“I feel good that he’ll win there, and I think having him in the House of Commons will be not just good for the NDP but good for the country,” Stewart said.

Harjit Sajjan, the Liberal MP for Vancouver South and the Minister of National Defence, was at Lee’s event Monday night. Sajjan said he was happy to support Lee, who he described as a “humble, great person.”

“I’ve had the opportunity to go door-knocking with him as well,” Sajjan told Postmedia. “His compassion that he has for his community, that’s what really, I think, sets him apart.”

The by-election fell as the federal Liberals are dealing with fallout from a scandal around allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office may have inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the criminal prosecution of Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. After the controversy, Wilson-Raybould resigned her position in cabinet, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerald Butts resigned his position.

Singh referenced oil and gas extraction, pharmaceutical profits and the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal in his victory speech. “People should be angry,” he said.

Peter Julian, MP for New Westminster-Burnaby, said voters who put Singh in office “were saying they want a fighter … someone who will stand up when the government makes bad choices.”

Justin Trudeau won the 2015 Canadian election on his sunny image and a promise to do politics differently. In March 2019, Trudeau is mired in scandal after demoting his attorney general when she refused to interfere in the prosecution of a Canadian engineering firm accused of bribing Libyan officials.

On Feb. 12, Jody Wilson-Raybould — whom Trudeau had demoted to minister of veterans affairs — resigned from Trudeau’s cabinet. On Monday, Trudeau’s troubles grew deeper when another government minister, Jane Philpott, also resigned, citing ethical concerns over Trudeau’s behavior.

[The U.S. isn’t being very neighborly. Here’s what it means for Canada’s foreign policy.]

What’s going on?

Let’s start from the beginning. SNC-Lavalin, the Montreal-based firm at the center of the controversy, is an engineering firm with 50,000 employees worldwide. From 2001 to 2011, the firm allegedly paid the regime of Moammar Gaddafi tens of millions of dollars in bribes. In February, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police formally charged SNC-Lavalin and two subsidiaries with violating the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

A conviction would leave SNC-Lavalin ineligible to bid on Canadian government contracts for a decade, which could bankrupt the firm. In a separate case, a former SNC-Lavalin vice president pleaded guilty to skirting election finance rules: at issue was $97,000 in SNC-Lavalin-directed illegal campaign contributions to the Liberal Party between 2004 and 2011. Trudeau became Liberal Party leader in 2013.

What does Trudeau think about this?

Here’s the problem. The government slipped a provision into the 2018 budget that would allow firms accused of paying bribes to enter into deferred prosecution agreements, sparing them from the 10-year ban on government contracting. But the director of public prosecutions, a nonpartisan civil servant, determined in September 2018 that SNC-Lavalin didn’t meet the criteria set out in the new law and refused to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement. It was then that Trudeau and his staff began twisting the attorney general’s arm.

Who is Jody Wilson-Raybould?

As attorney general, Wilson-Raybould had the authority to overrule the director of public prosecutions and offer SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement. After studying the case, Wilson-Raybould agreed that SNC-Lavalin wasn’t eligible for an agreement.

[There’s a hidden cost in Trump’s new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico]

Wilson-Raybould says this is when Trudeau and his aides wouldn’t take no for an answer. Hand-picked by Trudeau to be his minister of justice and attorney general, Wilson-Raybould is the first Indigenous woman to hold the office. Her presence in the cabinet became an emblem of Trudeau’s pledge of reconciliation with Canada’s First Nations — as well as a confirmation of Trudeau’s strong commitment to a gender-balanced cabinet.

But what did Trudeau and his team do?

Wilson-Raybould says Trudeau and 10 high-ranking government officials — including Principal Secretary Gerry Butts, Chief of Staff Katie Telford, Minister of Finance Bill Morneau and the country’s highest-ranking civil servant, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick — pressured her last fall to take into account the partisan ramifications of her decision. Legal experts argue this runs clearly against Canada’s “constitutional convention” that the attorney general has an independent role.

Testifying before the House of Commons justice committee on Feb. 27, Wilson-Raybould said she had a meeting with Trudeau and Wernick: “[Wernick] said, ‘They will likely be moving [their offices from Montreal] to London if [you do not halt the prosecution], and there is an election in Quebec soon.’ At that point, the prime minister jumped in, stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that ‘I am an MP in Quebec — the member for Papineau.’ ”

She reported on another meeting, where Butts and Telford told Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff that “there is no solution here that does not involve some interference” and that they “don’t want to debate legalities any more.” Wilson-Raybould would not budge, and on Jan. 14 Trudeau fired her as minister of justice and attorney general and demoted her to minister for veterans affairs.

[Saudi Arabia just expelled the Canadian ambassador in Riyadh. Here’s why.]

What’s the political fallout for the Trudeau government?

Trudeau relied on his image as an honest, upbeat and feminist politician to win office in 2015. After Wilson-Raybould’s testimony last week, some pundits believe the political damage is severe, perhaps beyond repair. Since the Globe and Mail broke the story in early February, the Trudeau team has clumsily tried to explain it away, first arguing they hadn’t directed her to make any particular decision, then that they hadn’t pressured her, then that they hadn’t improperly pressured her.

Three weeks ago, Trudeau claimed to still have Wilson-Raybould’s support, saying, “Her presence in cabinet should actually speak for itself.” The next day, Wilson-Raybould resigned.

Anonymous sources then tried to smear her as a pushy woman who was difficult to work with. That backfired spectacularly, with feminists and Indigenous leaders rallying to Wilson-Raybould’s side. Now Trudeau’s team says he wanted her to consider the jobs that would be lost if SNC-Lavalin were found guilty.

And what about the next election?

Canadians will go to the polls in October, and what once looked like an assured Liberal victory is now in doubt. Liberal Party poll numbers have fallen by three percentage points, and the opposition Conservative Party is now in first place. If an election were held last week, the poll numbers suggest the Conservatives would have won 153 seats in the House of Commons to the Liberals’ 152 seats, with third parties holding the balance of power.

The Liberal caucus appears divided between those who applauded Wilson-Raybould for, as they see it, speaking truth to power and those who are furious that their reelection chances now seem at risk. Meanwhile, Gerry Butts, Trudeau’s principal secretary and the architect of his rise to power, had to resign, following the allegations of improper pressure on the attorney general.

Could this get any worse?

Jane Philpott, another member of Trudeau’s cabinet and a close friend of Wilson-Raybould, resigned Monday, saying that she has lost confidence in the prime minister. She wrote: “I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities, constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one’s principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.”

Cabinet ministers have resigned in the past over differences in politics and policy. Here’s what’s different: There is no precedent in Canada for a prime minister to lose a minister who believes the prime minister’s actions are unethical. Justin Trudeau has just lost two.

Philpott, widely seen as among Trudeau's most effective ministers, cited how circumstances had become ""untenable"" for her to continue on as Treasury Board president. In a statement, she explained she lost confidence in the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin issue amid ""evidence of efforts by politicians and/or officials to pressure the former attorney general"" to intervene in the criminal case.

""In a democracy like ours and in a space where we value our diversity so strongly, we're allowed to have disagreements and debate. We even encourage it,"" Trudeau said about Philpott's resignation.

""This matter has generated an important discussion. How democratic institutions, specifically the federal ministry and the staff and officials that support it, conduct themselves is critical and core to all of our principles.""

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould quit cabinet last month over allegations the prime minister and senior government officials pressured her to take a certain direction on the SNC-Lavalin case.

""Concerns of this nature must be taken very seriously and I can assure you that I am,"" Trudeau said.

Watch: Andrew Scheer comments on latest Liberal cabinet resignation

The prime minister thanked Philpott for her work, including the ""tremendous progress"" on boil-water advisories during her time as Indigenous services minister. Trudeau pledged his government will continue this ""crucial"" work.

Philpott was regarded as a star minister with a deft hand for difficult portfolios. She has led both health and Indigenous services portfolios. In January, she was tapped to be president of the Treasury Board and minister of digital government after former Liberal MP Scott Brison's decision to leave politics. The role put her in charge of overseeing government spending.

Her resignation comes days after the prime minister shuffled his cabinet to fill the role Wilson-Raybould left behind at veterans affairs.

Some Liberal MPs not surprised by Philpott quitting cabinet

Addressing the elephant in the room didn't do much to mitigate tensions in the room. Trudeau found his climate change message a challenging sell after frequent interruptions by anti-pipeline protesters.

Angry protesters shouting during Trudeau's speech were shushed by Liberal supporters. Several activists were removed from the venue by security.

The prime minister was joined by Finance Minister Bill Morneau, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, and Environment Minister Catherine McKenna. A strong showing of Toronto-area Liberal MPs were also in the crowd, including Deb Schulte.

The King—Vaughan MP told HuffPost Canada she's ""obviously"" sad about Philpott's resignation.

Schulte said she wasn't completely taken aback by the decision, given her knowledge of Philpott's friendship with the former attorney general.

""I hope he takes it sooner rather than later,"" McKay added. He downplayed the perception that there's crisis within the party that has so far prompted two cabinet ministers to resign within a short period of time.

""These are troubling times, but I don't see trouble with the caucus.""

Liberal MP Omar Alghabra echoed his caucus colleague's sentiments about Philpott's cabinet departure, but admitted he wasn't ""shocked"" by the news.

""She is a valued colleague and I would consider her a friend,"" Alghabra told HuffPost. ""So I'm sad to see her leave.""

Philpott's resignation comes days after Wilson-Raybould's stunning testimony at the House of Commons justice committee. The former justice minister and attorney general inferred that she was shuffled into veterans affairs in January over her decision to not ask her deputy to issue a directive to initiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin.

Such a deal would have helped the Quebec-based construction and engineering giant pay a financial penalty related to foreign bribery and corruption charges, but avoid a criminal trial. With criminal prosecution still a possibility, the company faces a 10-year ban on federal contracts.

More evidence is expected to be presented at a justice committee meeting Wednesday with a scheduled appearance by Trudeau's longtime friend and former principal secretary Gerald Butts.

Butts resigned from the Prime Minister's Office last month in wake of allegations reported in The Globe and Mail that he pressured the former attorney general to take a specific direction in the criminal case involving SNC-Lavalin.

Justin Trudeau's right-hand-man says the prime minister did nothing improper as a deepening political crisis threatens the government's re-election chances. Here's what you need to know.

In a nutshell

Mr Trudeau has been accused of pressuring his former attorney general to cut a deal with a company facing corruption charges - and retaliating when she refused to play ball.

The revelations could cost Trudeau the October general election, some pundits say.

The former AG, Jody Wilson-Raybould, says Trudeau and his staff spent months trying to convince her that taking the company to trial would cost Canadians jobs, and their party votes.

She also says she was subject to ""veiled threats"", which she believes were made good when she was shuffled out of her department.

Now another minister, Jane Philpott, has quit saying it was ""untenable"" for her to continue due to ""serious concerns"" raised by the case.

But Gerald Butts, Mr Trudeau's former principal secretary, says there was no political pressure - only concerns for how the prosecution could affect local economies.

Who are the players?

The spurned ex-minister: Jody Wilson-Raybould was Canada's attorney general and justice minister. Unlike in the UK, the two roles are held by the same person.

She was also Canada's first indigenous justice minister and worked on a number of pieces of landmark legislation, including legalising cannabis and assisted dying.

In January, she was shuffled from the justice department to the department of veterans' affairs - a move many saw as a demotion.

The corporation: SNC-Lavalin is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies.

The company faces fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, when Muammar Gaddafi was in power.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

The PM: Justin Trudeau is Canada's prime minister. He won a majority government in 2015 on a platform of transparency, gender equality and a commitment to reconciliation with Canada's indigenous peoples.

He faces a federal election in October 2019.

The Trudeau ally who quit: Jane Philpott is described as one of his most trusted ministers.

But her resignation statement explaining why she was quitting as Treasury Board president could not have been more pointed.

Citing the SNC-Lavallin affair, she said: ""I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities, constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one's principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.""

Trudeau's right-hand man: Gerald Butts has been described as the ""most important Liberal in Canada today"" whose last name is not ""Trudeau"". But all that changed in February, when Mr Butts resigned amid rumours he had pressured the justice minister to cut a deal with SNC-Lavalin.

Mr Butts is one of Mr Trudeau's closest allies, and the two have been friends since their university days in Montreal.

He is credited with helping Mr Trudeau win the Liberal party leadership in 2013 and was a key architect in the Liberal party's sweeping 2015 electoral victory.

Why would Trudeau care about SNC-Lavalin?

SNC-Lavalin is based in Quebec, a swing province that has long been viewed as essential ground for the Liberal Party to win during an election - which is coming up in October.

When the Liberals win Quebec, they often win a majority of seats in parliament. When they lose, they lose badly.

At the time that Wilson-Raybould says she was being pressured to cut a deal, Quebec was also in the middle of a heated provincial election that eventually led to the ousting of Quebec Liberal premier Philippe Couillard.

Wilson-Raybould says the federal Liberal Party kept raising the Quebec election as one of the reasons why she should consider cutting a deal with SNC-Lavalin.

What does Trudeau say?

Trudeau has denied wrongdoing and says any lobbying by him or his inner circle for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was done to protect jobs.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, Mr Trudeau said he disagreed with her ""characterisation"" of events and maintained his staff followed the rules.

What could the fallout be?

Trudeau's longtime friend and principal secretary Gerald Butts has already resigned.

Many speculate that other top officials that Wilson-Raybould named may follow.

Canada's ethics commissioner is investigating Wilson-Raybould's accusations to see if any conflict-of-interest rules were broken. For her part, Wilson-Raybould says she believes no laws were broken, but that the prime minister's office acted improperly.

But the real question is what this could mean for Trudeau and his election in the fall.

Conservative leader of the opposition Andrew Scheer has already called for Trudeau's resignation, saying he no longer has the ""moral authority"" to lead.

That seems unlikely, but what is likely - at least according to columnist Chantal Hebert and other political pundits - is that ""the Liberals will likely go in the fall election campaign with the SNC-Lavalin albatross still hanging around their party's neck"".",Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould: The scandal that could unseat Canada's PM - BBC News,Bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47408239

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould dramatically deepened the biggest crisis of Trudeau's tenure just months ahead of an October election in which his Liberals face a tough fight.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, demanded the resignation of what he called a disgraced prime minister.

""He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,"" Scheer told reporters, calling for police to immediately probe the matter. Trudeau is due to address reporters later on Wednesday.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed ""consistent and sustained pressure"" on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

""In my view, these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter and that this pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,"" she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould, who named several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister.

Trudeau and other officials deny inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould. But the case forced the resignation of Trudeau's principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

Opinion polls show the affair is starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of what looks set to be a tightly contested federal election in October.

TODAY:

Justin Trudeau rode to power in part thanks to the notable number of Liberal ballots cast by women and younger voters, but now it seems that enthusiastic support is waning.

Pictou, N.S., has a major economic and environmental problem on its hands.

There's a new team practicing at Calgary's Olympic Park bobsled track, and they're quickly learning some important lessons about the sport.

Public perception problems

Justin Trudeau came to power in 2015, promising big changes to the way that Canada was governed.

The most visible manifestation of that vow came when he presented his new cabinet on the steps outside Rideau Hall.

Fifteen men and 15 women — the first gender-balanced cabinet in the country's history — with female Liberal MPs awarded such plum portfolios as international trade, health, environment and justice.

When a reporter asked why parity was important to him, the new prime minister gave a shrug and quipped: ""Because it's 2015.""

A loud cheer went up from the members of the public who had gathered on the lawn to watch the pomp and circumstance via large-screen TVs.

The election turnout was relatively robust in 2015 — 68.3 per cent of eligible voters cast a ballot, the largest proportion since the Jean Chrétien Liberals shellacked Kim Campbell and the Progressive Conservatives in 1993.

And Trudeau reaped the benefits, triumphing with almost every demographic.

But the Liberals did best with women and younger voters, already traditional areas of strength.

Polls taken at the end of the campaign suggested that the youthful Trudeau enjoyed a 14-point lead over the NDP's Tom Mulcair among Canadians aged 18 to 29, and a 15-point advantage over Stephen Harper. Trudeau also had a 10 percentage point lead over the Conservatives when it came to female voters.

How important was that support on the way to a 184-seat Liberal majority, which included 50 female MPs?

Very. Turnout among the youngest voters, aged 18 to 24, shot up by 18.3 per cent in 2015 — the largest increase on record. And young women accounted for much of that increase, with a 60.5 per cent turnout rate, up almost 20 per cent from 2011.

(There was also a record-setting turnout in many aboriginal communities in 2015, although the increased indigenous vote didn't necessarily translate into more seats for the Liberals.)

But now, almost four years later, Trudeau can't necessarily count on that enthusiastic support.

The CBC's Poll Tracker today shows Andrew Scheer's Conservatives almost four points out in front of the Liberals, 36.9 per cent to 33.1 per cent.

And some of the individual surveys that go into that aggregator — most especially those taken in the month since the SNC-Lavalin story broke — identify some worrying trends for the prime minister.

The latest Angus Reid Institute poll, for example, which found that six in 10 Canadians say their opinion of Trudeau has worsened in recent weeks, shows the Liberals trailing the Conservatives by seven points and with softening support in their key demographics.

Trudeau's advantage among women is now just six per cent, according to the survey. He's doing only seven points better than Scheer among 18- to 34-year-olds, and running well behind with older demographics.

And a recent Léger/Canadian Press poll that also shows the Tories out in front overall found almost even support for Scheer and Trudeau among female voters, 33 per cent to 34 per cent.

That same survey asked respondents if they thought Trudeau had done something wrong in his dealings with Jody Wilson-Raybould. Forty-one per cent said ""yes,"" including 37 per cent of female voters, while 41 per cent (and 47 per cent of women) said they weren't sure. Only 12 per cent said ""no.""

An Ipsos-Global News poll released today has the Tories with a nine-point lead among decided voters, 40 per cent to 31 per cent, and Andrew Scheer with a seven point advantage among women, 27 per cent to Trudeau's 20 per cent.

Four weeks into the SNC-Lavalin affair with no end in sight, the Liberals have clearly lost control of public perceptions and the political reality in Ottawa. Losing one senior, female cabinet minister was damaging. Having Jane Philpott quit yesterday, endorsing Wilson-Raybould's version of events and saying she has lost confidence in Trudeau's capacity to fix things, is potentially devastating.

Gerry Butts, Trudeau's friend and former principal secretary, is set to testify before the House of Commons Justice Committee tomorrow morning. He and the prime minister have both repeatedly said that they did nothing wrong or improper in talking to the former Justice minister about SNC-Lavalin's future.

But making that case convincingly without attacking Wilson-Raybould's integrity, or besmirching her character — potentially causing an even bigger rift in the party and with voters — will require far more deftness than the Liberal government has shown thus far.

Trudeau desperately needs to find a way out of the muck.

Because it's 2019, and the election is just eight-and-a-half months away.

Trouble in Pictou

Pictou has a major economic and environmental problem on its hands, reporter Tom Murphy writes.

I'm walking down Water Street in the Town of Pictou, N.S., when I hear it.

""Psst. Hey!""

A guy in his fifties, arm out the window of a pickup truck, beckons me over. He wants to talk.

""You here for the mill story?"" he asks.

There is truly only one story consuming people in Pictou County these days and they love to talk about it.

In private.

The community's Northern Pulp mill has been around for more than half a century. The jobs pay well and have helped keep the economy afloat.

But effluent from the mill has also been polluting and killing a body of water known as Boat Harbour, once owned by the Mi'kmaq First Nations.

People here know that can't continue. And the clock is ticking, with the effluent treatment facility used by the mill slated to close on Jan. 31 next year.

But as the stakeholders try to find an acceptable alternative, it is creating a rift in the community that's pitting industry versus industry and family versus family.

Fishermen fear piping the mill's waste directly into the Northumberland Strait will harm their fishery.

Forestry workers warn that without the mill, their industry will falter.

Besides the jobs at the Northern Pulp mill, the outcome of the debate over the plant's future will affect two key local industries - forestry and commercial fishing. (Jill English/CBC)

There's just so much riding on the future of the mill that people choose their words carefully around here. Local municipal politicians shy away from comment. Community organizations and businesses turn down access for our cameras.

Pickup-truck-guy doesn't want to do an on-camera interview. But he wants me to know all the good the mill does in this community.

I receive a lot of that kind of advice from all sides of the issue while in Pictou. But getting people to talk publicly about their feelings was no easy feat.

Residents are on edge here these days, knowing dramatic change for their community is on the near horizon. And they are beginning to realize there is no solution that will appease all sides.

And so they are tightly wound and, yes, tight-lipped.

Learning the hard way

There's a new team practicing at Calgary's Olympic Park bobsled track, and they're quickly learning some important lessons about the sport, reporter Erin Collins writes.

You learn some interesting facts working as a reporter.

For example, did you know that there are just two ways to go down a bobsled track? ""The right way, and the wrong way.""

I picked this little tidbit up chatting with Jerby Deriada, a brakeman with a bobsled team from the Philippines who has just learned this lesson the hard way — a few times.

Yup, you read that correctly, a bobsled team from the Philippines.

Turns out the right way means keeping your head in more or less of an upright position, while the wrong way involves sliding down an icy track on your head.

Good to know.

Deriada and his driver Rolando Isidro are in Calgary with another two-man team from the Philippines, training at the Canada Olympic Park bobsleigh track.

All four have day jobs with the Philippines Coast Guard, and were world champion dragon boat racers before they decided to take a crack at bobsled. They've been at the track in Calgary for several weeks and head home on March 15.

""Our inspiration for getting into the sport of bobsled is really the movieCool Runnings,"" says Buddy Cunanan, president of the Philippine National Bobsled, Luge, and Skeleton Association, referring to the Cinderella story of the Jamaican bobsled team coming to Calgary for the 1988 Olympics.

""And we thought if the Jamaicans could do it, why not the Philippines?""

Tune in to The National tonight to find out what inspired Deriada and his teammates from the tropics to shoot for a spot in the winter Olympics — and why a funding shortfall at the home of Canada's national team could quash their dreams.

March 5, 1971: Women react to news of Pierre Trudeau's marriage

Canada's bachelor-in-chief cuts short his single life at age 52, marrying Margaret Sinclair, a woman 30 years his junior, in a hush-hush Vancouver ceremony. They had met the year before at a Club Med in Tahiti. The reaction from women on the streets of Toronto is mostly positive, although a few worry about the age difference. The couple's first son, Justin, was born just over nine months later on Christmas Day. He, too, would go on to disappoint some women.

144,Empty,2019-02-28T14:42:26Z,Former Canadian Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday about political interference for SNC-Lavalin.,"OTTAWA — Former Canadian Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee Wednesday that she was told to interfere in the prosecution of Quebec contractor, SNC-Lavalin. The Official Opposition says Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has no option but to resign.

The political interference from the Prime Minister’s Office was apparently all about getting corruption charges against the company deferred in order to shore up Liberal Party support in the province of Quebec.

“For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin,” Wilson-Raybould told the committee. (RELATED: Trudeau Principal Secretary Gerald Butts Resigns In Wake Of Judicial Scandal)

Trudeau also participated in this “sustained effort,” according to Wilson-Raybould, and at one point he directly implied that Wilson-Raybould should consider the party’s political fortunes in Quebec. She described the incident when “the prime minister jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that ‘I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau.'”

The former attorney general and justice minister says she was “taken aback” by the comment and posed “a direct question while looking him in the eye.”

“I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the attorney general? I would strongly advise against it.'”

Trudeau’s response appeared to be both a denial and an affirmation: “The prime minister said, ‘No, no, no – we just need to find a solution.'”

Official Opposition Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is demanding that Trudeau resign for political interference and says the Royal Canadian Mounted Police must investigate Wilson-Raybould’s enormous claims. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Scheer said Trudeau has no moral authority to govern Canada. (RELATED: Former Canadian AG Jody Wilson-Raybould Quits As Trudeau Embroiled In Growing Scandal)

“I was sickened and appalled by [Wilson-Raybould’s] story of inappropriate and, frankly, borderline illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest levels of Justin Trudeau’s government,” he said.

Trudeau said Wednesday he won’t resign and has essentially dismissed his former minister’s testimony as a fabrication.

“I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” he said during an event in Montreal late Wednesday. “And therefore I completely disagree with the characterization of the former attorney general about these events.”

While media continued to demand answers throughout Wednesday afternoon, the Liberal government tried to avoid the story. Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale announced on Twitter that the federal government would be pardoning Canadians who had been charged with possession of marijuana before the drug was legalized.

Later today, I will give notice to introduce a bill to provide no-cost, expedited pardons for simple possession of cannabis. — Ralph Goodale (@RalphGoodale) February 27, 2019

Wilson-Raybould’s revolt is unprecedented in a Liberal Party that has dominated the Canadian political landscape for over a century by keeping caucus malcontents silent and demanding its Members of Parliament (MP) speak in unison. Suspicions that something was amiss in the Trudeau government were aroused when Trudeau demoted Wilson-Raybould from attorney general to Veterans Affairs minister last month following a cabinet shuffle.

The former minister will continue to sit as a Liberal MP for the time being. Wilson-Raybould, who is aboriginal, was seen as an example of Trudeau’s efforts to reach “reconciliation” with Canada’s First Nations.

Justin Trudeau's ship may be sinking, but he's not changing course.

The Canadian prime minister plowed ahead Thursday after his former attorney general alleged, in explosive testimony aired on national television, that he interfered in the justice system by pressing to end a criminal case against an iconic Quebec construction firm.

Speaking to reporters in Montreal, Trudeau insisted again his government had every right to consider the job losses that could result from a guilty verdict for SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.

The scandal has suddenly made Trudeau vulnerable, consuming his Liberals in the run-up to an election in which he'd have otherwise have been the frontrunner.

He's lost his polling lead for the first time since June, and the controversy has undermined his personal brand as a progressive leader who single-handedly returned his moribund party to power in 2015 on a pledge of change.

""It's very damaging and it's very serious,"" said Penny Collenette, a University of Ottawa professor who served as director of appointments under a former Liberal prime minister. Every politician wants to protect jobs, she said.

""But I think the question that needs to be asked here is: at what cost?""

Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press via AP Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks to supporters in February, 2019.

Trudeau's fate depends on several factors - including whether cabinet stands by him and the Liberals stay united. Only a handful of lawmakers have voiced any measure of support for Jody Wilson-Raybould, who quit the Cabinet last month but remains a Liberal member of parliament. The prime minister hasn't decided yet whether to force her out of the party's caucus.

Any divisions within his government on the matter could be fatal for efforts to convince voters the Liberals have done nothing wrong, said Nik Nanos, a pollster with Nanos Research Group. Trudeau, at the center of the crisis and with his own popularity waning, will also need a more team-oriented campaign in the next election to win voters who may blame him for the current crisis.

""If a narrative emerges that the caucus is divided on this, that will be lethal for Justin Trudeau,"" Nanos said in a telephone interview.

""I can't remember any party leader winning an election with his caucus divided. If the caucus can't even agree, how is it that they can govern?""

The latest polls already show the Liberals have lost their lead in voting intentions.

Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP Jody Wilson-Raybould speaks with the media after appearing in front of the Justice committee in Ottawa in February, 2019.

An aggregate of public opinion surveys maintained by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp shows Trudeau's team with 33.9 per cent of the vote, below the Conservatives with 35.8 per cent.

What's hurting the prime minister is the extraordinary spectacle of a former high-ranking member of his government now emerging as its most powerful critic - and his rivals smell blood.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called for Trudeau's resignation and wrote the Royal Canadian Mounted Police seeking an investigation. The police force hasn't said whether or not it will look into the matter. New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh is demanding a public inquiry.

Among those Wilson-Raybould accused of improper pressure is Bill Morneau, who she said she spoke to in the House of Commons. The finance minister said Thursday it was Wilson-Raybould who approached him, and defended the actions of his chief of staff, Ben Chin, in stressing the magnitude of potential job losses at the company.

""My role is, and continues to be, to think about how protect Canadian jobs,"" Morneau told reporters in Toronto.

""I will continue do that. I think that's critically important for us to understand in every decision we take as a government.""

Justin Tang/The Canadian Press via AP Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is embraced by former Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada Jody Wilson-Raybould after delivering a speech on the recognition and implementation of Indigenous rights in February, 2018.

Wilson-Raybould also took aim at Gerald Butts, Trudeau's former principal secretary, who on Thursday asked to be allowed to speak to a committee of lawmakers to tell his version of events. The former attorney general -- whose absence from cabinet will be filled in a shuffle Friday, according to CBC - may also end up testifying again.

But no current minister has broken ranks. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told the CBC she couldn't imagine Trudeau applying inappropriate pressure, and signaled frustration that Wilson-Raybould was now taking aim at cabinet. ""At the end of the day, when you leave the room, you have to play as a united team,"" Freeland said.

Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he believes Trudeau was within the ""box of what's legal"" with his actions, and that no one should jump to conclusions.

""We should take the time to listen to the other witnesses.""

Champagne and another minister, border security chief Bill Blair, each brushed aside a question on whether Trudeau should replace key staff.

""I remain very confident in the work of this government,"" Blair said.

Trudeau moved long-serving Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay to the veterans affairs portfolio to replace Jody Wilson-Raybould, who quit on Feb 12 after less than a month in the job.

Wilson-Raybould testified on Wednesday that when she was justice minister last year, officials in the Liberal government leaned on her to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial.

Her remarks prompted the leader of the official opposition Conservative Party to demand Trudeau's resignation. Polls show the affair is starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of a federal election set for this October.

Trudeau, who denies there was any wrongdoing, broke with tradition and did not take questions from reporters after the shuffle, which saw International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau replace MacAulay at agriculture.

Women's Minister Maryam Monsef took on the international development portfolio in addition to her current job.

He was going to “do politics differently”.

And for a while, that image remained in the minds of many Canadians.

Trudeau called himself a feminist. He said the most important relationship for him was the relationship between the federal government and Canada’s Indigenous Peoples. Repeatedly, he cast himself as a clean break from the politics of the past.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

But now, Trudeau’s carefully focus-grouped and PR-tested “new politics” image lies in tatters. Because it seems that his “most important relationship” is actually with the SNC-Lavalin Corporation.

When Jody Wilson-Raybould was appointed as Canada’s first female Indigenous Attorney General, many Canadians felt it would be a historic turning point. It seemed in line with Trudeau’s image and the rhetoric he was spouting.

Yet now her appointment looks cynical and political. Because the moment Jody Wilson-Raybould’s values clashed with the interests of the Liberal-connected engineering and construction giant SNC-Lavalin (a company seen as so corrupt that the World Bank banned it and its affiliates from World Bank projects for a decade), it seems that Trudeau was happy to throw her overboard and replace her with someone willing to give SNC-Lavalin what it wants – a deferred prosecution agreement that will let them avoid a criminal trial and keep getting lucrative federal contracts.

To get a sense of how deeply embedded SNC-Lavalin (which gave lots of money to Trudeau’s Liberal party and is headquartered in his home province of Quebec) is in Canadian politics, consider the fact that the Chairman of SNC-Lavalin’s Board is Kevin Lynch.

Lynch previously served as the Clerk of the Privy Council, the most powerful bureaucrat in Canada. And it turns out that Lynch contacted Michael Wernick – the current Clerk of the Privy Council – to complain that SNC-Lavalin wasn’t getting a Deferred Prosecution Agreement quickly enough.

Trudeau has repeatedly claimed that the decision on whether to give SNC-Lavalin a Deferred Prosecution Agreement was Jody Wilson-Raybould’s to make. However, she repeatedly said she had made that decision — and it was a big “no”.

It’s worth pointing out that in saying “no”, Wilson-Raybould was simply defending the decision made by Canada’s Independent Prosecutor, meaning she was standing up for the rule of law. Yet Trudeau, Wernick, and the staff in the Prime Minister’s Office kept pushing her to change her mind.

No matter how many times she made her decision clear, the pressure kept on going. And then, after she had repeatedly explained that SNC-Lavalin wouldn’t get a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, she was replaced as Attorney General.

The new Attorney General is David Lametti, a professor of law from McGill University – the same university Justin Trudeau attended. It’s surely a coincidence that Lametti represents an electoral district in Montreal, where SNC-Lavalin just so happens to be headquartered. Interestingly, Lametti has said a Deferred Prosecution Agreement for SNC-Lavalin is still a possibility, despite all the times Jody Wilson-Raybould stood against it.

This has turned into a massive scandal in Canada, a scandal that threatens the future of the Trudeau government. And while Trudeau tried to smooth things over with a press conference, it hasn’t worked. The reason it hasn’t worked is that the prime minister’s credibility has collapsed.

When the story of Jody Wilson-Raybould being pressured to change her mind first broke in the Globe & Mail, Justin Trudeau said it was “false.” Then, when Wilson-Raybould testified (and Trudeau is still using his authority to block her from sharing the full story), Trudeau said he “disagreed” with her testimony, even after he admitted he hadn’t reviewed all of it.

Then today, in his press conference, he basically confirmed everything she said, but tried to dismiss it by saying the events were “experienced differently”.

To get a sense of how shady that looks, imagine if Donald Trump held a press conference admitting to directly colluding with Russia in the 2016 US election, but then said it wasn’t actually a problem because he simply “experienced” the concept of “collusion” differently than other people.

This scandal is hurting Canada and our image on the world stage, as our commitment to the rule of law and reputation for ethical leadership is severely threatened. Trudeau started by denying the entire scandal even existed, and is now admitting to it in slightly different wording – which is a tacit admission that he’s been lying to Canadians for the past four weeks.

That’s why Trudeau’s poll numbers and personal approval ratings in Canada are falling fast. When our PM had the choice between standing with the ethics of Canada’s first Indigenous female Attorney General, or standing with a well-connected corporation ensnared in corruption, he chose the latter.

And when he had the chance to be honest with Canadians or lying, denying, and attempting to manipulate, he again chose the latter.

Turns out he was nothing more than a marketable face on the same corrupt power structure.

149,Empty,2019-03-05T05:45:00Z,The budget minister in Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Cabinet has resigned in an escalating political scandal. Jane Philpott said she had lost confidence in the government over its handling of a graft case.,"Treasury Board President Jane Philpott quit Canada's Cabinet on Monday. She's the third high-profile figure to leave her post over what's becoming an escalating political crisis.

In a resignation letter addressed to the prime minister, Philpott said she was seriously concerned by efforts by politicians and officials to pressure former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal case against Canadian engineering giant SNC-Lavalin and could no longer defend the government.

""Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and how it responded to the issues raised,"" Philpott said in a statement.

""I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities and constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one's principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them,"" she wrote.

The SNC-Lavalin case

Wilson-Raybould, a close friend of Philpott, resigned in February after being demoted the previous month. She told a parliamentary hearing last week that she had faced pressure from Trudeau and senior members of his government to avoid a criminal trial in the case of SNC-Lavalin.

The company is facing allegations that it bribed Libyan government officials between 2001 and 2011, when the country was ruled by Muammar Gadhafi. It has heavily lobbied the government to settle the case out of court, arguing those responsible had since left.

If it received a criminal conviction, the Montreal-based corporation would be banned from any federal government business for a decade. The company is a major economic force with about 9,000 employees in Canada and 50,000 worldwide.

Wilson-Raybould was convinced her refusal to help SNC-Lavalin was behind the demotion. She did not think the officials who contacted her had broken any laws, but called their efforts ""inappropriate.""

Trudeau reacts

Philpott, a physician considered a star in Trudeau's cabinet, had previously served as minister of health and minister of indigenous services. She was appointed to the powerful budget position in January.

At a Liberal party rally in Toronto, Trudeau said he was taking Philpott's concerns seriously.

""I know Philpott has felt this way for some time. And while I am disappointed, I understand her decision to step down. I want to thank her for her service,"" Trudeau said.

""But at the same time, we need to keep in mind the bigger picture,"" Trudeau said.

Trudeau has acknowledged raising the SNC-Lavalin issue with Wilson-Raybould, but has defended his actions as appropriate.This week, former top Trudeau aide Gerald Butts, who Wilson-Raybould said tried particularly hard to change her mind on SNC-Lavalin and who resigned from his position last month, is due to testify in front of a Parliament justice committee.

And she's ready to run for re-election in the fall.","Jody Wilson-Raybould says she is “overwhelmed and grateful” about an outpouring of public support since her scorching testimony in the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

And despite a nasty internal backlash after her explosive appearance before the federal justice committee, she has no intention of quitting the Liberal caucus in Ottawa.

“It really has been quite remarkable,” Wilson-Raybould said Saturday, in her first public remarks since her bombshell testimony.

“I have heard from thousands of people — neighbours, friends, constituents, as well as people from all across Canada.”

The former attorney general said she plans to run for re-election in the fall under the Liberal banner in Vancouver Granville.

“I feel overwhelmed and grateful. In my mind, all I was doing was my job.”

Wilson-Raybould stunned Ottawa last week with three hours of shocking testimony in the SNC-Lavalin affair, saying she was hounded for months to let the Liberal-connected, Quebec-based engineering company off the hook on criminal corruption charges.

Wilson-Raybould said nearly a dozen top power players in the government — including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Finance Minister Bill Morneau and several of Ottawa’s most powerful political staffers and bureaucrats — relentlessly pressured her to give the company a plea-bargain deal, which she refused to do.

She said she faced a “sustained effort” and “veiled threats” to intervene in the case. Trudeau removed her as attorney general in January and she resigned from his cabinet outright on Feb. 12.

“Like Canadians everywhere, I just try to do my job the best I can,” she said, adding she’s been recognized everywhere she goes while messages of support pour in.

“People coming up to me in airports, social media, emails, deliveries to my offices — I’m grateful for all of the support and kind thoughts.”

Trudeau has denied he did anything improper in the SNC-Lavalin case and said he “completely disagrees” with Wilson-Raybould’s version of events.

Since her testimony, she has faced criticism from fellow Liberals for breaking ranks. Liberal MP Jati Sidhu said she was not a “team player” and “couldn’t handle the stress” of her job, calling her testimony “sour grapes.” He later apologized for the remarks.

Despite the backlash, Wilson-Raybould said she has no intention of leaving the Liberals.

“I was elected as the Liberal member of Parliament for Vancouver Granville and I will continue to serve as such,” she said.

Trudeau said last week he had not decided whether Wilson-Raybould will be allowed to remain in the government caucus or to run again for the Liberals.

“I haven’t yet had the opportunity to review her entire testimony,” Trudeau said. “I will do that before making any further decisions.”

But Wilson-Raybould said she’s already secured the Liberal nomination for the October election.

“I was confirmed as the Liberal Party of Canada candidate for Vancouver Granville last year,” she said.

Despite being at the centre of a raging political storm, Wilson-Raybould said she is feeling upbeat and confident.

“I am doing fine,” she said. “The past few weeks have been eventful ones for our country, our system of government, and for myself and family.”

The House of Commons is now on a two-week break. Wilson-Raybould said she returned to Vancouver late Friday and is happy to be home.

“For sure I am looking forward to spending time back here for the next couple of weeks,” she said. “I’m looking forward to reconnecting with my constituents.”

The justice committee, meanwhile, is continuing its investigation of the scandal, while Canada’s independent ethics watchdog, Mario Dion, has launched an investigation of Trudeau’s actions.

The RCMP said it is reviewing complaints that government officials may have broken federal obstruction-of-justice laws.

(Bloomberg) -- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged there was an “erosion of trust” between his office and his former attorney-general over SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., though she never came to him directly to express her concerns about aiding the embattled construction firm.

Trudeau, in a press conference in Ottawa Thursday morning, gave his most fulsome response yet to the saga that has already seen two cabinet ministers quit, and forced his longtime friend and senior aide to step down. While recognizing there were lessons to be learned from the saga, Trudeau declined to apologize and insisted no inappropriate actions were taken.

“There was no inappropriate pressure,” Trudeau said. “I’m obviously reflecting on lessons learned in this.”

The scandal centers around what efforts Trudeau and his staff made to intervene to end a criminal case facing SNC, an iconic firm in vote-rich Quebec, the province that includes the prime minister’s own district. His ex-attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, alleges she was inappropriately pressured to help the company. Trudeau says he was worried about saving jobs, but never ordered her to do anything.

Trudeau acknowledged some conversations with her, but said he always believed the final decision was Wilson-Raybould’s and that she didn’t directly come to him to complain about the series of conversations.

Saw it Differently

“Each of these interactions was a conversation among colleagues about how to tackle a challenging issue,"" Trudeau said. “However, I now understand that she saw it differently.”

Trudeau’s comments were delivered the morning after his former aide Gerald Butts testified at a parliamentary committee, saying Wilson-Raybould hadn’t firmly ruled out intervening, and her objections ramped up only when her cabinet post was shuffled. The scandal has damaged Trudeau’s poll numbers ahead of an election this fall.

Trudeau said he was not aware that trust was eroding between his office -- namely, his ex-aide Butts -- and Wilson-Raybould. He said SNC faces “potential job losses in the thousands” as a result of the prosecution.

“I have taken and will continue to take many lessons from these days and weeks,” he said, including whether Canada may split the dual role of justice minister and attorney general. The justice minister is considered a more political role, while the AG’s is not.

Wilson-Raybould has alleged she and her staff were pressured from September through December to reconsider whether to issue a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin, to settle years-old corruption charges related to the firm’s work in Libya. A guilty conviction could include a ban on receiving federal contracts, while a DPA would see the company avoid that, essentially admit wrongdoing and pay a fine.

SNC-Lavalin employs about 9,000 people in Canada, and Trudeau and Butts have said it was those jobs they were looking to protect. Both say they never ordered Wilson-Raybould to do anything.

The story erupted in February, after which Wilson-Raybould quit cabinet. Wilson-Raybould detailed her version of events to lawmakers last week. Another minister quit this week -- Jane Philpott, who had in January warned Trudeau that Wilson-Raybould would see her portfolio change as a demotion related to SNC-Lavalin.

The incumbent Liberal Party sits at about 33 percent in national polls -- still competitive in Canada’s multiparty system, but trailing the Conservative Party at 36 percent, according to a poll aggregator run by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. It projects the Conservatives and Liberals would win a similar number of seats, though neither with a majority, if an election were held today.

152,Empty,2019-03-02T11:00:59Z,'The need for loyalty to the leader … at some point has to be sacrificed for what the individual believes is morally right.',"When Vancouver Granville MP Jody Wilson-Raybould levelled damning accusations at some of her Liberal colleagues in Ottawa this week, she joined a time-honoured list of maverick politicians from B.C. who have publicly challenged their leaders — and, in doing so, risked their political futures.

“I have huge respect for the way she conducted herself as a neutral attorney general,” said Brian Smith, who 30 years ago took a similar path, resigning as B.C.’s attorney-general over allegations of interference from the premier’s office.

“I know how she felt, because she gave up the job that she loved most, being attorney general. And it is a terrible emotional shock.”

In explosive testimony this week, Wilson-Raybould said she was fired as attorney-general in January because she refused to give in to “political interference” in a court case against construction giant SNC Lavalin, a large employer. Although she still sits as a Liberal MP, she broke from party ranks and accused 11 officials in the Prime Minister’s Office, Privy Council Office and Finance Department of trying to sway her decision as the country’s top lawyer.

In B.C., where politics is at times defined as a blood sport for the often-feisty dramatics at the legislature in Victoria, other politicians have taken similar stands that captured headlines. For some, the fallout killed their political careers, while others rose up from the political ashes to find success again as elected officials.

Perhaps the most parallel story to Wilson-Raybould’s took place in 1988, when Smith suddenly resigned, alleging he had confrontations with Socred premier Bill Vander Zalm’s office over two cases. Like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who denies any wrongdoing in the Wilson-Raybould affair, Vander Zalm insisted in 1988 he had not tried to interfere with Smith’s job.

Smith, though, argues both he and Wilson-Raybould took principled stands: “It’s pretty tough to uphold the neutrality of criminal investigations against the push of politicians. And the two come into a clash from time to time. And she was caught in an impossible vise.”

A former provincial Liberal cabinet minister, Bill Bennett, launched a similar fight in 2010 when, just after being fired as energy minister, he famously called then-premier Gordon Campbell a bully who was ruining their party by not stepping down as leader.

“The need for loyalty to the leader, the need for loyalty to the party, at some point has to be sacrificed for what the individual believes is morally right. And obviously that is the place (Wilson-Raybould) got to. And it’s a horrible place to be in,” Bennett recalled today. “It’s absolutely a no-win situation other than the person who does it knows in their heart it is the right thing to do.”

This phenomenon of outspoken B.C. politicians has crossed all party lines. Joy MacPhail, who had been the NDP’s finance minister, quit premier Glen Clark’s cabinet in July 1999, and would later say it was because Clark’s government had lost the trust of British Columbians. “I did this to save my party,” MacPhail said then.

B.C. has historically had a two-party system — typically a right-leaning free-enterprise party and the left-leaning NDP — which has led to polarization here, unlike in provinces with three dominant parties, said a University of B.C. political scientist, Gerald Baier.

“Because of (B.C.’s) polarization, it leads to rough and tumble politics, without much middle ground to fight over. That might mean that we have more characters and tolerance for people who are colourful because they can get away with it,” he said.

When B.C. politicians go to Ottawa, they can “bristle” at the way things are done in the more traditional central-Canada system, Baier said, recalling NDP MP Jim Fulton slapping a dead salmon on prime minister Brian Mulroney’s House of Commons desk during a 1985 debate about the sockeye fishery in B.C.

“Prime ministers always want to have a regionally representative cabinet, they work hard to have voices from different parts of the country. But the understanding is that the economic driver and the population driver is at the centre of the country — and the centre will win,” Baier said.

One of the reasons behind Wilson-Raybould’s willingness to provide her bombshell testimony this week may be linked to the long-standing belief in Indigenous circles that leaders are obligated to speak truth to power, said University of Victoria political scientist Jamie Lawson.

While other parts of the country have also created unique political figures, B.C. has bucked the Central Canada trend of “soft-spoken, diplomatic Lester Pearson”-type leaders, he added.

“We are certainly a province that is proud of that. It is kind of part of the self-identity of the place, and one of the consequences is people can come into leadership with the reputation of being mavericks. That’s something that goes right back to pre-Confederation times. It’s not every province that has a guy who calls himself Amor De Cosmos,” Lawson said in reference to B.C.’s renegade premier of 1872, who legally changed his name from the more bland William Smith.

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s victory in the federal Burnaby-South byelection, the NDP government’s response to threatened school closures in Vancouver, the latest in the legislature spending scandal and the province’s response to a measles outbreak.

Here is a look at some of our other political dissidents:

1952: W.A.C. Bennett

W.A.C. Bennett, a businessman from Kelowna, was elected to the provincial legislature as a Conservative in 1941, but twice his bids to lead the ruling party were rejected. Disgruntled, he resigned to sit as an independent in 1951, and then joined the Social Credit Party, which made a surprise breakthrough, forming government the next year.

Bennett was chosen to lead the party, and became the longest serving premier in B.C. history, from 1952 to 1972.

“Campaigning on a shrewd populist platform of fiscal restraint, fervent free enterprise, anti-socialist zeal, western chauvinism and unrepentant Ottawa-bashing, he developed a chameleon-like ability to adapt policy to either and sometimes both sides of any contentious issue,” Vancouver Sun columnist Stephen Hume wrote about Bennett.

“Bennett — journalist Bruce Hutchison described his ‘fixed neon smile, the bustling salesman’s assurance, the relentless torrent of speech’ as representing a revolution in provincial political style — spent his time in power remaking B.C.,” Hume wrote.

Bennett, who died in 1979, was known as Wacky to friends and foes.

1988: Brian Smith

B.C.’s first attorney-general to resign over differences with the premier was Sir Richard McBride, who left James Dunsmuir’s government in 1901.

Smith quoted McBride in his resignation speech in 1988, saying: “When Richard McBride resigned on a point of principle in the Dunsmuir administration in 1901, his father said: ‘My boy, resign everything but your honour.’… I am resigning as an act of honour.”

At the time, Smith complained Vander Zalm had a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the need for an independent attorney-general in relation to two cases he was handling, including a legal investigation into one of the premier’s close friends.

“I had all kinds of threats around me that I should back off that investigation, but I didn’t. And as soon as that investigation was finished, I stood up in the house and resigned,” Smith recalled today. “It was a terrible thing to have to give up the job you loved.”

He remained in the Socred caucus for more than a year, secretly trying to convince enough backbenchers to leave as independents so they could force Vander Zalm out and reform the party. The ploy didn’t work, and Smith left politics to become the chair of CN Rail.

Smith believes Wilson-Raybould will be given a rough ride if she tries to remain in the Liberal caucus, and predicts she has a bright future as a significant leader — but perhaps not one involving politics. “She is principled, and she ain’t no pushover. That is what the Trudeau government found out to their surprise.”

1988: Grace McCarthy

“Amazing Grace” McCarthy was the backbone of the Social Credit Party for decades, and became Canada’s first female deputy premier. But McCarthy publicly broke with then-premier Vander Zalm in 1988, alleging political interference by the premier and his principal secretary in the sale of the Expo lands in Vancouver.

McCarthy quit her post as economic development minister as soon as the bidding was complete and set about trying to bring down Vander Zalm before he could fatally damage the party. She urged other cabinet ministers to resign as a way to weaken the premier.

McCarthy coined the term “independent Socred” as a way to distance herself from the party, while staying close enough to take the reins if the opportunity presented itself. When Vander Zalm finally self-immolated in a scandal in 1991, McCarthy ran for the party leadership but was narrowly defeated by Rita Johnston.

A Vancouver park commissioner in the early 1960s, McCarthy had been recruited to provincial politics by W.A.C. Bennett, who was keen to encourage female leaders.

“At a time when female leaders were hard to find in Canadian politics, Grace McCarthy was an agent of change,” said former premier Christy Clark when McCarthy died in 2017. “When she was first elected, women could not even apply for mortgages without a male guarantor — until she worked with the provincial and federal governments to fix it.”

1991: Gordon Wilson

Gordon Wilson was a master at changing his political spots, serving as leader of the Liberal party for six years, as a cabinet minister for the New Democrats, and the creator of a now-defunct new party.

Today, Wilson declines to discuss his own past, but notes B.C. has several leaders, including Bennett, Vander Zalm and Dave Barrett, who built support for this province by picking fights with Ottawa.

“If I were to use a Western analogy, because of the polarized left-versus-right extremes in B.C., it is as if the majority of British Columbians are caught between two gunslingers on the main street of Dodge,” he told The Vancouver Sun. “As spectators, we try to speak truth to power before the gunfighter who is fastest to the draw slays the other and governs from the saloon.”

Wilson assumed leadership of a moribund Liberal party in 1987, with no elected members in the legislature. Nonetheless, he secured a spot in the 1991 campaign leadership debate and rocketed the party to prominence with one of the greatest sound bites in B.C. history.

As Social Credit premier Rita Johnston and NDP leader Mike Harcourt squabbled during the televised debate, Wilson interjected, “Here’s a classic example of why nothing ever gets done in the province of British Columbia.”

The Liberals elected 17 MLAs in 1991, placing second and effectively ending the Social Credit Party’s 39-year reign as the dominant political force in B.C. Despite his surprising success, his time as party leader would end two years later when his extramarital affair with Liberal MLA Judi Tyabji was revealed.

Wilson would be deposed by Gordon Campbell, and he and Tyabji would form their own party, the Progressive Democratic Alliance. Wilson was re-elected in 1996 as the only MLA of the party.

Three years into his term, Wilson crossed the floor to join the New Democrats as a cabinet minister and assumed the finance portfolio after the resignation of Joy MacPhail. When Glen Clark resigned in a scandal, Wilson took a run at the leadership of the NDP, but quickly aborted that mission.

He returned to the Liberal fold in 2016, when then-Premier Christy Clark rewarded him with a $150,000-a-year contract to promote opportunities for B.C. businesses in the liquefied natural gas industry.

1999: Joy MacPhail

Joy MacPhail resigned from her post as B.C.’s finance minister in 1999, when party leader and premier Glen Clark had become politically radioactive. Even when Clark himself resigned over his handling of a friend’s casino licence, MacPhail’s path to redemption was far from clear.

She cited “personal reasons” for quitting, in part because Clark’s hold on the party was so strong he could easily have shut her out even in his own disgrace. While she avoided direct confrontation at the time, she would later blast Clark’s ruinous style of governing.

“I do not believe in confrontation as a standard way of doing business,” she said at the time. “The old way of doing things under a Glen Clark government was to pick favourites and thereby create losers. … People have rejected that method of governing and that way of doing things. We must change.”

MacPhail would later abandon her own bid for the party leadership to back Ujjal Dosanjh in order to keep Gordon Wilson — Clark’s chosen successor — from gaining control. Dosanjh brought MacPhail back to cabinet as labour minister the next year, but that government was short-lived.

In 2001, the New Democrats were swept from office, leaving MacPhail with one of just two NDP ridings in the entire province. She served her final term as the party’s de facto leader in the legislature.

MacPhail, chair of the ICBC board of directors, was not available Friday for comment.

2010: Bill Bennett

When Bennett left Gordon Campbell’s Liberal cabinet in 2010, he made the rare move of airing the party’s dirty laundry in public, alleging there was “almost a battered wife syndrome inside our caucus.” Taking that stand put him “in a very dark place,” but he strongly believed Campbell, who was in his third term as premier, should step down to save the party, which had slumped in the polls.

Bennett rose again in the Liberal ranks when Christy Clark took over the party the following year, but he still wears the scars from speaking out.

“In party politics, the pre-eminent value is loyalty to the leader. There are still many many people in British Columbia who hate my guts, because I set that one aside one time and chose to do something that I thought as an individual was right,” added Bennett, who hopes Wilson-Raybould’s career is not ruined by taking a stand.

“I hope Jody Wilson-Raybould doesn’t feel like she is done yet either … She is at the beginning of what should be a stellar career and a career that’s important to Canada.”

Bennett believes the federal Liberals would be “crazy” to not let Wilson-Raybould run again under their banner.

2012: John van Dongen

John van Dongen, a one-time Liberal solicitor-general, shocked British Columbia in 2012 when he defected to the tiny B.C. Conservative party, and on his way across the floor blasted premier Christy Clark and his former Liberal colleagues with a long shopping list of ethical violations.

“What I believe people expect from political leadership are core values that include integrity and a genuine commitment to public service,” he said at the time.

Van Dongen was incensed when the Liberals wrote off $6 million in legal fees racked up by the Liberal aides accused in the Basi-Virk corruption trial ignited by the bargain-priced sale of B.C. Rail.

“Every week, constituents question government actions and issues that I am not able to defend,” he said.

His former colleagues in the Liberal caucus were quick to savage Van Dongen as self-serving, nasty and self-aggrandizing.

His tenure with the Conservatives lasted only a few months and he soon lost his seat altogether while running as an independent.

Postmedia could not reach Van Dongen for this story, but the person who was elected in his former riding in 2017, Darryl Plecas, has high praise for the man.

“He was so trying to do the right thing. And he just got beaten up by the system,” Plecas said. “I had so much respect for John.”

2017: Darryl Plecas

Plecas is the most modern example of a maverick B.C. politician. Elected as a Liberal in Abbotsford South, he was booted from the party after taking the speaker’s job, which effectively allowed the NDP and Greens to form government and relegated the Liberals to opposition.

Plecas defended the move as “the right thing to do.”

He has gone on to ruffle more Liberal feathers, releasing a bombshell report in January that alleges massive misuse of taxpayer dollars by the legislature’s two top officials, mainly while the Liberals were in power.

Plecas, who does not think he will run again in the next election, said he knew when he took the speaker’s job he would be “pummelled” by his Liberal colleagues, but was guided by his “moral compass” — as he believes Wilson-Raybould is.

“I say three cheers for her. However difficult it might have been doing what I was doing, it’s a thousand times more difficult for her. She would have known all along that you do not do that without a consequence. That is the way the system works. You will be punished. But I’m sure for her there must be an enormous sense of peace,” he said.

“To see her have the courage to stand up and do what she did, I think let her be a lesson for all Canadians.”

Gabe Garfinkel, the director of the Liberal Party of Canada in B.C., said he has been focused on listening to what grassroots Liberals have to say about Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, and encouraging their feedback and ideas.

“This open dialogue has been important and will ultimately help us work toward our common goal of maintaining the Liberal government’s progress on housing affordability, creating jobs and protecting the environment,” Garfinkel wrote in a text message to Postmedia News.

“It’s also been important to Liberals across British Columbia for Jody Wilson-Raybould to speak openly at the justice committee, and supporters here were pleased she had the opportunity to do so.”

“The Vancouver Granville Liberal Riding Association stands in full support of our MP Jody Wilson-Raybould, and her important work for our community, region and Canada,” said association chair Claire Marshall.

Tamara Taggart, a former CTV news anchor, said she is still seeking the federal Liberal nomination for the Vancouver Kingsway riding, held by the NDP’s Don Davies since 2008.

Wilson-Raybould’s testimony has not made her reconsider carrying the party’s banner, she said.

“I think that Jody Wilson-Raybould is an amazing woman and I look up to her,” Taggart said.

“I have deep respect for her and I have deep respect for the prime minister, and that’s all I can really say, because I just watched it like every other Canadian did.”

But David Moscrop, a political scientist at the University of Ottawa, said the Liberals will now have a tough time selling their “Sunny Ways” slogan, should they plan to use it again for the Oct. 21 election.

‘Fairly or unfairly, it (the party’s alleged conduct) certainly undermines claims to be a great champion and defender of feminism,” he said.

“That might not be an entirely fair point because you might say, look at Jane Philpott, look at Catherine McKenna, look at Kristy Duncan … there are plenty of strong women in the cabinet who have an influence. But that doesn’t mean people won’t make that argument.”

Moscrop said the Liberals have also undermined their position as a party which champions reconciliation and supports Indigenous people.

“That’s the price you pay when you try to forefront an Indigenous woman as being core to your brand and then throw her under the bus,” he said.

Moscrop said it is too early to get a good sense of what past Liberal voters will do at the polls this fall. There’s still the potential for more information to come and for resignations, and it’s unclear how long the scandal will drag on.

“But, put it this way, it certainly has the makings of something that could do significant damage to the Liberals’ re-election prospects,” he said.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday denied interfering in Canada’s judicial system as he sought to defuse a controversy threatening his political future and offered no apology, asserting only that lessons had been learned.

Trying to ease a month-long crisis, Trudeau called a news conference to address allegations that improper pressure was put on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a criminal trial.

“There was no breakdown of our systems, of our rule of law, of the integrity of our institutions,” Trudeau, the Liberal Party leader, told reporters. “There was never any inappropriate pressure.”

Trudeau, 47, came to power in November 2015 promising “sunny ways,” more accountability and a greater number of women in cabinet. He now finds himself accused of trying to arrange a backroom deal with a major company as his officials leaned on a high-profile woman cabinet minister.

Trudeau and other senior officials deny doing anything improper by asking Wilson-Raybould to consider offering SNC-Lavalin a deal to avoid a trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. Wilson-Raybould had the power to scrap the decision to go to trial and impose a fine but decided against it.

The crisis has prompted the resignations of Wilson-Raybould, Treasury Board President Jane Philpott and Trudeau’s closest political aide, Gerald Butts.

Although Trudeau had addressed the crisis in previous encounters with the news media, it was the first time he had summoned reporters specifically to talk about the affair.

“As we look back over the past weeks, there are many lessons to be learned and many things we would have liked to have done differently,” he said, adding he should have been aware Wilson-Raybould was unhappy.

A weekly tracking poll released by Nanos Research on Tuesday put the Conservatives on 35 percent public support with the Liberals on 34 percent. A Jan. 8 poll by the same firm had put the Liberals on 39 percent with the Conservatives on 33. Each poll was based on a random phone survey of 1,000 Canadians.

CONSERVATIVE CRITICISM

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer again demanded Trudeau resign and accused him of trying to justify and normalize corruption.

“It’s clearer than ever that inside his government, political interference and contempt for the rule of law are a matter of course,” he said in a post on Twitter.

Some Liberal legislators complained privately that Trudeau’s team had mishandled the matter. One senior party member, who had previously voiced concerns, said Trudeau had been right not to apologize.

SNC-Lavalin, which employs 9,000 people in Canada, was seeking a deferred prosecution agreement to allow the firm to escape with a fine.

It has close connections to the government. Kevin Lynch, the company’s chair, was once head of the federal civil service.

The company is based in the populous largely French-speaking province of Quebec, where Trudeau’s Liberals lead in the polls but say they need to win more seats to have a chance in the October election.

Liberal officials say media coverage of the affair in Quebec has been much more favorable than in other parts of Canada.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee last week that officials, citing the need to protect jobs, kept on pressing her to think again even after she made clear she felt the company needed to face a trial.

“We considered she was still open to hearing different arguments, different approaches on what her decision could be. As we now learn … that was not the case,” Trudeau said.

He said relations between his office and Wilson-Raybould had clearly been fraying for months.

“I was not aware of that erosion of trust. As prime minister … I should have been,” Trudeau said.

Wilson-Raybould, unexpectedly demoted to the veterans affairs ministry in January, quit on Feb. 12.

Updated

Swathed in a purple dressing gown, the elderly woman sits alone at the dining room table, her gaze fixed into the distance.

Key points: The image has been used by both Labor and the Liberals in political campaigns

The photo was taken 10 years ago in the United States

The photo is a widely used stock image of a generic elderly woman

One hand rests on her furrowed brow. In the other, she holds a sheet of paper — the type that looks to be bearing bad news.

The photograph is a powerful visual metaphor that speaks to the precarious nature of life facing her generation: failing health, financial hardship and social isolation.

Which is why in the decade since it was first taken, this $40 photo of the lady in the purple dressing gown has become a familiar stock image of choice for many journalists, marketers, advertisers and political parties.

And over the past few years, she has featured regularly in campaign material for both Labor and the Liberals before graduating to become a key visual motif of Liberal Party's ""retiree tax"" campaign targeting Labor's proposed franking credit reforms.

Same woman, same pose

The Labor Party used the image in Facebook campaigns in 2013, 2014 and 2015 to attack then prime minister Tony Abbott over his government's aged pension reforms.

In August 2018, Labor used the same photo of the woman to shame the Morrison Government over its provision of home care assistance for ageing Australians.

But the Liberal Party has also been an enthusiastic user of the photo, adopting the woman as the ""poster granny"" for its campaign against the Labor Party's franking credit reforms.

In May 2018, the Tasmanian Liberals featured the photo in a Facebook post having a go at ""Labor's Granny Tax"".

A month later, the photo made a cameo in a Liberal Party YouTube video titled ""Labor's Taxes: The Bill Australia Can't Afford"".

The video warned that a Shorten Labor government would ""take more than $200 billion from the pockets of Australians"" in the form of new or higher taxes.

Same woman, same pose, but now being deployed by both the Liberals and Labor for different causes.

From Facebook to billboards

Towards the end of 2018, she appeared on the Liberal Party's website as the face behind a petition form and, in January, cropped up in a number of Facebook posts made by Liberal MPs calling out ""Labor's unfair retiree tax"".

Last week, the campaign went up another notch. A post by Liberal National Party MP Luke Howarth, who currently holds the marginal seat of Petrie in the northern suburbs of Brisbane, shows the photograph on a roadside advertising billboard.

And later in the week, Liberal MPs and candidates were re-posting and re-tweeting a new variation of the social media campaign with the same familiar face in the background.

But there's more to the history of the woman in the purple dressing gown.

In an era of never-ending news cycles and the infinite opportunities afforded by social media, it's becoming increasingly hard to keep track of who uses what and when.

Which is why it probably went unnoticed that the same stock image of the lady in the purple dressing gown was used in a 2012 Obama campaign video taking down the Republican health care policy.

Convenience versus authenticity

Titled ""An elderly lady sat looking stressed reading bills"", the photo is one of a set available for purchase for $39.60 (including GST) from the leading stock image providers.

If you have been targeted by unusual political messages in the lead up to the federal election, show us what you're seeing. Email hiddencampaign@abc.net.au

Over the years the same image has also been used by many organisations including a Washington DC public policy institute, a South Florida debt advisory service, a charity for retired Delta Airlines employees, the Irish branch of the Society of St Vincent de Paul, a New York state medical billing company, an Oklahoma law firm and a home care service provider in Philadelphia.

The photo has likewise illustrated stories about retirement and healthcare in numerous news websites including Network 10, financial news site CNBC, Britain's Daily Express, Radio Canada International, Germany's Die Welt and Connecticut's New Haven Register.

According to a signed release form supplied by stock image provider iStockphoto, the woman who posed for the photographs lived in the town of Sandy in Utah and sat for the shoot on September 25, 2009.

At the time of the photo shoot, the woman — whose name was redacted from the form — was 72-years-old.

Todd Keith, a photographer from Salt Lake City who took the photo, said he believed his model was a US citizen who has since passed away.

Using stock images in political advertising is not without risks. It involves a trade-off between convenience and authenticity.

As the backlash over the recent case of the ""fake retiree"" and the 2016 ""fake tradie"" incident shows, there can be blowback when corners are cut.

""It is common for political parties of all persuasions to use stock images in their communications,"" a spokesman for the Liberal Party said, providing examples of some of the Labor Party's recent use of stock photos.

The Labor Party has also been approached for comment.

Even though he makes part of his living from stock photography, Mr Keith was firmly of the view that political parties should steer clear of them.

""It's not at all representative,"" he said. ""These [models] could be anybody, or have any political beliefs.""

That view is endorsed by Dee Madigan, the executive creative director of advertising firm Campaign Edge.

""It's surprising that they would do that,"" she said. ""Why not just spend a little bit more on a proper photograph. Otherwise, this becomes the story, as it will. Then it's an own goal.""

Ms Madigan, who has worked on campaigns for Labor in the past, says that her creative team now avoids using stock photos and even actors in political advertising.

""Which is really hard because real people are terrible at playing real people.""

She said the scandal me…,"(Bloomberg) -- The crisis engulfing Justin Trudeau’s government is deepening, with the self-avowed feminist prime minister of Canada reeling as high-profile female lawmakers jump ship amid an ethics uproar.

Treasury Board President Jane Philpott -- seen as one of his team’s star performers -- quit cabinet Monday amid questions about Trudeau’s efforts to snuff out corruption charges against Montreal construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. She said the scandal meant she could no longer back the government.

Philpott follows Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney general who says she was pressured by Trudeau and key aides into ending prosecution of the company. Another lawmaker, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, has declined to seek re-election. While she said her decision wasn’t related to SNC-Lavalin, she publicly cheered on Philpott and Wilson-Raybould.

It all leaves Trudeau without two of the highest-profile women in his famously gender-balanced cabinet. “Because it’s 2015” is how he explained the 50-50 lineup after a convincing election win four years ago. Amid the current scandal, however, he faces weakening party solidarity and sagging poll numbers.

‘Lost Confidence’

As head of the Treasury Board, Philpott -- a doctor from a Toronto-area district -- would have carried out many of the nuts-and-bolts efforts of the government’s agenda in the lead-up to the October election. Instead, she said she couldn’t back the government because of the SNC controversy.

“The evidence of efforts by politicians and/or officials to pressure the former Attorney General to intervene in the criminal case involving SNC-Lavalin and the evidence as to the content of those efforts have raised serious concerns for me,” Philpott said in her resignation letter. “Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised.”

There’s a gendered thread to the defections. Wilson-Raybould lauded Philpott’s decision Monday, calling her a “Mother of Country.” The former treasury board chief, who previously served as health minister, was among a handful of Liberal lawmakers who voiced support for Wilson-Raybould after her exit. The former attorney-general then returned the favor. “You are a leader of vision & strength & I look forward to continuing to work alongside you,” Wilson-Raybould tweeted.

Caesar-Chavannes -- a one-time parliamentary secretary to Trudeau -- also celebrated the move. “When you add women, please do not expect the status quo. Expect us to make correct decisions, stand for what is right and exit when values are compromised,” she said on Twitter.

Trudeau was elected under a pledge of “real change,” while leading a party with a long history of backroom deals. Part of his wave included many new faces -- Wilson-Raybould, Philpott and Caesar-Chavannes were all elected for the first time in 2015. Trudeau bet on the new blood when he froze out much of his party’s old guard, including senators appointed by his predecessors. He also trumpeted the need to bring diversity to the decision-making table. Wilson-Raybould was the country’s first indigenous justice minister, while Caesar-Chavannes is one of only a handful of black lawmakers in Trudeau’s caucus.

The departures leave Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland as one of the few women holding a major cabinet post, along with Carla Qualtrough, the former procurement minister who was named acting head of the Treasury Board to replace Philpott. Freeland, who led negotiations over the revamped North American free-trade deal, has so far stood by the prime minister.

Deferred Prosecution

The rest of Trudeau’s cabinet continues to back him, and lawmaker Steven MacKinnon on Monday acknowledged the Liberals “absolutely have a disagreement here” on the issue of stepping in to help SNC-Lavalin with a so-called deferred prosecution agreement.

“Our belief is that this company is one that is, like its competitors around the world, entitled to a deferred prosecution arrangement like they would be able to have access to,” in other countries with similar systems, MacKinnon told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. “The vast majority of my colleagues believe the government has acted entirely appropriately.”

The path forward now for Trudeau is unclear. While Caesar-Chavannes isn’t running again, Wilson-Raybould has said she intends to stay in the Liberal Party caucus and seek reelection under the party’s banner. Trudeau indicated Monday he was still weighing whether to force Wilson-Raybould out. Philpott hasn’t indicated if she will seek re-election.

But on Thursday, we learned that the lifestyle guru is taking the next logical step in her friendship with Snoop Dogg—which involves a cooking show the two host together that gave us the line, “Snoop’s Cornish game hens were the best ever”—and getting into the increasingly lucrative weed business.

CNBC reports that Stewart has signed on as an adviser to Canopy Growth, one of the largest marijuana producers in the world, to develop a line of C.B.D. products for animals. (Stewart’s own pets, which are often featured on her Instagram account, include Chow Chows, French bulldogs, Persian cats, a Fell pony, and Friesian horses.) “I am delighted to establish this partnership with Canopy Growth and share with them the knowledge I have gained after years of experience in the subject of living,” Stewart said in a statement. “I’m especially looking forward to our first collaboration together, which will offer sensible products for people’s beloved pets.” While Stewart says she herself doesn’t smoke, she has no problem with others smoking around her, which makes sense considering she’s just joined a pot company. “So someone smokes marijuana? Big deal! People smoke cigarettes and die from cancer,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. “I haven’t heard of anybody dying from cannabis. I’m quite egalitarian and liberal when it comes to stuff like that.”

Canopy—whose subsidiary, Tweed, unveiled a partnership with Snoop Dogg in 2016 that included a brand of weed called “Leafs by Snoop”—was founded in 2013 and received a major boost last year with the decision by Canada to legalize recreational pot, leading to such demand that there were supply shortages across the country.

Larry Kudlow: forget what you’ve heard, trade talks with China are going great

Yesterday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer appeared before Congress and uttered the words, regarding the trade war with China that has cost U.S. exporters $40 billion: “Let me be clear, much still needs to be done both before an agreement is reached and, more importantly, after it is reached, if one is reached.” In other words: slow your roll, Donald Trump. But according to National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, who has the distinction of never being right, Lighthizer is just being a stick in the mud:

“Last week was fantastic,” Kudlow told CNBC’s Squawk on the Street. “We’re making great headway on nontariff barriers and tariffs regarding various commodities such as soybeans and energy and beef. We have mechanisms with regard to enforcement, which is—I think—unparalleled.”

And at least one person believes him!

You’ll never believe it, but the White House’s top economic guru doesn’t like the Green New Deal

Speaking of the economy, while 2018 was an extremely solid year, things ahead look a bit more dicey:

Gross domestic product—the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the United States—grew at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the final three months of last year, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That marks a significant slowdown from the middle of the year, when a sugar high fueled by tax cuts and government-spending increases briefly pushed growth above 4 percent.

This year seems to be starting at an even slower pace. Many economists expect growth to drop below 2 percent in the first quarter, in part because of the partial government shutdown, which began in December and extended through most of January.

In recent decades, Russian and Chinese conglomerates have gained ever more global economic influence, making them powerful foreign-policy tools for their respective governments. But now Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are learning that they are the tools.

NEW YORK – Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping have each championed a model of authoritarian capitalism (call it “development with a dictator’s face”). But what neither leader seems to have anticipated is that the Russian and Chinese commercial sectors are becoming political forces in their own right, increasingly bringing pressure to bear on policymaking.

Wojtek Radwanski/AFP/Getty Images Europe, Please Wake Up Feb 11, 2019 argues that the EU cannot be saved without transforming its political party systems. Previous Next

Over the past two decades, Russian and Chinese multinational corporations – many of them awash in cash – have become powerful foreign-policy tools for their respective regimes. But they were once seen as modernizing forces that would help open up business and society alike. With energy giants like Gazprom and Rosneft promising to bring commercial values to backward Russia and the newly independent former Soviet states, Anatoly Chubais, a key architect of Russia’s privatization program, touted them as the vanguard of a new “liberal empire.” (Insofar as these firms also bound the former Soviet republics closer to Russia, so much the better.)

Likewise, in China during the presidencies of Jiang Zemin (1993-2003) and Hu Jintao (2003-2013), the rise of banks like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China, and of energy and heavy-industry firms like Sinopec, Sinochem, and the China Railway Construction Corporation, were seen as harbingers of modernization. Yet today, no one could mistake these firms for the equivalent of an ExxonMobil or a Microsoft. With top executives often parachuting directly into the boardroom from high political office, Chinese mega-corporations have long represented a merger of business and the state.

Moreover, as Gazprom, Rosneft, and the Chinese technology giants ZTE and Huawei have grown more essential to their respective governments, business and state interests have become even harder to disentangle. In the interest of their “national champions,” both the Russian and Chinese governments now seem to be pursuing policies they might not have chosen otherwise.

This dynamic is clearly on display in Venezuela. Through its affiliation with Venezuela’s state oil monopoly, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Rosneft has funneled upward of $17 billion in loans to the Chavist regime over the past decade. Meanwhile, Rosneft gained three million tons of oil in 2017 from its operations in Venezuela; more generally Russia has invested in many Venezuelan industries, from banking to bus assembly. At the same time, Venezuela has been one of the largest buyers of Russian weapons among Latin American countries.

Owing to these debts and other economic ties, Putin has little choice but to back the Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro’s crumbling regime, even as public support in Russia for the Kremlin’s foreign interventions declines. Rosneft’s interests in Venezuela are simply too deep for it to withdraw, especially now that Western sanctions have crippled the firm’s ability to secure financing in international markets.

Russia’s support for Maduro does not rise to the same level as its commitments in Syria, where its relationship with the Assad family goes back decades. Rather, its continued engagement in Venezuela reflects a cold, hard business calculation. According to Reuters, private security contractors with close ties to the Kremlin have been sent to defend Maduro. At the same time, there have been unverified (but plausible) reports of Russian planes departing Venezuela with shipments of gold, as payment for the country’s debts. Putin knows that if National Assembly President Juan Guaidó takes power, those who stood with Maduro will likely be ousted, and Russia’s privileged access to Venezuela’s oil fields revoked.

In monetary terms, Maduro’s fall could mean even larger losses for China, which has investments in Venezuela estimated to be worth around $60 billion – at least three times more than Russia’s. Like Russia, China got into bed with the Venezuelan regime in the 2000s, when the country was flourishing under former President Hugo Chávez. While China secured a sorely needed source of oil for its fast-growing economy, Chávez was able to reduce Venezuela’s reliance on the US as one of its leading export markets. In the meantime, Chinese tech giants have aided the Maduro regime in its domestic surveillance efforts, and (like Russia) China has sold Venezuela expensive weapons.

Still, should Maduro fall, China may be less exposed than Russia. The Chinese have been careful to cultivate contacts among various elements of Venezuelan society, including the opposition. And while China still supports Maduro officially, it has not followed Russia in accusing the US of an attempted coup.

This suggests that China wants to avoid the kind of radical steps that Russia is taking. The Kremlin is now actively competing with the US to influence the course of events in Venezuela, and has described the US attempt to deliver humanitarian aid across the Colombia-Venezuela border as a ruse to smuggle in weapons for the opposition.

China’s moderate behavior no doubt owes something to its ongoing trade negotiations with the US. Before extending his deadline for imposing higher tariffs on Chinese imports, US President Donald Trump indicated that Huawei and ZTE might be included in a final Sino-American trade deal. That would certainly please Xi, whose paramount interest is to protect both firms’ economic might.

With the ability to bar US companies from selling crucial inputs to Chinese firms, the Trump administration could inflict serious harm on both ZTE and Huawei. Huawei already stands accused of conspiring to violate US sanctions on Iran, leading to the arrest of its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Canada this past December. And ZTE has pled guilty to similar charges, paying penalties of $1.4 billion in 2017.

At the end of the day, Venezuela can’t hold a candle to the strategic importance of these two firms. And for the Kremlin, the calculus is the same: the prerogatives of business define the national interest. But, perhaps to Putin’s chagrin, in Venezuela that calculus has produced the opposite outcome.",Wag the Dictator,Project-syndicate.org,https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/russia-china-multinationals-setting-policy-by-nina-l--khrushcheva-2019-02

There’s no scandal here with SNC-Lavalin The Globe and Mail…","OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will try to shift the focus from the SNC-Lavalin affair to his preferred campaign battleground — climate change — with the release this week of the Liberal party's first election-year ads.

Radio ads will air in the four provinces where the federal government is imposing a carbon tax after their conservative provincial governments refused to levy their own price on carbon: Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick.

The ads stress that the money raised from the tax will be rebated directly to residents in those provinces.

The Canadian Press In new radio ads aimed at commuters, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warns that ""some politicians want to go back to the Harper years when pollution was free.""

Trudeau will set the stage for the ad campaign with a ""climate action"" rally in Toronto on Monday night.

The ads will then begin airing Tuesday morning, aimed at commuters.

The message, delivered by Trudeau, is identical for the four provinces — aside from the amount of money to be rebated to residents, which varies depending on the amount of carbon emissions to be taxed in each province.

According to the ads, an average family of four will receive more than $600 this year in Saskatchewan, more than $300 in Ontario and Manitoba and more than $250 in New Brunswick.

""Climate change is a real and serious problem,"" Trudeau says in the ads.

""We have a strong plan to fight it, one that leading scientists and economists support. It makes polluters pay and gives the money back to people.""

In a jab at the federal Conservatives and their provincial cousins, Trudeau concludes: ""Now, some politicians want to go back to the Harper years when pollution was free. We have to do better than that. Our kids are counting on us.""

Ads planned for months, party spokesman says

The Trudeau government is requiring provinces to impose a price on carbon emissions, starting at $20 per tonne this year and rising by $10 per tonne annually until it hits $50 in 2022. It is imposing its own tax on those provinces that have refused to meet the federal threshold.

The first payments will be visible to residents in the four provinces when they file their taxes this spring — in plenty of time to register with voters before they head to the polls in October.

Trudeau is also scheduled to visit Monday with a Mississauga family to ""highlight the climate action incentive payment.""

Environment Minister Catherine McKenna is also set to make a climate-related announcement in Ottawa on Monday, as the start of what a spokeswoman calls the start of an ""Ontario tour."" The prime minister and other Liberal MPs will be making similar appearances across the country this week.

Liberal party spokesman Braeden Caley says the rally and the radio ads have been planned for months — long before the SNC-Lavalin affair engulfed Trudeau's government this month with allegations of political interference in the justice system. But the timing is felicitous as the Liberals seek to change the channel from the controversy.

In bombshell testimony before the House of Commons justice committee last week, former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould said she was improperly pressured last fall by the Prime Minister's Office, the finance minister's office and the country's top public servant to prevent a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Watch: Wilson-Raybould says she asked Trudeau if he was interfering in case

Trudeau has insisted that he and others only wanted Wilson-Raybould to consider the impact of a prosecution on the viability of the Montreal engineering giant and its 9,000 Canadian employees, but they were always clear that it was up to her alone, as attorney general, to decide whether to intervene.

The director of public prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, decided last September not to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin, a legal option that would force the company to pay stiff penalties without the risk of a criminal conviction that could cripple it financially.

It is legally permissible for the attorney general to override the director of public prosecutions. Wilson-Raybould has said she considered the pressure on her to do so ""inappropriate,"" although she concedes it was not illegal.

Liberals mock Scheer for lack of climate change plan

Until the SNC-Lavalin affair exploded last month, climate change was anticipated to be the pivotal issue in the looming federal election campaign.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has warned that the carbon tax will drive up the cost of everything for consumers. He has yet to unveil his own plan for battling climate change — a fact which Liberals have ridiculed on a party-sponsored website that professes to be about the Conservative leader's climate plan.

Anyone visiting the website gets an error message — ""No plan found"" — and an updated count of the number of days that have gone by since Scheer promised a plan (308 as of Sunday).",Trudeau Seeks To Shift Focus Away From SNC-Lavalin With Climate Change Ads - HuffPost Canada,Huffingtonpost.ca,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/03/04/trudeau-snc-lavalin-climate-change-ads_a_23683520/

In dramatic testimony that lasted nearly four hours, Jody Wilson-Raybould broke her silence with a detailed account of efforts by Trudeau and top aides to persuade her to step in and end prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. She argues it amounted to interference in the judicial system, though concedes it wasn’t illegal, while Trudeau says he was trying to prevent job losses in his home province of Quebec.

“I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere,” the former attorney general said Wednesday afternoon. Wilson-Raybould, who quit cabinet this month, also said she faced “veiled threats” about what might happen if she refused to order an out-of-court settlement.

Her testimony shook the core of the Trudeau’s team, naming him, his finance chief and his most senior aides. The Conservative leader trying to unseat Trudeau in this fall’s election called for his resignation, but the prime minister stood his ground and rejected Wilson-Raybould’s version of events.

The public airing of grievances will inflame the scandal, which has driven the governing Liberals lower in national polls. The ordeal dredges up ghosts of the party’s past, which is marked by hand-in-glove ties with corporate Canada -- particularly in Quebec. The political fallout, however, is difficult to predict. Trudeau’s path to re-election runs through the largely French-speaking province, where his defense of SNC-Lavalin is being applauded.

Protecting Jobs

“I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau said Wednesday night in Montreal, where he was celebrating a Liberal Party by-election victory. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy.”

SNC-Lavalin had been pushing for what’s known as a deferred prosecution agreement to end a criminal case dating back more than a decade, related to corruption charges. The company’s stock plunged the most in six years Oct. 10 when it revealed that the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ruled out a negotiated settlement that would have staved off a trial. Settling out of court would also help the company, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada, avoid a ban on bidding for federal government contracts.

Wilson-Raybould pulled back the curtain on the effort to change that decision and help the company, in testimony that was aired on national television in its entirety. She spoke to lawmakers only after Trudeau waived privilege to allow her to do so, and believes she wasn’t even legally able to intervene.

Inner Circle

She said the prime minister and his aides wanted to end the case in part to prevent the company’s relocation -- and also to avoid electoral fallout for both the federal Liberals and the party’s provincial wing. Wilson-Raybould said she resisted intervening because she wanted to uphold the principle of judicial independence and the rule of law, but officials ignored her repeated instructions to stop raising the issue.

The former attorney-general identified a series of phone calls and meetings between her or her staff, and Trudeau or several of his top advisers. They include chief of staff Katie Telford; former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who resigned this month; and senior aides Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques. She also cited communications with Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his chief of staff Ben Chin.

One of the meetings was with Trudeau himself, in September. “The prime minister raised the issue immediately. The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC,” Wilson-Raybould said. She said she’d told him she had made up her mind.

London Calling

“The prime minister again cited the potential loss of jobs and SNC moving,” while also stressing that he represents an electoral district in Quebec. She said Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, the country’s top bureaucrat, also warned her the company “will likely be moving to London” without her intervention.

Discussions continued. Wilson-Raybould said Bouchard at one point said bluntly: “We can have the best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected.”",Trudeau’s Former AG Alleges ‘Veiled Threats’ to Settle SNC Case,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/trudeau-former-ag-alleges-veiled-214856748.html

Trudeau, rejecting an opposition call for his resignation, disputed allegations on Wednesday by his former justice minister that government officials inappropriately pressured her to help the SNC-Lavalin construction firm avoid a corruption trial.

The testimony from Jody Wilson-Raybould threatens to badly damage the Liberals just months ahead of what polls suggest will be a hard-fought election.

In an unusual move, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland appeared on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp to say she fully backed Trudeau.

“Of course I support the prime minister 100 percent ... I am very clearly of the view that the prime minister would never apply improper pressure,” she said.

Freeland, one of the most prominent members of the Cabinet, is seen by some observers as a possible successor to Trudeau.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, who on Wednesday called on Trudeau to quit, formally asked the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to probe the matter. Scheer said in a letter that it was illegal “to attempt to obstruct or defeat the course of justice.”

Wilson-Raybould, who complained about pressure from Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s then-principal secretary, said she did not consider the officials had broken any laws. Trudeau said the police had not contacted anyone in his office.

Butts, who quit earlier this month while proclaiming his innocence, asked on Thursday to speak to the justice committee to address Wilson-Raybould’s remarks.

One top Liberal official said there was no talk for now of a challenge to Trudeau’s leadership. In the Canadian political system, party leaders are elected at formal conventions and cannot be deposed by a simple vote of legislators, which means any move to push out Trudeau would be lengthy.

But another senior Liberal Party member said there was growing unhappiness among legislators about how Trudeau’s team had handled the SNC-Lavalin matter and that the prime minister needed to replace some of his staff.

“The level of concern over what has happened over the last few hours is unprecedented,” said the Liberal, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.

MAJOR EMPLOYER

SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals have said they need to pick up seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government. Liberal officials said media coverage of the affair in Quebec had been generally favorable.

Trudeau told reporters on Thursday that “Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy and that’s exactly what we have done ... we’ve also done it in a way that has respected our laws”.

Wilson-Raybould said she had confronted Trudeau in September over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help SNC-Lavalin evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. Wilson-Raybould said she made clear she was not prepared to help the company avoid a trial, which is now pending.

Wilson-Raybould said staff working for Finance Minister Bill Morneau had continued to press her to help the firm even after she asked them to stop.

Morneau told reporters that his officials had not behaved inappropriately and like Trudeau, stressed the importance of protecting jobs.

Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly given a less prominent job in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She said she was convinced her refusal to give way on the SNC-Lavalin case had prompted her demotion.","Top ally supports embattled Canada PM, easing pressure for now",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-politics-snc-lavalin-idUSKCN1QH215

Last week, former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould told a Commons justice committee she faced heavy political pressure and veiled threats from top Liberal officials who wanted her to allow SNC-Lavalin to avoid a trial on bribery charges.

SNC-Lavalin is facing corruption charges over contracts in Libya and was lobbying for a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) as an alternative to criminal prosecution. DPAs allow companies to avoid criminal prosecution by paying hefty fines and, in some cases, agreeing to outside monitoring.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from cabinet last month, recounted how Kathleen Roussel, the director of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada (PPSC), let her know in early September 2018 that she was rejecting the company's request to negotiate a deferred prosecution.

MacKinnon pointed to legislation that allows the attorney general to overturn a decision made by the director of public prosecutions.

""We do have a disagreement here. We absolutely have a disagreement here and I think the current attorney general has said that, look you have to keep assessing the facts as these cases move along,"" he said. ""But the fact is that we have 10,000 Canadians and their families and pensioners and suppliers and others who are not entitled to the same kind relief they would get if they were to work for an SNC-Lavalin competitor in the United States or in the United Kingdom ...

""The disagreement goes to how you see how Canada ought to approach major economic questions like the SNC-Lavalin issue. Do we do it like our OECD partners, do with these deferred prosecution arrangements, that have been widely discussed? Or do we do it with a ... perhaps more rigid approach?""

Deferred prosecution agreements ​became law in Canada in September of 2018.

It (almost) never happens in politics appeared first on Macleans.ca.","It is difficult to come up with any recent example of a Canadian cabinet minister resigning on principle, let alone one with anything near the devastating political impact that Jane Philpott stepping down as Treasury Board president on Monday has unleashed on Justin Trudeau’s government.

In a tweet announcing the decision that dropped jaws across Ottawa, she wrote, “There can be a cost to acting on one’s principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.” Her resignation letter explained that given the constitutional convention of cabinet solidarity in Canada, compelling ministers to defend all cabinet decisions and speak in support of the government, “it is untenable for me to continue to serve as a Cabinet minister.”

Philpott is close friends with Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former Attorney General who resigned from cabinet herself on Feb. 12, and whose testimony before the House of Commons justice committee last week implicated Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his top advisors and even the clerk of the Privy Council in what she described as sustained and inappropriate political efforts to help the Montreal construction giant SNC-Lavalin out of a legal jam. In her resignation letter, Philpott highlighted the issues of “independence and integrity of our justice system” that were central to Wilson-Raybould’s testimony last week.

“It is a fundamental doctrine of the rule of law that our Attorney General should not be subjected to political pressure or interference regarding the exercise of her prosecutorial discretion in criminal cases,” Philpott wrote. “Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised.”

Canadian political history contains only a handful of other cabinet resignations on principle. They include:

John Turner resigns as finance minister (1975)

It was the defeat of John Turner’s 1974 budget that triggered the election that brought Pierre Trudeau’s government back to majority territory, but as Turner struggled to control inflation, it was widely known that he wanted out of finance. By the summer of 1975, media reports had him mulling over quitting the government and leaving politics entirely.

Turner and Trudeau met and attempted to hash things out twice without resolution. Ultimately, Turner was fed up with what he saw as a government out of step with the reality of the economy and which had failed to support his fiscal policies. He also didn’t see a way to seize the leadership of the Liberal Party anytime soon, and so he submitted his resignation from cabinet on Sept. 9, 1975.

The resignation became massive political news, though opinion was divided between those who saw it as a betrayal of Trudeau and others who believed Turner was the sympathetic party.

In 1976, Turner quit politics and switched to corporate and legal work. In 1984, after Trudeau left politics for keeps, Turner threw his hat into the leadership ring and won on the second ballot, defeating Jean Chrétien. Turner automatically became Prime Minister, as the newly minted leader of the governing party, but after he dissolved Parliament and called an election for September 1984, his party was demolished by Brian Mulroney’s Progressive Conservatives.

The Liberals improved their ballot box showing in 1988, but Turner eventually resigned the leadership in 1990 and was succeeded by Chrétien.

Lucien Bouchard maybe resigned as environment minister, or was possibly fired? (1990)

Lucien Bouchard was minister of the environment and Brian Mulroney’s Quebec lieutenant when the Progressive Conservative government was making a second attempt to secure Quebec’s agreement on the revised Constitution.

To that attempted end, the Meech Lake Accord declared Quebec a “distinct society” and afforded the provinces more power. Bouchard was frustrated by what he perceived as Mulroney’s excessive concessions, and he sent a telegram of support to the Parti Québécois and declared himself a sovereigntist.

The exact terms of Bouchard’s departure have been disputed by the parties involved. Bouchard insisted he quit, but after the fact, Mulroney maintained that he fired him. “I said to him, ‘I have no choice but to demand your resignation immediately which I am now doing. You are no longer a member of my government. I have no idea why you did this, one day we will know,'” the former prime minister said in conversation with author Peter C. Newman.

In 1991, Bouchard established the Bloc Québécois with a cadre of other disenchanted Conservative and Liberal MPs from Quebec. In the 1993 federal election, the nascent party took 54 seats and Bouchard became the leader of the Official Opposition.

The whole affair caused an irrevocable rift between the former political colleagues. “Friends should not be in politics together when they disagree over principles,” Bouchard told CBC years later.

Michael Chong resigns intergovernmental affairs minister (2006)

On Nov. 27, 2006, the House of Commons overwhelmingly passed a motion stating “That this House recognize that the Québécois form a nation within a united Canada.” The motion had been Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s retort to a similar Bloc Québécois motion that did not have the benefit of mentioning Canada.

The motion was controversial, though Harper had argued that he used the word nation in a “cultural-sociological” sense and not a legal one. He had ordered his MPs not to oppose the motion or they could be expelled by caucus.

Conservative MP Michael Chong was Harper’s intergovernmental affairs minister at the time, and he resigned from cabinet in protest against the motion, saying it was too vague and opened the door to distinctions he found troubling. “To me, recognizing Quebecers as a nation, even inside a united Canada, implies the recognition of ethnicity, and I cannot support that,” he said. “I do not believe in an ethnic nationalism. I believe in a civic nationalism.”

The motion ultimately passed by a wide margin of 265-16. Chong went on to run unsuccessfully for the Conservative leadership in 2017, and remains a Conservative MP today.

Popular Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that “the prime minister would never apply improper pressure” and expressed “100 percent faith” in him.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau denied meddling, saying it was “entirely appropriate” for his staff to talk with the justice minister’s staff about the economic effects of their decisions.

Ex-Attorney General and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould testified Wednesday that Trudeau, his staff and other officials imposed inappropriate pressure on her to avoid criminal prosecution of Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin in a case involving allegations of corruption in Libya. She said they pushed for an agreement that would let the company pay reparations but avoid a conviction.

If convicted criminally, the company would be banned from receiving any federal government business for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in Quebec, with about 3,400 employees in the province, 9,000 employees in Canada and more than 50,000 worldwide.

Trudeau has acknowledged raising the issue with Wilson-Raybould, but said that was appropriate.

“Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs,” Trudeau said Thursday. “That’s exactly what we have done every step of the way.

“We have also done it in a way that has respected our laws and respected the independence of the judiciary,” he added. “There are no doubt disagreements in perspective on this but I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job and we were doing in a way that respects and defends our institutions.”

Morneau said he never raised issue with Wilson-Raybould, but said she had “approached me in the House of Commons to inform me that my staff was speaking to her staff, which I think is entirely appropriate.”

Wilson-Raybould herself said she didn’t think the pressure had been illegal; she had not directly instructed to avoid prosecuting.

But she said Trudeau warned that a prosecution would drive the company and its jobs out of Canada, and she said she was “barraged” and subjected to “hounding” by Trudeau and senior members of his government, including Morneau and his chief of staff.

The opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is calling on Trudeau to resign, and Wilson-Raybould’s testimony to Parliament has increased the uproar against Trudeau, who is facing an election this fall. Trudeau has already lost his closet adviser, Gerald Butts, who resigned last week. Butts denied he or anyone in Trudeau’s office pressured Wilson-Raybould and he is now asking Parliament’s justice committee to testify.

“I believe my evidence will be of assistance,” Butts said in a statement.

Wilson-Raybould, who had already been demoted to veterans’ affairs minister in January, resigned from the Cabinet on Feb. 12. She remains a member of Trudeau’s Liberal party in Parliament.","Trudeau, ministers deny improper pressure",Seattletimes.com,https://www.seattletimes.com/business/trudeau-ministers-deny-improper-pressure/

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday denied interfering in Canada's judicial system as he sought to defuse a controversy threatening his political future and offered no apology, asserting only that lessons had been learned.

Trying to ease a month-long crisis, Trudeau called a news conference to address allegations that improper pressure was put on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a criminal trial.

""There was no breakdown of our systems, of our rule of law, of the integrity of our institutions,"" Trudeau, the Liberal Party leader, told reporters. ""There was never any inappropriate pressure.""

Trudeau, 47, came to power in November 2015 promising ""sunny ways,"" more accountability and a greater number of women in cabinet. He now finds himself accused of trying to arrange a backroom deal with a major company as his officials leaned on a high-profile woman cabinet minister.

Trudeau and other senior officials deny doing anything improper by asking Wilson-Raybould to consider offering SNC-Lavalin a deal to avoid a trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. Wilson-Raybould had the power to scrap the decision to go to trial and impose a fine but decided against it.

The crisis has prompted the resignations of Wilson-Raybould, Treasury Board President Jane Philpott and Trudeau's closest political aide, Gerald Butts.

Although Trudeau had addressed the crisis in previous encounters with the news media, it was the first time he had summoned reporters specifically to talk about the affair.

""As we look back over the past weeks, there are many lessons to be learned and many things we would have liked to have done differently,"" he said, adding he should have been aware Wilson-Raybould was unhappy.

A weekly tracking poll released by Nanos Research on Tuesday put the Conservatives on 35 percent public support with the Liberals on 34 percent. A Jan. 8 poll by the same firm had put the Liberals on 39 percent with the Conservatives on 33. Each poll was based on a random phone survey of 1,000 Canadians.

CONSERVATIVE CRITICISM

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer again demanded Trudeau resign and accused him of trying to justify and normalise corruption.

""It's clearer than ever that inside his government, political interference and contempt for the rule of law are a matter of course,"" he said in a post on Twitter.

Some Liberal legislators complained privately that Trudeau's team had mishandled the matter. One senior party member, who had previously voiced concerns, said Trudeau had been right not to apologise.

SNC-Lavalin, which employs 9,000 people in Canada, was seeking a deferred prosecution agreement to allow the firm to escape with a fine.

It has close connections to the government. Kevin Lynch, the company's chair, was once head of the federal civil service.

The company is based in the populous largely French-speaking province of Quebec, where Trudeau's Liberals lead in the polls but say they need to win more seats to have a chance in the October election.

Liberal officials say media coverage of the affair in Quebec has been much more favourable than in other parts of Canada.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee last week that officials, citing the need to protect jobs, kept on pressing her to think again even after she made clear she felt the company needed to face a trial.

""We considered she was still open to hearing different arguments, different approaches on what her decision could be. As we now learn ... that was not the case,"" Trudeau said.

He said relations between his office and Wilson-Raybould had clearly been fraying for months.

""I was not aware of that erosion of trust. As prime minister ... I should have been,"" Trudeau said.

Wilson-Raybould, unexpectedly demoted to the veterans affairs ministry in January, quit on Feb. 12.

The latest Angus Reid Institute poll shows the Liberals falling behind the Conservatives in popular support, the PM’s approval rating dipping to Trump territory and Canadians engaging on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

According to the poll released Tuesday, Canadians are more engaged on this issue than on NAFTA talks, on China, even the Me Too movement. The poll shows that 66% agree with the statement that “There is a deeper scandal in the Prime Minister’s Office and more information will emerge.”

That view goes across the country and across all age groups, something that should frighten the Liberal campaign team.

Already the party is down in voter support, the poll showing that the Conservatives are ahead by seven points.

When asked “who they would support if an election were held tomorrow,” 38% said the Conservatives, 31% the Liberals and 14% the NDP.

The Trudeau Liberals are down in support across the country while Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives are on the rise.

The Angus Reid survey, which was conducted between Feb. 21-24, shows the Conservatives leading in every region but Quebec and Atlantic Canada.

In Quebec, the Liberals and Conservatives are tied at 24% support.

The only region the Liberals still hold a lead is in Atlantic Canada.

It’s a far cry from Trudeaumania and proof that the PM and his party are in trouble over their handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

This is the fourth poll showing the Conservatives ahead since the story broke.

The scandal isn’t just hitting the Liberal Party’s numbers, it is hurting Trudeau’s reputation, as well. Asked if their opinion of the PM has worsened, improved or stayed the same in the past month, 59% of Canadians said worsened.

Justin Trudeau’s approval rating sits at just 40%.

Seems trash talking the woman who used to be your attorney general for almost three weeks while preventing her from speaking turns Canadians off.

Trudeau may need yet another communications strategy.

And as the PM stands up in the House of Commons day after day saying that he did nothing wrong and is only supporting “good jobs” at SNC-Lavalin, he is showing that he is offside with the view of most Canadians.

Asked if the company should be prosecuted on the bribery and corruption charges they are facing, 63% said they agreed with the statement that, “ SNC-Lavalin should be fully prosecuted under the Criminal Code.”

Even in the company’s home province of Quebec, voters are split with 49% saying prosecute even if it means a 10-year ban on federal contracts and 51% saying the company should be allowed a remediation agreement.

On Wednesday, Jody Wilson-Raybould will speak to the House of Commons justice committee. If you’ve read the headlines, then you have likely heard that Trudeau says he has waived privilege and the former attorney general is free to speak.

How much she says could alter Trudeau’s fortunes in the future.

If she is upfront and forthcoming with Canadians, then the next poll could show even worse numbers for the Trudeau government.

The government that seemed invincible just a few short weeks ago, now seems very vulnerable, all because they tried to bully a woman that wasn’t having it.",LILLEY: SNC affair is sinking the Good Ship Trudeau - Toronto Sun,Torontosun.com,https://torontosun.com/news/national/lilley-snc-affair-is-sinking-the-good-ship-trudeau
169,Empty,2019-03-01T19:43:55Z,"Whatever surprises the fall election holds, it’s Jagmeet Singh’s party now—for better or worse The post All the obstacles standing between Jagmeet Singh and a revived NDP appeared first on Macleans.ca.","The facts of the matter don’t wholly warrant the New Democratic Party’s outward appearances of jubilation now that their leader, Jagmeet Singh, is finally assuming his place in the House of Commons and, at last, the national spotlight. But it is what it is.

While Singh easily trounced his rivals in the Feb. 25 Burnaby South by-election, he did so by winning only 39 per cent of the ballots cast by the 30 per cent of voters who bothered to show up. More precisely, he’s off to Ottawa thanks to only 8,848 of the 76,204 people on the riding’s voter registry.

This is not what you’d call the most glorious beginning of the NDP’s long march to the federal polls in October. Nine out of 10 NDP riding associations across the country don’t even have a declared candidate yet. Of the 338 MPs in the House, only 41 are New Democrats and 13 of them have already announced they won’t be running again. More dropouts are expected. Meanwhile, the party’s finances are a shambles—the NDP pulled in $1.97 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, the poorest haul since 2011.

So it will be a while yet before we know what Singh’s version of the NDP will look like, and what it will be about exactly, beyond the broad policy strokes that tend to situate the party quite reliably between Justin Trudeau’s Liberals and Elizabeth May’s Greens.

Further than that, all that can be said is that it’s Singh’s party now. And Singh might just have what it takes to make life miserable for Trudeau’s battered Liberals, especially now, on account of a stunning stroke of luck in Singh’s favour. While Singh was campaigning in Burnaby South, the SNC-Lavalin story was making a wreckage of Trudeau’s assiduously cultivated brand: Canada’s magnificently progressive, feminist Prime Minister, the champion of Indigenous rights, the Davos hero on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. And from the outset, Singh was itching to challenge Trudeau’s brand by seeing him and raising him.

If Trudeau was young—he’s 47—Singh was younger—he’s 40. If Trudeau was progressive in the fashionable “woke” mode, Singh was the real article—a natty, bicycle-riding, full-bearded Sikh, a crusading lawyer, and now the first person from what Statistics Canada calls a visible minority to lead a federal political party. Trudeau has his stylish socks, but Singh has his colourful turbans. He’s edgier. And he’s a better dancer, especially when it comes to bhangra.

But is this really what the NDP is supposed to be about?

It wasn’t that long ago that the NDP had a much clearer sense of what it was there for, what it stood for, and who it spoke for. It was a socialist party, or at the very least a social-democratic party, and it was rooted in the working class and in the labour movement. It arose from the social-gospel churches of the Prairies. It extended its reach into the great social justice struggles of 20th century. But then came the 21st century and the debilitating incoherence that ran straight across the “left” following the al-Qaeda attacks of 9-11. Meanwhile, the old industrial working class withered in the maelstrom of globalization and free trade. And then came the rise of identity politics.

New Democrats thought they’d finally hit the right notes with Jack Layton, who won the job of Official Opposition leader for the first time in the party’s history. But the fluke at the root of his success was conveniently overlooked: it was the collapse of the Bloc Québécois. More than half of the NDP’s 103-member parliamentary caucus came from Quebec ridings that had never voted NDP.

By the 2015 election, after a decade of Stephen Harper, voters wanted a change, and they wanted it fast. Along came the dashing Trudeau, who swept into power after outflanking Thomas Mulcair’s budget-balancing NDP from the left.

Mulcair was ignominiously ousted at the NDP’s April 2016 national convention in Edmonton, owing mainly to getting caught in the middle of an identity crisis that pitted ultra-green Leap Manifesto enthusiasts in one corner against Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s pragmatists in the other. The party was rudderless and adrift until the federal NDP convention of October 2017, when Singh won the leadership race on the first ballot.

In the early innings, his performance wasn’t promising. The awkwardness began with a strangely evasive interview he gave to the CBC’s Terry Milewski. Singh couldn’t bring himself to denounce fringe extremists in certain Sikh temples who continue to lionize Talwinder Singh Parmar, the terrorist mastermind of the 1985 Air India bombing. Singh later insinuated that Milewski’s questioning was racist. It took him weeks to back down and properly distance himself from Parmar’s admirers.

Then there was the time Singh asserted that judges appointed to the Supreme Court needn’t be required to speak French so long as they can speak an Indigenous language, and was forced to reverse himself after learning the NDP’s policy on Supreme Court appointments.

More recently, Singh found himself publicly at odds with NDP foreign affairs critic Hélène Laverdière and caucus chair Matthew Dubé on whether Juan Guaidó should be recognized as Venezuela’s interim president. It was another case of not knowing, apparently, what his own party’s position was on a subject of immediate concern in Parliament.

Several MPs had made it clearly but quietly known that Singh had to get himself a Commons seat, and that if he failed, he’d be pressured to resign as leader. So it was welcome news when the Trudeau government finally got around to declaring a by-election date for Burnaby South. Singh finally had his chance to run for the House of Commons.

Burnaby South wasn’t going to be a slam dunk, but the NDP had the upper hand, and it expended a great effort to get Singh elected. Singh’s campaign was short on detail and issues (housing, the environment, health care) and long on principles and rhetoric. But it was also something of a rerun of his leadership campaign, with its emphasis on Singh’s background and identity—the struggles of his immigrant parents, the bullying he put up with as a child, and his own up-by-the-bootstraps story of growing up in Newfoundland, Scarborough and Windsor.

This is all fair enough, and it might make an impression in Quebec, where voters are burdened by a weird aversion to religious symbols like turbans. But there was nothing novel in Burnaby about Singh’s candidacy as a person of colour. In 1972, the voters of what was then a mostly white, working-class constituency—Burnaby–Edmonds—elected the NDP’s Rosemary Brown as their MLA. Brown was the first Black woman elected to a Canadian legislature. In 1975, Brown ran for the leadership of the NDP, coming in a close second behind Ed Broadbent.

In Burnaby South, it’s practically impossible to not be a member of a minority group. Census Canada reports that 38.7 of the riding’s residents identify as being of Chinese origin, 32.2 per cent say they’re of European extraction, and the final 29.1 per cent identify as South Asian, Filipino, Korean, Black, West Asian and so on. Neither will Singh be particularly remarkable in Parliament as a turbaned Sikh. In 2015, 20 Sikhs were elected to the House of Commons.

During the by-election campaign, “race” erupted in nasty ways, twice, but neither occasion turned to Singh’s disadvantage.

Liberal candidate Karen Wang caused an uproar when it was revealed that she’d posted on the Chinese social media network WeChat that she was the candidate to back because she was Chinese and therefore had a head start on Singh, who she identified as being “of Indian descent.” Liberal headquarters ended up replacing her with Richard T. Lee, a longtime B.C. MLA whose associations with former B.C. premier Christy Clark’s government probably didn’t do him any favours. Lee came in second, trailing Singh by nearly 3,000 votes.

The second incident occurred at an all-candidates meeting, when Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson of Maxime Bernier’s right-wing People’s Party raised the lighting-rod subject of the murder of Burnaby teenager Marrisa Shen. A Syrian refugee has been charged with her murder. Thompson used the case to raise alarms about proper refugee “vetting.” There was a lot of shouting.

Thompson’s entourage throughout the by-election campaign did not consist of the stereotypical white yobs who like to shout about refugees. They were mostly Chinese-Canadians.

Much of Thompson’s 2,242 vote tally may or may not have bled away from Conservative third-place finisher Jay Shin (5,147 votes), and Singh is fortunate that Green Leader Elizabeth May invoked a traditional “leader’s courtesy” and declined to run a candidate against him.

Singh’s profile likely gave him an edge in the race, but he isn’t even the first NDP leader to launch his federal career in a Burnaby by-election. That title goes to Tommy Douglas, the Saskatchewan premier and leader of the NDP’s pioneering predecessor, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, back in 1962. As leader of the NDP, Douglas won three elections in a row in the riding of Burnaby–Coquitlam.

Going back further, Burnaby was also once the home of the Army of the Common Good, a radical workers’ co-operative during the 1930s that ran its own stores, farms and logging operations. It even printed its own currency, known formally as labour units, but usually called “lulus.” At the time, one of the army’s closest allies was Burnaby’s mayor, the crusading socialist William Pritchard, one of seven men convicted for sedition in the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919.

Nobody saw it coming when the SNC-Lavalin volcano erupted underneath Trudeau’s Liberals, and a great many voters might decide to give Singh’s New Democrats a try when October comes around. Or Singh might just put his foot in something, leaving the Liberals safe from harm. Or the liberal-left vote might split sideways to the electoral advantage of Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives, leaving everybody to lament about vote-splitting.

Here is Scheer’s full statement.

Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this great nation now that Canadians know what he has done. That is why I am calling on Justin Trudeau to resign. Further, the RCMP must immediately open an investigation – if it has not already done so—into the numerous examples of obstruction of justice the former Attorney General detailed in her testimony.

The testimony Canadians have just heard from the former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a Prime Minister who has lost the moral authority to govern. A Prime Minister who allows his partisan political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A Prime Minister who doesn’t know where the Liberal Party ends and where the Government of Canada begins. And a Prime Minister who has allowed a systemic culture of corruption to take root in his office and those of his most senior cabinet and public service colleagues.

I listened carefully to the testimony of the former Attorney General, and like Canadians, I was sickened and appalled by her story of inappropriate, and frankly illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest officials of Justin Trudeau’s government. All to let a Liberal-connected corporation off the hook on corruption charges.

Before Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Canadians knew Justin Trudeau had engineered an unwanted, sustained, and co-ordinated attempt to get Ms. Wilson-Raybould to change her mind and stop the criminal trial of SNC-Lavalin. Today, thanks to Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, we now know just how intense those efforts were: ten meetings and ten phone calls involving eleven senior government officials relentlessly targeting Ms. Wilson-Raybould over a four month period—with the sole objective of bullying her into bending the law to benefit a well-connected corporation.

The details are as shocking as they are corrupt: multiple veiled threats to her job if she didn’t bow to their demands. Urgings to consider the consequences on election results and shareholder value above judicial due process. And reminders from Justin Trudeau to his Attorney General about his own electoral prospects should she allow SNC-Lavalin’s trial to proceed.

As Ms. Wilson-Raybould has so clearly articulated, the people Canadians entrusted to protect the integrity of our very nation were instead only protecting themselves and their friends.

Mr. Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation.

Well before he became an MLA, and later the leader of the B.C. Green party, Weaver used words to describe the controversial project that became a template for Liberal and NDP premiers to come:

Hydro power is “clean.” It is “zero-emitting” power. It “does not produce greenhouse gas emissions.” Therefore, it is good.

Weaver’s assertions were as demonstrably false then as they are now.

All energy has environmental costs. Hydroelectric power may be clean in the extremely narrow sense that the energy carried in transmission lines does not emit greenhouse gases. But it is dirty in countless ways. Consider just three: flooded farmlands and uprooted farming families, destroyed Indigenous hunting and gathering sites, and mercury-contaminated fish in reservoirs that are themselves sources of greenhouse gasses.

Weaver later became sharply critical of Site C. But unfortunately, his earlier arguments in favour of the project were co-opted by the government to justify providing more allegedly green energy to an expanding natural-gas industry that includes a major liquefied natural gas plant on B.C.’s north coast and a new 670-kilometre pipeline linking the plant to the Peace region where companies drill and frack for natural gas.

This was readily apparent in December when Premier John Horgan and Environment Minister George Heyman officially released the provincial government’s latest climate action plan known as Clean B.C. at a packed event at Vancouver’s main library, which Weaver attended.

The word “electricity” is mentioned no fewer than 47 times in the document, including on first reference where Michelle Mungall, minister of energy, mines and petroleum resources, states that the government will use B.C.’s “abundant carbon-free electricity to power our province’s future.”

What Mungall didn’t say was that powering our future will be more and more about powering the natural-gas industry and LNG, something Weaver also strongly opposes.

The Clean B.C. document notes that in the Peace, “demand for electricity is growing faster than in any other part of British Columbia.” This has spurred the building of one new major transmission line known as the Dawson Creek/Chetwynd Area Transmission Project, or DCAT. That line now powers a number of gas processing plants, including the Sunrise gas plant near Dawson Creek, one of the largest such plants built in western North America in 30 years.

DCAT was built with the natural gas industry exclusively in mind. Now, a second line is slated for the same region. Known as the Peace Region Electricity Supply line (PRES), it too will supply the gas industry.

According to Clean B.C., these lines will allow natural gas companies to power their plants with “clean electricity” rather than following standard industry practice, using natural gas-powered equipment instead. By replacing gas with electricity, the government claims that “millions of tonnes of new greenhouse gas emissions” will be avoided.

The document does not say so, but the source for all of the hydroelectricity is the W.A.C Bennett dam, the first dam on the Peace River and the massive edifice that impounds Williston Lake, one of the world’s largest hydroelectric reservoirs. Also generating power and just downstream is the Peace Canyon dam. If and when completed, power produced at the $10.7-billion-and-counting Site C dam would also be part of that supply chain, thus linking destruction of some of B.C.’s richest farmlands to accelerating natural-gas production.

The document also does not include the cost to build those new transmission lines, who will pay their capital costs, or how building them helps our planet, especially when virtually all of the power carried in those lines goes to the fossil fuel industry.

DCAT’s capital cost was $300 million. PRES’s estimated cost is $285 million. There will almost certainly be cost overruns. The roughly $600 million to build those two lines gets added to a growing roster of new capital projects and upgrades.

And here’s the rub: Those costs are borne by all B.C. Hydro customers, not just the companies that the lines are largely built for. Worse, paying those bills will benefit our overheating planet not one iota.

The gas and valuable gas liquids like condensate that are “saved” by electrifying natural gas plants don’t remain in the ground. They flow to the surface along with all the other hydrocarbons that are drilled and fracked from the earth.

The government wants us to believe that using hydro power to electrify LNG production somehow reduces emissions. But all that electrification actually achieves is to save gas from being combusted in BC so that it can be piped out of the province and burned somewhere else.

All this plays out in a context where global emissions from natural gas and oil combustion continue going up, moving earth’s climate toward a dangerous and potentially irreversible tipping point.

B.C.’s 2019 budget adds further insight into the costs to be borne by B.C. taxpayers as the gas industry is electrified. Among a long list of capital projects with price tags exceeding $50 million is a new “interconnection project” involving B.C. Hydro and LNG Canada, the major LNG consortium led by Shell that proposes to build its LNG processing facility in Kitimat.

B.C. Hydro says the $82-million project involves upgrades to a substation in the Kitimat area and a new double circuit transmission line. The project is yet another reminder that when it comes to a clean, green future for our province, electrifying the gas industry is top of mind.

Clean B.C. is conspicuously silent on these costs. It also fails to mention that electrification will play out against the backdrop of vastly expanded natural gas drilling, fracking and gas production in the event that the LNG Canada plant ever materializes.

The plan is also curiously silent on Site C, the most expensive publicly funded infrastructure project in B.C.’s history. In fact, the government fails to mention the dam even once in the report’s 68 pages.

It appears increasingly that such omissions are a deliberate attempt to avoid discussing emissions. Because if sharply reducing greenhouse gas emissions is truly the goal, it is climatic lunacy to build an obscenely expensive and unnecessary dam and transmission lines to power up the very industry that needs to be powered down.

Weaver knows that better than most. Clean B.C.’s architects clearly see things differently.

Many New Democrats believe it’s a do-or-die contest – that Singh cannot lead his party in this fall’s general election if he can’t get himself a seat in Parliament.

Singh is hoping a victory tonight will give him much-needed visibility in the Commons in the run-up to the national vote in October, and put to rest grumbling within the NDP about his underwhelming performance since being chosen leader almost 18 months ago.

But Singh’s problems go well beyond his lack of visibility on the main stage of federal politics. The former Ontario provincial politician has faced criticism about his seeming unfamiliarity with federal issues and his handling of internal caucus matters – particularly his decision to kick Saskatchewan MP Erin Weir out of caucus for alleged misconduct, which has infuriated many NDP stalwarts in the province seen as the cradle of the party.

Under his leadership, the NDP has plunged to its lowest standings in public opinion polls since 2000, when it won just 13 seats. The party is mired in debt and its fundraising is sluggish. At least 11 of the 44 MPs who won seats for the party in 2015 have announced they won’t seek re-election this fall.

While many NDP eyes will be glued to Burnaby South tonight, an arguably better gauge of the party’s election-year viability will be going on in Outremont – the Montreal riding vacated last summer by Singh’s predecessor, Tom Mulcair.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 byelection. His victory turned Outremont into a beachhead for the NDP, which helped to launch the so-called orange wave that swept the province in 2011 and boosted the party to official Opposition status for the first time in its history. While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

The betting among political insiders is that the Liberals will retake Outremont, which would be a welcome boost for the governing party’s morale in the midst of the SNC-Lavalin controversy – and a particularly bitter loss for the NDP. The symbolism of losing their erstwhile beachhead would only reinforce polls suggesting New Democrats are in danger of being wiped out altogether in Quebec this fall.

But the blow would be softened, at least, if Singh is able to capture Burnaby South.

It’s no sure thing. The B.C. riding is not a natural home for Singh, who formerly represented Brampton in the Ontario legislature. Nor is it a safe NDP riding: New Democrat Kennedy Stewart, who resigned to become mayor of Vancouver, took the riding in 2015 with just over 600 votes more than his Liberal opponent, with the Conservative candidate not far behind.

While the byelection is thought to be a three-way race, being a party leader should give Singh an edge. The fact that the Green party has chosen not to run a candidate should also help.

Moreover, the Liberals did themselves no favours by dumping their original candidate amid controversy over her suggestion that Singh being of “Indian descent” could help her win. The current Liberal contender, Richard T. Lee, could face headwinds of a different kind, created by the ongoing furor over allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould – who represents a nearby Vancouver riding – to halt a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

WATCH: Unpacking the politics of the SNC-Lavalin affair

The third byelection is being held in the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe, left vacant by the retirement of Peter Van Loan, who had held the seat for the Conservatives since 2004. He won with a healthy 50 per cent of the votes in 2015, and the Tories are expected to easily hang on tonight.

All three contests will give the Conservatives a glimpse of what, if any damage, they might sustain from the advent of the breakaway People’s Party of Canada, formed by one-time Tory leadership contender Maxime Bernier.

""This is obviously not a situation or a decision to be taken lightly and we will continue to reflect and work on this issue,"" Trudeau said during a funding announcement in Charlottetown.

Wilson-Raybould confirmed on the weekend that she intends to run under the Liberal banner in the fall election.

""I have been confirmed as the LPC [Liberal Party of Canada] candidate for Vancouver Granville for the federal election 2019,"" Wilson-Raybould told CBC News in an email.

She would not comment further and said she isn't conducting interviews right now.

Last week, Wilson-Raybould told the Commons justice committee she faced intense political pressure and veiled threats from top Liberal officials who wanted her to allow SNC-Lavalin to avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges. SNC-Lavalin was facing corruption charges over contracts in Libya and was lobbying for a remediation agreement as an alternative to criminal prosecution.

Gerry Butts, the prime minister's close personal friend and former principal secretary, has been confirmed to appear as a witness Wednesday before the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair. He is scheduled to address the committee for two hours beginning at 10 a.m. ET.

Butts resigned from the PMO on Feb. 18 amid allegations he and others exerted political interference on Wilson-Raybould to override the Public Prosecution Service director's decision to prosecute SNC-Lavalin.

""At all times, I and those around me acted with integrity and a singular focus on the best interests of all Canadians,"" Butts said in a statement at the time.

In her testimony before committee, Wilson-Raybould gave her description of a meeting with Butts on Dec. 5, 2018. She said she wanted to speak to him about several things, including the barrage of people ""hounding"" her and her staff about the impact of prosecuting SNC-Lavalin.

""Towards the end of the meeting I raised how I needed everyone to stop talking to me about SNC as I had made up my mind and the engagements were inappropriate,"" she testified. ""Gerry then took over the conversation and said how we need a solution on the SNC stuff — he said I needed to find a solution.""

Wilson-Raybould said she was pressed by 11 PMO and other government officials, who continued to remind her of the economic and political consequences after she had decided to proceed with the prosecution.

The scandal has opened a debate over whether the position of attorney general should be kept separate from that of the justice minister, and whether the AG should be independent of cabinet.

Asked about that idea today, Trudeau said significant changes like that would require reflection and analysis.

""It's not something to do on a whim or as a minor thing. It's something to take very carefully and responsibly,"" he said.",Trudeau says no decision yet on whether Wilson-Raybould can stay in Liberal caucus,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-wilson-raybould-liberal-caucus-1.5041947

While Americans were transfixed on Wednesday with the salacious, but not legally damning, testimony of Michael Cohen before Congress, a bombshell went off in the Canadian Parliament. Former Canadian Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould testified before the House Justice Committee alleging that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and others in his administration pressured her in “inappropriate” ways to reach a settlement with an engineering company that has been charged with crimes.

The company, SNC-Lavalin, is facing charges that it sent bribes to Libya, then under the rule of Gadhafi, in defiance of Canadian law. If found guilty, the Quebec-based company will face severe sanctions, including a ban on working with the Canadian government. This would be a severe economic blow, especially in Trudeau’s home province of Quebec.

According to Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, she faced “consistent and sustained,” efforts by the Trudeau administration, as well as “veiled threats,” in an attempt to influence her decision regarding Lavalin. Under Canadian law, this type of attempt at political influence is at best inappropriate, and at worst illegal.

Unlike the slow moving investigation into Trump, the Trudeau scandal has unfurled remarkably quickly. On February 7, the Globe and Mail ran a story citing anonymous sources that suggested inappropriate political meddling had occurred. In her testimony yesterday, Wilson-Raybould discussed meetings with Trudeau and others from late last year. Trudeau says he disagrees with her assessment that the meetings were not appropriate.

In January, Wilson-Raybould was relieved of her duties as attorney general and given a lesser cabinet position. Then this month, she suddenly stepped down from the cabinet entirely. Also stepping down was Gerald Butts, a long time Trudeau political adviser heavily involved with Lavalin situation.

Yesterday’s testimony from one of his former cabinet ministers and a member of his own party has flung the Trudeau administration into a full-fledged crisis. With a general election looming in October, Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer said that Trudeau has “lost the moral authority to lead,” and should resign.

The crux of the case––and perhaps the key to Trudeau’s future––is whether the discussions with Wilson-Raybould were simply a good faith effort to make her aware of the economic and political implications of the Lavalin case, or a more nefarious effort to put a thumb on the scale of justice.

For her part, the former attorney general said that the pressure was maintained even after she had made clear that she had made a decision not to cut a deal with Lavalin. In addition, some observers view her demotion in January as a punishment for having defied the administration’s wishes.

With an election this year, members of the Liberal Party will have to decide if Trudeau can weather these harsh allegations and successfully lead them to victory. For now, Trudeau insists he did nothing wrong and that he will be exonerated by the ethics committee. But even in the best-case scenario for him, in which his administration’s pressure on the justice ministry was legal and ethical, it still represents a broad overreach into what is supposed to be an independent agency.

Justin Trudeau is often viewed in both Canada and The United States as a kind of anti-Trump. Young, nice looking, liberal, the son of a former prime minister, and sufficiently woke in all the right ways, he has a hero status for some. It is remarkable that all of a sudden it is Trudeau, not Trump, who may be taken down by corruption.

It’s a good reminder that Donald Trump didn’t invent corruption or the breaking of political norms––such things predate him by a few centuries. That a “nice guy,” like Trudeau engaged in corruption will surprise many, but perhaps it shouldn’t. Abuse of government power has never been limited to the crude.

It will be an astounding irony if just as the Mueller probe returns a report with no smoking gun, Trump’s adversary in Canada is engulfed in a damaging scandal. It will be another example of something that “wasn’t supposed to go that way.” But here we are. Over two years after investigations into Trump began there has still been no finding of wrongdoing by him. Just three weeks into the Lavalin scandal, Trudeau has been badly damaged.

Whether Trudeau’s leadership survives this scandal or not, it is yet another reminder that things are not always what they seem.

As of Monday, two members of Trudeau’s Cabinet have resigned, as has his top political adviser. The ethics commissioner for Canada’s Parliament has opened an investigation, and several opposition party members have called for the police or an independent inquiry to take on the case.

At the center of Trudeau’s political woes is SNC-Lavalin, a multinational engineering and construction firm based in Quebec.

The company has been trailed for years by allegations of corruption, including in Bangladesh, India, Canada and Mexico, where the authorities once accused a consultant to SNC-Lavalin of involvement in a plot to smuggle Saadi Gadhafi, a son of the former Libyan dictator, out of his home country.

The case that has ensnared Trudeau started in February 2015, when the Canadian authorities charged SNC-Lavalin with paying 47.7 million Canadian dollars ($35.8 million) in bribes to officials in Libya to win contracts there, and of defrauding the Libyan government of 129.8 million Canadian dollars.

Should SNC-Lavalin be convicted, it could be barred from federal government contracts for a decade, potentially crippling its business and eliminating many Canadian jobs. The company has successfully lobbied for changes to criminal law that would allow it to pay a large fine, as companies can do in “remediation agreements” in Britain and the United States.

The Minister

Trudeau’s first justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, inherited oversight of the case after his inauguration in November 2015.

Her appointment to the post was hailed by many Canadians as a sign of Trudeau’s commitment to indigenous and women’s rights. Wilson-Raybould is a former indigenous leader, and the appointment made her a member of Canada’s first gender-balanced Cabinet.

At some point, the relationship soured. In January 2019, Trudeau reassigned Wilson-Raybould from the Justice Department to Veterans Affairs, a post that she abruptly quit a few weeks later.

In testimony to a parliamentary committee last month, Wilson-Raybould said that while she was justice minister, Trudeau and his aides used “political interference” and “veiled threats” to pressure her to settle the case against SNC-Lavalin.

She described 10 meetings, 10 conversations and a series of emails about the criminal case with senior government officials, calling the pressure “inappropriate” but saying that it was not illegal. In a conversation with Trudeau, she recalled him saying, “there would be many jobs lost and that SNC will move from Montreal,” and asking her to “find a solution here for SNC.”

Despite the pressure she described, prosecutors have continued to pursue the company in court.

The Fallout

Trudeau has denied any wrongdoing, and told reporters, “Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy, and that’s exactly what we have done.”

He added that officials had acted “in a way that has respected our laws.”

But he has struggled to contain the political crisis. Following Wilson-Raybould, another member of Trudeau’s Cabinet, resigned, citing her “serious concerns” about the accusations of improper pressure.

“There can be a cost to acting on one’s principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them,” the minister, Jane Philpott, said in her resignation letter.

And Trudeau’s top political adviser resigned in February, denying any wrongdoing but saying that it was “in the best interests of the office and its important work for me to step away.”

The justice committee in Canada’s House of Commons conducted a hearing with Wilson-Raybould, and will question other people involved. But Trudeau’s Liberal Party controls the panel, making it unlikely to do the prime minister much harm.

Canada’s parliamentary ethics commissioner has opened an investigation, though by law he can look only for possible conflicts of interest.

The leader of the opposition Conservative Party has called for an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, whose policy prevents it from saying whether the force has begun an investigation. Several opposition parties have called for an independent special commission, which could create damaging hearings for the Liberals during the election season.

The political potential of all this has not been lost on Trudeau’s opponents. They have seized on the case to portray the prime minister — a self-described feminist, supporter of indigenous people and advocate of transparent government — as a leader who sent his aides to bully an indigenous woman in order to help a corporation dodge a criminal conviction in a corruption case.

Canada’s federal election is not until October, however, and analysts said the result will depend in large part on what happens next: whether Trudeau can defuse the scandal and the inquiries around it; how successfully his opponents can tar his reputation; and what happens with the SNC-Lavalin case.",How did Canada’s Justin Trudeau go from ‘sunny ways’ to political scandal?,Bostonglobe.com,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/world/2019/03/05/how-did-canada-justin-trudeau-from-sunny-ways-political-scandal/63vhMrMX6ko38WLwQNA7sL/story.html

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould prompted the leader of Canada’s main opposition party to insist that Trudeau quit just months ahead of an October federal election.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that she had confronted Trudeau over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. “I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau told a televised news conference in Montreal.

Preliminary results showed Jagmeet Singh won a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia.

Singh captured just under 40 percent of the vote.

A practicing Sikh, Singh made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau’s chances become.

“This staves off all the talk that Singh would have to quit ... at least for the moment he is vindicated,” said Richard Johnston, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia.

Johnston said in a phone interview that Singh would still need to overcome unhappiness with his leadership.

Singh, 40, a former legislator in the province of Ontario, had no experience in federal politics when he took over from former leader Thomas Mulcair.

He has clashed openly with senior members of parliament on a number of issues. A quarter of the 44 NDP legislators who won seats in the 2015 election have either already quit or announced they are not running again in October.

And in a further sign of challenges ahead, in another special election on Monday, the NDP lost the Montreal seat Mulcair had held to the Liberals.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News last week put the Liberals at 34 percent public support and the right-leaning official opposition Conservatives at 35 percent. The NDP was far behind at 17 percent.

Both Craft and her husband are major supporters of President Donald Trump.

The pick gives the former Republican commentator Max Boot major concerns that the Trump administration will once again become a laughingstock on the world stage.

Writing in the Washington Post, Boot points out that historically that position was filled by the major statesmen of their time — major historical figures including Henry Cabot Lodge and Adlai Stevenson. He notes that the President’s first pick, Nikki Haley, was a continuation of that legacy. “She was a former governor who has been talked about as a possible presidential contender, and she acquitted herself admirably at the United Nations,” Boot writes.

Her initial replacement, Heather Nauert, did not have an equally relevant resume. Nauert had previously worked at Fox News.

Craft is even more problematic, argues Boot.

“Kelly Knight Craft was chosen to be U.S. ambassador to Canada, and now to the United Nations, because she and her third husband, the billionaire coal baron Joe Craft, are mega MAGA-donors,” he writes.

“According to The Post, they gave ‘about $1.5 million to GOP candidates in 2016, including $270,800 to Trump’s campaign committee or his joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee.'”

He observes that Craft appears to be politically connected to the Trumps and the Republican leadership. She previously served as ambassador to Canada.

“Perhaps just as important from this president’s perspective, they are also ‘repeat, high-paying customers at Trump’s hotel in Washington.’ Craft’s other recommendation is that, as a Kentucky native, she is a supporter of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and is said to be friends with McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.”

“If confirmed, Craft will arrive at the United Nations as a laughingstock — just like her boss,” writes Boot, who left the Republican Party due to their embrace of President Donald Trump.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The leader of Canada's main opposition party demanded on Wednesday that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau quit after a former justice minister said government officials inappropriately pressured her to help a major firm avoid a bribery trial.

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould dramatically deepened the biggest crisis of Trudeau's tenure just months ahead of an October election in which his Liberals face a tough fight.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that she had confronted Trudeau over what she called inappropriate pressure to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade a corruption trial.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, demanded the resignation of what he called a disgraced prime minister.

""He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,"" Scheer told reporters, calling for police to immediately probe the matter. Trudeau is due to address reporters later on Wednesday.

After 16 months without a seat in the Commons — and dire warnings from within his own party that he'd either win the seat or find himself looking for another job — the NDP leader defied his critics and the pundits by capturing Burnaby South.

""To Burnaby South, thank you for trusting me to be your member of Parliament,"" a jubilant Singh told the crowd at his election headquarters.

Singh led throughout the night over his main rivals, Conservative candidate Jay Shin and the Liberals' Richard Lee.

Some will still suggest that Lee, a long-time provincial politician, had too much ground to make up after the Liberals original choice was forced to resign mid-campaign after making remarks in Mandarin about Singh's ethnicity that were considered offensive.

Some Liberals even suggested, privately, that a Singh victory wouldn't be such a bad thing for them given his uneven performance as leader, and their hopes of repeating their success poaching NDP supporters in 2015.

Whatever the reason, Singh is now poised to take a seat in the House of Commons — poised, finally, to begin shifting the discussion away from his embattled leadership to the issues the party intends to champion in the few months remaining before the fall general election: affordable housing, pharmacare and real action to combat climate change.

'National stage'

""With this win, people will get to see a progressive alternative to Justin Trudeau,"" said James Smith, Singh's campaign spokesperson. ""Conservatives won't push for more affordable housing, or for universal pharmacare. Jagmeet gets a chance now to stand up for those values on the national stage.""

That's the good news for the NDP. Good news for the party these days, however, always seems to come mixed with the bad.

In this case, New Democrats have to balance Singh's personal win against the loss of Outremont, the closest thing the party had to a fortress in Quebec. The Liberals resoundingly reclaimed the Montreal riding held by Singh's predecessor, Tom Mulcair, for the past decade.

Mulcair's 2007 byelection win gave the New Democrats a beachhead in Quebec. It was only the second time a New Democrat had ever won a seat in the province.

Four years later, Outremont became the epicentre of the so-called Orange Wave that swept across Quebec, giving the NDP nearly 60 seats there and vaulting it into the official opposition in Ottawa for the only time in its history.

Still, Monday's result in Outremont was not unexpected. For the Liberals, winning in Burnaby South would have been significant — more of an indication of momentum, especially in the wake of two weeks of negative media coverage from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Watch as Singh addresses supporters after his byelection win:

Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has claimed victory in the Burnaby South byelection, finally allowing him to lead his party from within the House of Commons. 7:03

In Quebec, opinion polls have unblinkingly recorded the decline in NDP support ever since Singh became leader. As it stands, the party might have trouble holding a single one of its 16 — make that 15 — seats in the province after Monday night.

Battle for momentum

Liberals insist the win in Outremont is a good omen for them, a clear indication that they are on track to increase their seats in a province that may well be decisive to their chances of winning a second term.

Outremont is also the third byelection in which the Trudeau Liberals have taken an opposition seat, joining Lac Saint Jean, Que., and South Surrey-White Rock, B.C. Both had been held by Conservatives.

Conservative Scot Davidson will be the next MP for the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe. (CBC)

The Conservatives, as expected, won handily in the Ontario riding of York—Simcoe. And they did so despite the presence of candidates from Maxime Bernier's maverick People's Party of Canada.

The PPC did surprisingly well in Burnaby South. The party's candidate took about 11 per cent of the vote there, most of it from the Conservatives. In the other two races, Bernier's candidates barely registered.

What does that mean? Possibly very little. But Conservatives will have to consider the potential impact of vote-splitting with the People's Party this fall in swing ridings, where even a small amount of vote bleeding just might mean the difference between them and the Liberals.

But the big story of the night remains Burnaby South.

Watch as Singh calls for change after his byelection win:

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says Canada can make different choices and get better results 1:59

The prevailing wisdom was that Singh would have a tough time winning the riding for any number of reasons.

Start with the results in 2015, when the NDP won Burnaby South by fewer than 600 votes. Add in the fact that Singh's political home, until recently, was halfway across the country in Ontario. His political experience was based on his time in provincial politics there.

The polls have been similarly unkind since he became leader in October 2017. NDP fortunes took a tumble with each Singh stumble, whether it was not knowing the party's position on a gun control bill or his decision to boot MP Erin Weir from caucus after complaints that he made women feel uncomfortable.

The party's fundraising has also been weak, with the NDP lagging far behind the other two major parties. And just to finish the pile-on, let's observe that fully a quarter of the current NDP caucus isn't running again.

That made Burnaby South an interesting choice for a rookie leader who had what appeared to be everything to lose in this race.

But it proved to be a good laboratory for testing the tolerance of progressive voters in one of this country's most diverse ridings. Half of the people who live there were born outside Canada.

It's also exactly the kind of riding Justin Trudeau has cultivated, said Shachi Kurl, executive director of the polling firm Angus Reid Institute, with tax hikes on the rich, the tax-free child care benefit and promises of new money for infrastructure.

""This is middle-class ground zero, middle-class central,"" said Kurl. ""This will be a good assessment of whether people think Justin Trudeau's delivering or not.""

Three byelections. Three winners from three different parties. For the candidates, an exciting conclusion to three exhausting campaigns. And the winners, at least, will get to do it all over again in just a few months' time.

If you missed that, the very brief version is that Trudeau’s former Attorney General, Jody Wilson-Raybould, has accused him of leading a campaign to prevent the prosecution of an engineering company in Montreal called SNC-Lavalin. This campaign included 10 phone calls and 10 personal meetings urging the AG to intervene in the case. Many of those contacts, including the one with the PM himself, mentioned that it would be bad news for the party if SNC-Lavalin were to be prosecuted just before an election. In short, this was a campaign of judicial interference for explicitly political reasons.

Yesterday, another cabinet minister in Trudeau’s administration announced she was resigning:

The unexpected resignation, by Jane Philpott, who led the treasury board, inflames a growing political crisis that has already cost Trudeau his former justice minister and his top aide. “I’ve been considering the events that have shaken the government in recent weeks and after serious reflection, I have concluded that I must resign as a member of Cabinet,” said Philpott, who was also a former health minister and minister of indigenous affairs… In announcing her decision, Philpott cited accusations that Trudeau and his aides had exerted improper and excessive pressure on the justice minister and attorney general at the time, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to seek a settlement in the criminal case against the company, SNC-Lavalin… “There can be a cost to acting on one’s principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them,” Philpott wrote in her resignation letter to Trudeau on Monday.

The first cabinet minister to resign was Jody Wilson-Raybould. She was actually demoted from Attorney General (after refusing to give in to the pressure campaign) to Veterans Affairs minister. A short time after this staffing change, she resigned. Trudeau’s top adviser Gerald Butts also resigned. He was one of the people heavily involved in lobbying Wilson-Raybould.

Andrew Scheer, the leader of the Conservative Party has called on Trudeau to resign but so far Trudeau’s own party is supporting him. But the resignation of Philpott, which is said to have come as a complete surprise to the PM, seems to have made an impact. Today the CBC reports that the Prime Minister is now considering making a display of contrition over the scandal:

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is holding high-level discussions today to plot next steps in the ongoing SNC Lavalin controversy — steps which may include Trudeau making some display of contrition over how officials in his office conducted themselves. A senior government official said one of the options being discussed is for Trudeau to “show some ownership over the actions of his staff and officials” in their dealings with his former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould… Trudeau abruptly cancelled a trip to Regina to spend Tuesday afternoon with his top advisers — including chief of staff Katie Telford, executive director of communications and planning Kate Purchase, executive director of issues management Brian Clow and Canada’s Ambassador the United States David MacNaughton. All of this was prompted by Philpott’s sudden resignation, which the source said “change(d) things once again — maybe in its biggest way so far.”

The next elections are in 7 months so Trudeau is going to have to get started on his show of contrition. A poll released yesterday (mostly carried about before the latest resignation) found that if an election were held now Trudeau would only receive 31% support. Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer would receive 40 percent support.","Another cabinet minister resigns, Justin Trudeau considers making a display of contrition",Hotair.com,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/03/05/another-cabinet-minister-resigns-justin-trudeau-considers-making-display-contrition/

When Donald Trump won the 2016 U.S. election after threatening to upend the global trading system, it looked like China had a rare chance to win friends and garner influence.

More than two years on, things aren’t working out so well for the budding superpower, Peter Martin reports. Opinion polls show China has failed to capitalize on Trump’s international unpopularity — and its diplomats seem to be making things worse, particularly in the past few months.

China’s envoy to Canada publicly accused his hosts of “white supremacy,” its ambassador in Sweden blasted the country’s “so-called freedom of expression,” and its chief emissary in South Africa said Trump’s policies were making the U.S. “the enemy of the whole world.” Foreign diplomats say their Chinese counterparts have become more aggressive and ideological in private meetings.

The shift in tone appears to stem from the changing political climate in Beijing: Proving loyalty to President Xi Jinping has become a top imperative, and officials worry that publicly expressing dovish views could hurt their careers.

With more countries growing skeptical of Chinese investment and its tech behemoths such as Huawei, it’s becoming more important for China’s diplomats to smooth the way. The question now is whether they can deliver.

Global Headlines

Socialism scare | It’s been a conservative attack line for generations, and now Trump and fellow Republicans have begun painting proposals embraced by many 2020 Democratic hopefuls as socialist. While Trump’s happy to embrace communist leaders from China, North Korea and Vietnam, his dire warnings that the U.S. risks Venezuela-style chaos if Democrats have their way are being amplified by Republican lawmakers in the fight for congressional seats and the White House.

Click here for four reasons why House Democrats are likely to avoid a high-stakes attempt to impeach Trump and instead look for ways to wound him politically heading into the 2020 election.

Brexit brinkmanship | Against the odds, Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal is clinging to life before next week’s crunch vote in Parliament. To reach this point, she’s survived votes of no confidence and endured the worst parliamentary defeat in more than 100 years. Tim Ross, Kitty Donaldson and Alex Morales document the meticulousness and perseverance, as well as the chaos and missteps, that have put the U.K. within reach of leaving the European Union.

Where's the proof? | A week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government sent Indian fighter jets to bomb a training camp of the terrorist group Jaish e-Mohammed in neighboring Pakistan, his ruling party is increasingly defensive about what they actually hit. As Iain Marlow reports, Modi’s administration isn't letting doubts get in the way of exploiting the military assault ahead of next month’s general election.

Khashoggi’s shadow | Trump’s nominee to serve as ambassador to Saudi Arabia said the U.S. must engage and partner with the kingdom to counter threats from Sunni-Muslim extremism and Iran despite the killing of columnist Jamal Khashoggi and frustration over the war in Yemen. Retired Army General John Abizaid’s comments may complicate his confirmation and anger lawmakers who’ve criticized the administration’s response to Khashoggi’s death.

Defense dispute | President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rebuffed a U.S. threat to punish NATO ally Turkey if it buys a Russian missile-defense system. Erdogan, who’s greatly expanded his military’s global footprint, called the agreement a “done deal” in a TV24 interview. The U.S. warned this week that it could retaliate by blocking Turkey’s planned purchase of the next-generation F-35 fighters, fearing the Russian system could be used to collect intelligence on the jet’s stealth capabilities.

In celebration of the GT-R’s 50th anniversary, we’ve ticked off the early edition GT-Rs, the revolutionary R32 GT-R, and the underrated R33 GT-R so far – go back and catch up first if you’ve not read them already.

Considering the lukewarm reaction that the R33 GT-R got upon launch (and arguably still today), the R34’s GT-R reception couldn’t have been more different when it was unveiled in 1999. The more square-looking front and rear ends, aggressive scowl and tall front bumper gave it a road presence unlike any GT-R previous. But aside from the cosmetics, there’s far less difference mechanically between the R33 and R34 than there is between the R32 and R33.

Rumour has it that the R34 GT-R was scaled back from ambitious plans due to Nissan’s uncertain financial situation at the time – apparently, a V6 featured in the original blueprints which wouldn’t resurface until much later in the R34’s successor. What the R34 did receive was an aerodynamics overhaul which greatly reduced front lift and increased downforce. Suspension tweaks, improved braking efficiency, an improved all-wheel drive and HICAS system, clever electronics, chassis stiffening and bracing was added, but more focus was put on saving weight whilst doing so too, meaning kerb weight is only just up on the R33.

Of course, Nissan still had its ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ with other Japanese manufacturers, so if you were to believe the book, it had less horsepower than a modern hot hatch at just 276hp. Nissan is famously conservative with power figures, so this was likely to be closer to 320-300hp in reality.

Background check complete. Here, in no special order, are my favourite five examples that we’ve showcased over the years…

1. Party Like It’s 1999: The Blitz Autobahn Project

Built to take on the RUF Yellowbird, Blitz’s R34 GT-R topped out at 343km/h (213mph) on the German autobahn in 1999 when a power steering belt disintegrated spectacularly. The Skyline was brought to a safe halt, and later went on to complete several other high-speed runs before being retired.

Featuring actual functional overfenders and some perfect period correct features, Trevor caught up with this iconic R34 just last year before it left the US and returned to Japan.

2. A 1,000hp GT-R & The Long Road To WTAC

It’s safe to say that Matt Longhurst takes time attack pretty seriously, and his 1,000hp R34 GT-R is about as extreme a track animal as you’ll find.

Boasting a full built billet engine, 1,000hp on tap, and some of the most insane bodywork and aero I can remember seeing on an R34, you’d be forgiven for thinking this was a big-builder project or race team build. But it’s not, it’s the results of what happens when one guy follows his passion. Well worth a read.

3. Trust Future Proofs The R34 GT-R

The R34-GTR is a 20-year-old car now, so the fact that the big Japanese tuning houses are still building them as demo cars speaks volumes for its potential. On a related note – is the heyday of coveted JDM machines in the past now, or do you think the R35, new Supra, Toyota 86, Type R and 370Z are future icons in the same way that we seen the Japanese performance models of the 1990s?

This particular example has been built by Trust to stand up to modern standards. It doesn’t boast crazy horsepower, or anything too off-the-wall, but rather a healthy dose of off-the-shelf parts perfect for sprucing up your GT-R. It’s pretty much the perfect spec R34 in my eyes.

4. Endless Legacy: An R34 GT-R Abroad

There’s something special about coming across a suspiciously special car overseas and then discovering that it’s a former demo car from one of the big Japanese tuning giants in its new life. That’s exactly what happened when Paddy visited Gatebil back in 2015.

Of course, what he uncovered was a former Endless demo car ripping it up in Norway. It’s not the only JDM legend now living in cooler climes, either. Maybe Norway’s where the best cars go to retire?

5. The Canadian Garage Saurus R34 GT-R

Anyone up to speed on their GT-Rs should instantly recognise the name Garage Saurus, one of the most ambitious and successful GT-R tuning shops.

Dino stumbled across this curiously Canadian GT-R in Japan at R’s Meeting late last year and did some further digging. It turns out that the car had been built by Garage Saurus and then shipped back and forth between Canada and Japan for periodic upgrades, and was now in the country for an epic road and track trip. How’s that for cool?

That brings us to the end of the Skyline era in our GT-R countdowns, but if I’m allowed a cheeky sixth choice, then this is it right here.

Next up, and in the final instalment, we look at the first non-Skyline GT-R, the R35…

According to Webster Dictionary, socialism is “a system or condition of society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the state,” where as social welfare is “organized public or private social services for the assistance of disadvantaged groups.” Social welfare was in fact an antidote to socialism initiated by one of the most conservative politicians in world history, Otto von Bismarck, the first Chancellor of newly unified Germany.

When Germany was unified in 1871, Europe had already witnessed a steady increase of socialist-communist influence. “A spectre is haunting Europe – the spectre of communism,” Karl Marx declared in 1848 while revolutions were spreading all over the continent. In the 1870s, the Social Democratic Party rose quickly in Germany, and Bismarck called those socialists “this country’s rats” and “enemies bent on pillage and murder.” Bismarck tied the socialist party to the attempted assassination on William I and banned the party. At the same time, he led the legislative action to establish a social welfare system in order to reduce the appeal of radical socialism/ communism to the working class and to increase commoners’ loyalty to the German state. Three important legislations laid the foundation of German social welfare system: the Health Insurance of Workers Law of 1883, the Accident Insurance Law of 1884, and the Old Age and Invalidity Insurance Law of 1889. Thus, the German social welfare system, arguably the first of its kind in human history, was created as an antidote to undermine socialist/communist radicalism in politics.

The hatred of Bismarck and many other establishments against socialism/communism was based on the ideology’s doctrine of abolition of private ownership via class struggle and “proletarian dictatorship.” Given what happened in Soviet Union under Stalin, or China under Mao, when millions landlords and business owners were killed and their properties were confiscated, Bismarck’s harsh words against radicals bending on “pillage and murder” may not seem too off the mark. However, Bismarck or any other politician could not possibly foresee the split of socialist/communist parties during the First World War. Many radical leaders in the Second Communist International abandoned Karl Marx’s calling for proletarian international solidarity against their own “bourgeoise” national government, and they became “national socialists.” At the same time, Lenin split with those “national socialists,” and formed the Third Communist International (Comintern). He condemned his fellow socialists as “revisionists” who betrayed Marx’s famous saying: “working class has no fatherland.” He went on to wage revolution against the Russian “bourgeois” state and succeeded.

The split of socialist camp in Europe had profound social and political consequences, including bloodshed. A case in point was Mussolini in Italy, who betrayed his father’s socialist belief and enlisted himself to fight in the war. Later, his Strom Troopers were fighting on the streets against their former comrades, who seemed to be loyal to Moscow rather than to Rome. One of Mussolini’s admirers was Hitler, who later named his party as “national socialist party” (NAZI). The elite establishments in both Italy and Germany faced a tough choice between Marxist socialists determined to wage class struggle against private ownership and national socialists who wanted to make their nation “great again.” The nationalists seemed to be more popular and gained more seats in parliaments than their former comrades. The rest was history; Mussolini and Hitler gained power in their respective countries.

In the US, the influence of socialism was on the rise during the “Gilded Age” because of unregulated and fast capitalist development. But Eugene Debs’ Socialist Party did not succeed by any means, thanks to the “antidote” provided by progressive reformers, who were largely middle-class professionals. They tried to prevent social revolution of the European typeand they did not want to see the tragedies in St. Petersburg or of the Paris commune occur in the New World. Their strategy was to educate the public to push for legislations on behalf of public interest, especially thepoor and marginalized, and against the greedy instinct of the corporate world. Consequently, we have “Workmen’s Compensation Law” and federal regulatory agencies such as FDA in place to make unregulated capitalist market economy behave more rationally, and to prevent the cumulation of private “wealth against common wealth.”

Thanks in part to the effectiveness of the “antidote,” Socialism has never been influential in America. Therefore, the public is much less informed about the nature and history of socialism than the European counterpart. Some political hackers could take advantage of this knowledge gap to accuse someone they disliked, such as Obama, as a “socialist,” or to name the “Obama Care” as a “socialist legislation.” People who would buy what the political hackers would sell need to know the basic definition of socialism, which is an ideology advocating “public,” “collective,” or “common” ownership of productive means against private ownership. In practice, socialism became quite popular in Western European countries, such as UK or even Canada, where many “Crown Corporations” were owned and controlled by the government. The problem was that they were all losing money, and dependent on taxpayers’ support to stay alive. During the 1980s, the so-called Reagan-Thatcher decade of conservatism, these socialist enterprises were all but privatized. In the 1990s, Tony Blair led the Labor Party to get rid of the “common ownership” clause in its constitution, moving it from the left to the center. That allowed the Labor Party to win election after election.

At the same time, Bill Clinton moved Democratic Party to the center, and won the elections twice. In the era of Trump, some elected Democratic officials again seem to move decidedly toward the left, some openly call themselves “democratic socialists.” Given the history of socialism in this country and around world, is this really a winning strategy? If you are in favor of “Medicare for all,” you don’t have to call yourself a “democratic socialist” because Medicare is not exactly an enterprise of “productive means,” as is US Steel or Exxon-Mobile. This is especially true if you argue that health care is a human right for everyone. Of course, you should call yourself a socialist if you really believe in the abolition of private ownership and social control of productive means by the state/government. For the sake of history, please tell your voters what you really believe, and don’t just throw out a label without a precise definition.",Is Bernie Sanders Actually A Democratic Socialist?,Historynewsnetwork.org,https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/171380

Attempting to work around a lack of pipelines, the provincial government intends to spend $3.7 billion to lease 4,400 oil tank cars and locomotives to export more Canadian tar sands oil to the U.S. The announcement came just days after the latest oil train derailment and spill in Manitoba, Canada.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley addressed concerns about safety regarding the oil trains.

“We are treating the safety of these rail cars as though they are traveling through our own backyards,” Notley said. “The cars we will be using will be the safest cars on the tracks. They include the safest technology and meet the highest standards including all recent changes to safety standards.”

New regulations enacted after the 2013 oil train disaster killed 47 in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, require oil and rail companies to use newer rail cars to move oil. And while these new tank cars — known as DOT-117 and 117Rs — are more robust than the older tank cars involved in the deadly incident, they aren't immune to the forces of a train derailment.

In the past year, two Canadian oil trains consisting of these “safest” tank cars have derailed and resulted in large oil spills. In June 2018, a train from Canada derailed and spilled 230,000 gallons of oil into floodwaters in Iowa.

The most recent oil train crash, which occurred on a ranch in Manitoba on February 16, involved 37 derailed tank cars. No details have been released on the amount of oil spilled, but aerial photos show streams of dark black oil leaking from the damaged tank cars.

While Premier Notley claims that these new rail cars are the safest, that doesn't mean they will survive a derailment intact. Oil trains will continue to derail and cause large fires and spills.

Oil-By-Rail Becomes an Election Issue

Not everyone is welcoming Alberta’s plans to get into the oil-by-rail business, which will likely become an issue in the upcoming election. The announcement was criticized by Jason Kenney, leader of Alberta's Official Opposition United Conservative Party, who told the CBC that, “If elected, a United Conservative government will subject today's [oil-by-rail] proposal to that value-for-money review.”

While Notley claims that the Alberta government will make over $2 billion in revenue from the investment, Kenney is skeptical. He says the deal is something Canadian taxpayers “cannot afford” and called it “corporate welfare.”

The skepticism about the deal's finances comes after recent reports that Canada likely overpaid in purchasing the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project when Kinder Morgan couldn't find a buyer — another Canadian government effort to support the money-losing tar sands industry.

Dueling Policies Mean Economics Not Working for Oil-By-Rail

Oil-by-rail can cost as much as $15 more a barrel for Canadian producers to transport the oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast compared to pipelines. It only makes economic sense for oil producers to use rail when the discount for Western Canadian Select (WCS, Canadian) oil versus West Texas Intermediate (WTI, American) oil is more that $15.

In late 2018, that discount was as high as $50 per barrel, which led Canadian producers to export a record 354,000 barrels of oil per day by rail in December. However, the steep discounts for WCS oil meant the Alberta tar sands industry was losing money on all of the oil it sold.

This situation led to Premier Notley announcing mandatory oil production cuts in early December, which very effectively decreased the discount for WCS oil. However, with the discount below $15, many producers are choosing to no longer use trains to move oil because it is no longer economically viable.

In mid-February, the CEO of oil producer Suncor commented on this unintended consequence of the production cuts.

“The rail economics are seriously damaged,” said Suncor CEO Steve Williams. “A lot of the rail movements are stopping or have stopped.”

Yet the Alberta government is now investing in moving oil by rail.

Whether or not Canadian government efforts to save the struggling tar sands industry succeed, the risks of moving oil-by-rail are well known.

The latest oil train derailment and spill demonstrate a maxim among oil spill responders: It's not a question of if the next oil spill happens but when. That would also seem to apply as more Canadian oil moves by rail and more oil spills inevitably occur.

While the oil may be moving in the “safest” rail cars — those cars are by no means safe.

201,Empty,2019-03-04T20:36:32Z,The self-immolation of the Canadian government is rooted in the way it came to power.,"Justin Trudeau Lived by Social Media. Now He’s Dying by It.

At the beginning of his term in office, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a diverse and gender-balanced cabinet at a widely celebrated public display of the new left in Canada. When asked why, he answered, “Because it’s 2015”—a response that went viral instantly around the world. Well, it’s 2019 now, and the Trudeau government is in the middle of a scandal of its own making, a drama playing out on social media and live TV that is paralyzing the country and could well take him down. Trudeau has become an object lesson in the perils of “virocracy”: It is in the nature of the social media left to destroy itself.

The SNC-Lavalin scandal has not really reached the international papers yet—I think because compared to the scandals engrossing Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, not to mention the United States’ Donald Trump, it hardly registers. Nonetheless, it involves a very serious claim of impropriety. To summarize briefly: A Quebec-based engineering company called SNC-Lavalin employs 8,500 people in Canada and tens of thousands more around the world. It is a company that has faced consistent and credible accusations of corruption, both at home and abroad. When a case involving the company’s alleged bribery in Libya was recently to be prosecuted in Canada, Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould was faced with a choice: pursue criminal charges, which would probably lead to the destruction of the company, or allow for a deferred prosecution agreement. Wilson-Raybould has testified that after her decision to prosecute, the prime minister improperly pressured her to impose the deferred prosecution agreement to preserve SNC-Lavalin’s Quebec jobs (and Quebec votes). When she resisted, the administration demoted her to minister of veterans affairs. For the record, the prime minister has denied there was improper pressure.

There have been many, many scandals of this magnitude in Canadian political history. The staff of Trudeau’s Conservative predecessor Stephen Harper was criticized by a federal watchdog for making improper payments to a senator, although the prime minister denied any involvement in the incident. Separately, his government was the first in Canadian history to be found in contempt of Parliament. Former Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chrétien’s last years were more or less consumed by deflecting a series of ethical breaches by his cabinet members. His Conservative predecessor Brian Mulroney was more old-fashioned: After leaving office, he took 300,000 Canadian dollars—about $350,000 in today’s U.S. dollars—in cash payments in hotel rooms. The SNC-Lavalin scandal is unremarkable except for one key distinction: A sitting member of Trudeau’s own cabinet blew it up.

Wilson-Raybould’s testimony was, by Canadian standards, high political theater. She concluded her remarks with the line: “I come from a long line of matriarchs and I am a truth teller.” A perfect tweet. Several of her colleagues in the Liberal Party and in cabinet voiced their support for her on various forms of social media. The response from the public, however, is less clear. Several provincial representatives from Quebec expressed concern, but only about whether SNC-Lavalin would be subject to a hostile takeover and the condition of the company’s employees. Imagine if the situation were reversed: If 8,500 Canadian jobs were lost because of a law attempting to preserve the political innocence of Libya, it’s hard to imagine Canadians would not be outraged.

The truth is that the self-immolation of the Trudeau government has been a long time coming. It’s rooted in the way it came to power, through virtue optics and social media. Trudeau is the master of the kind of celebrity progressivism that gets you turned into a paper doll in the pages of New York magazine. He proved that social media skills could win elections, too. But that political technique comes at a cost, and the cost is the need to appear pure. Trudeau is now paying.

A ripple of tension between image and power has run throughout the Liberals’ time in office. Jody Wilson-Raybould herself was a fascinating example. She is a former First Nation regional chief and the daughter of a chief, but when she attended the 2016 Assembly of First Nations, she had to make the following statement as attorney general: “As much as I would tomorrow like to cast into the fire of history the Indian Act so that the Nations can be reborn in its ashes, this is not a practical option—which is why simplistic approaches, such as adopting the UNDRIP [United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People] as being Canadian law, are unworkable and, respectfully, a political distraction to undertaking the hard work required to actually implement it.” The contradiction is obvious: The politically virtuous thing to do is to adopt UNDRIP. She couldn’t do it exactly because she had the power to do it. What torture it must have been—you can hear it in the phrasing—to be the person most responsible in the country for keeping the Indian Act, an evil document, in force.

The same tension was at play when Environment Minister Catherine McKenna posted comments on Twitter and Facebook about the gendered nature of environmental degradation. She was a citing a study that showed that climate change affects women and girls more than men and boys. But her point was really to affect the correct pose: “I fight for women and the environment.” And the problem is this: She was responsible, at that exact moment, for building a pipeline from the Alberta oil sands to the global marketplace. Why would she be a tool of misogyny if she really believed in the argument she was making? Government isn’t a TED Talk.

Anyone with any familiarity with political history or political theory knows that virtue and power are not always compatible. The sidelines are so much easier. From the sidelines, from Twitter, you don’t have to ask yourself if UNDRIP is workable. You just need to scream that it’s a disgrace the Indian Act exists, which it is. You just need to call your enemies misogynists and ignore the balance of compromises by which things are made to happen. Social media, gloriously, elides the fundamental dilemma of virtue and power through spectacle. Wilson-Raybould is a person of profound integrity. No one doubts it. But it doesn’t matter whether she’s unworthy of power or whether power is unworthy of her. The result is the same. There’s an election at the end of this year. For the sake of her integrity, Wilson-Raybould has effectively offered support to Andrew Scheer, the leader of the Conservative Party, who has no climate change plan and who was booed when he last appeared at the Assembly of First Nations. The Conservatives, of course, have never claimed to be moral arbiters as the social media Liberals have. They want to fight for Canadian jobs. They will certainly not hold themselves to standards they absolve their opponents of holding.

The Trudeau Liberals are, right now, the most successful progressive government in the world. On the day before Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Bloomberg reported that child poverty in Canada had fallen to its lowest level since 2002. They have kept Canada the world’s last bastion of functioning multiculturalism. They have stood for refugees. They have renegotiated NAFTA successfully with a madman. They have legalized marijuana. At the same time, Canada has led or come second in growth in the G-7 during most years of their time in office. All these successes are substantial, but they don’t matter politically, because the Liberals built their house on the sand of virality, which doesn’t register substance.

The right doesn’t face these problems. They brag about the ugliness of power, and voters respond to the fact that they’re not lying. Even if Trudeau wins again, his position will always be precarious. Viral virtue eats itself. If you live by poses, you’re going to die by them. The question of the next election is whether Trudeau’s skill at social media manipulation may not bring him to triumph anyway. The political power of social media, though it contains the glamorous flaw of self-immolation, is so huge that a traditional scandal like SNC-Lavalin may not register as it might have in another era.

The other thing Trudeau has going for him is the fundamental hypocrisy of the Canadian people. Smug self-righteousness is our definitive political attribute, especially when we’re talking to other countries, but way down deep we love a bully too. We may want to look like goody two-shoes, but we also want a thug to fight for our jobs and stand up to perceived thugs in Saudi Arabia or wherever. That’s as true in the era of Facebook and Twitter as it ever was.

The base isn’t stupid, and if they stay home on election day because you’ve disavowed them in the general election campaign then you aren’t going to pick up enough “moderate” voters to make a difference. That so-called strategy has looked more an more bleak for several years. Now the alleged moderates have not only decreased in number but they actually don’t represent any view on the American political landscape. These two graphs are from the Pew Research Center’s report Political Polarization in the American Public.

CREDIT: http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/section-1-growing-ideological-consistency/

Because our “first past the post” system crushes third parties like the bugs that they are, this polarization hasn’t been felt in American politics. But the same thing is happening in Europe and Australia/Oceania where parliamentary systems and you can see the effect.

Writing at the Washington Post, Harry Olsen has an intriguing piece on how centrist, “third way” politics are foundering basically everywhere after this philosophy had been declared victorious a couple of decades ago. The article is titled Don’t fool yourself. The political center won’t recover anytime soon and I don’t think the phenomenon is as surprising as some.

…Globally, the prevailing trend is rising support for anti-immigrant, nationalist populist parties — not a resurgence of the center. That trend is easy to see almost anywhere you look. Estonia holds national elections in a week, and polls show the big winner is likely to be the Conservative People’s Party of Estonia, which is set to more than double its share of the vote, becoming the third-largest party in the country. Spain’s Socialist president, Pedro Sánchez, recently called for a snap election after his government failed to pass a budget, but again, polls show an anti-immigrant, nationalist party called Vox will likely gain the most. Vox has skyrocketed in support from less than 1 percent in 2016 to an average of around 11 percent in recent polls. A three-party, center-right coalition including Vox shocked the country by winning the state elections last December in the longtime Socialist bastion of Andalusia. It now looks like that coalition will govern Spain, too. …Italy’s Lega is led by the notorious anti-immigrant and social conservative Matteo Salvini, who has garnered international attention with his opposition to admitting refugees from Muslim Northern Africa. Lega’s support has doubled within a year, from 17 percent in last March’s election to more than 35 percent today, easily making the brash populist the most popular political figure in Italy. …That’s the coalition that currently governs New Zealand, where Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, known for her environmental policies and deft use of social media, governs in coalition with the anti-immigrant and nationalist New Zealand First party. Their coalition agreement is opaque on the matter, but annual net migration has declined nearly 30 percent since the coalition took power in 2017. …Quebec elected a center-right government for the first time in decades last year, partially on its promise to reduce immigration to the province by 20 percent. A new political party, the People’s Party of Canada, formed last year with a platform of free-market economic reforms and reducing immigration. It is already receiving more than 2 percent in the polls, and could easily gain more support ahead of this fall’s national election.

What Olsen paints as anti-immigrant is, I think, much more a natural resurgence of nationalism that has been tamped down…tribalism, dontcha know…by would-be elites married to a populism abetted by the breaking of the information monopoly that has large numbers of people looking at the policies promoted by those elites and asking “WTF??” because a blind man could see they do nothing to benefit current or future generations of their nation. Immigration is a lightning rod for this effect because in so many Western nations, the elites either have or have no problem with opening the flood gates to no-skills/low-skills immigrants who either survive on the dole (paid for by the citizen taxpayer) or compete for low-end jobs with disadvantaged citizens and who, either by their own desire or the benighted policies of the host nation, show no desire to assimilate or even pretend to assimilate.

Those bemoaning the loss of a “center” are actually crying over the demise of Failure Theater and the log-rolling and deal-making that benefited only a relatively small number of people to the detriment of most everyone else. They are complaining that the rule by elites is coming to an end now that everywhere people are seeing that what was marketed as “bipartisanship” was actually just a self-serving scam.

This is “how you got Trump” in a nutshell.

As Texas Democrat and populist Jim Hightower was noted for saying, there’s nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos. The 2016 GOP primary demonstrated that in spades. The closer you were to being a “moderate” the sooner you looked like dead armadillo (Scott Walker, Jeb Bush). The closer your views were to those of the average voter the better your chance of survival. Ted Cruz understood that when he ran this commercial in 2016 highlighting the fact that illegal immigration was only supported by people whose jobs were not put at risk by it:

It will be shocking if the same dynamic doesn’t play out in the Democrat primary for 2020.

Fifty years ago, both US parties commanded a broad consensus opinion on the American Experiment. That consensus has unraveled. The two major parties now have very differing ideas about what the nation should look like and how our economic system should operate. The challenge in 2020 will be to appeal to those common values remaining with sufficient strength to bring along people who might not agree with large parts of your platform. It implies that rather than trying to appeal to moderates, the successful candidate will lock down and motivate their base and build enough common ground with some “moderate” elements to create a winning coalition. Will that common ground be reducing illegal immigration, as it is in Europe? Will it be restricting abortion and limiting the ability of the federal government to meddle in our lives? Or will it be guaranteed free day care, a $15/hour minimum wage and a stipend for those who, according to the Green New Deal, are “unwilling to work?” I really don’t know. Regardless, the unalloyed good here is that both sides are coming to see “moderates” as the feckless and uncertain allies that they are.

“Hillary and Bill Clinton Think Bernie Sanders Can’t Beat Trump in 2020, Still Bitter Over 2016: Report” [Newsweek]. “Interacting with each other briefly in Selma, Alabama, this weekend at the 54th anniversary of ‘Bloody Sunday,’ the two continued to show signs of resentment. Sanders reportedly received a brief handshake from Hillary Clinton, while others, such as Booker, received a more welcoming hug, according to those at the event.” • I think we should take this very seriously. The Clintons are, after all, experts at losing to Trump. (And what’s with “the two”? The only one Newsweek says showed resentment was Clinton. And what was Sanders supposed to do? Get all handsy, Joe Biden style? Imagine the hysteria. “Clinton camp stews over Sanders 2020 campaign” [Politico]. “When Sanders pulled in $1 million in the first three-and-a-half hours of his campaign, Adam Parkhomenko, the former director of grassroots engagement for the 2016 Clinton campaign, tweeted, ‘Only half were named Vladimir.'” • Classy! Another excuse. Thread: Over 86,000 black voters stayed home in Milwaukee between 2012 and 2016. Clinton only needed 22,748 to win. These voters were not ""turned away."" They just didn't see the benefit of voting for Clinton.https://t.co/jwGi6g6gD5@MalaikaJabali https://t.co/BrfHAtzudi — Briahna Joy Gray (@briebriejoy) March 5, 2019

2019

Where the low road and the lower road meet: It's frightening to see how many Resistance™ leaders are aligning themselves with someone who called @BernieSanders a ""fucking fake Jew"" cc: @neeratanden, @AdamParkhomenko, @donnabrazile Thoughts?#Bernie2020 pic.twitter.com/GmBd4DJag3 — NY For Sanders #Bernie2020 (@NYforSanders) March 3, 2019 “The Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez backlash begins” [Chris Cilizz, CNN]. “The real question then is not which part of the party is on the rise — it’s the AOC/Bernie Sanders wing for sure — but rather how those moderates and conservatives are treated by the liberals in the party. Will they be driven out as insufficiently loyal to the cause — as tea party (and Trump) Republicans have done to their own centrist wing over the last decade? Or will liberals find a way to incorporate the views of their more moderate party members as they try to find a candidate who can oust President Donald Trump in 2020?” • Sure. Just vote for #MedicareForAll and everything will be jake with the angels. For now. “Ilhan Omar’s Criticism Raises the Question: Is Aipac Too Powerful?” [Sheryl Gay Stolberg, New York Times]. “Those questions have grown louder with the controversy around Ms. Omar and will grow louder still in the run-up to this month’s annual Aipac policy conference — a three-day Washington confab that is expected to draw more than 18,000 people, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and leaders of both parties in Congress.” • I wonder if we’ll ask Bibi to explain to us again what our foreign policy should be, to a Joint Session of Congress? “Israel Boycott Exposes Serious Rifts in the Democratic Party” [The American Conservative]. “According to a 2018 Pew Research Center report, the number of Republicans that sympathize with Israel over Palestine has increased to 79 percent, while sympathy for Israel dropped among Democrats to 27 percent, a disturbing trend especially for the anti-BDS movement. Besides growing sympathy for the Palestinians, progressives are echoing the ACLU and other groups who say any law prohibiting [BDS] boycotts won’t ultimately survive a Supreme Court test. They are probably right.” • 27 percent. * * *

Realignment and Legitimacy

“A retiring Marine reflects on 18 years of war: What have we achieved?” [Des Moines Register]. “For most of my career, I believed that policymakers were in control of the situation and regardless of how counterproductive decisions made at their level seemed at my level, national leaders would not commit such vast resources in support of a policy lacking a definitive objective. Divested of this illusion, I can see this war was inadequately planned, recklessly administered, and is now just wasteful. Retiring after more than two decades enables me to confidently say that while I am proud of my service and especially those with whom I served, the war in Afghanistan and Iraq is a mistake. If those countries are fronts for the war on terror, it is because we have created them .” • These must be hard words to write. And this vote is there for Sanders (and Gabbard). They are the only two candidates — besides Trump, in his random, bloviational, give-zero-[family blogs] way — who can claim it. DSA (1): “How a Sanders 2020 Endorsement Will Hurt DSA” [Medium]. “As an organization with limited resources at our disposal, understanding the level of impact we can have on the working class per dollar or hour spent must be a vital part of our decision making…. We should look more towards methods of strengthening and growing our membership from the ground up — this means more support for smaller chapters, organizing committees and local elections as well as bridging gaps between national and local levels of organizing.” • At least delay the decision until the National Convention in August — still more than a year away from election day. That just seems like a no-brainer. DSA (2): It’s a long way from Brooklyn, NY to Eugene, OR: It's been 2 years since we started DSA Eugene.

I can’t bring to mind the long-ago article that explained how, er, “finding dates” was a tactic used by agent provocateurs to divide and destroy entities to which they were inimical, but the anecdotes were vivid, believe me.

Stats Watch

New Home Sales, December 2018: “In a very solid headline for what has been a run of weak ones for the housing sector, new home sales jumped” [Econoday]. “The bad is mixed with the good in this report but, for the outlook, the latest month is always the most important of any month, and December’s data for new home sales should give builders and sellers a lift.” And: “December 2018 Headline New Home Sales Improved” [Econintersect]. “Because of weather and other factors, the rolling averages are the way to view this series. The rolling averages improved by [sic] remains deep in contraction.”

Purchasing Managers’ Services Index, February 2019: Up “sizeably” [Econoday]. “New orders are the best barometer of future activity and the report’s description for February is a ‘sharp increase.'” And: “Both services surveys are in expansion – and improved this month. This is a much stronger report than last month” [Econintersect].

Institute For Supply Management Non-Manufacturing Index, February 2019: “Demand for exports is a major theme of a very positive ISM non-manufacturing report for February where the index jumped” [Econoday]. “Strong incoming orders and the need to work down backlogs should give this sample’s employment index in future months a lift.” And: “This suggests faster expansion in February than in January” [Calculated Risk].

Commodities: “Goldman Tones Down its Bullish Outlook on Commodities” [Bloomberg]. “Raw materials are no longer significantly undervalued and further price increases will require data showing better demand and tighter supply, analysts including Jeffrey Currie wrote in a March 4 report. However, a stronger-than-expected recovery in global economic growth could boost commodity indices, and there are still some industrial metals that offer relatively good value, according to the bank.”

Commodities: “Exclusive: U.S. to issue meat company guidelines as recalls mount – official” [Reuters]. “The U.S. government plans to issue new guidelines for food companies as early as this week after an increase in recalls of meat and poultry products possibly containing metal, plastic and other foreign materials, a food-safety official said on Monday… The voluntary guidelines , in the works for months, are designed to ensure companies meet pre-existing regulatory requirements, she said.”

Manufacturing: “Passenger Jet Parts Not Properly Checked By Japanese Engine Maker” [Bloomberg]. “Japanese heavy-machinery maker IHI Corp. said employees didn’t properly check some aircraft engines, the latest quality-control issue to dent the reputation of the country’s manufacturing sector…. IHI is still investigating how many engines were involved and over what period…. According to IHI’s website, the V2500 has been installed on Airbus A319, A320 and A321 jets, while the PW1100G powers the Airbus A320 neo.”

The Bezzle: “Tesla Sell-Off Worsens After Elon Musk’s Surprise Store Closings” [Bloomberg]. “Tesla Inc. shares continued a steep sell-off in the wake of Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s surprise move to close most of the electric-car maker’s stores and shift to online-only sales. Many sales personnel first found out about the decision when Tesla published a public blog post Thursday afternoon, said three people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters.” • Why would anybody buy a car from a company where the CEO openly treats his employees like garbage? It’s not like there aren’t other cars out there, even electric ones.

The Bezzle: “China suspends customs clearance for Tesla Model 3 imports – Caixin” [CNBC]. “China’s customs authority has suspended customs clearance procedures for Model 3 cars built by Tesla Inc, the financial publication Caixin reported on Tuesday. The report said the customs authority in Shanghai had found various irregularities in 1,600 imported Model 3 cars, including the improper labelling of the vehicles.” • “Improper labelling.” Hmm.

The Bezzle: “How much does Tesla have in the bank?” [FT Alphaville]. “A lower implied cash balance also may go some way to explaining the cost savings Tesla has made over the past year, including three rounds of lay-offs, and last week’s announcement that nearly all of its stores would be closing in-favour of online only sales.” Here is a tweet with the product of the post’s calculations in chart form:

For balance sheet aficionados, this could be important. Readers?

The Bezzle: “40% of Europe’s artificial intelligence start-ups have no AI” [Financial Times]. “The research by London-based investment firm MMC Ventures could not find any evidence, based on public information and interviews with executives, of artificial intelligence applications at 40 per cent of 2,830 AI start-ups in Europe.” • Tsk!

Concentration: “How badly are we being ripped off on eyewear? Former industry execs tell all” [Los Angeles Times]. “[Charles Dahan] was once one of the leading suppliers of frames to LensCrafters, before the company was purchased by optical behemoth Luxottica. He also built machines that improved the lens-manufacturing process…. ‘There is no competition in the industry, not any more,’ he told me. ‘Luxottica bought everyone. They set whatever prices they please.’… Dahan, who lives in Potomac, Md., was responding to a column I recently wrote about why consumer prices for frames and lenses are so astronomically high, with markups often approaching 1,000%.” • That’s a nice business to be in!

Our Famously Free Press

“Financial Times acquires majority stake in TNW (The Next Web)” [TNW]. “The deal forms part of a corporate development strategy that has seen the FT diversify its Group business in strategic business areas. The move complements the FT’s recent investment in Sifted, a new media site and newsletter targeting Europe’s innovators and entrepreneurs, and the expansion of various other tech-themed editorial products, and acquisitions by FT in recent years of AlphaGrid, a content production company, GIS Planning, a San Francisco-based investment intelligence company, and Longitude, a specialist provider of thought leadership and research services.” • “Thought leadership.” Gawd.

“Hiding in Plain Sight: PAC-Connected Activists Set Up ‘Local News’ Outlets” [Snopes]. Ugh. One of the many sordid details: “Chris Butler, listed as the Tennessee Star‘s investigative journalist, covered the Lee campaign and administration for the Star. But just before joining the Tennessee Star as an “investigative journalist,” he served as a media spokesperson “for a political PAC to help elect Bill Lee governor in 2018″ between May and August 2018.” • We like, at least, to have a door that revolves.

“Why Misinformation Is About Who You Trust, Not What You Think” [New York Magazine]. “Bennett Holman and Justin Bruner give a great example of heart arrhythmias. When people were first studying anti-arrhythmic drugs, the question was, “Are these going to reduce heart attacks?” Other scientists asked, “Do they reduce arrhythmia?” Big Pharma funded the latter group. It poured money into scientists asking whether these drugs reduced arrhythmia. In fact, they did. But they also increased heart attacks and were responsible for upward of 100,000 premature deaths by heart attack. So, again, independent researchers were doing exactly what they were doing before. It was just that some of them now had a lot more money and that shaped the evidence.” • 100,000 deaths seems like rather a lot.

Black Injustice Tipping Point

“Capital Prisoners: Unbranding the Narrative of Slavery” [Ghion Journal]. “Up until today, I used to refer to people who were indentured into forced labor as political prisoners [not slaves. But] a more appropriate name is capital prisoners. This is precisely what ‘slaves’ were, they were hostages of capitalism which turned human beings into assets and liabilities on the balance sheets of wicked traders…. The same way Africans once sold their own into bondage and overseers lashed capital prisoners, these modern day ‘House Negros’ are doing the bidding of the system by keeping their people oppressed while they live lavishly. I’m of course talking about Obama, Kamala, Booker and the army of black corporate courtiers who are unleashed upon the ‘African-American’ community.” • A complicated post, worth a read, agree or not.

204,Empty,2019-02-27T13:40:58Z,A Sikh leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP) won a by-election to enter the Canadian parliament.,"Jagmeet Singh is now considered as a viable challenge to the main Opposition Conservative Party leader

A Sikh leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP) won a by-election to enter the Canadian parliament.

Jagmeet Singh, 40, won the Burnaby South constituency seat in British Columbia (BC) province after defeating Liberal party candidate Tory Shin, a corporate lawyer, and Lee, a former Burnaby member of the provincial legislature representing the BC Liberals, his campaign said.

The by-election was held in three different provinces on Tuesday, with barely eight months left for the federal elections in October, also sealed Mr Singh's position as an undisputed leader of the NDP, the third largest party in the House of Commons.

The other two seats were bagged one each by the ruling Liberals from Ontario province and the main opposition Conservatives from Quebec.

The Scarborough-born Sikh leader, also rated as a rising star in Canadian politics, had a shaky position as the head of the NDP as he was not a Member of Parliament.

Following his win, Mr Singh is now considered as a viable challenge to the main Opposition Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, who is younger to him and streering a progressive alternative on the national stage to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal party.

According to Mr Singh's campaign spokesperson, James Smith, the NDP leader has now redeemed his supremacy in the party.

Affordable housing, pharmacare and meaningful action to combat climate change are his focused areas of work to solve the problems of the people, Singh told his supporters in his victory speech.

Mr Singh maintained that the successive governments of the Liberals and the Conservatives had only enriched corporations while neglecting common Canadians.

""I know it's been a long slog, but I hope you have more left in the tank. We have just eight more months to let the people know they can choose a government that stands up for people and not corporations, that doesn't give handouts to SNC-Lavalin,"" Mr Singh said in the context of the ongoing controversy involving SNC-Lavalin.

The NDP victory comes at a time the Liberals are facing the worst crisis involving the SNC-Lavalin bribery scandal, which led to the resignation of the former justice minister attorney general Jody Wilsom-Raybould

Will he one day be known as Prime Minister Singh after this fall’s federal election?

Singh got the first part out of the way, winning the byelection with 8,800 votes, or 39 per cent of the vote.

Liberal candidate Richard Lee (who replaced candidate Karen Wang partway through the campaign) came second with 5,930 votes, or 26 per cent of the vote.

Conservative candidate Jay Shin placed third with 5,133 votes, or about 22.5 per cent of the vote.

People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson did better than some people expected with 2,420, about 10.6 per cent of the vote.

Independents Terry Grimwood had 1.1 per cent of the vote and Valentine Wu 0.7 per cent.

Overall voter turnout was just 30 per cent.

Singh took the stage and thanked the other candidates for their contribution to the democratic process. He also thanked the party’s volunteers and supporters.

“I am humbled by your belief in me,” he said.

“I am humbled by your belief in me.” Jagmeet Singh #cdnpoli pic.twitter.com/SPcIoXuRBG — Kelvin?Gawley (@KelvinGawley) February 26, 2019

“I will be your champion,” Singh also said. “I will take each and every one of you to Ottawa. I will fight for you in the House of Commons.”

Singh, the first visible minority leader of a major federal party, said that when he was growing up, he never imagined seeing someone who looked like him running to be the prime minister of Canada.

“We just showed a lot of kids out there that yes we can,” he said, borrowing a slogan from former U.S. President Barack Obama.

The campaign was marred by shouting matches at campaign debates over such issues as immigration and refugees. There was also plenty of questionable campaign material distributed by some candidates during the past few weeks.

Before results rolled in, Vancouver East MP Jenny Kwan said she was confident Singh would serve Burnaby South well and boost the party’s fortunes.

“Jagmeet has made a decision,” Kwan told the NOW. “He’s chosen Burnaby South as his home. He’s moved his family here. Absolutely, I believe he can represent the people of Burnaby South and bring their issues forward. He’s been out in those doorsteps every single night, talking to people about what matters to them, what’s concerning to them and to ensure that there voice is going to be heard.”

Kwan continued: “I’ve been out door-knocking with Jagmeet in the rain, in the sun, in the snow and so I’m very optimistic about tonight and I’m super, super excited to have Jagmeet in the House of Commons with the NDP caucus.”

Burnaby Mayor Mike Hurley said he was excited to the city represented by a party leader. He said he hopes Singh can help bring much-needed federal housing funds to Burnaby.

The night also saw the nascent People’s Party of Canada receive approximately 11 per cent of the vote. The local candidate, Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson, repeatedly brought up the murder of Burnaby teen Marrisa Shen during the election as a reason to screen refugees more stringently.

(The man accused in the murder is a Syrian refugee who has yet to have his charges tested in court.)

Hurley said he thinks the PPC tapped into “fear and misunderstanding in the community.”

He walked away with 39 per cent of the vote (8,884 votes), followed by Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee’s 26 per cent and Conservative Jay Shin’s 22.5 per cent.

Here’s five things to know about Singh.

In 2011, Singh lost his first attempt to enter politics.

Singh’s first attempt to enter politics in 2011 was not successful. The longtime Toronto-area resident had run for federal government in the Brampton, Ont. riding of Bramalea-Gore-Malton but lost to Conservative candidate Bal Gosal by 539 votes.

Later that same year, he ran for a provincial seat in the overlapping riding and was elected with 38 per cent of the vote. After he was announced the winner, Singh gave a victory speech in English, French and Punjabi.

In 2017, Singh stepped down from his provincial seat after winning the federal NDP leadership race. He became the first member of a visible minority to lead a national political party. In 2019, he won a byelection in the B.C. riding of Burnaby South to secure a seat in parliament.

Singh has been hailed a ‘personality to watch’, ‘the greatest showman’ and the ‘most stylish politician in Canada.’

In 2012, the Toronto Star named Singh one of its “12 to watch in 2012.” In a profile, Singh was described as “not your typical New Democrat” and “one of the youngest, most dynamic MPPs at Queen’s Park”, a “trailblazer in Ontario politics.”

A Toronto Life feature last year called Singh “the greatest showman,” with a following that “should make Justin Trudeau nervous”, while a 2017 piece called him the “king of politician Instagram,” thanks to his photographs from international trips and of his well-cut suits. Earlier in 2013, Singh was also named among “the new power set” by the outlet.

Even popular magazine GQ chatted with Singh in 2017, the product of which was a piece that hailed Singh as an “incredibly well-dressed rising star in Canadian politics.”

“Jagmeet Singh looks the way you hope a progressive politician would,” begins the GQ piece. It’s safe to say Singh captured some attention on his way up through the political sphere with his approach and style.

Singh’s work as a lawyer paved his way into politics.

Singh has a science degree from the University of Western Ontario and a law degree from York University’s Osgoode Law School. He was called to the bar in 2006 and has worked throughout the Greater Toronto area, later opening his own firm.

Much of his work revolved around advocating for charter rights. In an interview with GQ, Singh said his entry into politics was largely due in part to his work in law: “As a lawyer I continued to do human rights work with local organizations and cultural communities that felt their political representation was inadequate; that the elected officials we had were not tackling the issues that mattered to them.”

Singh’s younger brother Gurratan is also a lawyer by trade but was elected last year in the Ontario provincial election in the riding of Brampton East. He has also served as Singh’s advisor during his campaigns.

At my little brother's call to the bar ceremony, he's a lawyer today…. proud of you bro. #proudolderbrother — Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh) September 21, 2011

Singh and wife Gurkiran Kaur recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary.

Singh and Kaur first met in 2010 when the former gave a presentation to Kaur’s class at York University. The pair went on a date in 2011 and kept things casual until 2017, when they went public with their relationship.

In January of 2018, Singh topped any photo-op Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had ever set up by inviting media to Toronto restaurant Vegetarian Haven – where the pair had their first date – to witness his proposal. The NDP leader got down one knee and proposed in front of family and friends as a quartet performed Ed Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud.” Kaur said yes.

The couple married the next month, with a ceremony in Toronto and more festivities in Mexico. They celebrated their one-year anniversary on Feb. 22, 2019.

Singh’s victory song is Post Malone’s “Congratulations.”

Singh has said that during his NDP leadership campaign, he listened to Post Malone’s “Congratulations” “literally everyday.”

“Something about the bravado laced confidence of the track touched on the spirit of our campaign,” he wrote in a Dec. 12, 2017 Instagram post. “We were setting out to achieve something that had not been achieved in the history of our country.

“It takes a little bravado to do that.”

“Congratulations” was released as the promotional single for the American rapper’s debut album Stoney. The track reached No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 11 and has been certified eight times platinum. Singh rapped along to the song at his Burnaby victory party following the Feb. 25 byelection.",Five things to know about Burnaby South MP Jagmeet Singh,Vancouversun.com,https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/five-things-to-know-about-burnaby-south-mp-jagmeet-singh

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Leila, and good morning to everyone. Q4 was another outstanding profitable quarter. We expanded gross margin by 300 basis points to over 22%. When you exclude the one-time benefit in 2017 due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act net income grew by 33%. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 35%. We placed 14 megawatts of solar projects in service and added 59 megawatts to our assets in development. This strong performance concluded another outstanding year. We again achieved our objective of growing profits faster than revenue. For the full year, we grew revenue by 10%, gross profit by 20%, net income by 8%, and adjusted EBITDA by 44%.

Important to note, excluding the Q4 2017 one-time tax benefit, net income growth was closer to 80%. And we generated adjusted cash from operations of over $100 million included the proceeds from Federal ESPC liabilities. Furthermore, we increased project backlog by 11% to $2 billion and more than doubled energy assets in development to 178 megawatts.

As we look back on the accomplishments of 2018, I wanted to share key elements that we think make Ameresco a remarkable business and an attractive investment for you, our shareholders. The first element is resiliency, a quality we discussed in the context of micro grids, but rarely in the context of our business model. Our performance this year highlights why resiliency is so important. As in any business, something usually goes wrong. In general, we can now absorb those unexpected challenges because we have a large diversified backlog of projects underpinned by notably stable and high margins reoccurring revenue streams.

At the start of 2018, we anticipated EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.65, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $75 million to $85 million. A midpoint of that range represented an increase of $17 million in adjusted EBITDA. We expected a vast majority of that incremental EBITDA to come from our renewable gas plants in Michigan, in Arizona. As it turned out, our 16 megawatt Michigan plant only started contributing meaningfully to earnings in the second half of the year, and the 6 megawatt Arizona plant just started generating revenue in the first quarter of 2019.

In the project business, we also encountered some normal disruptions. For instance, we get budgeted revenue from a large convention center project for the second half of 2018. However, we did not convert this award to contract by the end of the year. We expect this contract to be signed in the first half of this year. Another large contract is the ongoing Chicago streetlight project. Implementation and revenue recognition slowed down in the second half due to shortages of parts. In addition, the New York City Housing Authority requested that our focus was to make sure that their residents had no disruption in heat during the winter season.

As a result, other originally scheduled measures were pushed further out in the implementation schedule. These types of delays are normal in our project business, especially when you retrofitting buildings that they are in use. These are the types of challenges we have dealt with regularly for years. To counteract these challenges, we now have a broad set of revenue opportunities with other projects, services and activities that can absorb the shortfall.

During the year, our Federal Group demonstrated outstanding execution; converging very large projects, such as Island Palm Communities and Joint Base San Antonio. Our geographic expansion strategy with a focus of 100 penetrated parts of the country like the Southwest is also bringing in new revenues. The Southwest region topped $100 million of revenue in 2018, the first time ever for that region. This team is actively driving activity, notably in repeat business included a large Texas University System and multiple streetlight projects across the region. So, despite the project setbacks I mentioned, solid execution enable us to deliver net income of $38 million and adjusted EBITDA of $91 million.

The second important element of our business is visibility. Our visibility is measured in years and in billion of dollars. The leading edge of our pipeline is filled in with revenue as we've recognized two years or three years from now. This level of visibility is uncommon and it's critically differentiating Ameresco as an investment. We improved our visibility in 2018 across all dimensions. The most important is recurring revenue. For years, we have focused on building the portfolio of long-term reoccurring revenue streams. We have now reached a critical mass in that portfolio, which gives us an outstanding foundation for stability and high margins.

Our portfolio of operating energy asset now stands at 229 megawatts. Based on contracted power purchase agreements and incentive revenue this portfolio has solid visibility on $900 million of revenue over the next 20 years. Important to note, this figure does not include merchant revenue and also does not include any contributions from our extensive pipeline of assets in development and construction. If we include those likely sources we have line of sight of at least $3 billion of revenue. The energy, revenue visibility is complemented by contracted operations and maintenance, where we will realize revenue of $930 million over 15 years. Importantly, we are accelerating the build out of energy asset portfolio.

We are exiting the year with an outstanding development pipeline, which is well distributed throughout the US. These assets should be placed into service over the next 12 months to 13 months. Renewable natural gas also known as RNG or Green gas, is an important new opportunity in our energy portfolio. RNG is incremental to our extensive historical activity in solar and landfill gas. The Michigan and Arizona, RNG plants are now in service and we have a strong pipeline of additional green gas opportunities. We get talked about one plant in Texas entering our assets-in-development metric in Q3. We are now happy to report that we have formally added two additional plants to this metric in Q4.

Of the 178 megawatts of assets in development, approximately 23% are green gas projects. Beyond that, we still have five to six additional green gas opportunities we are actively pursuing. All of these projects are approximately 10 megawatts to 12 megawatts each. We are identifying creative new approaches to energy sales. For instance, in Canada, we are implementing a battery storage asset that will help balance the grid, storing energy during low demand hours and selling it back to the grid at peak demand. This asset is based in Ontario and will consist of two facilities with a capacity of two megawatts each. Of course, visibility is not limited to recurring revenue streams. We ended the year with total project backlog of almost $2 billion, included contracted backlog of $727 million. As we often mention, project sizes are getting larger, and we have been -- we are seeing in more and more repeat business. For instance, we have signed contracts for two phases of the New York City Housing Authority, and we are in good position to pursue additional work there. NYCHA is the biggest housing authority in the country and our strategic relationship with them has produced revenue for over two years now.

The third quality that makes Ameresco an attractive investment is our large and growing market opportunity. First of all, we are transforming our business model. Market demand is shifting from simple energy conservation measures to sophisticated infrastructure upgrades that reflect the new smart energy economy. Efficiency is always part of the plan, since core savings for the work, but projects are getting larger and more comprehensive. So as our traditional efficiency customers, we have leveraged HVAC upgrades or have acclaimed an advance building controls are now adding resiliency, distributed energy, battery storage, micro-grid controls and more.

According to Navigant Research, these technologies expand our total addressable market from approximately $6 billion to $8 billion per year to between $20 billion to $30 billion per year. A few years ago for example, the Joint Base San Antonio or Island Palm project might have been half the size, as they are today without micro-grids, infrastructure upgrades, resiliency, distributed generation and the additional advanced technologies in our portfolio. Our opportunity is also growing as we penetrate in new territories. We continue to target the Southwest and now the Southeast, which have been underserved by us historically. In Canada, we are beginning to see positive performance from the team -- the new team and structure we put in place in 2017. Finally, we are also getting meaningful traction in the UK.

To take full advantage of the growing market opportunities, we are stepping up our investments. We are expanding our team with more people that have in-depth technical expertise. Also, we are adding more people with deep expertise in project and energy asset development.

To conclude, we are optimistic about 2019 and the years beyond. As we have stated before, we plan on a three-year basis and see revenue growing in high single-digits and EBITDA growing high double-digits. As we exit 2019 with a strategic resource investments that we have made, the additional PV assets and the Texas RNG plant coming online. We are well positioned for strong growth in 2020 and 2021.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark for comments on our financial performance and outlook. Mark?

Mark Chiplock -- Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer

Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. As George mentioned, we concluded the year with outstanding fourth quarter financial performance. We grew revenue double digits and achieved our goal of growing profit faster than revenue. Our growing project backlog and recurring revenues continue to bring increased visibility and long-term predictability to our business model. I will start with some brief comments about our Q4 results, then turn to our full year 2018 results. All figures referred to Q4 2018, and all the comparisons are for the year-over-year changes unless I say otherwise.

As George mentioned with the delayed conversion of a large awarded convention center project and NYCHA's request to parse out our work, project revenues came in lower than expected. Despite these delays however, total revenue was up 3%, supported by increased energy and O&M sales. The recurring revenues from these lines of business continued to help offset the natural variability that exists in our projects business.

Strong gross margin performance was driven by high margin energy sales and a better mix of projects. We continue to demonstrate the operating leverage inherent in our business. Operating expenses grew only $2.2 million from last year, while gross profit grew by $7.7 million. This resulted in our operating margin expanding by 230 basis points. Full net income and EPS were below the amounts reported last year. However, keep in mind that in Q4 of 2017, we had a $14 million, or $0.30 per share benefit due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding this onetime benefit, non-GAAP net income grew 35%, and non-GAAP EPS grew 28%.

Now let's look at the full year results. These figures all referred to the full year 2018, and all comparisons are with 2017, unless I state otherwise. Revenue grew by 10%, and gross margin expanded 200 basis points to 22.1% due to a favorable mix of our recurring revenues and higher margin projects. For 2019, we expect gross margin to revert to more normal levels in the 20% to 21% range for the following reasons. First, we are converting the existing LFG plant in Texas to RNG. In doing so, we will take this asset offline for a significant portion of the year costing us $2 million to $3 million in contribution. Second, we expect a greater proportion of revenue to come from certain lower margin projects.

We demonstrated solid operating leverage, keeping operating expenses under tight control. Operating margin expanded by over 200 basis points. Looking at 2019, George noted that we are accelerating our investment in strategic resources to capture the growing market opportunities. As such we are planning to invest an incremental $3 million to $5 million above the normal growth in operating expenses.

Our balance sheet remains strong. Our liquidity is excellent with $61 million of cash on hand and over $70 million available on our corporate revolver. We have over $1 billion in assets and corporate debt of only $43 million. The rest of our debt is non-recourse project financing. It's also important to reiterate that the Federal ESPC liability is not debt to Ameresco.

Shifting to cash flow performance. This year marked an important milestone for Ameresco. While GAAP cash used in operations was $53 million, when you add back the proceeds from Federal ESPC projects, we generated over $100 million of adjusted cash from operations.

Let me quickly review the energy assets, which represent our primary capital investments. Total energy assets on our balance sheet are over $450 million of which 83% are in operations, while the balance are assets in construction. During 2018, we placed 39 megawatts into service during the year. Our development pipeline is 178 megawatt equivalents which more than doubled from a year ago. Of course, we also have assets in even earlier stages of development, but those are not yet counted in our formal assets in development metric. We are fully confident in our ability to finance this pipeline.

As energy assets are becoming an important driver of our growth, we thought it would be important to help shape how those assets will contribute to our results. We will not comment on specific plans, but can provide approximate guidelines for your modeling. Keep in mind, the mix of incentives and contract structures can vary from asset to asset. In general, RNG plants at current rim prices and at full capacity can generate approximately $1 million of EBITDA per megawatt annually. Our solar plants at full capacity can generate approximately $200,000 of EBITDA per megawatt annually.

For 2019, we expect to place between 50 megawatts and 60 megawatts of assets into service. Our Texas project is expected to come online in the second half of 2020. And the two additional RNG projects recently awarded in California are expected to come online in 2021. As these projects are still in the permitting stage the timelines are subject to change.

Finally, let me explain likely changes in our tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2018 was 11.4%. This included a tax benefit from the extension of the energy efficiency deductions available under 179D. The benefit was approximately $5.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. That tax benefit has since expired and it is not clear if it will be extended. As such, in 2019, we are assuming a higher tax rate in the range of 18% to 20%.

We expect another solid year of revenue and profit growth. We expect 2019 revenue to be in the range of $845 million to $885 million. Our gross margin in 2018 was higher than normal. So we expect to return to more normal levels, akin to what we reported in 2017. We expect EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.85. Adjusted EBITDA should grow again likely to the range of $93 million to $103 million.

Like last year, we are not offering quarterly guidance due to the variability of project revenue timing. I will remind you that Q1 2018 was unusually strong due to benefits in both revenue and earnings. Therefore, we expect Q1 of 2019 to look more like Q1 of 2017. However, we expect the full year to follow the normal pattern of sequential growth each quarter. That concludes our prepared remarks.

So now we would like to open the line for your questions. I will turn the call back over to our coordinator, Heather, to run the Q&A session. Heather?

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And your first question will come from Carter Driscoll with B Riley, FBR. Your line is open.

Carter Driscoll -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst

Good morning, gentlemen.

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning, Carter.

Carter Driscoll -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst

Congratulations on a very strong 2018 first half. Maybe you could, George or Mark, talk about, the puts and takes, the conversion of the Texas plant. Just make sure I understand the timing of that? And kind of like the incremental contribution from converting it over to green gas?

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

Okay. Well, one of us will cover it. I will cover the timing and then Mark will cover the contribution. The timing right now is contemplated to come online in the second half of next year. And we are in the process of getting there all the appropriate permits and that's why sometimes we say it depends what happens to the permitting schedule. Right now, based on what we know, it looks like we will be in the second half. But something could happen. As you probably recall on the Phoenix plant even though the project was completed this -- the fourth quarter of last year, it didn't fully operate until the first quarter of this year because of local permitting issues, right?

Mark Chiplock -- Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer

Yeah. And then just to reiterate going in 2019 Carter, right, we're going to take that offline and as we mentioned. So, that's probably going to have an impact of about $2 million to $3 million in lost contribution this year. But then again when that comes back online and we're at full run rate as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that plant will be about 12-megawatts -- 10 to 12 megawatts and we would anticipate about $1 million of EBITDA per megawatt annually. So...

Carter Driscoll -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst

Just on an apples-to-apples, from one feedstock to another would it be roughly, I guess, about a 50% increase in contribution on EBITDA. Is that fair?

Mark Chiplock -- Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer

Yeah, about 5%.

Carter Driscoll -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst

5%.

Mark Chiplock -- Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer

Five times, I'm sorry.

Carter Driscoll -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst

Yeah. Okay. All right.

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

If we ask the question correctly I mean we're losing $2 million to $3 million of EBITDA this year and will be pretty much $10 million to $12 million EBITDA once it's fully operational. And those numbers I want to question a little bit everyone that when we talk in $10 million to $12 million -- the $1 million contribution EBITDA it is the current rain prices and the plants operating at full capacity. Sometimes you might see it from quarter-to-quarter we have some variability.

Carter Driscoll -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst

Yeah. Just trying to get a sense of the magnitude of the change in investment taken offline. Okay. Maybe just talk about some of the newer geographies. You mentioned having real success incrementally in the Southwest territory, Southeast has been more of an underserviced territory for you as you mentioned. Canada looked like it's come back online. Can you just kind of give your thoughts whether it's -- do you see more incremental impact in the second half of 2019 or 2020? And then the mix of types of projects you're going after by region?

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. And that's why I mentioned it, because we have said it in the past. We have underserved in the Southwest and the Southeast. And we're getting -- I mean, we reached over $100 million for the Southwest group and that's an outstanding performance for them for the year. And they have very good backlog, established good backlog, especially in Texas. But in addition to that, we are not talking much about California, but we have made great strides in California as well. We have 10 operating LFG plants in California. Now as you saw, two of the new ones, the green gas plants, they are in California, and we do not put them in the backlog until we have clear visibility as to the connection with their local gas pipelines to their local utility there as well as the gas contracts. And in addition to that, we're developing several projects there for assets solar plants that they will be in our provided visibility in a year or so. So we're making good strides. The Southeast, even though we have done some projects in the Southeast like Florida and Georgia, we think there is more potential. So part of the investment we make in there, we put in more people in -- put additional resources in those particular groups.

Carter Driscoll -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst

And I'm assuming the connection for the California plants is not PG&E (ph) territory?

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes.

Carter Driscoll -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst

Okay. I'll get back in the queue. I'll take the rest offline. Thanks guys.

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. Your next question comes from Craig Irwin with ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open.

Craig Irwin -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst

Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning, Craig.

Craig Irwin -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst

So, George as we could look back to this time a year ago when you gave guidance originally of $75 million to $85 million in EBITDA, your actual result for the year was $11 million higher than the midpoint of the guidance you issued at the beginning of the year. You've already touched on a couple of the things that maybe went the wrong way in 2018. But can you maybe talk to us about the contingencies you had that were unnecessary? And maybe the projects that outperformed in 2018? And how this is factored into our guidance for 2019? Are you expecting the same conservative outlook for some of these projects that obviously went better than expected over the last 12 months?

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

Okay. That's a good -- Look we tried to be conservative in our guidance. But on the other hand we try to be realistic because we are in the project business and we implemented these projects and many things happen. So, last year we updated our guidance two -- three times actually during the year as we got better visibility. When we started out at the beginning of the year, we had over $150 million that we were planning to get for the year. That was coming from projects that they were not signed yet, otherwise actually awarded projects that they had to move into the executive category. So that's one. The other one, if you remember we had some issues in the beginning with Woodland asset and I was reluctant to step up to the plate and give a broader guidance on that. But as the year moved on though and we got more information, we upgraded our guidance. And the one that, I will pay more attention to throughout guidance is the EBITDA. And the EBITDA, the last one that we gave was top line was $89 million and we came in at $91 million EBITDA. And the revenues that we lost, they're lower-margin revenues as Mark pointed out. And they were about $12 million to $15 million all the projects I mentioned together, if you bundle them up. And -- but the contribution for those projects and the bottom line most likely would have been $1 million. So that's -- that explains last year. This year, again, we tried to be very cautious, because for example the Arizona plant is up and running right now. For example yesterday, we were at full capacity. Today, we have taken it out to do some modifications. Part of the course in ramping up this facility, it takes some time. In addition to that, again, like last year, this year we have slightly more amount of revenues as we have in our plant that comes from awarded projects they have to be converted to contracts execution in order to go ahead and implement them. Mark, you want to add anything else to that?

Mark Chiplock -- Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer

No. I think you hit on a lot great points. If I just come back Craig to your question regarding the 2018 closeouts. I mean, we don't plan for the pickups from project closeouts. As you know, I mean, our recent history has shown that we've had some, but it's not a guarantee. And with all aspects of our project business and the size and timing is going to vary from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. So in 2019, we don't plan for pickups from (Technical Difficulty)

Craig Irwin -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst

Okay. Excellent. And just a follow-up question here. You mentioned $150 million in business executed last year that was both awarded and executed in 2018. Can you share whether or not you've included a similar assumption for 2019, or have you factored something may be on the conservative side like you did at the beginning of last year?

Mark Chiplock -- Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer

Yeah, I mean -- as George mentioned, we are assuming certain amount converted from awarded into contracted in our numbers, probably not as large as last year, but still we are going to have to rely on a fairly sizable amount coming from awarded. We have good visibility from our contracted backlog contributing into the project revenue. But yeah, we're still going to rely on converting awards this year.

Craig Irwin -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst

Okay. And my next question's about the Phoenix plant the new G&G plant that you brought online this quarter. Congratulations about getting that thing up. Can you maybe clarify for us was this a headwind for EBITDA in the quarter? Will it be a headwind in the first quarter? Would you expect to maybe see a modest profit contribution in the March quarter for that plant as it starts to ramp and go through the shakedown?

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

You will not see much impact at all in the first quarter. But it will start ramping up the second quarter, and of course the balance of the year. Like I said, I think it's so far gives you even more color if we got it up to full operation two, three days ago operated for a couple of days, then we take -- we took it down, because we were going to do some minor modifications so it might take a few days to a week. So it will be my -- a very small contribution this quarter, but then you will see it picking up the second and the third quarter and so on.

Craig Irwin -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst

Great. And then...

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

One of the things, the other thing that I might point out even the Michigan plant we had a hard time getting it up and running. And this last quarter, I would say over-performed the last quarter. I'm talking about the last quarter of last year over performed that what we expected. By the way, there's was an excellent performance on the particular plant there the fourth quarter of the year.

Craig Irwin -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst

Those are amazing plants which is why I've been so focused on them for the last 18 months. So just to...

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

They were great. And that's why we called them out, because they are so significant and they have such a contribution to the EBITDA for the year. Even though their timing might not be exact, we wouldn't be able to predict it exactly when they come online. But they are becoming catalyst for the year or for the quarters that they show up and they are fully operational. And that's why we called them out in order to help everyone else understand, how much potential contribution we have. In addition to that, to give a better color what's it's going to look like over the next two to three years going forward.

Craig Irwin -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst

Great. And then last question, if I may. The two plants you mentioned in California you moved into your backlog for the G&G pipeline, right, 41 megawatts. Can you maybe discuss with us what changed over the last couple of months? Were there specific permits issued, or were there preliminary design engineering plans that were formulated and approved, or what have you booked these into backlog now? What gives you the confidence that this is changed? And how should we look for potential bookings of the remaining five or so which actually seems to point to a little bit of growth total in the headcount there, right? But what should we look for those other plants to potentially come into your backlog as you build out this portfolio?

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

I'll be very specific. For example, the two plants the Keller and Solar that we put in service I mean the service in our awarded backlog this last quarter that made a significant impact. We had to execute the agreements with the utility in addition to that the gas contracts with a client. Now the client of course there is the landfill owners. And they are the ones we're looking right now. Once we execute those gas contracts, you probably see them on the awarded category. In addition to that on the PV, the last quarter we did acquire some projects from developers that they were not able to complete them at the early stage of developments and we acquired them and then we executed and so that's why you saw a major impact. Going forward, again and Mark might want to add some more color to it, but we will use the same guidelines we used in the past. The pipeline is large, but we are careful when we put them in the awarded category. We're going to make sure that the probability of getting them up and running is much than -- better than 50%.

Mark Chiplock -- Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer

Yeah. No, I agree. I think the only thing I'd add, I mean, once we get them into the asset and development metric, it's generally a pretty high probability, better than 90% that those will go to a project. So we feel pretty good about that one if they get into the metric.

Craig Irwin -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst

Great. Thanks, again, for taking my questions.

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. That's great.

Operator

Thank you. Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.

Noah Kaye -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

Thanks. Good morning, George and Mark.

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

Hello, good morning.

Noah Kaye -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

Maybe just a clarifying question, since we're talking a lot about the RNG asset portfolio. What are the total RNG assets in operation today, in megawatts or megawatt equivalents, including Phoenix?

Mark Chiplock -- Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer

Bear with me just -- we've got about 22-megawatt equivalents in service today.

Noah Kaye -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

Right, including Phoenix. And assuming the Texas conversion and the two California plants come online, what does that grow to at the end of 2021?

Mark Chiplock -- Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer

Yeah. So another 10 to 12 each for the three of those, so another 30-plus megawatts on top of that.

Noah Kaye -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

Okay. And you know just understand here, as we're thinking about the puts and takes of the guidance, I mean, that the -- you're getting a full-year of Michigan now, which -- it's correct, you said was a -- that's a 16-megawatt plant, did I hear that right?

Mark Chiplock -- Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer

Yeah.

Noah Kaye -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

And Arizona is six, right?

Mark Chiplock -- Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer

Yes.

Noah Kaye -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

Okay. So let's just say we're getting, let's be conservative and say we're getting 8 megawatts or 8 million or so of kind of year-over-year benefit from Michigan. That's already -- that alone is the bridge to the midpoint of your guidance in a vacuum. But there are a lot of other puts and takes that you, yeah, I'm sorry, go ahead.

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

We have to take $3 million off that because of converting the Texas plant from brown gas to green gas. And in addition to that you have to take another $5 million of investments that we make in primarily additional people in order to be able to increase our development business, whether its assets, for example, even the RNG assets we had in order to be able to execute on them, we need more development engineers, as well as more construction managers and so on. The same with battery storage. We had -- we brought a couple of people on. The same with micro-grids and so on. So we got to take eight -- we started and I will say it and they're probably $8 million from last year to this year.

Mark Chiplock -- Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer

Yeah. And I would say...

Noah Kaye -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

Yeah. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Mark.

Mark Chiplock -- Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer

Yeah. So I was just gonna add, I think that the estimate, probably, Michigan a little high. We're probably looking at around $8 million total between the two incremental. Because remember the Michigan plant was running in the early part of year. It was ramping up through Q2 and then fully running in Q3 and Q4. So it's probably -- I think that estimate on that one particular plant is a little high and we're probably looking at something around $8 million between the two of those incrementally.

Noah Kaye -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

Yes. That's perfect. That's really where I was going with it. That we're getting about $8 million of benefit from the gas projects incremental. Sub out the $8 million that you called and then we're basically getting another $8 million of EBITDA growth on the remaining part of the business. Is that the right way to think about the growth?

Mark Chiplock -- Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer

That's probably a little bit less. I mean to the project mix -- again as we mentioned it, we expect a higher proportion of that is going to be at margin that are lower than our average. So again it's probably closer to $6 million on the project side just given the mix.

Noah Kaye -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

Okay. All right. So let me just ask you -- yeah, sorry, go ahead, George.

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

The margin, we -- we ended up last year over 22% gross profit margin and we estimated this year it would be closer to 20% to 21%. So we're losing well over a point there and that's substantial.

Noah Kaye -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

Yeah, yeah. Understood. Okay. Sorry, go ahead, George. Let me just switch gears for a second herein and talk about the project business. We just went through the longest federal government shut down in history. You had a strong quarter there in terms of the revenue and the performance. How does it impact the business and the business going forward?

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

This is a good thing about our business. As you know all these Federal ESPC contracts are funded through a third-party Bank of America whatever the case might be, Hannon Armstrong and so on. So the money goes into it an escrow account and then we as we build them out, we draw from that lines. So we had no interruptions though the government shutdown. It did not impact our project. And what the other thing that's helped there is the fact that we were doing the projects all of them in contraction there were for basis-in-basis, it was no impact on that. If for example, we were doing a GSA build-in and then it was not occupied during the time, I'm sure we wouldn't be able to do construction. So we didn't see any impact at all on the implementation side where we saw an impact was on executing a contract that was ready to be signed and there was nobody there to sign. So that got moved into this quarter. Other than that we didn't see any impact. We saw some impact on a local government elections. Switching a government in a particular state and the contract got shifted to this quarter from last year. So because the projects get funded through third-party financing then don't have to come up with the money, the bottom line is that, that helps our business model during commission.

Noah Kaye -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

Yeah. I mean, yeah, because that's something that I think we all wanted to understand because the fully contracted backlog is up very nicely. Year-over-year, but obviously did step down sequentially by a fair amount and the new contracts and awards were lighter than a year ago. So really the question is should we expect maybe an above-average kind of amount of bookings and contracts' conversion in 1Q relative to last year really due to the timing?

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

No. It's due to timing and it's the lumpiness. There's lumpiness from the awards but what is impacting a little bit the backlog is the fact that we shifted, the business model for more projects to more assets. And a good part for example, the Southwest region, we're transforming that unit for built-in assets for others built-in assets for us. So some of the awards that get shifted now into the assets in development, as we tried to retain them for our own balance sheet, we don't show them as projects anymore, we show them as assets in development. And that's why I will look at the total. That's why I started pointing out the assets in development because there is a shift in our business model and that impacts the project awards.

Mark Chiplock -- Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer

Yeah. The only thing on the awarded I mean the optics there with the year-over-year growth is small, but 2017 had some large awards. So I think it's a tough comp year-over-year, but we're continuing to back still with projects, we had over $700 million of new awards in the year, and we continue to see some song quoting activity in federal and C&I. So I think we feel pretty confident we'll continue to grow the backlog in order to meet our revenue goals going forward.

Noah Kaye -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst

Perfect. Thanks so much for taking the question.

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

Operator

Thank you. Your next question comes from Chip Moore with Canaccord. Your line is open.

Chip Moore -- Canaccord Genuity Limited -- Analyst

Hey, morning folks. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe we could talk a bit more about the solar-asset pipeline. How are things trending there? You did buy a firm in California during the quarter, what do they bring? You've had them for four months or so, what have you seen since you have acquired them?

George P. Sakellaris -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

They have a pretty good pipeline of 100 megawatts or so. It's only the two individuals. And part of the resources we are increasing the development capability of that group associated with engineers. And so far I think they haven't moved any projects to what I will call to-be-awarded category yet, but we contemplated that they will put some in service this year. And they're primarily focused in the central even though they're located in California. Our primary focus for that group is in the center. And that's why when I talked about transforming all the company to be able to compete in the new environment and part of the addition investments that we're making in resources, it has to do with that particular group as well as the Southwest in the Southeast.

Mark Chiplock -- Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer

And the East.

Chip Moore -- Canaccord Genuity Limited -- Analyst

Yes. No, absolutely. Understood. Thanks guys.

209,Empty,2019-02-28T18:36:00Z,"The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has given the UK a blunt message after British lawmakers voted for a plan that could result in a Brexit delay. Barnier called for decisions, rather than extra time.","Any delay to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union ""must serve not to put off the problem but to resolve the problem"" in the British parliament, EU negotiator Michel Barnier said Thursday.

""Today, above all we need decisions, much more than extra time,"" he added.

After a meeting with Barnier in Vienna, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said he would also like to see Brexit resolved before European elections in May. It would ""seem more than absurd"" for a country wanting to leave the bloc to be able to vote for its legislature, he said.

On Wednesday, more than 500 MPs in the 650-seat parliament backed a plan to vote on British Prime Minister's Brexit deal on March 12. If lawmakers reject the deal, the plan foresees another parliamentary vote on whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal or delay it's March 29 exit date.

UK approach

May has been struggling to gain enough support from hard-line pro-Brexit MPs within her Conservative Party and Northern Ireland's DUP party, which props up her government, for the existing withdrawal agreement.

Prime Minister Theresa May speaking in the House of Commons

In recent weeks, her government has tried to convince EU leaders to accept legal guarantees that would make the deal's so-called Irish backstop temporary. Critics fear the backstop could force the UK to follow EU rules indefinitely.

But EU leaders have repeatedly said they would not agree to any legal changes to the existing deal.

Barnier reiterated that position in Vienna, telling reporters that the EU was ""not going to reopen the withdrawal agreement.""

Another one bites the dust

On Thursday, George Eustice, a junior minister in the UK's agriculture ministry, resigned from his post in protest of May's three-step plan.

The decision to offer parliament the power to delay Brexit would ""lead to a sequence of events culminating in the EU dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country,"" he said.

This septic isle It never rains A delay by UK Prime Minister Theresa May to allow Parliament to vote on her Brexit deal has increased the chances Britain will leave the bloc without a deal in March. The odds on a no-deal Brexit have shortened to 2/1, according to oddschecker.com, while Steve Eisman, the trader whose prediction of the 2008 crisis was dramatized in the film The Big Short, is betting against UK banks.

This septic isle Money where your mouth is The IMF says that while some sectors like agriculture and mining might benefit, the majority of sectors would shrink by between about 1 percent and 33 percent. The Bank of England said no-deal would wipe between 4.75 percent and 7.75 percent off what the UK would have produced by 2024 and the pound would fall by 25 percent.

This septic isle Not waving, but drowning The EU has said the UK would have ""third country"" status under a no-deal scenario, giving it the same status as China, Russia and Pakistan. All goods crossing EU borders would be subject to tariffs of up to 38 percent. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said additional paperwork attached to trading under WTO rules would act as an extra tariff of up to an average of 6.5 percent.

This septic isle Love's labor lost Britain’s farmers and manufacturers face the largest shortage of skilled workers since 1989 due to a fall in the numbers of EU27 nationals coming to work since the Brexit vote. A no deal would likely accelerate that process.

This septic isle A road to nowhere The financial industry and British regulators say a hard Brexit poses a threat to trillions of euros worth of derivative and insurance contracts London could lose up to to €800 billion to Frankfurt, lobby group Frankfurt Main Finance has said. Some 30 banks and financial firms have already chosen the city as the site of their new EU headquarters, with others opting for Dublin or Paris.

This septic isle Movers and shakers left in limbo No-deal would have significant implications for people's ability to go where they want. A €7 charge for visiting the EU's Schengen Area would kick in in 2021, after the UK's transition period ends. British expats would face uncertainty, as many foreign governments have not yet established their rules for residency under no-deal.

This septic isle Can't beat a good queue The UK Road Haulage Association has said a lack of planning over no-deal would mean the manufacturing sector would be put under ""severe pressure"" and hauliers would go out of business. European airports have warned that no-deal would cause ""major disruption and heightened safety risks"" to the air network. Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary has warned planes could be grounded.

This septic isle All in it together The biggest impact of no deal could be felt in Ireland, which exports 12 percent of its goods and 40 percent of its food to the UK, and two-thirds of its other exports travel through the UK. The IMF believes the Netherlands, Denmark, the Czech Republic and Belgium also face taking moderate hits to their economies of between 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent.

This septic isle Where there is harmony, May brings discord The Police Federation has said it was worried about ""widescale disruption and dangers for the general public."" Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has said 3,500 troops are on standby to cope with the fallout of no deal. The government is preparing for potential shortages of key items in the wake of a no-deal Brexit. But May refused to guarantee the health service (NHS) would have enough medicines.

This septic isle Christmas-voting turkeys play chicken in Ireland The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would remain unresolved with no deal. The main sticking point has been the Irish 'backstop' — the insurance scheme for avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. One solution has been a Canada-style agreement that would remove most EU restrictions but would not abolish the need for a hard border. But uncertainty breeds fear. Author: Jo Harper



Meanwhile, the opposition Labour party has said it would put forward an amendment calling for a second EU referendum when the next ""meaningful vote"" is held. However, opposition to a second public vote within Labour and the Conservative Party makes its chances of success slim.

No-deal fears

With 29 days to go before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU, businesses are starting to scramble to prepare themselves for a potentially chaotic ""no-deal"" exit.

Drivers in the Republic of Ireland were told Thursday that they would need an insurance document to cross the border into Northern Ireland if both sides failed to reach a deal.

211,Empty,2019-02-26T23:06:07Z,A second-amendment concert venue and restaurant. Japanese cryptocurrency start-up. Right-wing European political parties. Meet the sponsors for CPAC 2019. The post A guide to CPAC’s sponsors: from a Japanese cryptocurrency startup to the NRA appeared first on…,"

As the 45th Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, begins Wednesday, a look at the event’s sponsors shows a collection of outside spending groups, prominent conservative activist organizations, think tanks and media outlets.

A who’s-who of conservative money networks, many sponsors are promoted in CPAC’s’ panels and events, and often onstage rubbing elbows with the influencers currently driving grassroots conservative politics.

CPAC touts itself as “the birthplace of modern conservatism,” and has long been observed for the pulse of the conservative movement. President Donald Trump’s appearances at the event before his presidential bid have been credited by some for raising his profile among movement conservatives in the years before the 2016 Republican primary.

Behind CPAC is the American Conservative Union a conservative lobbying organization and outside spending group which organizes the event. In the last election cycle, ACU spent $258,000 in support of Republican candidates, according to data tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics.

2018 was ACU’s biggest year for lobbying since 2005. Last year the group spent $540,000 on lobbying, advocating for bills ranging from net neutrality, pro-sugar industry regulation, budget cuts and sentencing reform.

ACU’s going rate for a sponsorship buy-in at CPAC costs thousands of dollars. The lowest level of sponsorship, a “participating sponsor,” costs $7,000, with the highest level, a “platinum sponsor,” running at $250,000.

Sponsorship not only buys organizations extensive promotion at the event, but many sponsors have their own panels, speakers and events at CPAC. As one “ACU insider” told the Daily Beast last year: “That’s one of the bigger benefits of sponsorship… the higher you sponsor, the higher the chances your speaker and your panel topic will happen at CPAC.”

Yet the subject of panels and events is reached through “consensus” by CPAC’s organizers and not by sponsors, according to Ian Walters, ACU’s communications director. Planning committees in the run-up to the event, which can include people affiliated with sponsors, plan the event’s schedule before sponsors are ultimately decided, Walters said. He added that it would be inaccurate to say sponsors have any limiting influence on potential events or panels.

“It’s about as public and transparent a process as there can be,” Walters said.

This year, CPAC has two “platinum sponsors” spending $250,000. One is Liberty HealthShare, a health care cost-sharing company. The other is Dragging Canoe – Pigeon Forge.

Dragging Canoe is the only sponsor without a hyperlink to its website on CPAC’s sponsors page. It is an upcoming “a second-amendment themed entertainment venue and restaurant in Pigeon Forge” slated to open in 2020, according to Walters. CPAC was approached by Dragging Canoe’s owners last year for a potential sponsorship.

Google searches provide no information about the company. A Dragging Canoe, LLC was registered as a business with the Tennessee Secretary of State last November and lists a for-sale empty building in Maryville, Tennessee as its address. Despite being an up-and-coming business, Dragging Canoe is sponsoring CPAC’s $250 a ticket “Ronald Reagan Dinner and Reception” on Friday night.

The next level of sponsorship at CPAC, “presenting sponsors” who spent $125,000, include the National Rifle Association, the GOP, and Liberty, a Japanese cryptocurrency start-up.

The event, in turn, has multiple panels on the second amendment and gun control, including a speech by NRA president and Iran-Contra figure Lt. Col. Oliver North. The co-founder of Liberty, Jikido “Jay” Aeba of the Japanese Conservative Union, will participate in a panel about cryptocurrency.

While not all events and speakers represent sponsors, those that do have extensive real estate in CPAC’s agenda. The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank, spent $60,000 to sponsor the event. A number of Heritage Foundation staff are to appear on stage throughout the week, and the think tank will host events on censorship of conservatives and election security.

The Center for Security Policy, another think tank and longtime sponsor, spent $12,000 to sponsor CPAC this year. CSP has long been criticized as Islamophobic, and has promulgated conspiracy theories about Muslims, including an impending Sharia take-over of the United States and the infiltration of the U.S. government by the Muslim Brotherhood.

CPS is sponsoring multiple events at CPAC, including an event moderated by National Security Advisor John Bolton’s former chief of staff on “Why Anti-Zionism is a Form of Anti-Semitism and a Threat to National Security.” Frank Gaffney Jr., the controversial founder of CPS, will moderate his own event on CPAC about the persecution of Christians around the world.

Another major sponsor of CPAC is the Heartland Institute, a free-market think tank and previous sponsor. The Heartland Institute has positioned itself as a leading critic of climate science for many years, and has coordinated with the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency to promote views denying climate change. As a $28,000-sponsor, Heartland is present throughout CPAC’s agenda. Its CEO has a stand-alone speech on Friday afternoon, and the group is sponsoring an event on “AOC’s Green New Deal: Debunking the Climate Alarmism Behind Bringing Full Socialism to America.”

Another CPAC sponsor is the Alliance of Conservative and Reformists in Europe, or ACRE, which represents the third-largest political party in the European Parliament. While ACRE includes member parties outside of Europe like the GOP, the conservative party of Canada and Likud in Israel, it has within its parliamentary ranks the controversial far-right parties of Poland, Italy, Denmark and Bulgaria.

ACRE will host an event at CPAC on “Building a Stronger Transatlantic Security and Defense Cooperation” featuring the Polish ambassador to the United States.

There are other ties to the European right-wing at CPAC. Italian lawmaker Giorgia Meloni, an ally of Matteo Salvini, Italy’s controversial deputy prime minister, will appear on a panel with ACU board member José Cárdenas and Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) on “Democracy Breaking through Darkness: Can Europe and Venezuela be Liberated?”

Though not listed as an official sponsor, Heritage Action for America, a lobbying organization and outside spending group, has a number of sponsored events throughout CPAC’s agenda. Heritage Action for America spent nearly $2 million supporting Republican candidates in the last-election cycle.

Reporters for conservative media outlets who paid thousands of dollars to sponsor CPAC are also featured prominently throughout the event’s agenda.

The Washington Times, which spent $60,000 to sponsor the event, has 6 of its reporters appearing on-stage. The Daily Caller, a participating sponsor, has four reporters featured at CPAC, one of whom publicly apologized earlier this month for racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic old tweets.

As CPAC commences, it remains at the intersection of grassroots conservatism and big-money influence. The event too remains a prominent spot for GOP officialdom, shown by its upcoming appearances by numerous Republican lawmakers as well as President Trump.",A guide to CPAC’s sponsors: from a Japanese cryptocurrency startup to the NRA,Opensecrets.org,https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2019/02/a-guide-to-cpacs-sponsors-from-a-japanese-cryptocurrency-startup-to-the-nra/
212,Empty,2019-03-07T00:03:14Z,The whole point of empowering women is to disrupt the status quo. So why are the Trudeau Liberals so stunned that it has happened?,"What did Justin Trudeau expect when he appointed a gender-balanced cabinet? That it would be business as usual? He was wrong.

And what’s worse is that the prime minister, his officials and others in Ottawa’s inner circle now reeling from the high-profile resignations of two female cabinet ministers, appear stunned by that realization.

International Women’s Day is on Friday and, ironically, the theme is: The better the balance, the better the world. Right now, with the Liberals in free fall, Trudeau and some in his party probably don’t see it that way.

With 2030 as a goal to reach gender equality, the United Nations has noted that disrupting business as usual is “central to removing structural barriers and ensuring that no woman and no girl is left behind.”

Disruption is at the heart of the drama playing out in Ottawa.

Both Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott were very clear about their reasons for resigning. It’s not because of hurt feelings. It isn’t because they didn’t get their own way and they left in a huff.

Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney-general, gave cogent testimony and a detailed chronology about meetings, texts and conversations that followed her decision to prosecute SNC-Lavalin for corruption rather than proceed with a deferred prosecution arbitration.

She testified that Trudeau, his staff, deputy ministers, the clerk of the Privy Council and others continued to press her to change her mind.

They did so even though by convention and by law, the attorney-general has the sole responsibility to make decisions about prosecutions. And, with this particular law, the attorney-general is specifically forbidden to consider political and economic factors.

When Trudeau’s former chief of staff, Gerald Butts, testified Wednesday before the justice committee, he denied any inappropriate pressure was applied and insisted that Wilson-Raybould had been repeatedly told that the decision was “hers alone.”

But he added, “I am fully aware that two people can experience the same event differently.”

Perception matters in politics more so than in most arenas, and what was striking about Butts’ appearance before the committee was his tone, which contrasted sharply with Wilson-Raybould’s measured responses.

As a First Nations woman from B.C., Wilson-Raybould is a triple outsider in a country long dominated by men schooled in Central Canada.

Butts inadvertently underscored that point with his clubby tone at the justice committee hearing. He responded to Conservative Lisa Raitt’s question by first noting they were both born in Cape Breton. He attempted to disarm the NDP’s Murray Rankin with flattery.

Butts even slipped in details of his personal relationship with Wilson-Raybould, including that she and her husband had dined at his home and that he, his wife and children had enjoyed their company, while he was deflecting questions about whether the former attorney-general had lied to the committee.

The government’s response to the issues raised about prosecutorial independence and the rule of law as well as Wilson-Raybould’s treatment were the reasons Philpott gave when she resigned this week.

She wrote that, “There can be a cost to acting on one’s principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.”

Too often the men that these two cabinet ministers have left behind have sounded like school boys.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau suggested Philpott was motivated by friendship. Jati Sidhu, the Liberal MP for Mission-Matsqui-Fraser Canyon, suggested Wilson-Raybould’s father was “pulling the strings.” Sidhu later apologized.

Of course, it’s not only men who struggle with the tectonic shifts taking place.

Reporters sought out Wilson-Raybould’s father for comment. But there is no indication that they tried to find out what Margaret Trudeau thought about her son’s performance.

Sheila Copps, who was deputy prime minister in the Liberal government of the 1990s, said Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have created victim narratives for themselves and described them as neophytes who don’t understand how politics works.

But Copps is wrong on both counts.

In the #MeToo #TimesUp #BelieveWomen era, they have joined the swelling ranks.

As for politics, Wilson-Raybould and Philpott understand how it works, and they don’t like it.

Nor do most Canadians, according to the latest polls.

It may not yet be too late for the Liberals to recover before the Oct. 21 election. But it will require a great deal of humility.

Trudeau needs to apologize first to Wilson-Raybould. Maybe she didn’t take her concerns to him as quickly as she should have. Maybe she didn’t tell him and his office on the date that the SNC-Lavalin decision was made and communicated to the company.

But, according to Butts’ testimony, they were never going to stop pressing for a deferred prosecution until the day that the criminal case begins. Proving that the government now knows where the line is may be more difficult.

Trudeau also needs to apologize for breaking his promise to be more transparent and more responsive to ordinary Canadians than to interest groups.

He needs to show more respect for diversity and an understanding that it means more than having different faces in the background.

Finally, he might want to walk back his feminist claim and turn to others who can give him and those around him some guidance on how to act like one because there is no “business as usual” any more. And, to paraphrase Martha Stewart, that may be a good thing.

213,Empty,2019-02-28T03:21:25Z,"'It's been a long time since we've seen any politician open up honestly, show integrity, tell the truth, without any fear.'","Jody Wilson-Raybould is being hailed for her courage by some B.C. voters and politicians who followed her stunning testimony on Wednesday.

At a hearing of the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould described a “consistent and sustained effort” to prevent construction giant SNC-Lavalin from being prosecuted in a bribery case. The former justice minister accused senior ranks of the federal government, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, of targeting her with “veiled threats” as they tried to interfere.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called for Trudeau’s resignation, while Green party Leader Elizabeth May and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said they want a public inquiry into the allegations. Trudeau said Wednesday evening that he “completely” disagreed with Wilson-Raybould’s characterization of the events.

While Wilson-Raybould’s fellow Liberal members of parliament deferred to Trudeau, others said they believed her and offered her praise.

“I think she’s a hero,” said Peter Julian, NDP MP for New Westminster–Burnaby.

Julian said he was dismayed by Trudeau and his government’s alleged conduct, and said he believes Wilson-Raybould lost her job as justice minister as a direct result of her standing up for the integrity of Canada’s court system.

“I think she’s very courageous,” Julian said. “Pressure was put on her. She talked about veiled threats and consequences being repeatedly expressed to her.”

The testimony itself was unlike anything he has seen in his decades in Canadian politics, he added.

“I think it should raise flags for all Canadians about how this prime minister and how this government deals with fundamental issues of principals and our court system, and all the principals that, I think, for so many Canadians they hold dear,” he said.

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s victory in the federal Burnaby-South byelection, the NDP government’s response to threatened school closures in Vancouver, the latest in the legislature spending scandal and the province’s response to a measles outbreak.

Dan Albas, Conservative MP for Central Okanagan–Similkameen–Nicola, said he found Wilson-Raybould’s testimony detailed, specific and explosive. He was stunned when she described the pressure she had been put under.

“The prime minister, by the very act of the allegations and subsequent coverup, has lost the moral authority to lead this country,” Albas said.

“It’s the right of every Canadian to have equality under the law and Mr. Trudeau, by trying to grant a favour to friends in this company, jeopardized that by intervening in what is supposed to be an independent prosecution.”

Albas said Wilson-Raybould was in a cabinet position for good reason, and took the role seriously under intense pressure.

“The litany of people that put pressure on her is breathtaking, based on her testimony,” said Jenny Kwan, NDP MP for Vancouver East. “The prime minister maintained and continues to maintain that there was no inappropriate pressure put on Ms. Wilson-Raybould but clearly, based on her account, the pressure was there to see.”

Kwan, whose riding borders Wilson-Raybould’s in Vancouver Granville, said she often sees the former justice minister at public events. She admires the courage it has taken her to testify, she said.

“I’ve always had a lot of respect for Ms. Wilson-Raybould, even though we are on different sides of the political spectrum,” Kwan said. “This situation really has just reinforced that for me.”

Green Leader May, who is MP for Saanich–Gulf Islands, said that while Wilson-Raybould was constrained in what she could say by solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentially requirements, “she was entirely credible, she was so impressive and displayed such integrity.”

Wilson-Raybould made it clear that she had been subjected to a pattern of inappropriate pressure from politicians and, what May found most shocking, from the civil service, she said.

“What Jody Wilson-Raybould revealed today, Canadians would be forgiven for having this shake their confidence in our institutions,” May said. “To serve the interests of SNC-Lavalin over the interests of Canadians institutions and our constitution is deeply, deeply troubling.”

Mira Oreck, director of stakeholder relations for B.C. Premier John Horgan, ran against Wilson-Raybould in the Vancouver Granville riding in 2015. She declined to be interviewed but said she stood by a message she posted Wednesday on Twitter.

“The calm, strength and clarity of @Puglaas in this testimony is stunning and inspiring,” Oreck wrote, referring to Wilson-Raybould’s Twitter handle, Puglaas, which means “woman born to noble people” in the Kwak’wala language.

Wednesday morning at Wilson-Raybould’s Vancouver constituency office, staff didn’t want to comment ahead of her testimony but said they planned to watch it live in the office’s small lobby.

Dozens of passersby, asked whether they were following the testimony, said they were not keeping a close eye on federal politics. Some said they were preoccupied by events in the U.S., particularly the bombshell testimony of Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer.

But a few said they either looked forward to reviewing Wilson-Raybould’s testimony later in the day, or had been tuning into broadcasts as often as possible.

“I was so impressed,” said Alan Rees, 77, of Richmond. “If anybody wants to know why there is such a disdain for politicians, I think this illustrated it. It’s been a long time since we’ve seen any politician open up honestly, show integrity, tell the truth, without any fear. A lifelong conservative may just change his mind.”

Rees lamented that any action on her testimony might be delayed by the federal election on Oct. 21, 2019. But how it is handled will show to the world what democracy means in Canada, he added.

“What should happen is a few people should be smacked on the knuckles and maybe fined, and perhaps even go to jail,” he said.

Scott Girling, 57, from South Surrey, said he was disappointed with the federal government, its “silence” and Trudeau’s attitude toward the situation.

“I just wanted her to be able to tell her story, tell the truth, whatever that is,” he said. “I’m sure people will be scrambling to try to save their name or the jobs, or save face for the particular party that they’re with.”

Barbara Onneken, 62, from Maple Ridge, said she wasn’t surprised by what Wilson-Raybould said in her testimony.

“We expected that and we’re really happy that she did get to speak, because it is her right to speak,” she said.

“He (Trudeau) needs to come clean.”

The Vancouver Granville Liberal riding association could not be reached for comment.

University of the Fraser Valley political scientist Hamish Telford told Postmedia News that he watched Wilson-Raybould’s testimony in class with students.

“My students thought that this would be damaging to the prime minister. That it’s hard to deny that there was a far amount of pressure being applied.”

Telford said Wilson-Raybould had indicated she would run again in her riding of Vancouver Granville in the October election.

“We think as a Liberal, but we aren’t entirely sure about that,” he said.

He said that the one important thing that Wilson-Raybould did not reveal was why it was decided in September that that the bribery charges against SNC Lavalin should go to criminal prosecution and not be dealt with through a remediation process as the prime minister apparently wanted.

The post Most Canadians don’t want to spend $1 trillion to buy U.S. state of Montana appeared first on Vancouver Is Awesome.","We have all been exposed to online petitions in the past few years, but one that caught the eye of the media on both sides of the 49th parallel this month was unique. Someone identified as Ian Hammond is suggesting that the state of Montana should be sold to Canada for US$1 trillion.

The petition alleges that the money that Canada would pay for what is colloquially known as Big Sky Country would be used to eliminate America’s national debt. While US$1 trillion is a considerable amount of money, the United States would be required to sell 21 more states at the same price to actually erase its national debt, calculated late last year a US$21.97 trillion.

In any case, the idea has provided plenty of fodder for the media. At the time of this writing, more than 16,000 people have added their names to the petition. Research Co. asked Canadians about it last week. Across the country, a majority of respondents (56%) disagreed with the notion of purchasing Montana, but almost three in 10 (28%) were ready to welcome an American state into Confederation.

Canadian men are more likely to support the purchase than women (32% to 24% respectively). On a regional basis, residents of Alberta boasted the highest level of support for a “Canadian Montana” at 37%, followed closely by Saskatchewan and Manitoba at 34%.

There was little fluctuation across party lines, with very similar proportions of Canadians who voted Conservative (30%), Liberal (28%) and New Democratic (26%) in the 2015 federal election saying Canada should buy Montana.

The biggest variation is observed on age. Just 21% of Canadians aged 55 and over and 28% of those aged 35-to-54 would consent to the Montana purchase. But the proportion jumps dramatically among those aged 18 to 34 to 41%.

Montana borders three Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. Its main economic activities are agriculture and ranching, which may suggest a perfect extension of Alberta into the south. However, Montana is landlocked, so its acquisition would not facilitate the process of getting Alberta’s oil to Asian markets, unless a pipeline somehow turned westward into Idaho and Oregon.

In some respects, Canada would be adding a distinctly multicultural province. Montana’s state motto, “Oro y Plata,” (“Silver and Gold”) is the only one in the entire United States to be penned in Spanish, instead of the most habitual Latin or English. The motto also enshrines the importance of mining, at a time when resource development projects have become more controversial than ever in Western Canada.

Montana’s state animal is the grizzly bear, the same species that was recently protected by the British Columbia government in the form of an extremely popular ban on trophy hunting. If Montana became a province, Canada would get a piece of the coveted Yellowstone National Park, as well as the second-largest ski resort in the United States – Big Sky.

There are also implications in the world of sport. Welcoming Montana into Confederation might help bring about tax incentives to refurbish the Centennial Ice Arena in Billings, in the hopes of bringing an eighth National Hockey League (NHL) team to Canada. Montana’s residents pay no sales tax, but that would change after the purchase. This should prompt the ownership group to christen the NHL franchise as the “GST Billings.”

The population of Montana is similar to those of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, so both should serve as starting points to figure out how to establish a legislature for the newest Canadian province. Saskatchewan’s legislative assembly has 61 seats, and Manitoba’s has 57. Let’s split the difference and award Montana a legislature with 59 members.

At this time, Montana has 100 members in the state House of Representatives and 50 in the state Senate. A process of primaries would reduce those 150 state lawmakers to 59, and a test would transfer existing Democrats and Republicans into Canada’s more traditional political parties.

Montana’s three representatives in the U.S. Congress – two senators and one congressman—would be immediately appointed to the Canadian Senate. If we allocate Montana the same six seats that other western provinces have in the Red Chamber, that leaves us with three vacancies.

Let’s take two nominees from the realm of entertainment. Missoula-born filmmaker David Lynch and actor Dana Carvey would be wonderful additions to the upper house. We could even find a way for Mike Myers to preside their citizenship ceremony.

The final Senate nominee from Montana is Phil Jackson, who coached teams to 11 National Basketball Association titles. We not only gain a capable negotiator, but an ideal option to coach Canada’s basketball team in the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics.

Unfortunately, Canadians rejected the purchase by a two-to-one margin. But we still can ponder what could be.",Most Canadians don’t want to spend $1 trillion to buy U.S. state of Montana,Vancouverisawesome.com,https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/02/28/canadians-dont-want-1trillion-purchase-montana-us-state/
215,Empty,2019-02-25T11:00:00Z,There’s a high level of optimism in all camps about Monday's federal byelection in which five candidates are vying to replace Peter Van Loan as the new MP for the York-Simcoe riding.,"Monday's byelection in the York-Simcoe riding will see the People's Party of Canada (PPC) and Conservatives squaring off in a Tory-held riding for the very first time.

Nine candidates are vying to replace Peter Van Loan as the new federal Member of Parliament for the riding and all eyes will be on the PPC to see how many votes they take away from the Conservatives, and whether it would be enough to tip the riding toward the Liberals or NDP.

Van Loan, a member of the Conservative Party, announced his retirement in September after 14 years as the representative of the riding — long considered a Tory stronghold.

Scot Davidson, the new Conservative Party candidate, said he's feeling confident.

""This is really a referendum on the Liberal government,"" said Davidson, a local entrepreneur from the town of Georgina.

Today, byelections will be held in ridings across the country including York–Simcoe in Ontario, Outremont in Quebec and Burnaby South in B.C. (CBC)

The York-Simcoe riding was one of three federal byelections called by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Jan. 9.

Davidson has positioned himself as a businessman looking to apply his skills in helping industries grow, with a keen interest in supporting agriculture.

""Let's face it, this riding being so close to Toronto is a place where farmers themselves want to expand and look at even food processing. It's something that I can bring to the table and help facilitate,"" Davidson said.

He says he's not worried about being new to politics but rather sees it as an asset, insisting that he has ""young legs, I'm ready to run.""

Liberal candidate Shaun Tanaka went head-to-head against Van Loan in the last federal election but fell short.

This time, the mother of two says she's back and has a better chance than ever.

""We increased the Liberal voter turnout by 400 per cent,"" she told CBC News, referring to the last federal election.

""When I asked the family whether I should take this on again because it's a big ask of the entire family, the boys said to me, 'You totally should, because this time you're going to win.'""

Shaun Tanaka is hopeful the headway she made in 2015's federal election will result in a Liberal upset this time around. (CBC)

Tanaka said she isn't worried about the SNC Lavalin scandal currently plaguing the prime minister.

""I am really focused on York-Simcoe, because that's where I'm running. And I'm not hearing it at the doors,"" she said.

""What I'm hearing at the doors [is] that it's hard to raise a family. I'm hearing at the doors that they are concerned about the health of Lake Simcoe,"" said Tanaka, adding that ""I want to be that voice in Ottawa.""

NDP candidate Jessa McLean says she can be the voice of the local working class who are struggling. (Jessa McLean)

NDP candidate Jessa McLean says she's the voice of the working class.

""We have a lot of precariously employed people,"" she said. ""Our job market is, either you're commuting [to the city] for a half decent paying job or you're staying here and earning very little.""

She's a community organizer in the region and a champion of the ""$15 and Fairness"" campaign to push the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

""Our housing rates have gone up the most in terms of Ontario,"" she said.

""Rentals are up 56 per cent while our wages are only up 11 per cent.""

People's Party of Canada debut

This byelection is also the PPC's debut at the polls, and an out-of-towner — ex-Toronto prosecutor Robert Geurts — is its candidate.

""The project right now is to get the word out. We are a national party,"" he said.

Robert Geurts of the People's Party of Canada says a lot of this campaign has to do with spreading the word of the new party's existence. (CBC News)

Ex-conservative MP Maxime Bernier founded the party after losing the federal Conservative leadership nod to Andrew Scheer.

""Scot Davidson has no plan really to change anything. He's going to stick to Mr. Scheer's plan,"" said Geurts, explaining their focus on courting millennial voters.

""That generation is so bright, and so exciting. [They] haven't been corrupted yet,"" he said.

""That's where I think Bernier has sort of said, 'Listen, our platform is unfinished because there's some really exciting things we can do if we don't burden ourselves with the old baggage of before.""'

Monday's byelection comes three months after municipal elections and six months before the federal election in October.

If you go into a Reform or Conservative temple, it’s likely that you will notice two things: The congregation is becoming smaller and older. Across the United States and Europe, Jewish congregations are aging at a rapid rate, a phenomenon increasingly common for mainstream religions across the high-income world.

Overall, the American Jewish population—unlike that of demographically robust Israel—is on the decline, with a loss of 300,000 members over the past decade, a number expected to drop further by 2050. The median age of members of Reform congregations is 54, and only 17 percent of members say they attend religious services even once a month. Four-fifths of the movement’s youth are gone by the time they graduate high school. The conservative movement is, if anything, in even worse shape: At its height, in 1965, the Conservative movement had 800 affiliated synagogues throughout the United States and Canada; by 2015 that number had fallen to 594.

But Jews, and their religious institutions, should not feel singled out. The share of Americans who belong to the Catholic Church has declined from 24 percent in 2007 to 21 percent in 2014, a more rapid decline according to Pew, then any other religious organization in memory. There are 6.5 former Catholics in the U.S. for every new convert to the faith, not a number suggesting a very sunny future.

The mainstream Protestant churches are not exactly filling the sanctuaries either. Some, like the internally conflicted Methodists have seen their number of North American congregants drop from 15 million in 1970 to barely half that today. Since 2007 alone, America’s mainstream churches have lost 5 million members, and even the once vibrant evangelical movement is losing adherents outside of the developing world. Ever more churches, particularly in urban areas, are being abandoned, turned into bars, restaurants, and luxury condos. And nothing augurs worse for the future than the fact that American millennials are leaving religious institutions at a rate four times that of their counterparts three decades ago; almost 40 percent of people 18 to 29 are not unaffiliated.

This decline is not necessarily a reflection of less spiritual feeling: Two-thirds of unaffiliated Americans still believe in God or a universal spirit. The Pew poll shows that since 2012, the share of Americans who describe themselves as “spiritual but not religious” has surged from 19 percent to 27 percent five years later.

Why, then, the decline in religion? For one thing, young Americans have different habits. Rather than join institutions, millennials, argued Wade Clark Roof, author of the book Spiritual Marketplace, are indulging in a kind of “grazing,” finding their spiritual fixes in various different places rather than any one organized church. As sociologists Robert Putnam and David Campbell explained, those in this age group “reject conventional religious affiliation, while not entirely giving up their religious feelings.”

But the consumption habits of the young aren’t the only reason for America’s religious drought. Religious institutions and ideas are currently under political attack, predominantly from the left, with some progressives, such as California’s Dianne Feinstein or New Jersey’s Cory Booker, appearing to see embrace of Christian dogma, or even membership in such anodyne organizations as the Knights of Columbus, as cause for exclusion from high judicial office.

This trend is reinforced by the media , which is often dismissive of traditional faith. There has been a powerful tendency to demonize and suggest the worst of motives among the faithful, which was evident in the rush to judgment about the alleged racism of the Covington, Kentucky, religious students. Before the facts proved claims of racism to be false, newspaper accounts and tweets from journalists endorsed actions against the students, sometime including violence, in ways more reminiscent of Joseph Goebbels than Joseph Pulitzer.

As in many cases, this bias reflects the groupthink nurtured at our leading universities. Evangelicals and religious conservatives barely exist in the country’s leading theological seminaries, where they are outnumbered, by some estimates, 70 to 1 by liberals, and evidence suggests that those espousing traditional religious views are widely discriminated against in academic departments.

In this difficult environment, many religious movements—Reform Judaism, mainstream Protestantism, and increasingly the Catholic Church under Pope Francis—have sought to redefine themselves largely as instruments of social justice. Although doing good deeds, or mitzvot, long has constituted a strong element in most religions, the primary motivation of the faith community traditionally focused on heritage, spirituality, and family. In their haste to be politically correct, even Catholic private schools such as Notre Dame are rushing to cover up murals of Columbus, and, in one California case, a private Catholic grammar school has gone as far as hiding statues of saints.

Yet rebranding themselves as progressive often brings religious activists into alliances with people who reject their core values. The Catholic left, for example, allying itself with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, implicitly embraces the advocates of the most extreme abortion liberalization. Sometimes, these linkages are ironic: Faith in Public Life, for example, a strident “religious” group advocating a progressive anti-Trump line, gets much of its funding from George Soros, arguably the world’s most well-heeled and active promoter of atheism.

For their part, progressive Jews, embracing the notion of tikkun olam, face a similar dilemma. In their rush to oppose President Trump, with his occasional despicable winks at alt-right groups, many Jewish activists have collaborated with the organizers of the Women’s March, including enthusiastic backers of the most influential anti-Semite of our time, Nation of Islam head Louis Farrakhan.

Deep blue cities and the progressive feeding lots of the academy—strongholds of progressivism—are precisely where support for such anti-Jewish measures as the BDS movement is strongest. Anti-Semitism is particularly rife not in conservative Southern schools but in progressive places like San Francisco State; in that city, the ultimate progressive stronghold, a leftist gay Jewish café owner recently has been subject to repeated protests for being a “Zionist gentrifier.”

This alliance with anti-Semites and those opposing the existence of the state of Israel pushes the limits of cognitive dissonance. Jews in the U.K. are confronted with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who defends not only anti-Zionist but also traditional anti-Semitic tropes. Recently progressive heartthrob Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, herself an adopter of anti-Israel memes about Gaza and other occupied areas, gushed over her recent “lovely and wide-reaching” conversation with Corbyn, the West’s most politically prominent Judeophobe.

Indeed, despite the impression left by some progressive Jews, the largest threat to Jews in America stems not from the isolated and pathetically small lunatic fringe of white supremacists. The most anti-Israel members of Congress , as well as on the local level , come primarily not from the right wing of the GOP but the burgeoning left wing of the Democratic Party. Democratic voters—as well as key constituencies like minorities and millennials—poll consistently less sympathetic to both Jews and Israel than older, generally white Republicans.

Is there a way back from this sorry state of affairs?

However satisfying to its practitioners, the emphasis on social justice is clearly not attracting more worshippers. Almost all the religious institutions most committed to this course are also in the most serious decline, most notably mainstream Protestants but also, Catholics and Reform and Conservative Jews. The rapidly declining Church of England, which is down to 2 percent share among British youth, is burnishing its progressive image by adding the use of plastics to its list of Lenten sacrifices, but seems unable to serve the basic spiritual and family needs of their congregants.

In contrast, more conservative faith organizations generally enjoy better growth, and higher birthrates, particularly in the developing world . The University of London’s Eric Kaufmann explains in his important book Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth? that if current trends continue, the more fundamentalist family-centered faiths seem most likely to survive. Already, for example, Orthodox Jews, historically a small subgroup, are projected to become the majority of the Hebraic community in Britain by 2100, and already constitute some three-fifths of Jewish children in New York.

Orthodox Jews and evangelicals may be finding common ground, then, but the future of religion overall does not seem a bright one. It’s hard to imagine most young Jews becoming Orthodox, or casual Christians embracing en masse Mormonism or evangelical Christianity. Instead, the future seems to point to a smaller, more conservative religious community, isolated amidst an increasingly secularized culture.

To survive, less traditionalist faiths need less “virtue signaling” and more emphasis on serving the needs of congregants. Marshall Toplansky, who advises Church World Services, a major Protestant aid group, suggested that groups like Mormons and evangelicals who focus on providing services for families and their local communities fare far better than those more tied to strictly a social gospel. Toplansky said that many mainstream churches “have overlooked the value of building grassroots relationships with their donors,” who sometimes do not share the progressive ideology of the clerical class. Without engaging the faithful and addressing their needs, he noted, “people stop identifying with their local institution and stop participating in the local activities that defined them to begin with.”

Catholicism, now under a reforming and politically progressive pope, faces a similar challenge. It is losing adherents, not only in North America and Europe, where his views are popular, but also his homeland of South America, where the church is steadily losing out to more conservative evangelical churches. Until the 1960s, at least 90 percent of Latin America’s population was Catholic, but that number has fallen to under 70 percent. Today, roughly 1 in 4 Nicaraguans, 1 in 5 Brazilians and 1 in 7 Venezuelans are former Catholics. The one place where the church is growing most, Africa, is dominated by conservative bishops often at odds with Francis.

Anthony Lemus, an influential lay Catholic, believes the church’s future relies on remaining true to its principles while refashioning its message to serve its adherents’ worldly, as well as spiritual, needs. An astrophysicist brought up in a deeply Catholic East Los Angeles household, Lemus is working with a prominent Catholic theologian, Rev. Robert Spitzer, on rewriting of the Catholic Catechism to make the faith more accessible to the new generation. He also supports efforts to improve services from the church—day care, athletic clubs, camps—that might attract young families back to the faith.

“Today’s generation is more in tune with value-add products and services influencing their lives immediately, and the relevance of faith competes with these promotions,” he said. “A ‘sticky’ rebranding of the importance of faith formation’s value in everyday life is key to reposition its importance for living a holistic life.”

Ultimately, as Lemus suggested, religions, including Judaism, can only hope to thrive if they serve a purpose that is not met elsewhere in society. It is all well and good to perform good deeds, but if religions do not make themselves indispensable to families, their future could be bleak. As we already see in Europe, churches and synagogues could become ever more like pagan temples, vestiges of the past and attractions for the curious, profoundly clueless about the passion and commitment that created them.

But instead, from the mid-2000s onward, the leftward flank of the Democratic Party looked at the country’s changing demographics and growing social liberalism and decided that Clinton’s compromises with cultural conservatism weren’t as politically necessary as they had been (which was true), and that therefore they were free to become increasingly ideologically maximalist on everything touching gender or race or sexuality or immigration (which was … not true).

In this sense the story of the Democrats’ struggles over the last 15 years is a story of a party that has consistently moved leftward faster than the also-changing country, and consistently overread victories — on same-sex marriage above all — as a template for how every cultural battle should play out. It’s a story of a new feminism that’s pushing the party ever-further from the center on abortion, of a new cohort of white liberals who are actually to the left of many African-Americans on racial issues, of an activist base that brands positions that many liberals held only yesterday as not only mistaken but bigoted or racist or beyond-the-pale.

And in this part of the Democratic coalition’s story, the center-left’s role has been extraordinarily passive, essentially following the cultural left a tiny bit more slowly rather than trying to devise a more moderate approach. You can find hints of what such a moderate approach might look like in intellectual projects like Jonathan Haidt’s Heterodox Academy, or in the probing, evenhanded culture-war reportage of the magazine writer Jesse Singal (whom I hesitate to even praise because it will do him no favors on the internet). But that cultural moderation has no substantial political form, no important champions within the Democratic Party. It has Joe Manchin and Tulsi Gabbard, maybe, but they are eccentric figures; elsewhere among the Democrats there is little interest in considering all the different ways that cultural extremism costs them votes.

Which means that if the center-left abdicates, DeLong-style, on economic policy, the Democratic Party as a whole will have moved to the left on every front, writing off not only the possibility of compromising with Republican politicians (which, for now, might be understandable) but also the possibility of winning over voters who would almost certainly be Democrats if the party still occupied the cultural terrain that it held in 2000 or even as late as 2008.

Because the country as a whole has also shifted left since 2000, that kind of writing-off will not prevent the Democrats from winning elections; it probably won’t prevent them from beating Donald Trump. But it will stand in the way of any dramatic left-of-center consolidation, any kind of more-than-temporary Democratic governance. And if the center-left feels itself irrelevant in an age of socialist ambition, then taking up the task of rebuilding a cultural center, and a Democratic Party capable of claiming it, seems like the task that might actually be suited to the times.

Sadly the rest of the DeLong thread didn’t take up that possibility. It degenerated, instead, into a howl against Republican fascism and a post-Protestant sermon about how liberal America can build the true and only heaven, the real shining city on the hill.

Which suggests that to reckon with the possibility that making liberalism a pseudo-church might be a problem, not an aspiration, we need a very different center-left from the one surrendering today.",What’s Left of the Center-Left?,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/opinion/democrats-liberals-socialists-cultural-left.html

Mr. Penn added, “Despite my misgivings about the Mueller investigation, let me be clear as a lifelong Democrat under no circumstances would I work paid or unpaid for President Trump nor was this meeting about that in any way.”

Reached late Friday night, however, Mr. Stein said he invited Mr. Penn to the meeting specifically to discuss polls with Mr. Trump.

Mr. Penn was one of three advisers who helped Mr. Clinton navigate toward the political center when he battling a newly empowered Republican majority in Congress led by Newt Gingrich, then the House speaker. He stuck with the Clintons longer than some of Mr. Clinton’s other political gurus, like Dick Morris and Douglas E. Schoen, who became highly vocal Clinton antagonists. Mr. Penn also helped Mrs. Clinton win a New York Senate seat in 2000.

But his fallout with the onetime reigning brand in Democratic politics began during Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, where he clashed with other advisers and was ultimately removed as the chief strategist. Over the past year, like Mr. Schoen and Mr. Morris, he too has won praise on the other side of the political spectrum as he has become seen as a heretic on the left.

Mr. Penn has been praised internally at the White House, and by the president himself, for his fulsome attacks on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. In his appearances on Fox News — he last appeared on MSNBC in September 2017 — and in his opinion pieces in the conservative-leaning opinions pages of The Hill, Mr. Penn has accused Mr. Mueller of overreaching in his investigation.

But an actual sit-down meeting with the president in the Oval Office was, for some former colleagues of Mr. Penn, the inevitable outcome of what they see as his rightward lurch. “Some people are loyal to Republican red, some people to Democratic blue and some capitalism green,” said Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Mrs. Clinton, who served as her gatekeeper in the Senate and at the State Department.","White House Memo: Mark Penn, Ex-Clinton Loyalist, Visits Trump, and Democrats Are Not Pleased",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/us/politics/mark-penn-trump-clinton.html

By day’s end, nearly two dozen Democratic senators, in a letter to the Democratic leader, Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, said that abolishing fusion voting was a bad idea. They also called on Ms. Stewart-Cousins to decouple any negotiation over fusion voting from the budget, due April 1, when Mr. Cuomo could have some leverage over lawmakers. “The policy debate is too important to New York voters to be left to the 11th hour,” the letter read.

On the other side of the Capitol, the Democratic speaker of the Assembly, Carl E. Heastie of the Bronx, was more circumspect, saying he and his conference had not yet discussed the issue.

Fusion voting helps facilitate the survival of parties like the Conservative Party and the Independence Party, which often endorse Republicans. Under state law, any party which receives 50,000 votes in a gubernatorial election is guaranteed a spot on the ballot for the next four years.

Mr. Cuomo collected votes on four different ballot lines, including the Working Families Party, on the way toward a record vote-tally in November. But the W.F.P. did not endorse Mr. Cuomo in the primary; party leaders, saying they wanted to support a “real Democrat,” chose Ms. Nixon.

The W.F.P.’s bet backfired when Mr. Cuomo badly defeated Ms. Nixon in September, and the group subsequently endorsed Mr. Cuomo in the general election in a humbling reversal. Since then, the party has anticipated retribution from Mr. Cuomo, who has been known to hold a grudge.

The W.F.P. continued to issue warning shots to the Democratic Party in the last several days, sending out a battery of letters from supporters of fusion voting — including Senators Chuck Schumer, Kirsten Gillibrand, and most of the state’s Democratic House of Representatives delegation — and issuing multiple online pleas for support tagged with #StandWithWFP and #NoFusionBan.","Ocasio-Cortez, Warren and Sanders in an Unlikely Skirmish With N.Y.

Assembling a presentation for sympathetic political donors, they listed points of weakness for Mr. Trump such as “tweeting/temperament” and “criminality/corruption.”

The group concluded that Mr. Trump’s scandals were not yet badly damaging him with Republican-leaning voters: “Even relatively high information voters aren’t paying particularly close attention to day-to-day scandals,” the presentation stated. But it added that there was “room to educate voters” on the subject.

Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former lawyer, may have begun that education on Wednesday.

With Mr. Cohen’s appearance before a House committee, the public airing of ethical transgressions by Mr. Trump reached a new phase, one that may be harder to ignore for friends and foes alike. The spectacle of Mr. Trump’s onetime enforcer denouncing him in televised proceedings, detailing a catalog of allegations of cruelty and crimes, signaled the pressure the president’s already strained coalition could feel in the coming months as Congress scrutinizes him, and as the special counsel Robert S.

221,Empty,2019-02-25T19:00:57Z,Democratic candidates for the 2020 nomination must come out against the filibuster.,"It would take decades before senators realized that without such a motion, there was no way for a simple majority to forcibly end debate, what we now call “cloture.” It was possible for a single member to block anything he opposed, and it took unanimous consent to stop him.

The filibuster was born. But the small size of the Senate and informal rules around deliberation meant it wasn’t used in earnest until the late 19th century, as American politics became more polarized around party and ideology, and informal rules around speaking and debate could not accommodate the increased pace of activity in the chamber.

The modern filibuster began to take shape in 1917, when President Woodrow Wilson used war demands to pressure the Senate into adopting cloture and a supermajority threshold for ending debate (at the time, it required two-thirds of the Senate ). But even with reform, the filibuster remained a powerful tool for “tedious delays” and “contemptible compromises of the public good.”

In the 20th century, recalcitrant senators used the filibuster to block or delay anti-lynching laws, bans on poll taxes, bans on literacy tests, and other civil rights laws. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was nearly killed by a filibuster. In recent decades, routine use of the filibuster has made it difficult for presidents to pursue their agendas and for Congress to pass major legislation. In turn, it has obscured democratic accountability and made voters feel less efficacious — when voting majorities to power isn’t enough to change the way things are, it’s fair to wonder if electoral politics is worth the trouble.

We are long past the days of large, bipartisan majorities for ambitious, far-reaching legislation. Just three Republican senators backed the 2009 stimulus and not one voted for the Affordable Care Act. Critics see this as evidence these laws were too liberal, but in truth it reflects structural change in American politics. The parties are polarized and ideologically coherent; they offer fundamentally different visions for the direction of the country. A President Booker or Klobuchar might seek Republican support for their agendas, but they won’t likely find it. The legislative path for their policies — to say nothing of a Green New Deal or universal child care — will go entirely through the Democratic Party.

As it stands, Democrats would be lucky to win a Senate majority in 2020, much less the supermajority needed to end a filibuster. For the party to have any hope at actually implementing its agenda, the filibuster needs to be either reformed or eliminated. And the first step toward that is litigating the issue in public to help voters see the cost of preserving this rule, which could put pressure on other senators if a movement forms to end it.

The Senate was built to govern, not to spend its time in endless deliberation, and the legislative filibuster makes that difficult, if not impossible. It does so in ways that typically disadvantage progressives and reformers, and which will cripple the next Democratic administration, as it nearly did the previous one. Any potential political danger — Republicans could easily attack an anti-filibuster push as the first step toward taking away our cars, cows and airplanes — is outweighed by the power that comes with being able to credibly connect the election outcome to a particular policy. Give me the votes, and I’ll give you this plan.

If Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand or any of the other Democratic candidates are actually serious about their policy agendas, the only choice they have is to abandon their attachment to this arcane procedure and lead their party to a firm consensus against a rule that was never supposed to exist.

Top congressional Democrats on Wednesday introduced legislation to restore the open internet rules repealed by the Trump administration in December 2017.



Democrats in the House and Senate introduced companions bills aimed at reinstating the Obama-era net neutrality rules that prohibited broadband providers from blocking or throttling websites or offering preferred businesses higher-quality service for additional fees.

The bill would further restore the Federal Communications Commission’s expansive authority to regulate internet service in the United States and penalize providers for “unjust and unreasonable” practices negatively affecting small business and consumers.

At a press conference announcing the legislation, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that reinstating net neutrality would help promote American democracy and economic possibilities. “Democrats are proudly taking bold action to restore net neutrality protections: lowering costs and increasing choice for consumers, giving entrepreneurs a level playing field on which to compete, helping bring broadband to every corner of the country.”

The bill would nullify the FCC vote to reclassify broadband access as an “information service” under Title I of the Communications Act. “It would also prevent the FCC from once again reversing the 2015 declaratory ruling and order, which classified broadband internet access service as a Title II telecommunications service,” said Free Press Director Timothy Karr.

In essence, the FCC would no longer be able to abdicate its responsibility on a whim to protect users from the discriminatory practices of internet providers. The law would instead compel the agency, absent some future act of Congress, to defend the net neutrality principles in every state.

Both of the FCC’s Democratic commissioners—Jessica Rosenworcel and Geoffrey Starks—issued statements supporting the bill. “I am hopeful that the bill introduced today will energize folks across the country that care about Net Neutrality and lead to restoration of the common-sense protections,” Starks said. The bill was also endorsed Wednesday afternoon by the Internet Association, which represents the interests of dozens of major internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft.

Gigi Sohn, who helped draft the 2015 order and was counselor to former FCC Commissioner Tom Wheeler, likewise applauded the bill’s authors, asserting the law, if passed, would “promote competition and ensure affordable access in the broadband market.”

Republicans at the FCC scrapped the rules in a party-line vote less than a year after President Donald Trump took office. The commission’s chairman, Ajit Pai, has consistently claimed the so-called “light-touch regulations” establish in their place would give broadband providers more incentive to innovate and build networks; whereas the old rules, he said, had hampered investment and deployment.

Pai’s frequent remarks about the harms allegedly caused by the Obama-era rules were often contradicted by the broadband providers themselves. And as of at least late January, the new jobs and industry-wide investments Pai promised had not materialized.

Far from it, AT&T and Verizon initiated huge layoffs in the United States last year, despite also benefiting hugely from Trump tax cuts. In October, Verizon also announced that it had no plans to accelerate its 5G deployment.

The Democrats, who won control of the House in the November 2018 elections, also noted that the GOP-controlled Senate already voted one year ago to reinstate the net neutrality rules with the help of three Republicans.

“When we talk about a free and open internet, we mean an internet that is free from corporate control and open to anyone to communicate, innovate and connect,” said Senator Ed Markey. “The Save the Internet Act is clear and simple: overturn the Trump FCC’s wrongheaded decision and restore strong net neutrality protections.”

REUTERS/Mike Segar

The digital billboards on the side of a skyscraper in Manhattan’s Times Square are the latest broadside against the 29-year-old liberal known as “AOC,” by the Job Creators Network, founded by billionaire Bernard Marcus, a former chief executive of Home Depot Inc.

Representative Ocasio-Cortez, whose district includes parts of the New York City boroughs of the Bronx and Queens, has sought to push her party to the left on environmental and economic issues. She was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November in an upset victory over a more mainstream Democratic incumbent.

Ocasio-Cortez had opposed Amazon.com Inc’s plan to create a major New York outpost with nearly $3 billion in city and state incentives. When the company last month scrapped plans to build in New York, she called it a big victory for progressive politicians.

Last month, she teamed up with U.S. Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, to lay out a plan to eliminate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions within a decade with government-led investments in clean energy and infrastructure.

“Hey AOC, you’re the ‘boss’?” read one billboard. “WE DON’T THINK SO. The American PEOPLE are the boss,” said the other sign, with a link to a website critical of the “Green New Deal.”

In the last two weeks, the Job Creators Network has erected seven billboards in Times Square aimed at Ocasio-Cortez and her policies, a spokeswoman for the group, Elaine Parker, said in an email.

The group has called the “Green New Deal” an unrealistic and potentially ruinous plan for the U.S. economy that would require massive government spending.

A representative for Ocasio-Cortez did not return emails seeking comment on the billboards.

Last month, Ocasio-Cortez said in a message on Twitter that the billboard campaign demonstrated that her fight against “dark money & anti-worker policies” was gaining traction.",Conservatives target Ocasio-Cortez's 'Green New Deal' in New York billboards,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-ocasio-cortez-idUSKCN1QN026

In elections last year, two Trump-like Republicans running for governor and senator lost to Democrats by blowout margins.

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

Most of the Democrats running for president want to create a national single-payer health care system. They want to begin a massive transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. They want to legalize marijuana, pass broad family leave policies, and do a whole lot of other things that previous generations of presidential candidates have balked from fully endorsing.

But most of these presidential candidates are shying away from endorsing — or outright opposing — a Senate rules change that a growing number of progressive activists say would be essential to making any of these proposals reality.

They're calling on Democratic candidates to endorse ending the legislative filibuster, which requires support from at least 60 senators — in almost all cases, that means bipartisan support — to pass most bills. ""In order to actually pass a big, bold pro-democracy package, or a big, bold climate package, or a health care package, we're going to need to be able to do that with 51 votes,"" said Ezra Levin, the co-founder of the grassroots organizing group the Indivisible Project.

The push to eliminate a rule that isn't constitutional, but is so bound into Senate history and culture that it may as well be, has this field of unapologetic progressives uncharacteristically cautious.

""Great question,"" California Sen. Kamala Harris, a candidate running on a promise to ""speak truths,"" said when an Iowa voter asked her about killing the legislative filibuster. ""Let's change the subject!""

Harris isn't the only candidate cautious about the idea. Many senators see the filibuster as the one essential tool a minority party has to hold leverage and block legislation it opposes. Fresh off a two-year stretch where Republicans held all the levers of power in Washington, D.C., many Democratic senators see the hassles of the filibuster when a party is in the majority as worth the cost of the protections it affords for years in the minority.

A brief history of the filibuster for those who aren't steeped in Senate history: it's not in the U.S. Constitution, but for most of the Senate's history, the body has required a super-majority of members to agree to end debate and move forward to final votes. That meant even if the majority of lawmakers supported a bill, or a judicial nominee, a large-enough minority could block a vote.

In the face of increased Republican filibustering, Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, eliminated the filibuster for lower court and executive nominations in 2013. Four years later, when Republicans held the Senate and the White House, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., eliminated filibusters for Supreme Court picks. That meant all these nominees could be confirmed with simple majorities, rather than needing 60 votes of support. Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh were both confirmed with fewer than 60 votes, among many other lower court nominees.

The filibuster's last stand: legislation. Most bills still need 60 votes to move forward. That's why Levin and many other progressive activists are arguing for Democrats to kill it, should the party retake the Senate in 2020.

""We know that the Republicans will utilize every tool available to them to prevent these kinds of big reforms from getting done. They've done it before. They did it during the entirety of the Obama administration,"" he said.

But of the seven U.S. senators running or considering running for president, only one – Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren – is even open to the idea of eliminating the barrier.

New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand rejected the argument that a 60 vote threshold would block all major Democratic policies during a recent interview on Pod Save America. ""If you're not able to get 60 votes on something, it just means you haven't worked hard enough, talking to enough people.""

Progressives like Levin point to the fact that the Obama Administration worked hard to court Republicans during the push for the Affordable Care Act and other major bills, and often got, at most, one or two GOP votes.

Still, Gillibrand's not alone. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told CBS he's ""not crazy about getting rid of the filibuster."" California Sen. Kamala Harris is ""conflicted,"" and said ""I see arguments on both sides.""

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker is more forceful. ""I will personally resist efforts to get rid of it,"" he told reporters on the first day of his presidential campaign.

Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar both signed a letter urging the Senate to keep the legislative filibuster in 2017, when President Trump began his on-again, off-again Twitter calls to blow up the rule.

But Warren indicated it's a proposal worth considering. ""If the Republicans are going to try to block us on key pieces that we're trying to move forward, then you better believe we've got to keep all the options on the table,"" she told Pod Save America.

It's a sharp break from some of the non-senators in the race, including Washington Democratic Governor Jay Inslee. ""The filibuster will essentially doom us to a situation where we'll never be able to fight climate change,"" he said, blaming the senators' support for the rule as a byproduct of their life in a fiefdom.

Delaware Sen. Chris Coons said it's not about Senate power — it's about giving minority parties protection and encouraging bipartisan.

""It's a terrible idea,"" Coons — who isn't running for president but has long defended the filibuster — told NPR. ""Democrats would reap the whirlwind almost immediately.""

""It is the last bulwark of the rights of the minority in the Senate,"" he said. ""If a simple majority could carry the day, we'd have a right-to-work law signed into law by President Trump — I could give you a list of 20 things that President Trump would have signed into law in his first few weeks that would either repeal any positive thing that President Obama did, or anything that a progressive Democrat would hope to do in the future.""

In addition to measure curbing collective bargaining powers, Democrats were able to use the filibuster last session to block attempts to repeal Obama-era financial reforms and abortion restrictions, among other measures.

Levin says he's willing to make that trade-off. ""Look, Democracy is the theory that people know what they want, and they deserve to get it. And I don't think as pro-democracy progressive we can afford to be scared of the will of the people,"" he said.",Most Democratic 2020 Hopefuls Not Ready To Bust The Filibuster To Push Party Agenda,Npr.org,https://www.npr.org/2019/03/04/699465964/most-democratic-2020-hopefuls-not-ready-to-bust-the-filibuster-to-push-party-age

coral davenport And laid out this set of sweeping, incredibly ambitious proposals about how to both tackle climate change and solve social injustice all in one package.

archived recording (alexandria ocasio-cortez) So thank you all very, very much.

archived recording Excellent. Thank you, Alexandria. Now, I’d like —

michael barbaro So how do Democrats react to this proposal from their new star freshman house colleague?

archived recording (kamala harris) I am supporting the Green New Deal.

coral davenport So it was amazing to see a number of the presidential candidates immediately embraced it.

archived recording Does the Green New Deal go too far?

archived recording (bernie sanders) No.

coral davenport Bernie Sanders.

archived recording (bernie sanders) You cannot go too far on the issue of climate change. The future of the planet is at stake.

coral davenport Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand.

archived recording (kirsten gillibrand) I support all the framework that the Green New Deal supports because —

coral davenport Kamala Harris, Cory Booker.

archived recording (cory booker) Our planet is in peril, and we need to be bold. It’s one of the reasons why I signed on to the resolution and co-sponsored the resolution for the Green New Deal.

coral davenport They didn’t just embrace it. They co-sponsored it.

michael barbaro Wow.

coral davenport Which essentially says, we’re co-authors too.

archived recording (cory booker) We need to push the bounds of human potential because that is our history.

coral davenport It became clear that they could see that Representative Ocasio-Cortez had become this celebrity, had become this star, had galvanized the progressive left. And there is a tremendous eagerness, particularly on the part of the presidential candidates, to just jump right into that and harness that. They want to get that energy. And this is one of the first big policy things that she did. And so she just saw all of the — not just the progressive left, but the establishment Democrats, the more moderate Democrats, jumping on and saying, hey, this is mine too.

michael barbaro So how much of that has to do with all these reports that say, basically, climate change is upon us. It’s here. It’s happening.

coral davenport It has a lot to do with it. I think there are three key things that have contributed to the changing politics of climate change, Michael. One, as you said, absolutely — just in the past year or two alone, there have been major new reports that say, clearly and definitively, a lot of the extreme weather events that we are seeing now are caused by climate change. Second thing is polling shows that millennials, who will soon be the largest voting demographic — that this is an issue they care about more than almost anything else. That’s a big change. The third thing, I think, that politicians are paying attention to is President Trump. President Trump has made climate change an issue because he has elevated climate policy. He has said he’s going to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. He’s rolling back climate change regulations. He mocks climate science. So all of those present a clear way for his prospective opponents to carve out a strong position against him.

michael barbaro So it appeared the moment was uniquely right for something like this to come along.

coral davenport Yes.

archived recording The Green New Deal, a six-page resolution on issues related to America’s role in global climate change —

michael barbaro OK, so what is actually in the Green New Deal?

coral davenport So the Green New Deal is very broad. But in terms of climate change, it says —

archived recording The Green New Deal calls for reducing carbon emissions to zero and moving the U.S. off of fossil fuels in 10 years.

coral davenport The entire world needs to get to zero emissions by 2050.

archived recording It would meet 100 percent of the power demand through clean and renewable energy sources.

coral davenport A 10-year plan to slash CO2 emissions in the United States to get to getting 100 percent of U.S. electricity from clean and renewable sources, such as wind and solar.

archived recording Eliminating gas-powered engines, like cars, making air travel obsolete, retrofitting all existing buildings —

coral davenport So those are the broad strokes of what it says about climate change.

michael barbaro And all of them are wildly ambitious.

coral davenport Those are extremely ambitious, just in terms of energy and climate policy. But it also goes way, way, way beyond that. It talks about how working to achieve these goals could create new green jobs. But it also talks about guaranteeing health care, guaranteed minimum wage, family medical leave, paid vacations and retirement security to every American.

michael barbaro So it’s kind of a kitchen sink of liberal aspirations. It’s a little bit of everything.

coral davenport It is a social progressive, liberal wish list, all bundled into this thing that’s supposed to be about climate change with no clear policy prescriptions on how actually to achieve any of these goals. And just to be clear, this sounds a little inside baseball, but it’s important to note this whole sweeping proposal is also not even a bill.

michael barbaro What is it?

coral davenport It is a non-binding resolution, which is about the weakest thing that you can bring up in Congress. It is a statement of what you want, of what you would like to have. So if it were to ever pass, it would do nothing. It would be Congress saying —

michael barbaro This is what we wish for.

coral davenport Yeah.

michael barbaro Got it. So it’s a kind of manifesto, more than anything.

coral davenport That’s a good way of putting it, yes.

michael barbaro So given that, what is the point of this? What is the point of the Green New Deal?

coral davenport At this point, it seems that it’s really just about trying to get the party to come together with one voice and say, we care about this. These are the goals that we have as a party — which, for this particular party, which has often been fractured and divided, is not necessarily a small thing.

michael barbaro So what happens next?

coral davenport So soon after this resolution gets introduced, things start falling apart. The first thing that happened was there was a huge logistical scrub. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s office had sent out this sheet of talking points about what was in the package. Unfortunately, some of the things that were in the talking points actually weren’t in the package, including, for example, a guaranteed right to work for those unable or unwilling to work. And within days, you had Republicans saying, this is the best thing that’s ever happened. This is rife with targets for us.

archived recording The only thing green about the so-called Green New Deal is how much green it’s going to cost taxpayers if these people ever pass it into law.

archived recording (speaker 1) You know, it was “yes we can,” but I’m wondering if now, it’s “yes we can become a socialist country.” And I know —

archived recording (speaker 2) Yeah, that’s right. This is actually not about green energy. This is really about socialism. This is nothing more than a socialist Trojan horse. That’s why they —

michael barbaro Because the impression that’s left is that Democratic presidential candidates have signed on to something that seems to support paying people who are unwilling to work, which feels like, essentially, catnip to Fox News — to anyone in the conservative Republican world.

coral davenport Absolutely. And Democrats are put on the defensive saying, no, no, no, I supported the bill, but I don’t support this other thing that’s a description of the bill. That’s a terrible position for them to be in. And of course, immediately, it created a backlash, not so much to climate change, but to this particular proposal.

archived recording (donald trump) But they should stay with that argument. Never change. No planes, no energy — when the wind stops blowing, that’s the end of your electric. Let’s hurry — darling, is the wind blowing today? I’d like to watch television, darling.

michael barbaro And what happens with moderate Democrats? How are they responding to this proposal? So some of them started backtracking and saying, well, we will also be unveiling our own climate proposals in the campaigns. So it will be different from this. So I think a lot of Democrats are saying, wait a minute, let’s find our own proposal that maybe is not quite this thing. And then it blew up even more when —

archived recording (speaker 1) What are we doing here?

archived recording (speaker 2) We’re standing at — we’re asking for the New Green Deal —

archived recording (speaker 3) And we’re trying to present this letter that we’ve made to Senator Feinstein.

coral davenport We saw these supporters of the Green New Deal confronted Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat of California, one of the older members of the Senate, very much an establishment figure, someone who’s always been considered a reliable yes vote on environmental issues, and —

archived recording Senator, the —

coral davenport Even though what she was telling them was the truth — this proposal, this resolution, has no chance of passage. It’s not realistic legislation. It won’t have bipartisan support. It doesn’t make sense to put your back into something that’s never going to turn into legislation that will be enacted. But that practical message was not resonating with these passionate student protesters.

michael barbaro Right, it looks like a politician a bit callously telling young, idealistic kids, no, I will not protect the Earth in a way that you want me to.

coral davenport That’s how it came across.

archived recording Senator, we know that no plan is going to pass right now while the Republicans control the Senate. This is a long game. We need to be doing this to unite the Democratic Party. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but voters haven’t been particularly energized the last couple of years. We need something to fight for. Your constituents are asking you for this. And I really believe, and tens of thousands, millions —

coral davenport And this is at a moment where the political strategists in the party are looking at this and saying, those are the kids whose votes we need. What are we going to do about this? We don’t want them to be turned off by us in this way.

archived recording (dianne feinstein) I understand all of this. And I’m trying to do the best I can, which was to write a responsible resolution.

archived recording (speaker 1) Any plan that doesn’t take bold transformative action is not going to be what we need.

archived recording (speaker 4) We have a letter for you.

archived recording (dianne feinstein) I just won a big election.

archived recording (speaker 5) Yeah, that was the point of coming up to —

coral davenport So all this happens. Democrats are trying to figure out what are we going to do here. And Senator Mitch McConnell —

archived recording (mitch mcconnell) Now, Mr. President, on another matter.

coral davenport — the Republican majority leader, who is a very smart, very savvy political operator —

archived recording (mitch mcconnell) Our nation has watched the Democratic Party take a sharp and abrupt left turn toward socialism.

coral davenport — basically seems to smell blood in the water, and stepped up and said, hey, why don’t we just have a vote on this Green New Deal? And then all the Democrats can be on the record showing what they think of it.

archived recording (mitch mcconnell) And nothing encapsulates this as clearly as the huge, self-inflicted national wound the Democrats are agitating for called the Green New Deal.

michael barbaro So he spots the division —

coral davenport Absolutely.

michael barbaro — sees the messiness, and says, what a great time to force the entire party to have to say, I want this, or I don’t want this.

coral davenport Absolutely. And that was the real sign that the whole thing had fallen apart and was coming unraveled, when it had truly turned into a weapon of the right.

archived recording (mitch mcconnell) Let’s review a few of the greatest hits in this particular proposal. Democrats have decided every building in America needs to be either overhauled or replaced altogether. Forget about coal and all the jobs it supports in my state of Kentucky and around the country. Cars, lawnmowers, commercial airliners — everything must go. Everything must go. And by the way, all this and more, Mr. President, can be ours for the low, low price of a staggering expansion of centralized government and, wait for it, upwards of a mere $93 trillion. What a great idea. [MUSIC]

coral davenport And at this point now, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, has advised his caucus not to vote for or against it — simply to vote “present” when it comes up on the floor. And keep in mind, on the other side of the House, where Democrats have the majority, Nancy Pelosi has absolutely no intention of bringing this to the floor, because she knows it’s a problematic vote. And in fact, when she was asked about it early on, she stumbled over its name. She seemed to be very dismissive of it. She does not seem to take it seriously.

michael barbaro So you know you have a problem when the Republicans are eager to put a Democratic resolution on the floor of the Congress, and the Democrats are trying to avoid having their resolution put on the floor of the Congress.

coral davenport That is a clear sign, when the opposing party can’t wait to take the thing and force you to vote on it — then yeah, things are not going well.

michael barbaro Right. [MUSIC]

archived recording (mitch mcconnell) The proposal is so lacking in details and math that it’s almost impossible for analysts to even know where to begin trying to connect it to the real world. So Mr. President, like any good socialist plan, I’m sure we’d hear a lot about soaking the rich.

michael barbaro So Coral, where does this story pick back up?

coral davenport So Senator Schumer, after getting a giant Green New Deal headache, on Wednesday morning goes on the Senate floor and starts talking about it.

archived recording (chuck schumer) Now, Mr. President, maybe Leader McConnell doesn’t realize this, but because of the political stunt vote he’s planning on his version of Green New Deal, for the first time in a long time, the Senate is finally debating the issue of climate change. And it’s about time, if you ask me.

coral davenport But he uses it as a moment to pivot and talk about several other new proposals.

archived recording (chuck schumer) I understand my friends on the other side of the aisle don’t like the Green New Deal. O.K., that’s fine. What’s your plan? Maybe a lot of members think they can get away without having to answer the question. They won’t. They won’t. And that’s why we need a committee focused on this.

coral davenport One is creation of a new Senate committee to deal with climate change.

archived recording (chuck schumer) I will introduce a resolution to create a new committee on climate. Democrats believe this is an issue of surpassing importance. What do our Republican colleagues believe? We hope sincerely that our Republican friends will come around and view it the same way.

michael barbaro And Coral, what’s going on exactly? What is Schumer doing here by suddenly talking about the Green New Deal and talking about the environment in such a formal, high-profile way?

coral davenport Schumer is a politician, and so he sees that there is all of this millennial energy around the Green New Deal and around climate change. And he’s looking at the fact that people are asking questions about this when candidates go out to town halls in a way that they never have. So he wants to harness all this energy. He wants to make sure that millennials who care about climate change are still excited about Democrats and don’t think that these are fogies of yesteryear. But he wants to find a way to pivot away from the Green New Deal and come up, essentially, with a real piece of legislation that would be, probably, a lot more realistic and something that candidates could live with and that could be brought up on the Senate floor after an election.

michael barbaro So not have climate change associated with universal health care —

coral davenport Right.

michael barbaro — or the possibility of paying people who aren’t working, but have it become part of the Democratic Party platform in a way that he feels is in line with where the party’s politics are.

coral davenport Right.

archived recording (chuck schumer) Because climate change will not wait for the partisanship that so often defines this chamber to ebb, it will not pause while one party’s in power. Its impacts will not discriminate between red states and blue states. It’s time to put our party affiliations aside and agree that we face a major crisis caused by humans, and we have an immediate and glaring need to address it.

michael barbaro And when I think of Schumer, I think of the embodiment of the party’s middle.

coral davenport Totally.

michael barbaro A figure who is not a far-left figure. And so I wonder what it signals that he’s the one out there embracing this as the future of the party.

coral davenport That is the thing that I thought was the craziest of all. He has never elevated this. He’s never talked about it. He’s never pushed on it, because it’s never been seen as a vote-getter. So to all of a sudden see Chuck Schumer go out on the floor and talk like he’s a climate evangelist is amazing. To be fair to Schumer, he said he’s a new grandfather, too. So he cares about his grandchild. But I do think he is also looking at these polls, and looking at this Feinstein video that went viral, and freaking out a little bit and thinking, well, we’ve got to strategize for the next elections.

michael barbaro So Coral, what do we make of this? First, the Green New Deal is the hot new thing. Then it is the hot potato. But somehow it landed with Schumer standing on the Senate floor, talking about climate change in this new, powerful way for him.

coral davenport Yeah, so at the end of the day, I’m very skeptical that the actual Green New Deal is going to be passed or put into effect. But this sudden skyrocketing to fame of the Green New Deal and Representative Ocasio-Cortez, and the rallying of the millennials, and even the pushback, even the fallout — it showed the Democratic Party leaders, even as middle-of-the-road political pragmatists, that there is a new energy and interest from a key demographic of voter that they care about. That was the effect of this whole Green New Deal roller coaster. And the outcome is we’re in new territory. I never thought I would write the sentence that Chuck Schumer wants to elevate the issue of climate change for campaigns, ever.

michael barbaro So actually, you could argue that this resolution that seemed like a political fiasco in the beginning — it actually kind of worked. It injected this issue into the Democratic Party’s bloodstream, just as people like Ocasio-Cortez and liberals, perhaps, intended.

coral davenport Even if nothing that the Green New Deal calls for actually comes to pass, it has changed the conversation. It has changed the political calculus. And it has helped bring the issue of climate change into the top tier of political campaigns, a place it’s never been.

michael barbaro Coral, thank you very much. We appreciate it.","Pressed by Climate Activists, Senate Democrats to ‘Go on Offense’",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/us/politics/senate-democrats-climate-change.html

Enlarge this image toggle caption Charlie Neibergall/AP Charlie Neibergall/AP

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, one of half a dozen Democratic senators running for the White House, is reintroducing a bill on Thursday that would fundamentally end the federal government's prohibition on marijuana.

The Marijuana Justice Act, which was first introduced by Booker in August of 2017, seeks to make marijuana legal at the federal level by removing it from the list of controlled substances, while also expunging the convictions of previous marijuana drug offenders and reinvesting in low-income and minority communities that were particularly hard hit by the federal government's war on drugs.

Some other senators running for president are co-sponsors of the legislation, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., as well as Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, who is considering a bid.

Two key senators from the Midwest are not listed as co-sponsors: Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who's also running for president, and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who is mulling a 2020 bid.

Ten states plus Washington, D.C., have legalized some amount of recreational marijuana, and 33 states plus D.C. allow medical marijuana.

Warren introduced a bipartisan piece of legislation last year with Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., to prevent the federal prohibition on marijuana from applying to states that had already legalized it. But Booker's legislation, which she supports, is a more sweeping change.

The bill is retroactive and would apply to people currently serving time for marijuana-related offenses.

The support for Booker's proposal among fellow Senate Democrats vying for the White House is a sign of how much the party has shifted in recent years, and the degree to which candidates feel they need to bolster their progressive credentials in a crowded Democratic field.

It's also an indication of the overall appetite for progressive policies in the 2020 Democratic primary race.

Sanders re-introduced the Raise the Wage Act last month, which would increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour. It was co-sponsored by nearly every Democratic senator considering a run for the presidency: Booker, Brown, Gillibrand, Harris, Klobuchar, Merkley and Warren.

He is not alone in questioning if he is the man for the moment.

The clamor for Biden to join the pack seeking to challenge Republican President Donald Trump has quieted as the Democratic field has grown more crowded and diverse, according to interviews with more than two dozen strategists, activists, party organizers and voters.

Opinion polls show Biden, a former U.S. senator from Delaware who served two terms as former President Barack Obama’s vice president, remains popular. But the Democratic Party may no longer need him in order to be competitive against Trump.

“I love Joe Biden. He’s a great guy and a great politician,” said Jerry Shriner, a Democratic National Committee member from Idaho. “I wish he were the president right now. But I’m not sure I wish he is president in 2021.”

Democrats are in the early stages of an internal debate about how best to challenge Trump in next year’s presidential election, weighing factors like electability, ideology and identity.

The strength of the field - expected to include at least six sitting U.S. senators, plus several current or former governors, U.S. House of Representatives members and a former Cabinet secretary - is a factor in Biden’s calculations, those close to him say.

He will be more likely to remain on the sidelines if he feels a strong candidate capable of beating Trump is emerging.

But a source close to Biden said: “If I had to guess, he’s probably going to do it.”

Biden associates have held discussions with potential staffers and supporters who could serve political strategy, grassroots organizing and digital campaign roles, according to two sources. One source said those conversations were necessary to quickly ramp up a formal campaign operation should Biden decide to run.

Some party activists say, however, that Biden has not reached out to broad donor networks to gauge the level of monetary support he could expect.

Biden, who mounted failed presidential campaigns in 1998 and 2008, said at an event in Delaware on Tuesday that he did not want a third bid to be “a fool’s errand.”

“What I don’t want to do is take people’s time, effort and commitment without there being a clear shot I could be the nominee,” he said. “I think I can.”

‘TOO OLD’

Biden chose not to run in 2016 when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was widely considered the heavy favorite for the Democratic nomination. Some political analysts have since speculated he could have won industrial battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that proved crucial to Trump’s surprise victory.

Biden’s high name recognition among Democratic voters means he likely can afford to wait longer than lesser-known candidates to enter the 2020 race. But even that comes with a risk.

“The longer he waits, the more people are going to start to want to follow some of the new and younger voices they’re hearing,” said Bret Niles, the Democratic Party chairman in Linn County, Iowa.

Biden’s age, ideology and record already are drawing scrutiny. If elected, he would be 78 when he was sworn in.

“Joe Biden is too old,” said Mary Donough, 60, a Democrat from Des Moines, Iowa, who plans to participate in her state’s crucial nominating caucus next year and wants a younger candidate to challenge Trump.

“There is just more energy there,” she said.

Biden’s backers will argue his age represents experience, said a former aide who asked to speak on background in order to explain internal talking points.

“Voters look at Donald Trump and they look at what we’re missing, which is someone who understands the institution, someone who is an adult, someone who is seasoned, someone who respects the institutions,” the former aide said.

If Biden does run, the chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, said on Thursday that Trump and the Republican Party would attack his work as vice president under Obama.

“Go ahead and run,” McDaniel told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Maryland. “Run on your record of stagnant wages, of jobs leaving this country, of manufacturing jobs fleeing United States of America, of bad trade deals, of bad foreign policy.

The Democratic Party undoubtedly has moved left since the last time Biden appeared alone on a ballot in 2008, when he was re-elected to the Senate by Delaware voters for his seventh term.

“Times have changed,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. “Does he meet the moment?”

Green, whose group supports the candidacy of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, lumps Biden in with white, male, moderate Democrats who have faltered in recent elections, like Phil Bredesen, who lost his U.S. Senate race in Tennessee last year.

Biden also will have to answer for his record.

He chaired the 1991 confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and was criticized for not doing enough to protect Anita Hill, who accused Thomas of sexual harassment. Biden has since apologized and said he should have done more to shield Hill from attacks by Republicans.

Unions remain unhappy about the free-trade deals advocated by the Obama administration, and liberal progressive groups point to the bailout of Wall Street banks during the financial crisis that provided no help to distressed homeowners.

Sharon Holle, who has been working to organize for Biden in Iowa ahead of his decision, argued his experience would appeal to Democrats nervous about the country’s direction under Trump.

“People are scared,” Holle said. “We’re in a crisis right now. We need somebody we can trust.”","As Biden weighs 2020 bid, Democrats ask: 'Does he meet the moment?'",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden-idUSKCN1QH1EX

Ms. Preckwinkle, 72, has spent most of her career immersed in Chicago government, climbing from Fourth Ward alderman to Cook County Board of Commissioners president and chairwoman of the county Democratic Party. Along the way, she has built a reputation as a true progressive and a founder of the Progressive Caucus on the City Council. She has favored criminal justice reform, affordable housing, repairing relationships between police and communities, and economic development in neglected neighborhoods in Chicago.

In February, she was narrowly surpassed in votes by Ms. Lightfoot, 56, who has never held elected office and has promised “a new progressive vision for the city.”

Ms. Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor and former president of the Chicago Police Board, an oversight group, is not far apart ideologically from Ms. Preckwinkle on many of the issues facing the city.

But she is trying to define herself as the true progressive in the race partly by highlighting Ms. Preckwinkle’s time in government, especially her relationship with Edward M. Burke, a Chicago alderman who has been charged with attempted extortion and held a fund-raiser for Ms. Preckwinkle. She returned the money and stripped Mr. Burke of his role as chairman of a county committee. (In things that haven’t changed when it comes to Chicago elections, Mr. Burke was re-elected in February despite facing a criminal charge.)

Ms. Preckwinkle has indicated that she will fight to hold onto the label. “I’m the most progressive candidate in this race, and I’ve taken my progressive values to whatever job I’ve taken on,” she said in a debate in January.

In February, when she knew she was headed for a runoff, she reflected on Chicago’s shifting political order. “I remember when ‘progressive’ wasn’t a positive,” she said. “It was at best a euphemism for ‘unelectable.’ Those of us who proudly claimed it had to fight to transform the political landscape.”",Chicago’s Political Order Was Upended This Week.

It's called the ""Save the Internet Act…","The latest battle between arch-enemies Nancy Pelosi and Donald Trump could be the internet.

On Wednesday, Democratic legislators introduced a new bill in both the House and the Senate that would reinstate net neutrality. It's called the ""Save the Internet Act of 2019."" And, as articulated in the bill's just three pages, it would overturn the Trump FCC's rules that overturned the Obama-era FCC's net neutrality protections. And, it would task the FCC with protecting net neutrality across the country.

Last Congress, we voted to restore #NetNeutrality in the Senate.



Now, House and Senate Democrats are introducing a bill to #SaveTheInternet.



Let’s pass the Save The Internet Act in both houses and make the internet free and open again. #SaveTheNet https://t.co/hA3DFkSloZ — Senate Democrats (@SenateDems) March 6, 2019

Thanks to shifting tides of power in Congress, and the popularity of net neutrality amongst constituents of both parties, the bill could actually have a chance to pass through congress. But ultimately, Trump could be the one to pull the internet's plug.

First, let's talk about this bill's chances in Congress. In May 2018, three Senate Republicans crossed the aisle to vote with Democrats to overturn the FCC's ruling. After passing the Senate, that bill died in the House, where then speaker Paul Ryan refused to bring it to a vote.

Last year, after the Senate voted to #SaveTheNet, Paul Ryan ran out the clock on #NetNeutrality in the House. This time, it’s our House. Today, Democrats in both the Senate and House are announcing the Save The Internet Act, and we’re going to send it to Donald Trump’s desk. — Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) March 6, 2019

But things are different now. The Democrats control the House of Representatives by a wide margin, so the bill should be able to pass there. But political demographics have changed in the Senate, too: the Republicans hold a stronger majority of 57-43, since Democrats lost two seats in the midterm elections.

The three Republican Senators who voted for the last net neutrality bill — Susan Collins of Maine, John N. Kennedy of Louisiana, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — are still in office. But there's no guarantee that they'll side with the Dems again. And, assuming all Senate democrats vote for the bill, they'll have to pick up another Republican to pass it.

In Washington, the net neutrality issue often plays out along party lines, with Democrats seeking to codify net neutrality as the law of the land, so that ISPs can't charge different rates to access websites at certain speeds. Republicans have largely sided with ISPs, giving them more freedom to charge whatever they want.

But amongst citizens, net neutrality is an issue that actually has a lot of popularity across party lines; according to a 2017 poll from the University of Maryland, 75 percent of Republicans, 89 percent of Democrats and 86 percent of independents were in favor of keeping the Obama-era net neutrality regulations in place. If Republican senators listen to their constituents, perhaps the bill could actually pass through Congress.

But that's where the big, orange obstacle that is President Trump comes in.

Trump weighed in on net neutrality before, displaying a very limited grasp of what the concept actually means — but generally taking a stance against it.

In 2014, he tweeted that the Obama-era FCC rules that protected net neutrality would ""target conservative media,"" and equated it with an unrelated concept. At a rally in 2015, he said he would ask Bill Gates, re ""the internet,"" about ""closing it up.""

Obama’s attack on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2014

But his most definitive action came as president, when he appointed Ajit Pai, a known opponent of net neutrality, to the role of FCC chairman. In March 2017, Trump's administration clarified its stance on net neutrality: then Press Secretary Sean Spicer (miss u bb) announced the administration's ambition to overturn the Obama FCC's net neutrality rules. He said that Trump had “pledged to reverse this overreach,” characterizing the Obama-era rules as unnecessarily bureaucratic regulation that ""stifles American innovation, job creation and economic growth."" These are common arguments against net neutrality perpetuated by ISPs that have been shown to hold no water.

Trump has been no special friend to ISPs: a recent report divulged Trump's blatant attempt to block AT&T from merging with Time Warner. But that was in retaliation for his anger at CNN, a Time Warner subsidiary — not because he necessarily cares about ISPs. What's more likely guiding Trump is his good ol' strategy of If Obama Was For It, I'm Against It. Opposing his enemies has always been more meaningful for Trump than the actual issues.

And unfortunately, net neutrality could become a casualty in this petty war, if Trump lets his dismal understanding of tech issues, and his general hatred for Obama and Nancy Pelosi, guide his veto pen. Let's not let it.",Net neutrality gets a second wind. The problem? Donald Trump.,Mashable,https://mashable.com/article/save-the-internet-net-neutrality-donald-trump/

Updated at 9:55 a.m. ET

Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper has announced he will seek the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, becoming the second governor to join a crowded field of candidates.

In a short video released Monday morning, Hickenlooper pledged to fight what he referred to as a crisis that threatens everything America stands for, as a picture of President Trump flashed on the screen, ""As a skinny kid with Coke bottle glasses and a funny last name. I've stood up to my fair share of bullies. Standing tall when it matters is one of the things that really drives me.""

In an interview with Colorado Public Radio, Hickenlooper said he has his own tactic for dealing with Trump's aggressive tactics.

""You say back what they're saying, but you twist it just enough so the people they're trying to impress see the lunacy, the comedy in what they're trying to say,"" Hickenlooper said. ""When their audience begins laughing at them, it drives most bullies nuts.""

The 67-year-old former geologist, beer brewer and mayor of Denver has been considering a presidential bid for some time. He often touts his state's solid economic growth, especially in rural parts of Colorado. Hickenlooper also points to his accomplishments as governor, such as Medicaid expansion, increased infrastructure and public education spending and overhauling state campaign finance laws. He also led Colorado through major challenges, including historic wildfires and floods, and a mass shooting at a movie theater in a Denver suburb.

""I promised Colorado families that we would rebuild our communities better than before, and that just offering thoughts and prayers would never again be sufficient,"" said Hickenlooper, who served two terms as governor, in his launch video.

In 2013, Hickenlooper signed universal background checks into law and a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines, but his pro-business centrist profile could be a turn-off for progressives in the party. He's also been a strong supporter of Colorado's oil and gas industry, which is sure to be a point of contention for some Democrats.

As governor, he was known to try to build consensus and compromise on tough issues tackling the state. He argues there's more Democrats agree on than disagree, and that he could be a draw for independent voters and disaffected Republicans.

In an interview with NPR last month, Hickenlooper warned Democrats that the party needed to stand for more than opposition to President Trump.

""I think there is so much frustration at the national level, and I think President Trump has created this, so that the one way that people can demonstrate quickly and firmly that they are against Trump is to show anger and really lash out — at either President Trump or someone — to demonstrate that they have the same values as the Democratic primary voters. And I understand, I feel that,"" Hickenlooper said. ""But I think there might be a kind of a new silent majority of people that are also going to want to see achievement.

Hickenlooper joins a field that now has 14 declared major candidates. He said that what sets him apart from his opponents is that many of them have spent long careers in Washington engaged in a ""debate of words"" while he's been focused on making his state function.

""I understand we need debate, but we also need doers,"" Hickenlooper told Colorado Public Radio. ""I'm someone who, pretty much my whole adult life, has been spent bringing together talented teams of people and then working with them to accomplish real progressive change.""

While Hickenlooper isn't as well-known as some other potential challengers, he made that a clear lack of name recognition won't stop him. He formed a political action committee and began traveling for candidates during the midterm elections. This year, he's been making stops in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, where Democratic voters will get their first crack at weighing in on the field. Hickenlooper kicks off his campaign Thursday night in downtown Denver. He then heads on a two-day swing through Iowa, followed by a stop at the South by Southwest Conference in Austin, Texas.

House Democrats on Wednesday will introduce a bill to reinstate the net neutrality rules repealed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in late 2017.



In a letter to Democratic colleagues, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the bill, know as the “Save the Internet Act,” will be introduced on Wednesday morning at 11:15 am. Text of the bill is not currently available.

The bill will likely seek to reestablish broadband internet access as a “telecommunications service” under Title II of the Communications Act, a key designation the Republican-led FCC voted to abandon in late 2017. The change to Title II classification gave the FCC the authority in 2015 to protect online businesses and consumers against any unreasonable practices of broadband providers.

The 2015 order also outlined numerous practices that the Obama-era commission believed unreasonable. That included the ability of broadband providers to selectively block or throttle websites and services. It also banned systems of paid prioritization, in which ISPs are allowed to choose which services are the quickest to access for consumers, charging companies additional fees for the privilege.

In December 2017, the FCC’s three GOP commissioners, led by Chairman Ajit Pai, voted to repeal those protections in a party-line vote. The vote was, in essence, a decision by Republicans to diminish their own agency’s authority to protect consumers, while claiming that—despite evidence to the contrary—oversight was hindering industry innovation.

“The bill isn’t out yet, but we hope it will give a congressional stamp of approval to the FCC’s 2015 Net Neutrality rules and the whole Open Internet Order,” said Timothy Karr, senior director of strategy and communications at Free Press. “That’s crucial, because the legal framework already in Title II is the baseline for guaranteeing the full range of protections demanded by internet users, including overwhelming majorities of Democratic and Republican voters.”

The effort to pass the “Save the Internet Act” in the Senate is being led by Senator Ed Markey, his spokesperson said.

In late 2017, the Senate passed a resolution to overturn the FCC’s net neutrality repeal under the Congressional Review Act. But the House, then controlled by the GOP, did not take up the resolution in time.

The FCC repeal is also currently being challenged in the D.C. Circuit by dozens of petitioners, including the Mozilla Corporation, Public Knowledge, Free Press, the Open Technology Institute at New America, and 21 state attorneys general.

Is nothing sacred? Democrats want to take away hamburgers from the American people, an ex-Trump aide has warned.

The wild claim about a supposed plot to ban the national food came from onetime White House aide Sebastian Gorka at a conservative political jamboree.

The humble ground-beef patty has become ammunition in a US cultural food fight since a Democrat dared to suggest Americans eat fewer of the sandwiches.

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been touting a climate change plan.

Railing against Democrats, Mr Gorka told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland on Thursday: ""They want to take your pickup truck.

""They want to rebuild your home. They want to take away your hamburgers.""

Perhaps even more dubiously, he added: ""This is what Stalin dreamt about but never achieved.""

Ms Ocasio-Cortez provoked conservative scorn this month when she along with Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, unveiled the Green New Deal.

Their policy paper proposed to overhaul the US economy to tackle climate change.

But it was a reference to ""farting cows"" in a since-retracted accompanying document that invited the ridicule of eager critics.

""We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero, emissions in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast,"" the offending section said.

There is no reference to banning cows in the text of the Green New Deal itself. So, as Washington politicos used to say, where's the beef?

But Republicans seized on it as evidence of a radical far-left agenda within the Democratic party.

President Donald Trump suggested at a rally in El Paso, Texas, that ""you're not allowed to own cows anymore"".

Republican members of the House Natural Resources Committee took to eating hamburgers on Capitol Hill to protest against the Green New Deal.

The issue was quickly taken up on social media by conservatives, who shared photos of themselves cooking and eating beef.

Addressing the controversy, Ms Ocasio-Cortez told a late-night talk show that nobody would be forced to ""go vegan"", but that ""we've got to address factory farming"".

""Maybe we shouldn't be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch, and dinner,"" added the New York City congresswoman, a self-described democratic socialist.

While bovine flatulence is often connected to climate change, a cow releases more greenhouse gasses through burping (around 600 litres of methane a day).

Some suggested that even if the Green New Deal did call for a ban on burgers, it would be worth it to ""save Earth"".

Hamburger-gate raged on this week after Ms Ocasio-Cortez was photographed having dinner at a Washington restaurant with a colleague, who was caught eating the now-controversial meal.

The photograph went viral, with some suggesting the congresswoman was a hypocrite.

Ms Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, joked that the photo proved a ""vast conspiracy"" to allow Americans to eat burgers.

Americans eat nearly 50bn hamburgers a year, according to the Center for Investigative Reporting.",Do Democrats want to take away Americans' hamburgers?,BBC News,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47394484

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) On Tuesday, House Republicans will take a crucial vote that will mark what the party is becoming at this crossroads in American history. President Donald Trump has invoked national emergency power to secure federal funds for a wall that Congress refused to pay for. He has done so based on an alleged crisis at the border that almost no reputable expert agrees is real.

""The President's actions are at odds with the overwhelming evidence in the public record, including the administration's own data and estimates,"" proclaimed 58 prominent ex-national security officials who oppose what the President is trying to do. They made this assertion -- to be entered into the Congressional Record -- in a 13-page joint statement issued Monday.

Even some Republican loyalists understand that if President Trump takes this step to finance a border wall, future presidents in both parties will have sufficient justification to enact policy to tackle their goals, including initiatives on climate change, without congressional support.

Congress has the power to stop President Trump if it wants to; it doesn't need the courts to step in. If the House and Senate vote for a resolution revoking this use of emergency power, with sufficient votes to override an expected presidential veto, Trump has to back down. Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976 , Congress gave itself the power to restrain the president.

But President Trump is tweeting out warnings to his fellow Republicans. ""I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,"" he tweeted Monday morning. In a follow up , he asked: ""Why on earth would any Republican vote not to put up a Wall or against Border Security. Please explain that to me?""

The good news for President Trump is that the odds are on his side. Most Republicans won't go along with Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Although a handful of Republicans have indicated they opposed the emergency declaration, most have not. The Democratic-controlled House is expected to pass legislation reversing Trump's emergency order, but it is not even likely that the resolution will make its way through the Senate, where the Republicans hold power.

This vote is the latest in a series of critical moments since January 2017 in which congressional Republicans have shown themselves to be the foundation of the Trump presidency rather than passive bystanders. Republicans have made active decisions that strengthened the President's hand or allowed him to use his authority in unprecedented fashion because it seemed to serve their political interest.

When Republicans did not censure President Trump after his stunning failure to fully condemn the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, the party showed that it had the President's back . When the party ended his controversial first year by voting in favor of Trump's massive corporate tax cut, it handed him a crucial legislative victory at a key point in his presidency -- one that greatly improved his standing with the Republican electorate.

When then-House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes released a memo making pointed accusations about the motives of the FBI, he and the Republicans on his committee joined in on the President's ongoing assault on law enforcement institutions -- an apparent attempt to discredit the investigations into his campaign and presidency.

Most recently, the Republicans allowed President Trump to shut down the federal government for the longest period in American history , even though the Senate had reached an agreement over the budget, so that the administration could score political points with the base. Government workers went without pay so that the party could start setting up for the 2020 campaign.

In announcing the deal to reopen the government, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced his support for the President turning to emergency power -- only days after expressing his staunch opposition to such a move.

This week's vote might be the most important of all these enabling moments. If the Republicans don't vote to stand between Trump and this aggressive use of presidential power, they are giving consent to the President to unilaterally siphon money from programs that Congress has funded into a program that Congress refused to support.

Republicans are increasingly erasing any daylight between themselves and President Trump, and it may be about to happen again. This is his party, and more importantly, this practice has been an active decision by Republican elected officials.

When Trump's presidency is over, Republicans will spend many years reckoning with the decisions they have made.

The Federal Trade Commission is launching a new task force focused on the tech industry, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, with a broad anti-trust mission that will “include re-examining mergers that already have been approved by the government.”



FTC Chairman Joe Simons wrote in a statement, “The role of technology in the economy and in our lives grows more important every day. It makes sense for us to closely examine technology markets to ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition.”

The agency wrote that the task force will be staffed with career officials and is modeled on the 2002 Merger Litigation Task Force, which had roles in reviewing both hospital mergers and enforcement in retail business. FTC officials did not discuss specific companies that might be examined by the new force, the Journal wrote:

The new task force will be drawn from existing staff, and include 17 FTC attorneys. While FTC officials said they couldn’t discuss specific cases they would be examining, they said they would consider breaking up deals that are creating harms. “In general with consummated mergers we have the full panoply of remedies,” said Bruce Hoffman, the director of the FTC’s competition bureau. That could include breaking up merged firms or requiring a spinoff of specific units, he added, assuming the FTC can meet its legal burden of showing harm.

However, obvious potential targets are tech titans like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. The former has bought up numerous competitors such as WhatsApp and Instagram, and the FTC is reportedly mulling slapping it with a massive fine for potential violations of a 2011 deal with the agency on user privacy. Google has rapidly bought up swathes of the digital ad business and owns YouTube, and along with Facebook is estimated to control well over half of the U.S. digital ad market. Amazon has regularly faced accusations of anti-competitive behavior. All three companies, as well as other major tech firms, have faced calls to break them up or at least soften their edges.

“The FTC, if it is to remain relevant, needs some way of assessing the evident competition problems in the tech sector and taking action when necessary,” Columbia University law professor Tim Wu told the Journal. “The FTC needs to get past its laser-focus on consumer prices, and figure out what competitive harm means in today’s tech markets.”

Donald Trump’s administration threatened to investigate Facebook, Twitter, and Google last year, accusing them of silencing and discriminating against conservative voices online.

While claims of bias and censorship by big tech companies are by no means exclusive to any one side of the political spectrum, the narrative coming from Trump and the broader GOP has included repeated and baseless accusations tech companies are controlled by liberals and serve as de facto arms of the Democratic Party. (Trump, for one, has promoted this idea with wild-eyed claims of “SHADOW BANNING” on Twitter, doctored videos purporting to show Google blacklisting his speeches, and diatribes against Facebook.) Last year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions convened a meeting of federal and state law enforcement officials, reportedly trying to focus their energy on investigating those claims of left-wing bias instead other concerns like handling of user data.



Those efforts, so far, have amounted to little more than empty threats, and there’s no indication at this moment that the FTC’s new commission has anything to do with them. (In fact, the FTC has been examining these issues separately for some time.) Per Wired, there is actually some concern from tech critics that the agency won’t even rouse itself to do much of anything on the more legitimate antitrust concerns.

Matt Stoller, a fellow at the anti-monopoly Open Markets Institute, told Wired that the FTC has taken no real antitrust action to date on big tech and he was “scornful of the new seating arrangements, because the FTC has consistently proven they do not want to wield power.”

“They want to hold hearings. They want to get their friend economists and antitrust lawyers to fly into DC and talk to each other,” Stoller added. “They don’t want to do their No. 1 job, which is to police markets for unfair and anticompetitive behavior.”

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo

The new primary election for the state’s 9th District in the U.S. House of Representatives, which stretches southeast from Charlotte to north of Whiteville along the state’s southern border, will take place on May 14, the bipartisan state elections board said.

The general election will be held on Sept. 10 if no second primary is needed on that date. If there is a second primary, the general election will take place on Nov. 5. The candidate with the second highest number of votes may demand a second primary if no candidate receives more than 30 percent of the vote; the top two vote-getters would be on the second primary ballot.

The race is the country’s last unsettled 2018 congressional contest, but the outcome will not change the balance of power in the Democratic-controlled House.

The state Board of Elections ordered a new vote in February after a four-day hearing during which it heard evidence of what election officials called a well-funded campaign to tip the election by a political operative working for Republican House candidate Mark Harris.

Residents of at least two counties in the district said Leslie McCrae Dowless and his paid workers collected incomplete absentee ballots and, in some instances, falsely signed as witnesses and filled in votes for contests left blank, according to testimony at the hearing.

Dowless was arrested and charged on Feb. 27 with three felony counts of obstruction of justice, two counts of conspiring to commit obstruction of justice and two counts of possession of absentee ballots, court documents said.

Citing health concerns, Harris said after the hearing that he will not run again for the seat. He led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes out of 282,717 ballots cast on Nov. 6, but elections officials refused to certify him the winner because of allegations of irregularities in the vote.

McCready has declared his candidacy.

WASHINGTON – Sen. Bernie Sanders signed a pledge, required under new Democratic National Committee rules, that declared he was a Democrat and would serve as one if elected president, according to media reports.

Sanders, an independent from Vermont, is one of more than a dozen candidates who has launched a presidential bid or announced an exploratory committee for a White House run. He signed the pledge, which was given to all 2020 candidates for their signature, on Tuesday, according to a copy obtained by NBC News.

""I am a member of the Democratic Party,"" the document signed by Sanders reads. ""I will run a Democrat, accept the nomination of my Party, and I will serve as a Democrat if elected.""

The document also states that the DNC has the authority to determine whether a candidate is indeed a ""bona fide Democrat,"" saying the committee would examine the candidate's record, writings and accomplishments.

The new DNC rule is part of a number of changes within the organization.

It was partially enacted as a response to Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, which he lost to Hillary Clinton. Sanders ran as a Democrat but was a longtime independent and self-described democratic socialist. Some Democrats had worried during the primary fight that Sanders could run as an independent if he lost to Clinton, something Sanders did not do.

There was also question over whether Sanders should qualify for the primaries since he was registered as a Democrat.

Sanders caucuses with Democrats but has consistently run for office as an independent, including on Monday when Sanders filed to run again for his Senate seat in 2024, according to NBC News.

Since the 2016 race, the DNC has also scaled back the role of superdelegates in presidential nominations, which Sanders and his supporters rallied for.

The change came after complaints about party insiders' incredible influence in the primary process. Superdelegates announcing support for Clinton gave her an early advantage in the primary, and their role was a major point of contention for Sanders’ supporters.

242,Empty,2019-03-02T11:00:00Z,The party hopes to restore and extend key provisions of the Voting Rights Act.,"The Voting Rights Advancement Act is written to “restore and bolster the Voting Rights Act, and undo the damage done by the Shelby County decision,” Sewell said in a press release. In that decision, Chief Justice John Roberts invalidated the Voting Rights Act’s “coverage formula,” a list of jurisdictions that had to seek federal preclearance for any changes to elections laws. In Roberts’s reckoning, racism in the country had been pared back, and continuing to require special scrutiny of those jurisdictions—despite the numerous laws they proposed over the years that failed preclearance tests and resulted in litigation—was unconstitutional.

Since then, voting-rights advocates and several Democrats argue that the country has been mired in a new—and predictable—age of accelerated voter suppression and restrictive voting laws. “We’ve just seen since Shelby an onslaught of more restrictive voting laws,” Sewell told me a few weeks ago in her office.

She often speaks on the voter-ID laws in her home state. They have grown tighter over time in ways that seem to uniquely disadvantage elderly black voters, who may not have or need a driver’s license, and who, having grown up in the rural Jim Crow South, may not have ever had the official documentation to get some strict forms of ID. Sewell cites her own father, who died in 2017 and had a series of strokes that left him wheelchair-bound near the end of his life. “He didn’t have a driver’s license but he had been voting—until Alabama changed its law in 2014—with a validly issued federal ID called a Social Security card,” she told me.

Alabama is one of several states that have rapidly created more restrictive voting laws post–Shelby County, and also where gerrymandering, voter purges, and zealous campaigns against the specter of noncitizen voting by a wave of pro-Trump state attorneys general and secretaries of state have dominated the political process. In North Carolina, GOP legislators have fought to maintain power with gerrymandered maps, enacted a voter-ID and elections-law package that one federal court said discriminated against black people “with almost surgical precision,” and have leveraged just about every antidemocratic measure to maintain power. The past few months in North Carolina have culminated in a so-called legislative coup by the GOP, aimed at disempowering a newly elected Democratic governor. The State Board of Elections decided last week to redo the congressional race in the Ninth District in light of evidence that election fraud on behalf of the Republican candidate Mark Harris influenced the result.

Not to be outdone, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp won his election against Democrat Stacey Abrams after a mass campaign of voter suppression, including hundreds of thousands of voter purges that disproportionately affected people of color—in an election that he administered as secretary of state. In Texas, gerrymandering, voter-ID laws, and court rulings have been at the center of politics for years, and almost got the state placed back under federal preclearance. A North Dakota voter-ID law in place in 2018 seemed to specifically target the state’s Native American population. Former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, an architect of the post–Shelby County Republican elections-law strategy, lost his bid for governor after facing allegations of voter suppression. And places like Maricopa County, Arizona, have seen purges and Election Day lines over the years that have disproportionately affected Latinos and other minorities at incredibly high rates.",The Democrats’ New Voting Rights Moment,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/03/democrats-hope-restore-key-section-voting-rights-act/583969/
243,Empty,2019-02-26T11:00:04Z,Is it time for the U.S. to confront other great powers — or to retreat?,"Mr. Trump shares some of these inclinations. “Great nations do not fight endless wars,” he proclaimed in the State of the Union. He has pledged to pull most ground troops out of Syria and is pursuing negotiations with the Taliban in Afghanistan. On the whole, though, most advocates of restraint find little to like in Mr. Trump’s militarized foreign policy. They see a president who has attempted to assert American dominance over the world, boosting the defense budget, escalating military interventions in the Middle East and Africa, and imposing new sanctions on Iran and now Venezuela.

Yet they also see an opportunity to constrain the United States’ military adventurism by opposing the war powers of an unprincipled and unstrategic commander in chief. On Feb. 13, antiwar forces scored a victory when the House voted to end military support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. If the resolution passes the Senate, it will mark the first time Congress has invoked the 1973 War Powers Act in order to bind the president to remove American forces active in hostilities abroad.

The bill also offers a template for further withdrawals, according to its Senate sponsors, Democrat Chris Murphy, Independent Bernie Sanders and Republican Mike Lee. “Since 9/11, politicians have become far too comfortable with American military interventions all over the world,” they have written. The next step may be to repeal the Authorization for the Use of Military Force passed after the Sept. 11 attacks, which successive presidents have used to justify almost unlimited warmaking in the greater Middle East.

Restraint is advancing on the left of the Democratic Party, but it’s not yet clear whether it can pierce the center as domestic proposals like Medicare for All have done. Calls to cut military spending, advanced by Mr. Sanders and House progressives, have not quite become a core principle of the progressive movement. And advocates of restraint tend to become less vocal and unified when they turn beyond the Middle East. The sponsor of the House’s Yemen resolution, Representative Ro Khanna, has distinguished himself by supporting diplomacy with North Korea and opposing regime change in Venezuela, but he stands apart. The restraint coalition would benefit from taking a similarly global view if it is to advance a comprehensive alternative to the status quo.

The Coming Clash?

Does the future belong to great power competition or restraint? Partisans of each camp have good reason to feel the wind at their back. Decades of policy failure have converged with the daily eruptions of President Trump to throw open the question of what America’s place in the world should be.

What’s more, the two camps have not quite trained their sights on each other. That is partly because advocates of great power competition in the establishment remain obsessed with Mr. Trump, while advocates of restraint have been marginalized for so long that they need to pick their battles. One can even glimpse the outlines of a tacit bargain between them, breaking down geographically: As restrainers try to end wars in the Middle East, centrists pivot toward the Pacific, where the adversaries are larger but war less likely.

For now, savvy politicians can adopt both positions at once. Ms. Warren, for example, denounces Chinese and Russian behavior at the same time that she promises to remove troops from Afghanistan and “cut our bloated defense budget.” And Democrat-leaning experts not previously outraged by America’s Middle East entanglements now bemoan them as distractions. Before long, it will be only anti-Iran, pro-Israel hard-liners — members of the Trump administration and Democratic leadership included — who will strongly defend America’s posture in the region.",2020 Will See a Monumental Clash Over America’s Place in the World,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/opinion/2020-foreign-policy.html

After an initial rush by Democratic luminaries to endorse the ambitious social justice plan championed by liberal stalwart Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to address climate change, some in the party have started pushing back.

Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., said ""there's no way to pay for"" the Green New Deal and is drafting a narrower alternative. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., has criticized the plan as a ""dream"" that would hurt regions dependent on reliable, affordable energy. Freshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., praised the Green New Deal's goal to wean the country off fossil fuels but said it's far too ambitious.

""I’m a pragmatist,"" Slotkin said in a recent statement. ""While I agree with the need to reduce carbon emissions, I believe that setting a 10-year goal to go totally carbon-free, as is currently specified in the Green New Deal, does not set us up for success – particularly given the range of energy sources that communities and industries rely on.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has kept her distance from the Green New Deal, referring to the plan in an interview last month as “the green dream or whatever they call it.""

An aide for House Democrats said Tuesday that there was no timetable to bring the Green New Deal to the floor for a vote.

Spurred by government reports warning of drastic consequences, Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., unveiled the nonbinding plan in February.

It calls not only for combating climate change by eliminating carbon emissions and remolding the economy to one powered by renewable fuels, but also prescribes a broad social justice platform advocating for free housing, medical coverage and higher education for all Americans.

Most of the major Democratic presidential hopefuls have endorsed the proposal, which has drawn 100 co-sponsors in Congress.

Republican leaders on Capitol Hill deride the Green New Deal as a far-left gambit that would bankrupt the country.

They consider it so politically advantageous that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is vowing to bring the measure to the Senate floor – an unusual step considering the Kentucky Republican spends much of his energy preventing legislation he opposes from getting a vote.

The bill will be brought for a vote ""to give everybody an opportunity to go on record to see how they feel about the Green New Deal,"" McConnell said recently.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., acknowledges the Green New Deal doesn't have universal backing in his caucus.

But ""Democrats believe strongly that we have to do something about climate change,"" he told reporters Tuesday. ""There are different views as to what we should do, but we're united in the fact that we should do something.""

Public opinion polling has been limited on the Green New Deal, but support to act against climate change appears to be growing.

Seven in 10 Americans (73 percent) believe global warming is happening, an increase of 10 percentage points since March 2015, compared with14 percent who don't, according to a report in January by Yale University in Connecticut and George Mason University in Virginia.

""Americans who think global warming is happening outnumber those who think it isn’t by more than a 5-to-1 ratio,"" the report concluded.

Slotkin, the Michigan congresswoman, said it's important not to overshoot, especially when only bipartisan solutions will pass Congress and be signed into law over the next two years.

""With an issue this urgent, we must focus both on big, bold initiatives, as well as on concrete steps we can take in the near-term,"" she said. ""This means building from areas where we have the most common ground.""

Despite the numerous controversies that have enveloped the administration since its inception – and the risk that the drumbeat of negative coverage could turn off supporters in 2020 – new presidential rally data, shared with Fox News, is boosting campaign hopes.

OPINION: THIS IS TRUMP'S BEST MESSAGE GOING INTO 2020 (AND HE DIDN'T EVEN WRITE IT)

""President Trump’s clear record of accomplishment for the American people should appeal to all voters, including those who did not vote in 2016,” said Kayleigh McEnany, newly named press secretary for the Trump campaign. ""Thanks to President Trump, Americans are now benefiting from new jobs, bigger paychecks, leadership on the world stage, and the confirmation of Constitution-abiding judges.”

The Republican National Committee’s analysis of data from the president’s rally in El Paso last month — his first of the year — showed nearly a quarter of those who attended did not vote in any of the past four elections, including 2016. The numbers also showed that another 25 percent of those who attended the rally only voted in one out of the past four elections.

Of those who RSVP’d to the rally, 70 percent were Hispanic and nearly 50 percent were female. Additionally, 60 percent were between 26 and 55 years old, according to the RNC. Party officials see them as new voters available to them in 2020, especially since they were interested enough in Trump to attend a rally.

""Enthusiasm for President Trump's successful agenda is reflected in the tens of thousands of new and non-traditional voters who attend his rallies and donate to us,” RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel in a statement. ""Once these voters show up, the RNC works hand-in-glove with the campaign to keep them involved and ensure they show up for President Trump on election day as well.”

FOX NEWS POLL: MAJORITY THINKS DEMOCRATS HAVE A CHANCE TO UNSEAT TRUMP IN 2020

The RNC is continuing a practice from 2018 to follow up with those who RSVP to rallies with a text, which is usually sent the next day. The text typically includes a link either to voter registration information or a particular policy issue on the GOP’s website.

Republican strategists in key states agree that they’re seeing the potential for new Trump voters, including places like Pennsylvania and Florida.

""In Pennsylvania, there are a significant number of voters who didn’t turn up in 2016 that will show up at the next presidential election [and] will show up in favor of President Trump,” said Charlie Gerow, longtime Republicans strategist in Pennsylvania. Gerow said that some voters may have been unsure of Trump in 2016, but appreciate the administration’s emphasis on opioids, energy and manufacturing jobs and could be persuaded.

In Florida, strategists say that Trump’s strong language against socialism and tough stance against disputed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro will do him favors in a state with a high immigrant population from socialist countries.

""Some of the things that are starting to define 2020 campaign -- and were in the State of the Union speech -- were things like the showdown over socialism,” said Adam Goodman, a Florida Republican strategist. “That gives the president an opening and opportunity.""

To be sure, the embrace by several Democratic presidential candidates of big-government policies like the Green New Deal has emboldened Republicans, arming political operatives with a potent rhetorical weapon going into 2020.

Republicans will certainly have challenges to contend with, though, including the enthusiasm on the Democratic side that won them back the House of Representatives last fall. One Democratic strategist said it’s expected that voters who didn’t engage in 2016 will be more involved in 2020 amid renewed activism, particularly among progressives.

“Look no further than the Women’s March after Donald Trump’s inauguration,” the strategist said. “We’ve engaged a ton of folks that didn’t engage in 2016 and that carried through to 2018 when Democrats made sweeping gains in the governor’s mansions and statehouses.”

The Democratic National Committee is also preparing its ground game early – looking beyond the primary states – so that they have an infrastructure in place for whoever is the nominee. The DNC announced plans to recruit and train college students who are expected to graduate by June 2020 as field organizers across the country, calling it Organization Corps 2020.

“We know that the key to defeating Donald Trump in 2020 is to organize early and put the best team in place to motivate Democratic voters to make their voices heard,” DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement announcing the new initiative.

Another concern for Republicans remains the president’s polling numbers, with his approval ratings rising but still underwater at 44 percent, according to Gallup. The partial government shutdown was widely seen as a reputational blow for Republicans, including the Trump administration.

Other recent polling reflects a mixed picture. A Fox News poll in December, taken before the shutdown began, showed a strong 67 percent of Trump voters would definitely vote for him again in 2020. Still, up to 10 percent said they would probably or definitely vote for someone else – meaning the Trump re-election campaign could lose a fraction of its 2016 support, even as it identifies and wins over new supporters.

Democrats are already pointing to the president’s approval rating as evidence the president’s re-election outlook looks bleak.

“As we head into 2020, it's clear that Donald Trump will struggle with his re-election campaign with an approval rating barely breaking 40 percent,” said Sabrina Singh, a DNC spokesperson. “We will continue to harness that same energy we saw in 2018 by putting organizers on the ground early to engage in their communities and expand the electorate.""","Trump campaign sees potential for new 2020 supporters, in rally turnout - Fox News",Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-campaign-sees-potential-for-new-2020-supporters-in-rally-turnout

While the issue of marijuana legalization and decriminalization was once a source of division among the Democratic Party, it has since become a mainstream stance among most Democrats, especially those running on platforms revolving around criminal justice reform.

Recreational marijuana is now legal in 10 states and the District of Columbia. A total of 33 states have approved marijuana use for medicinal purposes.

Under the Trump administration and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Department of Justice has aggressively cracked down on marijuana operations in states that have legalized the drug — making marijuana a prominent issue in the 2020 presidential election.

So far, nearly every single declared Democratic presidential candidate and one potential Republican contender have come out in support of both decriminalization and legalization of marijuana at the federal level.

New Jersey Senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker formally introduced the Marijuana Justice Act, an ambitious piece of legislation that aims to de-classify marijuana's status as a schedule one drug and expunge thousands of federal marijuana possession convictions.

Other presidential candidates, including Sens. Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Bernie Sanders, signed on to the legislation as co-sponsors.

And last year, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren put forth the bipartisan STATES Act with GOP Sen. Cory Gardner, which would prohibit the DOJ from prosecuting the use and commercial sale of marijuana in states that have legalized the drug.

While it is rare that an incumbent president faces a serious primary challenger, the few times it happened in the 20th century, it divided the party and drew out a process that was supposed to be a breeze.

Now, after a tumultuous two years in the White House, President Donald Trump is facing the prospect of a primary challenger, or perhaps several.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld launched an exploratory committee to examine a run for president on the Republican ticket. Weld, who in 2016 was the vice-presidential nominee on the Libertarian Party ticket, has characterized Trump as unstable and unfit to be president.

""To compound matters, our president is simply too unstable to carry out the duties of the highest executive office — which include the specific duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed — in a competent and professional matter,"" Weld said at an event in New Hampshire upon announcing his exploratory committee. ""He is simply in the wrong place.""

Several other Republicans are mulling challenges against Trump from a centrist position, including Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who unsuccessfully ran for the GOP nomination in 2016.

Primary challenges against sitting presidents typically weaken them. There are several examples of Republicans and Democrats mounting insurgent bids that ultimately resulted in their party's president failing to secure another term — even if they do not even come close to winning the nomination.

Bush vs. Buchanan Patrick Buchanan in 1992. Steve Liss/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images

An examination of the 1992 Republican presidential primary is a somewhat of a reverse of the situation that Trump could soon find himself in.

Patrick Buchanan, a former senior aide to both President Richard Nixon and President Ronald Reagan, mounted a primary challenge against Bush. Buchanan ran from nationalist, right-wing approach. He was much further to the right than Bush, promoting a nationalist, populist agenda against what many on the right viewed as a weak-kneed globalist.

""But by espousing positions on trade, immigration and the role of the United States in the world, views tinged with a kind of isolationism and protectionism that are anathema to many free-market and globalist conservatives, Mr. Buchanan is seen by some as an imperfect spear with which to impale the President,"" The New York Times' Steven Holmes wrote in 1992.

Buchanan's challenge rattled the Bush campaign. While Buchanan never defeated Bush in any of the primary races, he produced strong results and, in some cases, exposed ideological rifts within the Republican Party, including in the early primary state of New Hampshire.

Bush would go on to lose his reelection fight against Bill Clinton.

Kennedy vs. Carter

When Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy challenged Jimmy Carter in 1980, the US economy was not in top shape, prompting questions about Carter's strength and ability to win reelection.

Carter and Kennedy were at odds for quite some time. But the primary race brought that bad blood to the forefront of American politics.

Kennedy would go on to severely damage Carter in the primary, winning 12 states compared with Carter's 29.

Kennedy, who remained in the Senate and died in 2009, eventually acknowledged he would not win the primary and bowed out of the race. But Carter would go on to lose to Ronald Reagan, who was the California governor at the time.

Before Reagan defeated Carter in 1980, he mounted a primary challenge against President Gerald Ford, who had recently taken over as the commander in chief in the wake of the Watergate scandal and the resignation of Richard Nixon.

Ford, who was appointed vice president after the resignation of Spiro Agnew, became president in the most unconventional way. Less than one year before becoming president, Ford was the House minority leader.

The scandal-ridden administration that collapsed as a result of Watergate opened the door for an insurgent primary challenge. Reagan gave Ford a run for his money during the primary but fell short of the number of delegates needed to win the nomination outright.

Then at the 1976 Republican National Convention in Kansas City, Missouri, Reagan contested Ford's nomination. Ford won the nomination, but delegates replaced Vice President Nelson Rockefeller's nomination with Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.

Ford ultimately lost to Carter in the general election.

Other primary challenges created problems for incumbents

A handful of other instances of primary challengers attempting to oust incumbent presidents have shaken up races but have done far less damage.

When Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota challenged President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 at the height of the Vietnam War, the Democratic Party devolved into chaos, ultimately leading to the complete restructuring of the primary system for the following presidential election.

New York Sen. Robert Kennedy then challenged Johnson for the Democratic nomination, too. What followed became one of the most chaotic primary campaigns in US history.

Johnson bowed out of the race and was replaced at the top of the ticket by Vice President Hubert Humphrey.

The night he secured victory in the California Democratic primary, Kennedy was assassinated by Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian-Jordanian national angered by Kennedy's support for Israel.

Humphrey would go on to become the nominee at the Democratic National Convention and lose to Richard Nixon.

Whether Trump will face the same fate as so many other incumbent presidents who faced primary challengers is still unclear. But recent polling shows there is indeed an appetite for someone who is not Trump within the Republican Party, albeit a still relatively small one.",No sitting president has survived a serious primary challenge in the past 50 years.

Michael Cohen, once the president’s personal lawyer, told the House Committee on Oversight and Reform of misbehavior and possibly criminal conduct on the part of his former client ranging from paying off mistresses and lying about a real estate deal in Moscow to inflating the value of his assets for insurance purposes and deflating them when paying his taxes.

Yet Mr. Cohen testified that he had no evidence of collusion between Donald Trump and Russia and was never explicitly ordered by Mr. Trump to lie to Congress. Mr. Cohen had inferred, however, that Mr. Trump wanted him to lie. Mr. Cohen’s lies under oath are one of the reasons he is headed to a federal prison.

For all the sensationalism and political excitement of Mr. Cohen’s testimony, it is worth remembering that Mr. Trump has not, in fact, been found guilty of any crime, something that cannot be said about his former lawyer. Would any of the president’s critics credit Mr. Cohen’s veracity if he were testifying in support of his former employer, rather than against him? Whatever you think about Donald Trump, Michael Cohen simply is not an honest person. The idea that he suddenly becomes one as soon as he has something bad to say about the president is far-fetched, to say the least.

High-profile congressional hearings are show business, and this one was no exception. It bears comparison with the highly politicized hearings that a Republican-controlled Congress held during the Obama administration, looking into such matters as arms sales to Mexican drug cartels as part of a botched sting strategy by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (Operation Fast and Furious) and conflicting State Department claims about the circumstances of the 2012 attack by Islamist militants on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. The latter saw Republicans in 2015 call the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton to testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi.

As opposed to primary elections, a handful of states use a unique system called caucuses.

Read more:Here's everyone who has officially announced they are running for president in 2020

Primary elections are quite simple. Voters show up to their polling place, whether it is a school, library, or elsewhere, and check the box for the candidate of their choice.

But not all primaries are the same. Some are ""open"" elections, meaning that any voter can show up and pick a candidate from any party. If you vote Republican and plan to do so in the general election regardless of who the Democratic nominee is, you can still weigh in on the field of candidates when it is your state's turn to pick.

But not all states have open primaries. Many are ""closed"" primary elections, meaning that you can only cast a ballot in the primary of the party for which you are registered. For example, if you are a registered Republican, you might only be able to check a box next to Trump's name — or you might have another option if he draws a successful enough opponent from within the GOP.

Iowa is not the only state that conducts caucuses instead of primaries

Caucuses are different than primaries for a number of reasons. You do not simply show up, check a box, and leave with an ""I voted"" sticker.

The process can take hours, as voters will gather at a venue to hear out supporters of various candidates, debate issues, and ultimately come to a conclusion about which person will make the best presidential nominee. Voters will select delegates who will represent them at the party's annual convention in the summer.

When voters arrive at the venue, which can be anywhere from a high school gymnasium to a restaurant, supporters of certain candidates will break off into groups, including groups for undecided voters. Then voters, who are typically activists and very politically engaged, will plead their case to everyone about why their preferred candidate is the best choice.

With a large field of candidates and a diverse spectrum of ideology in the Democratic race, this could take all night.

And most caucuses have a threshold to earn delegates, meaning that a candidate might need 15 percent or more of the votes to be awarded delegates. For instance, Ted Cruz earned eight delegates in the 2017 Iowa caucuses, while Donald Trump and Marco Rubio each earned seven, respectively.

Iowa is the most famous, but nine states as well as three United States territories conduct caucuses in lieu of a primary election. Caucuses also vary by party as well. As an example, Kentucky has a Democratic primary but Republican caucuses. In addition, several states have switched to primaries for 2020, like Minnesota and Colorado.

The states with caucuses are:

Iowa

Alaska

Nevada

North Dakota

Kansas

Wyoming

Hawaii

Kentucky (Republican only)

Maine

Washington (Democratic only)

The US territories conducting caucuses are:

American Samoa

The US Virgin Islands

Guam

Caucuses were used by most states until the 1970s. The Democratic Party created the McGovern-Fraser Commission, which reformed the nomination process after what was largely viewed as a political catastrophe in the 1968 presidential election, when Hubert Humphrey lost to Republican Richard Nixon.

""Pressure from party activists at the convention resulted in the creation of the McGovern-Fraser Commission, which proceeded to rewrite the party's roles between 1969 and 1970,"" wrote Scott Piroth in a journal for the University of Vermont. ""The Commission mandated that all national convention delegates had to be chosen in forums that were open to all party members and conducted within the calendar year of the election. States holding primaries had to place the names of qualified candidates on the ballot, and the distribution of convention delegates would be proportional, in order to reflect the results of such primaries.""

Since the reforms, caucuses have dwindled and disappeared over the past several decades. But in a large field of candidates, the caucuses could end up being a major strategic advantage for Democrats looking to make gains without a lot of name recognition.","Here are the key differences between primaries and caucuses, and which states use each",Business Insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/primaries-caucuses-differences-between-which-states-2019-3

Maybe you heard: Communist Cuba is on the road to freedom.

That’s what Cuba’s rulers want you to think after the Cuban people overwhelmingly approved a new constitution on Sunday. But the opposite is true. Cuba’s rulers have only cemented their control, and the Cuban people are no closer to freedom today.

Just look at the process that created this new constitution, which was anything but democratic. It began last summer when the National Assembly established a commission to draft the text. The Assembly claims to represent the Cuban people, but its most recent election fielded a party-approved candidate in each of its 612 races. The electorate could only vote yes or no. Every Communist candidate won.

As for the commission, it consisted of 33 hardline Communist loyalists, chaired by none other than First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba Raul Castro. Its only goal was to safeguard the tyrannical one-party state, which it accomplished by drafting a charter that makes socialism in Cuba “irrevocable.”

Ultimately, the new constitution is little more than a public-relations stunt. Like the Soviet constitution of old, it has freedom-friendly language on paper that disappears in reality.

More commentary: Venezuela was my home, and socialism destroyed it. Slowly, it will destroy America, too.

Green New Deal’s 55 promises that have little to do with climate change: The full list

Are you really into socialism? You're probably not.

For example, the document ostensibly recognizes private property for the first time. This is a meaningless clause considering the constitution also reiterates the “irrevocable” role of central planning and state control over production and land use. Nor can there be any meaningful protection of private property in a country that refuses to recognize the concept of individual rights.

Cuba's fake rights

Similarly, the text appears to restore the presumption of innocence in Cuban courts and the right to legal representation. This, too, is a dead letter. All lawyers and judges serve at the pleasure of the Communist Party and follow its dictates. The regime also routinely ignores those due process obligations that already exist in Cuban law, including the right to petition the authorities with grievances, and has arrested and imprisoned thousands of political prisoners without formal charges in recent years.

Finally, the constitution seems to place constraints on Cuba’s president, restricting the position to two consecutive terms and creating a new and co-equal office of prime minister. But the true ruler of the country — as in all Marxist systems from China to North Korea — is the party’s first secretary. In Cuba, it’s Raul Castro. There are still no checks and balances on this all-powerful position; the Castro family continues to control every facet of Cuban life.

These and other so-called reforms are little more than a colorful new paint job on the same rusty old Communist architecture. The structure underneath is still a totalitarian state that bans political parties, imprisons and harasses dissenters, and denies the Cuban people’s most basic human rights.

Nothing will change

Tellingly, the constitution omitted any reference to the freedom of conscience. The regime actively tried to prevent Christians from speaking out or even participating in the referendum.

Then again, the referendum itself was a ploy by Havana to legitimize its rule and disarm foreign critics. It left pro-freedom Cubans in a lose-lose situation. They could either vote no in an election with a pre-ordained outcome or refuse to participate altogether, giving the regime a lopsided victory either way. The U.S. media is lauding the 9% who voted no — a historic high — but that number is highly suspect for a dictatorship that craved a democratic veneer. Havana could very well have pulled it out of a hat.

Meanwhile, for the Cuban people, nothing will change.

The regime will laud this new step in the revolution’s struggle, even as its subjects struggle to survive in a nation defined by poverty. Last week, I spoke with Rosa María Payá, a Cuban activist whose father Oswaldo Payá founded a movement opposed to the Communist Party. The regime assassinated him in 2012, and now his daughter tells me the new constitution only “guarantees the perpetuation of the dictatorship.”

Rosa María believes the Cuban people deserve a real referendum, which she advocates through an initiative known as Cuba Decide. Tens of thousands of her fellow citizens have joined her to call on Havana to hold a yes-or-no vote — not on a Communist constitution, but on the Communist Party itself.

The regime will never let such a vote happen because it fears nothing more than the Cuban people. Instead, it staged a rigged referendum to fool the world and fortify its rule. The new constitution is a charter of renewed tyranny, not liberty, and so long as the Communist Party reigns in Havana, Cuba will never be free.

“The grassroots spoke, the DNC listened,” crowed the headline on DailyKos, whose founder Markos Moulitsas argued that letting Fox News host the debate was akin to allowing President Donald Trump himself to ask the questions.

In rejecting Fox, however, the DNC also gave up a shot at reaching cable news’ largest audience for a night of live, unedited pitches on how the crowded and experienced field of candidates would fix the country’s problems.

As Republican strategist Evan Siegfried noted, for Democrats to win states like Ohio and Michigan in 2020, they are going to need folks who watch Fox News.

Chairman Tom Perez nodded to this reality in his announcement. “I believe that a key pathway to victory is to continue to expand our electorate and reach all voters,” he wrote. But, ultimately, he decided some of the network’s personalities are too cozy with the Trump Administration and could not be trusted.

Perez cited reporting from The New Yorker’s Jane Mayer, who detailed just how much the relationship between the President and his favorite on-air personalities drove much of the Administration’s agenda. “Fox has been both his shield and his sword,” she wrote. Given the anecdotes Mayer uses to illustrate her point, Perez said he had few other choices.

But the choice speaks to the tension inside the Democratic Party at this moment. There is tremendous frustration with Trump and an energy coming from the Left. That’s why folks like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris are already attracting large crowds for their rallies. But there’s also a universal desire to win, even if that means moving slightly toward the center on policy.

Nowhere was this clearer than during a recent breakfast where Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat who is pondering a campaign of his own, found himself dogged by questions about a series of progressive ideas introduced by liberal darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Brown, who has a four-decade record that at times has been further to the Left than most of his fellow Democrats, was clearly frustrated at how party activists were taking their cues from Ocasio-Cortez.

“I won’t individually talk about every time a freshman member of Congress or Presidential candidate comes out with the plan,” he said. “I am not going to take a position on every bill that’s coming out.”

Debates have become intensely watched. The first one of the 2016 cycle — in August of 2015 — drew 24 million viewers, a record. The first of 2020 will be in June of this year on NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo. CNN will host the second debate in July.

And with President Donald Trump unlikely to face a serious primary challenge, they’re also a one-sided opportunity for Democrats to get their message out and counter the White House’s incumbent advantage on dominating the news cycle.

Fox News, in a statement, urged the DNC to reconsider. “We hope the DNC will reconsider its decision to bar Chris Wallace, Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, all of whom embody journalistic integrity and professionalism, from moderating a Democratic presidential debate,” Fox News exec Bill Sammon said. “They’re the best debate team in the business and they offer candidates an important opportunity to make their case to the largest TV news audience in America, which includes many persuadable voters.”

To be fair, Fox News’s programming can at times be a series of contradictions. The journalism on the network can be hard-hitting, as when Ed Henry grilled embattled Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt or Chris Wallace challenged White House adviser Stephen Miller on immigration. But its primetime lineup is made up of opinion-driven anchors who are largely in lock-step with the President.

For the purposes of the debate, however, those pundits were not in contention.

A DNC reconsideration seemed unlikely. Party insiders and Perez’s informal cabinet largely supported the move, arguing that the goal of the debates is to build a large audience of likely voters in a Democratic primary. But the risk, of course, is surrendering any independent voters in the process.

Judging from the early weeks of the 2020 campaign, it seems the Democrats are aiming for the party’s loyal and loud grassroots for now.

The former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic nominee told a New York television station she would not join a crowded field of candidates seeking to challenge President Donald Trump next year.

“I’m not running,” Clinton told News 12 Westchester. “But I’m going to keep on working and speaking and standing up for what I believe.”

The definitive announcement leaves the Democratic field wide open, with at least a few major names still deciding if they’ll throw their hats in the ring. Some lawmakers have already seen an early wave of support, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who raised nearly $6 million in the first 24 hours after announcing his campaign. Sanders had been Clinton’s main primary opponent in 2016.

Clinton has been advising several declared or potential candidates, including Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and former Vice President Joe Biden, according to The New York Times. But many had warned that were she to launch her own attempt, Clinton would immediately be a divisive addition to the field after losing to Trump in 2016. Many party members hoped she’d keep a low profile ahead of the midterm elections, citing her low approval rating.

“I’ve told every one of them, don’t take anything for granted, even though we have a long list of real problems and broken promises from this administration that need to be highlighted,” Clinton said. “We have to work really, really hard to make our case to the American people, and I’m going to do everything I can to help the Democrats win back the White House.“

Clinton said Monday that she planned to remain engaged with politics throughout the next election, even if she’s not a candidate herself. She also said she was “thrilled” to see several women launch bids for the White House after her own groundbreaking nomination.

“I want to be sure that people understand I’m going to keep speaking out,” Clinton said. “I’m not going anywhere. What’s at stake in our country, the kind of things that are happening right now are deeply troubling to me. And I’m also thinking hard about how do we start talking and listening to each other again.”

She continued: “We’ve gotten into really opposing camps, unlike anything I’ve ever seen in my adult life.”",‘I’m Not Running’: Clinton Ends Speculation She’ll Vie For White House In 2020,Huffpost.com,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-not-running_n_5c7df9a4e4b0129e36be1e3c

Clinton ran on the Democratic ticket in 2016 and in the 2008 Democratic primaries. She was defeated by Donald Trump in the 2016 general election and then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois in the 2008 primaries.

Trump frequently rails against Clinton, often recalling the personal email server scandal that plagued her 2016 presidential campaign. In August 2018, Trump fueled a theory, first reported by the Daily Caller, that China may have ""hacked Hillary Clinton's private email server.""

Sixteen hours after Trump's claim, an FBI official said the organization ""has not found any evidence the (Clinton) servers were compromised.""

The Democratic Party has officially ruled out letting Fox News host one of its 2020 presidential primary debates. Democratic National Chairman Tom Perez had raised the possibility of picking the conservative network as a debate host earlier this year, but he said Wednesday that a recent blockbuster exposé convinced him to scrap the idea. “Recent reporting in the New Yorker on the inappropriate relationship between President Trump, his administration and Fox News has led me to conclude that the network is not in a position to host a fair and neutral debate for our candidates,” Perez said in a statement first provided to the Washington Post. “Therefore, Fox News will not serve as a media partner for the 2020 Democratic primary debates.”

Good call.

Democrats never had any reason to trust Fox to give them a fair shake in the first place. Now that should be crystal clear in the wake of Jane Mayer’s report documenting in detail how the conservative network has moved from partisanship toward propaganda in the age of Trump. Among the conflicts she reported in the New Yorker this week: During the 2016 GOP primary, network brass may have tipped Trump off about questions ahead of Fox-hosted debates; during the 2016 general election, Fox killed a story about Trump’s relationship with Stormy Daniels; and during Trump’s first year in office, the president ordered Gary Cohn to pressure the Justice Department to pursue an antitrust case involving Time Warner, the parent company of Fox rival CNN, allegedly as political payback.

You don’t need to take Mayer’s reporting as gospel to see that Fox has a vested interest in keeping Trump in the White House, where he routinely receives formal and informal advice from Fox veterans past and present. Likewise, you can believe that Chris Wallace and Bret Baier are respectable journalists and still have serious doubts whether, as debate moderators, they would have been the ones truly running the show. And you can also think Democrats should make a more concerted effort to reach new audiences and still believe there are better ways to do that—off the top of my head: travel to Wisconsin—than by lending legitimacy to a network that helped spread debunked and dangerous conspiracy theories about everything from Obama’s birthplace to child sex rings to the 2016 murder of former DNC staffer Seth Rich.

The decision has some drawbacks. If Fox News is state media, then more Americans watch state media than any other cable network. A Fox-hosted debate would have offered Democrats a platform to speak directly to an audience they almost never reach unfiltered. Winning over loyal Fox viewers wouldn’t have been easy, but simply making the overture might help with those swing voters who are exhausted by partisanship. Similarly, Democrats are now opening themselves up to criticism that they’re afraid to take serious questions from conservative media. Never mind that Republicans pulled out of a 2016 primary debate with NBC after their candidates didn’t like the questions CNBC moderators asked at a previous debate or that the White House press briefing has become a thing of the past under Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

It’s unclear how seriously the DNC was considering giving Fox one of the debate slots even before the New Yorker story broke. Fox hosted back-to-back town halls with Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton during the 2016 primary, but the last time the network hosted an official Democratic debate was 2004. (During the 2008 cycle, the DNC pulled the plug on a planned Fox debate after then-Chairman Roger Ailes made an Osama Bin Laden-themed joke about Obama.) What makes Perez’s decision stand out, though, is how he made it. The DNC plans to hold 12 primary debates but so far it has selected media partners for only the first two: NBC (and its sister networks) and CNN. Perez, then, could have simply waited until he had selected the remaining 10 debate hosts, ruling out Fox by omission in the process. Instead, he seized a moment that offered the easiest out the DNC is likely to get and that simultaneously maximizes the New Yorker story’s damage to Fox and Trump. If this fight with Fox was unavoidable, then Perez was smart to throw the first punch.",Democrats Made the Right Call to Reject Fox News as a Debate Host,Slate.com,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/03/fox-dnc-debate-smart.html

The following essay is adapted from an episode of The Gist, a daily podcast from Slate about news, culture, and whatever else you’re discussing with your family and friends.

In late 2016, Barack Obama dismissed the idea of reparations during an interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates, saying: “As a practical matter, it is hard to think of any society in human history in which a majority population has said that as a consequence of historic wrongs, we are now going to take a big chunk of the nation’s resources over a long period of time to make that right.” The president went on to note, wisely, “It’s hard to find the model in which you can practically administer and sustain political support for those kinds of efforts.”

Further, he went on to say that he was “not so optimistic as to think you would ever be able to garner a majority of the American Congress that would make those kinds of investments above and beyond the kind of investments that could be made in a progressive program for lifting up all people.”

To strip the blessedly nuanced argument to its essentials, Obama is saying that he opposes reparations because a) they would be unfeasible; b) they would be unpopular; and c) their beneficial effects can be achieved in a different, better, more realistic, and fairer ways. I agree on all counts and would add that many Obama programs were in fact doing the work of “lifting all people up.”

Let us now consider the answer to the question of reparations that California Sen. and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris gave to Charlamagne tha God on The Breakfast Club radio program:

“Well look, I think that we have got to address that again, it’s back to the inequities. Look, America has a history of 200 years of slavery. We had Jim Crow. We had legal segregation in America. We’ve got to recognize back to that earlier point, people aren’t starting out on the same base, in terms of their ability to succeed. So, we have got to recognize that and give people a lift up.”

There we have it—the door to reparations has been opened by a leading Democratic candidate. Massachusetts Sen. and fellow presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren also voiced support for reparations when she told the the Washington Post of the need to institute “systemic structural changes” to support black families. Add to this chorus candidate Julián Castro’s pledge of support for reparations, and you get this Washington Post headline, “Three 2020 Democrats say yes to race-based reparations,” and this New York Times headline, “2020 Democrats embrace race-conscious policies, including reparations.”

The headlines are accurate. Castro, Warren, and Harris did indeed answer “yes” when asked the question “Should we institute reparations?” They said yes. When Barack Obama was asked the same thing, he answered, “No.” Despite that fundamental diametric disagreement, all of these Democratic politicians then endorsed the same exact same approach. They proposed broad programs that would help poor communities—programs that would benefit many, many black people.

But that is not reparations. Those are broad social programs that the Democratic Party has been championing for ages, programs that are often thwarted by Republican majorities and legislatures. The real meaning of reparations is to identify the descendants of slaves and to say to them, “Here is some money,” or, “Here are some goods or programs that we should give you as a country because of your race and our history.”

I happen to think reparations are a bad idea. Mostly because, as per the argument of Barack Obama, they are impractical, unpopular, and probably disastrous to the electoral viability of any candidate that seriously proposed them, which is why no Democrat is seriously proposing them.

Warren and Harris have good, interesting programs for the poor and the historically discriminated against. They’re just not reparations. They are not saying, “You descend from a slave, here is some restitution money.” Reparations in Germany actually happened. In 1952, as part of the Luxembourg agreement between West Germany and Israel, the government of West Germany agreed to a plan to pay survivors of the Holocaust. The first payments of over almost $8 billion in today’s dollars went to Israel, where hundreds of thousands of Germany’s victims had settled.

Even today, anyone who can prove they were in a concentration camp, ghetto, or hid from the Nazis—or were a fetus as their mother suffered such persecution—is eligible to receive 2,500 euros. In 1988, the U.S. Congress voted to give reparations to the precise Japanese people who were interned during World War II. There were still tens of thousands of them alive, and each survivor of internment received $20,000 until 1999 when the government ended the program, having spent $1.6 billion.

Nothing like that is being proposed here. Neither of the aforementioned programs paid money to the heirs of victims—you needed to be a victim (or a fetus) who directly suffered. It’s been 150 years since slavery ended in the United States, and the legacy still stains the national character, rends the national soul, and continues to unfairly stymie the progress of millions of Americans. But finding an actual administrable, sensible, workable, fair government program to address in monetary terms that historic injustice is seemingly impossible task. It’s also sure to be an unpopular one.

I can’t imagine reparations passing Congress. I also can’t imagine the specter of DNA testing to qualify for reparations, arguments over whose family immigrated from Nigeria 50 years ago, versus who could trace their lineage back 200 years—or a requirement that funding from the bottom three quintiles of white society, where the average income is $38,000, be provided in part to the top quintile of black America, where the average income is $155,000. I can’t imagine the government telling Latino Americans, “Sorry, not discriminated against enough.” I furthermore can’t imagine them telling Latino people who are black, “Sorry, your ancestors were brought to this hemisphere as part of the slave trade, but not to America.”

The candidates clearly realize these landmines are scattered about. That’s why they’re not proposing actual programs for actual reparations in the sense that the term is actually used. They are answering the question “Do you believe in reparations?” by saying, “Yes, we do, and here is my broad program to help black people.” Barack Obama answered the question, “Do you believe in reparations?” by saying, “No, I don’t, and here’s my broad program to help black people.”

What those different answers, buttressed by similar proposals, tell me is that the candidates’ perceptions of Democratic voters have radically shifted, and most candidates aren’t eager to let an opponent of theirs stake out a position to the left of them. We’re also dealing with candidates who don’t have the confidence of Barack Obama to match their rhetoric with their programs. Obama knew he was disappointing a lot of Democrats and a lot of people in the African-American community. He was fine with it. Warren and Harris are not, though Harris, post Da Breakfast Club interview, seems to have backtracked or at least obfuscated when asked to provide a yes or no answer to the reparations question.

Granted, the 2020 Democrats are running in a different age against a different background and a different set of opponents. But if they think they’re going to win a primary by telling potential voters what they think the voters want to hear, and then not match those words with actual programs, I think they damage their credibility and hurt their chances. There might be no repairing that.

257,Empty,2019-03-07T16:40:00Z,"With candidates angling to appeal to an increasingly left-leaning Democratic electorate, the former New York City mayor never had a realistic chance of winning the Democratic nomination.","The 2020 Presidential election is still twenty months away, but the field for the Democratic primary is already taking shape. Earlier this week, John Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado, announced that he is running, bringing the number of confirmed candidates to a dozen or so. Two other possible entrants indicated that they are staying out: Jeff Merkley, the two-term liberal senator from Oregon, and Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York. Bloomberg’s announcement got the most attention. Arguably, however, it was Merkley’s decision not to enter the Democratic contest that said the most about how the race is shaping up, and how crowded it has already become.

Despite what Bloomberg’s handsomely rewarded political consultants may have told him, he never had a realistic chance of winning the Democratic nomination. He only just rejoined the Democratic Party last year. Although he is widely regarded as having been a competent mayor, Democratic primary voters aren’t in the mood to nominate a former Republican billionaire with strong pro-business views who virtually bought the mayoralty in 2001. (He spent five times as much as his opponent, Mark Green.) Despite his high name recognition, Bloomberg got just two per cent in the latest opinion poll of likely voters in the Democratic primary.

On the face of it, a Merkley candidacy might have had more potential. At the age of sixty-two, he is an articulate liberal who rose from a humble background and still lives in a blue-collar neighborhood. As the speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives, from 2006 to 2008, he helped lead the campaign to grant equal legal rights to same-sex couples. In the U.S. Senate, which he entered in 2009, his record on issues such as Wall Street reform, income inequality, L.G.B.T. rights, and political corruption mark him as one of the Senate’s most liberal Democrats. (In 2016, he was the only Democratic senator to endorse Bernie Sanders.) Last year, he was one of the first Democrats to travel to the southern border as the Trump Administration enforced a policy of separating migrant families.

In earlier election cycles, someone like Merkley could have emerged as the standard-bearer for progressive Democrats. But that ground is now so crowded that Merkley appears to have decided that there wasn’t space for him. In a video announcing his decision not to run, Merkley pointed to “three great crises” that threaten America: a “political crisis” of voter suppression and dark money; an “economic crisis” marked by the lack of opportunity for middle-class families; and a “climate crisis” endangering forests, farms, and fisheries. Had Merkley entered the race, his record would have given him the credibility to highlight these issues, but he wouldn’t have been the only one doing so. As he pointed out in his video, “There are Democrats now in the Presidential race who are speaking to the importance of tackling the big challenges we face.""

Who are these candidates speaking Merkley’s language? At the left end of the progressive axis, Sanders is running again, and is sure to be a potent force: this past weekend, more than ten thousand people turned out at Brooklyn College to hear him speak. Senator Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, another populist firebrand, and an ally of Merkley’s in the effort to beef up regulation on Wall Street, has been running since January. (Before launching her campaign, she proposed a distinctive plan to reshape corporate charters and appoint worker-representatives to corporate boards of directors.)

But Sanders and Warren aren’t the only candidates courting the Party’s left-liberal base. Senator Kamala Harris, of California, who entered the Senate four years after Merkley did, launched her campaign by proposing three trillion dollars of tax credits for middle-class families. Harris has also endorsed Sanders’s Medicare for All proposal and the Green New Deal resolution that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey proposed. So has Senator Cory Booker, of New Jersey, who has long been regarded as a centrist.

You can go down the candidate list. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York, who started out her political career as a centrist upstate Democrat, now supports Medicare for All, and she has also proposed a federal jobs guarantee. Julián Castro, of Texas, who was the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Obama Administration, has endorsed Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, and he has also proposed universal pre-K.

The key message of all this, and of Merkley’s decision not to run, is that, at this stage, the distinctions among most of the Demoratic candidates aren’t as important as the similarities. The majority have endorsed a strikingly progressive agenda, and if Joe Biden, the former Vice-President, gets into the race—as seems increasingly likely—he will surely do the same thing. Any suggestions that Biden will run as a Clintonite centrist, a throwback to the nineteen-nineties, is off the mark. In recent speeches, Biden has outlined an economic agenda that includes a fifteen-dollar minimum wage, free college education, and enlarged tax credits for middle-class families. As yet, he hasn’t said much about Medicare for All or the Green New Deal. If he does enter the race, he will probably mimic other candidates by expressing support for the general ideas while reserving his position on the details. (On Thursday, the Times reported that Biden’s political strategist, Steve Richetti, “has called a handful of would-be candidates and their aides to signal that the former vice president is likely to enter the race.”)

Among the confirmed runners, the two partial exceptions to the lean-left trend are Senator Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Hickenlooper. Klobuchar is positioning herself as a pragmatic, no-nonsense Midwesterner. Although she has expressed support for universal health insurance and had called for aggressively tackling climate change, she has set more modest goals than the Medicare for All proposal and the Green New Deal, which she described as “aspirational.” Hickenlooper, a former craft-beer entrepreneur who, as governor, was forced to work with Republican legislators in Colorado, is also touting his abilities as a can-do pragmatist.

It remains to be seen how much of a market among Democratic primary voters there is for this style of politics. But the biggest slugfest will be on the center-left, where most of the candidates are clustered. On Thursday, the Ohio senator Sherrod Brown, another well-known Democrat who had been seriously thinking about entering the race, announced that he, too, has decided not to do it. As the campaign develops, some more fault lines are sure to develop, of course. A while ago, I asked the head of a progressive think tank what those fractures are likely to be, and she answered, without hesitation, “In how to pay for it all.”

At this stage, perhaps understandably, most of the candidates aren’t providing many details in this area. Warren is an exception. She has proposed a new wealth tax on the richest seventy-five thousand households in the country, which she says would “produce trillions that can be used to build an economy for everyone, including universal childcare, student debt relief, and down payments on a Green New Deal and Medicare for All.”

Sanders, for his part, has previously proposed raising income taxes on the rich, as well as beefing up the inheritance tax and imposing a tax on financial transactions. Some of his supporters have expressed support for Modern Monetary Theory, a controversial approach that claims the federal government’s power to print money greatly enhances its capacity to spend and invest without necessarily raising taxes. (So far, Sanders hasn’t explicitly endorsed M.M.T.) Harris has said that she would pay for her middle-class tax cuts by reversing the Trump tax cuts and imposing a new levy on big financial institutions. Gillibrand is another supporter of a financial-transactions tax. Virtually all of the candidates support raising taxes on carbon usage.

When the televised debates start, in June, all the candidates will be pressed to provide more details about their policies. For now, they can largely get away with expressing generalizations. But the over-all trend is clear, and it is going in a progressive direction. Given how the American economy has developed over the past forty years, this is perfectly understandable.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Leading House Democrats will offer a resolution Wednesday condemning anti-Semitism in response to Rep. Ilhan Omar's latest remarks on Israel, a senior Democratic aide said.

The declaration, written by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats, comes after Omar's new remarks suggesting American supporters of Israel are pushing people to have ""allegiance to a foreign country."" It's at least the third time the Minnesota Democrat's words have put her colleagues in a more delicate spot than usual on the U.S.-Israel relationship, and the second time in two months that she's drawn a stern backlash from party leaders.

A draft of the resolution does not rebuke Omar, a Somali-American and one of two Muslim women in Congress. But it sets out the history of anti-Semitism and bigotry in America, including anti-Jewish tropes about divided loyalties. The document also rejects bigotry directed against Muslims after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

It says the House ""rejects anti-Semitism as hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States.""

The document is the written embodiment of the bind in which Omar has repeatedly put Democrats who have celebrated her election as part of the history-making class that helped flip control of the House in the November elections. The March edition of Rolling Stone magazine is covered by a photo of Pelosi and the next generation of House women, including Omar.

Omar didn't start the internal Democratic chafing over Israel, and she's not unfamiliar with bigotry. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies are looking into a report of a threatening graffiti message directed at her. She also was the target of an anti-Muslim poster that appeared last week at the West Virginia Capitol in Charleston, with her picture over an image of the World Trade Center's burning towers.

Omar says she's questioning the U.S. relationship with Israel and the influence game in Washington.

Still, senior Democrats were unmistakably wary of dealing with Omar's habit of inflaming a divide in the party over U.S.-Israel relations. Some demanded a retraction and apology from Omar, with one House chairman saying she invoked a ""vile, anti-Semitic slur"" and another congressional veteran tweeting that Omar ""continues to mischaracterize support for Israel.""

""I should not be expected to have allegiance/pledge support to a foreign country in order to serve my country in Congress or serve on committee,"" Omar tweeted back.

Last month, Omar ignited a bipartisan uproar in Washington and Minnesota when she suggested on Twitter that members of Congress are paid by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee to support Israel. AIPAC is a nonprofit organization that works to influence U.S. policy.

Many Jewish leaders denounced her remarks as reviving old stereotypes about Jews, money and power. She soon apologized and said, ""Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes.""

Many progressive Jews rushed to her defense, however, saying it's not inherently anti-Semitic to criticize Israeli government policies or AIPAC. Omar's spokesman, Jeremy Slevin, said she is not criticizing American Jews or their faith, only offering a ""fair critique"" of Israel's powerful lobby.

That episode came after Omar apologized for a 2012 tweet in which she said, ""Israel has hypnotized the world.""

Some have suggested that Omar be stripped of her seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, a move Pelosi and Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. have so far resisted. But Engel's statement on Friday mentioned his panel and conduct becoming a member of the House.

""It's unacceptable and deeply offensive to call into question the loyalty of fellow American citizens because of their political views, including support for the U.S.-Israel relationship,"" Engel said in a statement that also suggested she apologize.

Unlike the previous two incidents, Omar did not apologize this time.

""I am told every day that I am anti-American if I am not pro-Israel. I find that to be problematic and I am not alone,"" Omar tweeted Sunday. ""I just happen to be willing to speak up on it and open myself to attacks.""

For a rising star in the Democratic Party and candidate for president, Julián Castro’s visit to Los Angeles on Monday was strikingly low-key. The former San Antonio mayor and secretary of Housing and Urban Development met with a small group of students at UCLA, where he received a warm welcome, and later sat with immigration-policy faculty at a conference room inside the Luskin School of Public Affairs.

Castro, who looks younger than 44, burst onto the national stage after delivering an impassioned keynote speech during the 2012 Democratic National Convention. Soon after, he joined Obama’s Cabinet and was considered a potential running mate for Hillary Clinton. When Clinton passed—and then lost—Castro was left without a formal platform from which to build a national profile. But that has not deterred him. He is now trying to be the Democratic presidential nominee despite never having won a statewide election.

I first met Castro in Las Vegas a few years back. He struck me as strangely mimetic of Obama: the same grave voice, long pauses, and careful delivery, dressed in an appropriately dark suit. The similarities are not coincidental. Like Obama, Castro has long been thought of as an ideal politician to reach across racial divides. In 2010, after he began his term as mayor of San Antonio, the country’s seventh-most-populous city, the New York Times hurried to label him “the post-Hispanic Hispanic politician.” Castro has relaxed since then: Gone are the ties and the Obama staccato. (He has also polished his Spanish since then. As a third-generation Mexican American from Texas, Castro was not fluent). But he still embraces the broader character that brought him national attention in the first place. When I asked Castro if he thought it indispensable for the Democratic Party to choose either a woman or a Latino politician like himself in 2020, Castro resisted the invitation to advocate for identity politics, instead explaining that the party should “first and foremost” ensure the nominee “is well-qualified, has great ideas for the future of the country, and can represent everybody.”

As we sat inside the office of Gary Segura, dean of the Luskin School and a well-known Latino vote expert and advocate, surrounded by books on immigration and Chicano studies, Castro spoke not of these issues but of a wider agenda that would attract voters far beyond the country’s Southwest. I asked Castro if he thought his candidacy could appeal to disaffected white voters in the Rust Belt. After acknowledging that the size of the Democratic field would be a daunting challenge, Castro described an “inclusive vision” with ambitious aims. “I can get support even from some people who voted for Donald Trump,” Castro said. “I believe I can go into Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and win those states back, that I can go get the electoral votes that we lost very closely in 2016.”

Castro told me he sees himself as the “antithesis” of Trump, particularly on immigration issues. He has called Trump’s border wall “the definition of insanity.” In Los Angeles, I asked him about Trump’s policy on Central American refugees and the willingness of the new government of Mexico to collaborate with the president’s punitive policies. “I was surprised that the Mexican government cooperated with President Trump,” Castro told me. “If a family has traveled thousands of miles, they never expected to end up in Mexico. I believe they should have the opportunity to seek asylum under national and international law and to do that in the United States.”

Castro has long been thought of as an ideal politician to reach across racial divides.

On other foreign policy matters, Castro fell into a familiar trap among Democratic progressive politicians. When I asked him whether he recognized Juan Guaidó as the legitimate interim president of Venezuela, he vacillated. “I think that the people of Venezuela should have the opportunity to recognize Guaidó and that he has, under the Constitution, this sort of interim status,“ he told me. The same thing happened when I asked Castro if he considered Nicolás Maduro a dictator. “He has failed the people of Venezuela. I’m not shedding a tear for Maduro,” Castro replied.

When I pushed back, asking for clarification on whether Maduro should indeed be regarded plainly as a dictator, Castro tiptoed around the definition, much like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have in recent weeks. “I believe he has acted like a dictator. I have no love for Maduro,” Castro said.

Julián Castro’s identity as an inclusive, progressive politician who can appeal to voters beyond the Latino community will face its two biggest tests in Iowa and New Hampshire, less than a year from now. If Castro’s candidacy survives those contests, where the Hispanic share of the electorate is still small, he will get a chance to come back south, to Nevada, and, crucially, California, where he will face steep competition from, among others, Sen. Kamala Harris, who’s vying to become the first-ever Democratic candidate from the country’s most populous and most immigrant-rich state. If Castro somehow manages to sneak past Harris, his improbable journey might yet continue.",The Mayor Makes His Move,Slate.com,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/03/julian-castro-2020-profile.html

A Republican event in the West Virginia state capitol Friday sparked controversy as “WVGOP Day” sponsored by the state Republican Party included an Islamophobic display linking one of the first Muslim congresswoman in U.S. history to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The poster displayed in the capitol rotunda depicted newly elected Democratic congresswoman Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota underneath the twin towers burning on Sept. 11th with the caption “’Never forget’ — You said… I am the proof you have forgotten.”

The poster sparked a furor in the capitol and “caused the resignation of at least one staff member and left another reportedly injured when things got physical as the altercation spilled into the chamber of the West Virginia House of Delegates,” the Washington Post reports. “Photos of the poster showed it next to a placard promoting ACT for America, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated an anti-Muslim hate group.” ACT for America said on Twitter that they were not responsible for the display that led to the resignation of Sergeant at Arms Anne Lieberman, who Democratic legislators said called all Muslims “terrorists” during the chaotic aftermath.

No wonder why I am on the “Hitlist” of a domestic terrorist and “Assassinate Ilhan Omar” is written on my local gas stations.

Pelosi defended Omar and says she does not believe the new c…","WASHINGTON (AP) — Divided in debate but mostly united in a final vote, the House passed a resolution condemning anti-Semitism and other bigotry Thursday, with Democrats trying to push past a dispute that has overwhelmed their agenda and exposed fault lines that could shadow them through next year's elections.

The one-sided 407-23 vote belied the emotional infighting over how to respond to freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar's recent comments suggesting House supporters of Israel have dual allegiances. For days, Democrats wrestled with whether or how to punish the lawmaker, arguing over whether Omar, one of two Muslim women in Congress, should be singled out, what other types of bias should be decried in the text and whether the party would tolerate dissenting views on Israel.

Republicans generally joined in the favorable vote, though nearly two-dozen opposed the measure, one calling it a ""sham.""

Generational as well as ideological, the argument was fueled in part by young, liberal lawmakers — and voters — who have become a face of the newly empowered Democratic majority in the House. These lawmakers are critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, rejecting the conservative leader's approach to Palestinians and other issues.

They split sharply from Democratic leaders who seemed caught off guard by the support for Omar and unprepared for the debate. But the leaders regrouped.

""It's not about her. It's about these forms of hatred,"" Speaker Nancy Pelosi said before the vote.

The resolution approved Thursday condemns anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against minorities ""as hateful expressions of intolerance."" Omar, a Somali-American, and fellow Muslims Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Andrew Carson of Indiana, issued a statement praising the ""historic"" vote as the first resolution to condemn ""anti-Muslim bigotry.""

Some Democrats complained that Omar's comments on Israel had ignited all this debate while years of President Donald Trump's racially charged rhetoric had led to no similar congressional action.

The seven-page document details a history of recent attacks not only against Jews in the United States but also Muslims, as it condemns all such discrimination as contradictory to ""the values and aspirations"" of the people of the United States. The vote was delayed for a time on Thursday to include mention of Latinos to address concerns of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. It was inserted under a section on white supremacists who ""weaponize hate for political gain"" over a long list of ""traditionally persecuted peoples.""

An earlier version focused more narrowly on anti-Semitism. The final resolution did not mention Omar by name.

Getting this debate right will be crucial for Democrats in 2020. U.S.-Israel policy is a prominent issue that is exposing the splits between the party's core voters, its liberal flank and the more centrist Americans in Trump country the party hopes to reach.

""What I fear is going on in the House now is an effort to target Congresswoman Omar as a way of stifling that debate. That's wrong,"" said presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent.

""Anti-Semitism is a hateful and dangerous ideology which must be vigorously opposed in the United States and around the world,"" the senator said. ""We must not, however, equate anti-Semitism with legitimate criticism of the right-wing, Netanyahu government in Israel.""

Other Democratic presidential contenders tried to walk a similar line.

California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris said ""we need to speak out against hate."" But she said she also believes ""there is a critical difference between criticism of policy or political leaders, and anti-Semitism.""

A statement from Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said, ""Branding criticism of Israel as automatically anti-Semitic has a chilling effect on our public discourse and makes it harder to achieve a peaceful solution between Israelis and Palestinians."" She said threats of violence, including those made against Omar, ""are never acceptable.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said, ""Everyone is entitled to their opinion, they are allowed to have free speech in this country,"" Gillibrand said. ""But we don't need to use anti-Semitic tropes or anti-Muslim tropes to be heard.""

By Susan Cornwell

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Freshman Democrats determined to walk a centrist path in the U.S. House of Representatives are testing party harmony between moderates and liberals, just as work on major issues including gun control and healthcare policy is getting underway.

Democrats took control of the House from President Donald Trump's fellow Republicans in January thanks in part to party moderates who won seats formerly held by Republicans in November's midterm elections.

But these centrists already have upset some Democratic elders including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the party's liberal wing by voting on occasion with the Republicans during their first couple of months in office. Republicans are in the minority in the House, but control the Senate.

Tensions flared this week after House Republicans managed to successfully amend a gun control bill with votes from 26 Democrats. Many of the Democrats who broke with the party line on Wednesday represent swing districts that had voted for Trump in 2016.

""How did Nancy Pelosi let this happen?"" Justice Democrats, a liberal political action committee that helped elect new Democratic star Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York in November, asked on Twitter after the vote.

The episode highlights the political tightrope being walked by several dozen freshman who helped to clinch the House majority for Democrats in November by expanding into Republican territory. There currently are 235 Democrats, 197 Republicans and three vacancies in the 435-seat House.

The centrists have not gotten as much attention as Ocasio-Cortez during their first months in office, and their differing positions from the party's liberals on policies such as government-run healthcare have at times put them at odds.

They also already have Republicans on their backs for the next election in 2020. Many of the 55 seats Republicans plan to target next year are held by freshman Democratic lawmakers who captured a previously Republican-held seat last year or prevailed in districts Trump won in 2016.

Representative Joe Cunningham, 36, did both when he won a South Carolina district in November that had not elected a Democrat to the House since before he was born. Cunningham defeated Republican rival Katie Arrington by less than 2 percentage points in a district Trump won by 13 percentage points in 2016.

On Wednesday, Cunningham was among the Democrats who supported the Republican amendment calling for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency criticized by liberals like Ocasio-Cortez, to be notified when an illegal immigrant in caught trying to buy a gun.

Cunningham, a gun owner, said the next day he saw the amendment as minor. He added that it should not detract from the fact that the House had passed a gun control measure for the first time in two decades, calling for universal background checks on gun purchases.

In an interview on Tuesday, Cunningham was unapologetic for sometimes siding with Republicans. He has done it around a dozen times since January, mostly on procedural votes.

""I will be an independent check and not toe the party line whenever I disagree,"" Cunningham told Reuters. ""I'm not going to let the national party or the national message drive my message at home.""

Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, another Democratic freshman, said, ""I just do what I think is right,"" after straying from his party's line on a previous Democratic proposal banning funding for Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall. Van Drew also supported the Republican gun amendment.

'JUST VOTE NO'

The House Democratic leadership was divided this week on members breaking with the party line. Pelosi told reporters on Thursday she did not approve, even on procedural votes.

""Just vote no, because the fact is, a vote yes is to give leverage to the other side,"" Pelosi said.

Other Democratic leaders took a more relaxed view.

""It's OK to vote your district,"" said Representative James Clyburn, a member of the House Democratic leadership who, like Cunningham, represents a South Carolina district.

""We have a very diverse caucus,"" Clyburn added. ""I wish people would not compare us to the Republicans, where everybody looks alike. We've got varied backgrounds and experiences that we have to take into account.""","Centrist Democrats stray on votes, roiling House majority party",Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/centrist-democrats-stray-votes-roiling-house-majority-party-180216861.html

“There’s a consensus,” Biden told an excited crowd during an appearance at the University of Delaware. “The most important people in my life want me to run.”

Andreas Gebert / Reuters Former Vice President Joe Biden says his family wants him to run for president in 2020 but he hasn't made up his mind yet.

He did not explicitly say he was running. In fact, the 76-year-old lifelong politician conceded he may not be popular enough to win over the Democratic Party of 2020. Yet roughly 10 months before the first primary votes are cast, Biden sent an unmistakable message to prospective rivals and voters alike that the already-crowded Democratic field is far from set.

Should he run, he would instantly become a front-runner, the best-known option for primary voters and perhaps the best-respected by elected officials and donors, who in many cases have a decadeslong relationship with the longtime Democratic leader. Biden’s potential rivals had little to say publicly about his latest comments on potentially joining the field, but in private, their camps conceded that he would be a political force who could scramble the evolving field.

Biden could erode Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ popularity with working-class voters in the Midwest, California Sen. Kamala Harris’ standing with African-American voters in South Carolina and New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s claim to the political center.

“Uncle Joe is absolutely beloved within the Democratic Party and for good reason,” said Zac Petkanas, an aide to former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “However, this isn’t a popularity contest. Not only is he going to have to prove he’s got fresh, bold ideas, but that he’s tough enough to stand up to Trump.”

While he would be the oldest U.S. president ever elected, toughness has never been an issue for Biden, a native of working-class Pennsylvania, who suggested last year that he would “beat the hell” out of President Donald Trump for his comments about women if the two were in high school.

It is unclear, however, if Biden’s profile, politics and policies are in line with today’s liberal base, a relatively small slice of the electorate that holds outsized sway in presidential primary elections.

Biden would stand out as an old white man just months after Democratic voters sent the most diverse class to Congress in history. He would also be viewed as an establishment-minded moderate unwilling to wholly embrace litmus test issues like free universal health care, free college and the so-called Green New Deal.

“He is the biggest, best-known candidate in the race,” said veteran Democratic strategist Gary Pearce. “Personally, I have mixed feelings. For all the respect I have for him, I don’t know if he’s the right thing for the Democratic Party right now.”

Still, Trump allies have long considered Biden among the most formidable possible general election opponents given his working-class appeal. Despite more than four decades in Washington, most of it as a Delaware senator, he has long played up his upbringing in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

Biden also has far more international experience than his would-be Democratic opponents — and the president. At a global security conference in Germany this month, he told an international audience that an American leader “stands up to the aggression of dictators.”

Yet he has struggled to develop a strong base of political support in two previous presidential runs.

Veteran Iowa Democratic strategist Brenda Kole noted that Biden has never run as a former vice president — particularly one so closely associated with popular former President Barack Obama.

“Ultimately, if he can make the case that he is the best candidate to beat Donald Trump, and I haven’t heard a convincing case yet from the vast field of candidates so far, he could break through,” Kole said.

With his family behind him, Biden said Tuesday he’s still determining whether he can mount a high-powered campaign to win the nomination and defeat Trump. He acknowledged that he’s not sure his “alleged appeal” is real.

“I don’t want this to be a fool’s errand,” he said, noting that his personal decision not to align his candidacy with a super PAC could create financial challenges.

Biden told The New York Times he’d launch his campaign after March if he decides to get in.

In the meantime, Biden allies are reaching out to campaign operatives in early-voting states including New Hampshire and South Carolina to gauge their willingness to join Biden’s team. On Tuesday, operatives in both states said chatter continues, though no formal job offers had been extended.

South Carolina Democrat James Smith, the party’s nominee for governor in 2018, said Tuesday that he’s compiled a list of possible hires for the former vice president.

“I believe he’s getting ready to say the word,” said Smith, who was endorsed by and campaigned with Biden last year.

In Iowa, Biden is the most recognized and preferred in early polls. Yet activists report a hunger for new faces, as evidenced by big crowds at recent events for Harris and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Midwesterners such as Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown are also making a play for Iowa voters, though Brown has yet to announce whether he’s running.",Joe Biden Says He’s ‘Close’ To Making Decision About 2020,Huffpost.com,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-2020-decision_n_5c760fd2e4b08c4f5555466b

What does the Alabamian writer Rick Bragg mean when he says in the introduction to your new book, Bending Toward Justice, that there are too many ghosts in Alabama?

There is often an undercurrent of racial tension in the state that people have a hard time getting over. And they really have a hard time talking about.

Just this month there was an editorial in an Alabama newspaper calling for the Klan to ride again. How can this be?

The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now

It’s like the ghost that appears in your worst nightmare. It comes to the front, and you realize that yes, we have gone very far, but we’ve got a ways to go. There are people in this state, and this country, that have feelings about race that are very, very strong.

Your book is about the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in 1963, which resulted in the deaths of four girls, and your role in bringing some of the bombers to justice as a prosecutor. Why write a book about this now?

It’s important with cases like this to have a written history of how it all came together and how things have changed so people can look at it and understand it. Second, I think we are backsliding on civil rights and voting rights. We saw it in the courts with the Shelby County v. Holder decision [which struck down part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act], but we’re also seeing it in a broader sense.

A cynic might say that you’re publishing this book now to remind voters of your civil rights bona fides. Would you like to address that?

Well, yeah, I can see that. But this book has been in the works for a long time.

You won your Senate seat in a close special election against Roy Moore, a controversial figure facing sexual-assault allegations. Do the Republicans just have to nominate a normal person in 2020 to defeat you?

That underestimates the people of Alabama. It’s a fairly tribal state, but you’re basically saying to folks that they don’t think, and they’re not going to look at candidates. Anybody I run against is going to run so far to the right, they will essentially be a lapdog. There will be people who want that, but I just give the people a lot more credit.

Given that your time in public office may be short, why did you choose to make your first speech on the Senate floor about gun violence?

To bring attention to the fact that there are measures that we can do while we still respect the Second Amendment, with regard to background checks, the “boyfriend loophole” and reporting. I thought that message coming from a gun owner and an avid hunter might resonate more than the usual suspects’.

Do you think Donald Trump will be re-elected in 2020?

I think folks will underestimate him, simply because of the way he conducts himself. I do worry that there’s too many in the Democratic Party who think, “Oh, we can’t lose this.” Well, we can.

Do you have a favored candidate to beat him?

You’ve got to have a candidate that talks to the heartland of America. It’s no secret I think Joe Biden fits that bill better than anyone. We tried the chaos thing and I just don’t think it’s working. We’re looking for a transitional candidate, who respects the institutions of government, who believes they work for all people, not just himself.

Is it true, as your book’s intro claims, that you’re a terrible fisherman?

I love Rick Bragg, but he says some things that you just can’t rely on. There is an element of jealousy with him.

Organizers of the pro-gun sanctuaries admit they took the idea from liberals who have created immigration sanctuaries across the United States where local officials defy the Trump administration’s efforts to enforce tougher immigration laws.

Now local conservatives are rebelling against majority Democratic rule in the states. Elected sheriffs and county commissioners say they might allow some people deemed to be threats under “red flag” laws to keep their firearms. In states where the legal age for gun ownership is raised to 21, authorities in some jurisdictions could refuse to confiscate guns from 18- to 20-year-olds.

Democrats took control of state governments or widened leads in legislative chambers last November, then followed through on promises to enact gun control in response to an epidemic of mass shootings in public spaces, religious sites and schools.

Resistance to those laws is complicating Democratic efforts to enact gun control in Washington, Oregon, New Mexico and Illinois, even though the party holds the governorship and both chambers of the state legislature in all four states.

The sanctuary movement is exposing the rift between rural and urban America as much as the one between the Republican and Democratic parties, as small, conservative counties push back against statewide edicts passed by big-city politicians.

“If they want to have their own laws, that’s fine. Don’t shove them on us down here,” said Dave Campbell, a member of the board of Effingham County, Illinois, about 215 miles (350 km) south of Chicago.

Backers of the sanctuary movement say they want to take it nationwide. Leaders in all four states where it has taken hold have formed a loose alliance, sometimes sharing strategies or texts of resolutions. They also say they are talking with like-minded activists in California, New York, Iowa and Idaho.

As it grows, the rebellion is setting up a potential clash between state and local officials.

In Washington, nearly 60 percent of the voters in November approved Initiative 1639, which raises the minimum age to purchase a semiautomatic rifle to 21, enhances background checks and increases the waiting period to buy such guns to 10 days.

The law is due to take effect in July, but sheriffs in more than half of Washington’s 39 counties have pledged not to enforce it, pro-gun activists say, and five counties have passed resolutions to the same effect.

Governor Jay Inslee has firmly backed I-1639 and Attorney General Bob Ferguson has advised sheriffs “they could be held liable” if they allow a dangerous person to acquire a firearm later used to do harm.

Sheriff Bob Songer of Klickitat County, population 22,000, called Ferguson’s warning a “bluff” and said he would not enforce I-1639 because he considered it unconstitutional.

“Unfortunately for the governor and the attorney general, they’re not my boss. My only boss is the people that elected me to office,” Songer said.

GAINING MOMENTUM

Support for Second Amendment sanctuaries has gained momentum in recent weeks, especially among county boards in New Mexico and Illinois.

Sixty-three counties or municipalities in Illinois have passed some form of a firearms sanctuary resolution and more are likely to, Campbell said.

Twenty-five of New Mexico’s 33 counties have passed resolutions to support sheriffs who refuse to enforce any firearms laws that they consider unconstitutional, according to the New Mexico Sheriffs Association. In some cases hundreds of pro-gun activists have packed county commissioner meetings.

In Oregon, voters in eight counties approved Second Amendment Preservation Ordinances last November that allow sheriffs to determine which state gun laws to enforce.

Organizers in Oregon plan to put even more defiant “sanctuary ordinance” measures on county ballots in 2020 that will direct their officials to resist state gun laws.

Such sanctuary resolutions could face legal challenges but backers say they have yet to face a lawsuit, in part because the Washington initiative has yet to take effect and the Illinois and New Mexico legislation has yet to pass.

The chief counsel for a leading U.S. gun-control group questioned the legality of the sanctuary movement, saying state legislatures make laws and courts interpret them, not sheriffs.

“It should not be up to individual sheriffs or police officers deciding which laws they personally like,” said Jonathan Lowy of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. “This attitude shows a disrespect for the way our system of government is supposed to operate.”

In New Mexico, the legislature is moving forward with a slate of gun-control bills. One would enhance background checks and another would create a red-flag law keeping guns out of the hands of people deemed dangerous by a judge.

The New Mexico Sheriffs Association is leading the resistance, saying the red-flag law would violate due process rights and was unnecessary given current statutes.

Tony Mace, sheriff of Cibola County and chairman of the statewide group, said the background check law would impose regulations on hunting buddies or competitive shooters every time they share guns, and he refuses to spend resources investigating such cases.

New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham accused the rebellious sheriffs of falsely promoting the idea that “someone is coming for their firearms,” saying none of the proposed laws infringe on Second Amendment rights.”It’s an exhausting charade,” Lujan Grisham said.","Defiant U.S. sheriffs push gun sanctuaries, imitating liberals on immigration",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns-sanctuary-idUSKCN1QL0ZC

New York (AFP) - Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, the centrist billionaire Democrat who positioned himself as a potential challenger to Donald Trump, said Tuesday he would not run for president in 2020.

""I believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election. But I am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field,"" the businessman said in an opinion column on the Bloomberg media platform that he owns.

""Many people have urged me to run. Some have told me that to win the Democratic nomination, I would need to change my views to match the polls,"" the 77-year-old said, acknowledging the leftward tilt among many of the dozen major Democrats already in the race.

""I've run for office three times and won each time, in no small part because I've never stuck my finger in the wind to decide what I should believe. It's not who I am, nor do I think it's what voters want in a leader,"" he added.

Bloomberg said he would instead devote his considerable financial muscle toward addressing some of the nation's major challenges, including climate change, gun violence, the opioid crisis, failing public schools and college affordability.

""I love our country too much to sit back and hope for the best as national problems get worse. But I also recognize that until 2021, and possibly longer, our only real hope for progress lies outside of Washington,"" he said.

""And unlike most who are running or thinking of it, I'm fortunate enough to be in a position to devote the resources needed to bring people together and make a big difference.""

His announcement brings an end to a potentially tantalizing 2020 matchup between two New York billionaire businessmen: the brash real estate tycoon currently in the White House versus the more measured -- and wealthier -- media mogul.

Bloomberg noted the importance of Democrats winning in 2020, describing Trump's presidential term as one of ""chaos, disruption and deceit.""

""I've never made any secret of my belief that Donald Trump is a threat to our country,"" he said, adding it was essential that Americans ""nominate a Democrat who will be in the strongest position to defeat Donald Trump and bring our country back together.""

- All eyes on Biden -

With Bloomberg now out of contention, attention turns to former vice president Joe Biden, who is the most prominent Democrat still mulling a presidential bid and has yet to announce his plans.

Former congressman Beto O'Rourke, the charismatic Texan who narrowly lost a Senate bid to incumbent Ted Cruz last year, is also a potential candidate, and says he will reveal his plans soon.

Bloomberg is the fourth potential candidate to pass on a presidential race this week.

Eric Holder, who served as US attorney general in Barack Obama's administration, said no on Monday, followed by Senator Jeff Merkley, who announced Tuesday he would run for re-election to the Senate instead of launching a White House bid.

Hillary Clinton, the 2016 nominee who lost to Trump despite winning the popular vote, finally ruled out a repeat run, prompting some presidential trolling.

""Aw-shucks, does that mean I won't get to run against her again?"" tweeted Trump. ""She will be sorely missed!""

Those already in the race include senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, as well as current and former governors and mayors.

Bloomberg sounded a warning to those challenging Trump, especially the several candidates including Sanders and Warren who have embraced progressive policies like universal health care and a massive plan to address climate change and economic inequality that critics say would cost tens of trillions of dollars.

""We cannot allow the primary process to drag the party to an extreme that would diminish our chances in the general election and translate into 'Four More Years'"" of Trump, Bloomberg said.",Ex-NY mayor Bloomberg rules out run for US president in 2020,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ex-ny-mayor-bloomberg-rules-run-us-president-214859975.html

In a campaign announcement video released on Monday, Hickenlooper presented himself as a Washington outsider capable of both confrontation and cooperation.

“As a skinny kid with Coke-bottle glasses and a funny last name, I’ve stood up to my fair share of bullies,” Hickenlooper says in his video. “I’ve proven again and again I can bring people together to produce the progressive change Washington has failed to deliver.”

His record of bipartisanship in a battleground state stands in contrast with the nation’s polarized electorate and a desire among progressives in the Democratic Party for confrontation over cooperation.

While Hickenlooper is the latest Democrat to announce his candidacy for president, another possible contender, former Attorney General Eric Holder, took his name out of contention in a Washington Post op-ed Monday. Holder said he’ll remain involved in the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.

Hickenlooper, 67, who completed his second term as governor in January, has a knack for political salesmanship and showmanship -- skills that could help in challenging a former reality TV star turned president. His unorthodox story and folksy personality could enable him to break through among Democratic contenders, though his wisecracking tendencies may also lead to campaign missteps.

Denver Rally

On Thursday, Hickenlooper is expected to hold a kick-off rally in Denver before departing on a two-day tour of Iowa, where the first nominating contest of 2020 is scheduled to be held in 11 months.

He joins an already-crowded Democratic primary field that, among others, includes Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist senator from Vermont who lost to Hillary Clinton in 2016, and senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey.

In 2005, during his first of two terms as Denver’s mayor, Hickenlooper twice parachuted from a plane for a television commercial backing voter referendums in Colorado to permit government spending that he considered critical for the state’s future.

Five years later, he appeared in a shower, fully clothed, for another TV spot. This one was in support of his candidacy for governor and a pledge to conduct a clean campaign as others engaged in dirty politics.

Craft Beer

Born in suburban Philadelphia as the youngest of four children, Hickenlooper attended a private boys’ academy on a scholarship and graduated from Wesleyan University.

After being laid off as a geologist during a slump in Colorado’s oil industry, he co-founded the Wynkoop Brewing Company in a then-abandoned warehouse district in Denver, and later used a “running of the pigs” to celebrate anniversaries of the microbrewery and restaurant. Riding the craft beer craze, he went on to open 15 brewpubs and restaurants, mostly in the Midwest, according to his campaign.

Hickenlooper parlayed his business success into a winning 2003 bid to become mayor of Colorado’s largest city. In that post, he streamlined government and persuaded voters to support tax increases for light rail and to help address homelessness. Time magazine named him one of the five best big-city mayors in 2005, and he won re-election in 2007 with 87 percent of the vote.

Obama’s Request

In 2010, then-President Barack Obama called Hickenlooper, who was mayor when Denver hosted the 2008 Democratic National Convention, and asked him to run for governor. He won with 51 percent of the vote in an election against a Republican and a third-party opponent.

As governor, Hickenlooper promoted a business-friendly environment in a state that’s been among the fastest-growing in the nation in recent years and has increasingly leaned more Democratic.

During his time as governor, Colorado became one of the first two states to legalize recreational marijuana, even though he opposed the ballot measure that started the process. He also supported an expansion in the state of Medicaid, and backed LGBT rights.",Colorado’s Hickenlooper Announces Democratic Presidential Bid,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/colorado-hickenlooper-announces-democratic-presidential-113000820.html

Morgan, who is tipped to be a major figure in a post-May government, said the party ne…","LONDON — The Conservative party must start the process of replacing Theresa May as prime minister before the end of this year, the former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has told Business Insider.

Morgan, who was thrown out of government by May when she became prime minister in 2016, said the Conservatives must begin to think about finding her successor in order to prepare for a potentially early general election.

""Certainly by the end of 2019 the party is going to have to be thinking about future leadership,"" Morgan told BI in an interview this week.

The prime minister last year pledged to stand down before the next general election, currently scheduled for 2022, after her own MPs launched a vote of no confidence in her leadership.

However, she has so far resisted attempts to spell out exactly when she will stand down, insisting that there are issues outside of Brexit she wishes to concentrate on, like the ""burning injustices"" she has vowed to eradicate.

""I think the prime minister is deeply frustrated that she can't do all of that because of Brexit,"" Morgan told BI.

""The prime minister definitely wants an opportunity to talk about those injustices in a way that she hasn't done before — and I understand that. But, she is not going to lead us into the next election. We don't know when that election is going to come, and given the lack of majority in Parliament, it may come sooner than 2022.""

There has been growing speculation in Westminster about an early election, ever since May lost a House of Commons vote on her Brexit deal by a record-breaking margin back in January.

With the Democratic Unionist party, which props up May's minority government, threatening to withdraw their support, many figures in the party are turning their attention towards the possibility of an early vote.

Certainly by the end of 2019 the party is going to have to be thinking about future leadership.

""At some point, the Conservative party will absolutely need to think about the leadership question, whether it is this year or next,"" Morgan said.

The MP for Loughborough was a senior member of David Cameron's government and has previously been tipped as a future prime minister. However, her political career received a setback after May removed her from government alongside her ally, former Chancellor George Osborne.

Following her departure, Morgan fell out with May's team in a public spat over a £1,000 pair of leather trousers worn by the prime minister.

Text messages leaked to the press at the time revealed May's aides referred to Morgan as ""that woman"" and insisted that she should not be allowed into Downing Street.

Morgan — Conservative entryism is exaggerated

Getty

Last month three MPs — Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen, and Sarah Wollaston — quit the Tory party, citing the alleged ""Bluekip"" takeover of local associations as one of their reasons for walking out and joining the Independent Group.

""This shift to the right has been exacerbated by blatant entryism,"" the trio wrote to May upon their departure.

""A purple momentum is subsuming the Conservative party, much as the hard left has been allowed to consume and terminally undermine the Labour Party.""

As BI reported hours before Soubry, Allen and Wollaston's departure, the Conservative party's ""moderate"" wing is concerned that pro-EU MPs are being targeted for deselection by an increasingly pro-Brexit membership.

However, Morgan, who was a prominent campaigner for Remain in the 2016 EU referendum, has recently been a key figure in attempts to heal internal divisions over Europe in the party.

She is now working with the ""Malthouse Compromise"" group, alongside leading Brexiteers such as the Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, in order to find a position for both wings of the party to unite around.

She dismissed suggestions that her party was being pushed by Brexiteers towards a far-right fringe.

Morgan said this characterisation of the Tory party was ""just not right,"" adding that: ""I don't subscribe to this view that the far-right is somehow in control of the Conservative party from top to toe.""

She added: ""Apart from Europe, the Conservative party by and large agrees on everything.

I don't subscribe to this view that the far-right is somehow in control of the Conservative party from top to toe.

""There will be an element of people having slightly different views on foreign policy or how generous the welfare system should be, but at the Spring Statement next week, almost all Conservative MPs will be on the same page.""

The former secretary of state admitted that a wave of new members had recently joined the party ""because they want Brexit,"" but suggested that talk of Conservative party entryism had been heavily exaggerated.

""When I go to Conservative associations, they are much more likely to say to me 'for God's sake, don't let Corbyn in' than they are to say 'we joined because we want to get rid of certain MPs who we don't agree with on Brexit'.

""At the end of the day, any political party wants to see an increase in membership. That's not an issue. It's more of question of making sure we hold together as one Conservative force.""

She also denied reports of widespread attempts to remove pro-EU MPs.

""There is no doubt that people in Nick Boles' association have talked about it [de-selections] seriously.

""But how many people more widely have actually talked about it? I can't remember the last time the Conservative party deselected a Member of Parliament. It was a very long time ago. It's not something that happens.""

Morgan also shot down claims that the Tories have an Islamophobia problem, leveled by figures like the party's former co-chair Baroness Warsi, after over a dozen members were suspended for discriminatory comments about Muslims.

""I understand that Sayeeda [Baroness Warsi] feels very passionately about this, and maybe it's that her experiences are different from mine,"" she told BI.

""But I have a significant Bangladeshi, Muslim population in my local constituency, and never have they said to me they don't feel like the Conservative party is a party they can support because of people's views on Islam or because they are Muslims.

""It's not something I recognise at all.""

Article 50 extension could be a ""really, really bad idea""

Kirsty O'Connor/PA Images via Getty Images Morgan, who voted for May's deal in the first meaningful vote, said it was ""absolutely possible"" that the House of Commons would vote for May's deal ""by a small majority"" in the new vote penciled in for next week.

However, if the Withdrawal Agreement doesn't pass, MPs are set to have a choice between either a no-deal Brexit or delaying Brexit in order to avoid an abrupt and disruptive departure on March 29.

She admitted that despite its complications, Brexit being delayed via an extension to Article 50 was almost certain.

""The period of time needed to pass necessary legislation is pretty challenging. A short, technical extension to get legislation through seems more than likely,"" Morgan said.

She revealed that she hadn't decided how she'd vote on a possible extension, and expressed concern about growing calls among MPs for the Article 50 process to be extended into the summer.

""Nobody wants there to be no deal on March 29 but we need to hear what the government strategy is if the vote doesn't go through. In the same way that the government stepped in so the House didn't need to vote on the Cooper-Boles amendments, what is the government's plan going to be?"" she said.

""When it comes to the extension of Article 50, how long is the government talking about?

""What does the government intend to do during that time? And how will it relate to fighting the European Parliament elections, which I think would be a really, really bad idea for us to get involved in?""

Part ""B"" of the Malthouse Compromise — a plan designed to find ""alternative arrangements"" to the controversial backstop for Northern Ireland — effectively means leaving the EU without a deal in less than four weeks time.

Morgan admitted she had been ""uncomfortable"" signing up to this part of the plan, devised by Brexiteers including Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker, but said preparing for a no-deal exit ""has to be on the government's agenda.""",The Conservatives must think about replacing Theresa May 'by the end of 2019',Business Insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/nicky-morgan-conservatives-replace-theresa-may-by-end-of-year-2019-3

French publication iGen (translated) reports that the company is allowing iPhones with third-party batteries to be worked on by Apple’s Geniuses.

Up until now, Apple has typically refused to repair or work on iPhones with non-original components like batteries. Here’s how one Apple employee described the previous policy to iGen:

“If we could not remove a battery on a phone that had a battery problem, we replaced the complete unit at the price of the repair of the battery (49 € or 69 € depending on the model). With a third-party battery this will never be the case. The replacement will be charged at the full price of the unit.”

But as of February 28th, iGen says Apple Stores have adopted a different policy and have been repairing iPhones with third-party batteries for customers. If the new policy does indeed stick, it will likely be seen as a consumer friendly move.

However, there are safety and liability concerns, as mentioned by another Apple employee:

This change in the care policy worries some. One of them argues that batteries installed by third parties are potentially more at risk: “It has already happened (when the tests were crashing) that we do not detect the third battery, and that at the opening it inflate or short circuit and grid the motherboard. Double problem: to whom the fault for the apparatus and to whom the fault for the technician if this one has an accident.”

Further, the French Confederation of Democratic Labour tweeted a statement that also echoed safety concerns along with alleging Apple made the policy change too quickly. Translated:

Management too often forgets that when it comes to safety, we have to go through the French authorities when we put in place new procedures.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)

WASHINGTON (AP) — The House put on a display of Democratic priorities this week with two bills to bolster background checks on firearms purchases, showing just how quickly the politics of gun control have turned.

Just a few years ago, says Kris Brown, the president of one of the nation's leading gun violence prevention groups, there was a ""sense of hopeless"" after a divided Congress tried — and failed — to change gun laws following the mass shooting of 20 young children and six adults at Newtown Elementary School in Connecticut.

But a new generation of teen leaders ""flipped"" public sentiment after the shooting last year at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, she said, helping to elect lawmakers in 2018 who are willing to buck the powerful gun lobby, including the National Rifle Association.

""We're at a completely different time,"" said Brown, the president of the Brady, the group formerly known as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The group changed its name this week on the 25th anniversary of implementing its landmark background check bill.

Parkland ""reignited something in people,"" she said in an interview after the House votes on Thursday. Democrats — and some Republicans — ""understand this is where American sentiment is going and what people want.""

On Thursday, the House approved legislation to allow a review period of up to 10 days for background checks on firearms purchases.

Democrats led passage, 228-198, with a handful of defections and scant Republican support. The bill stems from the 2015 shooting at Emanuel AME Church in South Carolina, where nine black worshippers died at the hands of a white supremacist. A faulty background check allowed the gunman's firearm purchase after the required three-day review period expired.

On Wednesday, the House approved a more ambitious measure — bipartisan legislation requiring federal background checks for all gun sales and transfers, including those sold online and at gun shows. A handful of Republicans crossed over to join Democrats. It's the most substantial gun violence prevention bill in more than a decade.

Not all Democrats helped in passing the bills, and some broke with their party to back a Republican counter-effort Thursday to maintain the three-day review period for victims of domestic violence seeking guns.

But the outcome showcased a turn of events as Democrats — and some Republicans —more fully support gun control measures they were hesitant to tackle even a few years ago.

The NRA acknowledges the challenges ahead. But the Second Amendment group also downplays the momentum of the gun control advocates, especially since the White House has threatened to veto the bills. The measures are likely to languish in the Republican-controlled Senate.

The NRA's Chris Cox said in a statement that the group ""will continue to fight to preserve the constitutionally protected right to self-defense.""

The NRA spent more money than ever to help elect Trump, who in 2017 became the first president in decades to speak at their annual convention. And while the group was outspent by gun-safety advocates in the 2018 midterm that ushered Democrats into power in the House, it says its deepest asset is the millions of Americans who are Second Amendment advocates.

""The strength of the NRA has always been with our grass roots,"" said spokeswoman Jennifer Baker, ""and our tens of millions of members and supporters who consistently go to the polls and vote on this issue and actively engage with their elected officials.""

Polling, though, shows attitudes are shifting. A survey conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research last year found that nearly 7 in 10 adults favored stricter gun control measures. That was the strongest level of support since The Associated Press first asked the question five years ago.

Gabby Giffords, the former Arizona lawmaker who was severely wounded in a 2011 shooting and now runs a gun advocacy group bearing her name, said in a statement that the votes this week show ""how serious the new majority in the House of Representatives is about taking action to make our communities safer from gun violence.""

272,Empty,2019-03-03T14:00:00Z,In other headlines: Michael Cohen went to Washington and some people said things they (probably) shouldn't on Twitter.,"The past seven days have brought another Democrat looking to be president, another Trump associate being called to testify before Congress, another potential escalation—and then de-escalation—in the tension between India and Pakistan, another sign that California is struggling more than many states with climate change, and another album from Solange. (It also brought another Oscars, but whether it's upset over Green Book's wins or gossip about Gaga, that already feels like a lifetime ago.) It's not all been re-runs, though; there have also been big developments in ongoing stories that people have been discussing for some time. What have people been talking about online this last week? We're glad you asked.

What Not to Say in Your Outside Voice

What Happened: You'd think that an attorney would know better than to attempt to intimidate a witness via social media, considering how much trouble it could get everyone in. You'd think.

What Really Happened: It was the (now deleted) tweet that got everyone's attention. Ahead of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's testimony to Congress last week, Florida Republican representative Matt Gaetz tweeted the following message: ""Hey @MichaelCohen212 — Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she'll remain faithful when you're in prison. She's about to learn a lot.""

Well, that's certainly a thing. And one that got a lot of people's attention, not least of all the media, because of course.

Some had some theories about where this tweet actually came from.

We'll come back to that later. For now, let's be thankful that Gaetz seemed to appreciate see the gaffe here. Just kidding.

The tweet remained up until the Speaker of the House sent out a particularly pointed subtweet of her own.

That, in turn, prompted Gaetz to finally apologize.

Turns out, an apology wasn't enough to handle the fallout of the tweet. Not from Michael Cohen, who had more important things on his mind—we'll come back to that soon enough, too—but from the Florida Bar, which launched an investigation into Gaetz over whether or not he violated professional conduct rules with the tweet. It may not be the only investigation he faces; a Democratic lawmaker has asked for an House Ethics Committee investigation, too.

Oh, and remember the question about whether or not the president was involved with the tweet in the first place?

For his part, Gaetz denies this. But, really, what is true anymore?

The Takeaway: For those who thought that this entire story seemed too cliché to be true, you're not alone, apparently.

The Michael Cohen Hearing

What Happened: For those hoping for epic political theater, last week's public testimony from former personal attorney (and infamous “fixer,” although, says who?) Michael Cohen proved to be not only worth the price of admission, but everything anyone could have hoped for.

What Really Happened: So, how did that whole Michael Cohen testimony on Wednesday go, anyway? The answer, as might have been expected, was ""particularly explosively."" So much so that things started exploding as soon as his opening statement leaked to the press hours before the hearing itself.

The statement, which really should be read in full for the appropriate effect, is available in many places but this Washington Post annotated piece is perhaps the best primer. It was, to be blunt, pretty damning stuff, although of course there were those who simply brushed it off as the ravings of an admitted liar. The hearing itself, however, proved to be just as amazing. Some brief highlights:

Heady stuff, and enough to give the media a lot to pick over and analyze for days to come. (And not just how poorly the Republicans fared.) The president, who was out of the country at the time of the hearing—stay tuned, we're about to get to why—let his spokesperson do the talking for him, for once.

Well, OK; he waited a day before commenting directly, at least.

All other kinds of interested parties had a lot to say about Cohen's testimony, as well.

Still, at least the Republican Party had a plan to make sure that people didn't pay too much attention to everything that Cohen was saying.

Yes, that's right. We should all stay focused on the president's historic meeting with North Korea. There's no way that could go wrong, right?

The Takeaway: For those wondering just how bad this was for the president, you might want to read this Twitter thread. But, suffice to say: This was a historic event when it came to demonstrating just how bad things have become.

The North Korea Summit Goes South

What Happened: If the Trump administration had hoped to drown out any and all bad news last week with a successful summit with North Korea, reality took a very different turn. Really, it wasn't a good week for the president.

What Really Happened: Getting back to why President Trump was out of the country during the Cohen testimony: He was in Vietnam for the second US/North Korea summit, a prospect that worried some, not least because of concerns over how far the president would go to get a deal he could boast about. Despite attempts to silence the press, initially, hopes were high.

Late Wednesday, however, it suddenly became obvious that things weren't going according to plan.

The hastily-rescheduled press conference confirmed what people were suspecting: The talks had fallen apart.

There's something odd about this sticking point, however; while Trump said that he was willing to ease some sanctions but North Korea was asking for all sanctions to be lifted, that's not what North Korea is saying they asked for.

Some after-the-fact positioning so North Korea could save face, or a case of the president lying? It's genuinely difficult to tell. On social media, some were arguing against those calling the summit a failure for Trump, as the hashtag #TrumpFail started to trend.

Funny story about giving legitimacy to a dictator; even though the summit fell apart, that didn't mean that the president wasn't willing to find some way to bow to North Korean interests in a truly dangerous, damaging way.

It didn't escape anyone's notice, either.

All told, this trip really didn't go so well for the president. But there's always next time, right?

The Takeaway: You know the traditional thing where Donald Trump says something today, and there's usually a tweet from the past where he completely contradicts himself? This time, it's not a tweet; it's far longer.

Takers and Fakers and Talkers Won't Tell You

What Happened: Oh, don’t worry; as bad a week as it had been for Trump before Thursday, things actually got worse when news emerged that he'd overruled experts to help his son-in-law.

What Really Happened: As last Thursday afternoon rolled around, Trump was surely glad to get back to the United States, where everything was calm and ... You know where this is going, don’t you?

As reported by The New York Times, President Trump ordered then-Chief of Staff John Kelly to grant top-secret security clearance to son-in-law Jared Kushner last year, despite concerns by intelligence officials and the White House's top lawyer. Kelly was so disturbed by the order that he quit in protest—no, sorry, he ""wrote a memo about how it wasn't his fault."" Potato, tomato. You know how it is.

The report was quickly picked up by other outlets. It's almost as if people care about who gets security clearances that they probably shouldn't have.

The fact that the president had overruled his own intelligence people was, unsurprisingly, very much at odds with the way in which the issue had been addressed by administration officials in the past.

But that's not to say they didn't know what was going on wasn't a problem, apparently.

The timing of this would appear to be an issue for the administration.

Meanwhile, it's the substance that's an issue for … well, everyone else in the United States, really?

For those wondering why this is such an issue, here's one explanation:

Here's another, arguably more speculative, definitely more serious, one:

Maybe we're all overreacting, though! Perhaps there was a really good reason for it.

The Takeaway: If only there was some sign that the man who advised Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman shouldn't be given top secret security clearances. If only.

Meanwhile, in Another Hipster Coffee Shop

What Happened: Let's wrap up this week with something lighter, of sorts. If you have ever thought to yourself, ""Hey! Twitter doesn't seem to do anything about all the ideologues on the platform, what would it take to get one thrown off?"" Congratulations; You got an answer this week, and it was perfect.

What Really Happened: Maybe you remember Jacob Wohl. He's a far-right activist, who you may recall tried unsuccessfully to create a sexual assault conspiracy against Robert Mueller. He is, shall we say, someone that is going places, as long as it’s understood that those places may include being a punchline.

His journey towards that destination went farther last week when he gave an interview to USA Today in what seemed to be an attempt to tout his genius and strength in the surreal electoral playing field that is 2019.

In said story, Wohl boasted that he planned to create fake Facebook and Twitter accounts to, quote, ""steer the left-wing votes in the primaries to what we feel are weaker candidates compared with Trump."" Funny thing about announcing your intent to essentially duplicate the Russian troll operation during the 2016 election in a national newspaper: People notice.

Yes, a man famous for using Twitter to report on how hipsters in hipster coffee shops were repeating right-wing talking points ended up being banned from the platform after declaring his intent to weaponize it. There's no small irony here, and as should only be expected, a lot of people couldn't pass up the chance to use a favorite Wohlian construct to talk about his banishment.

It wasn't all jokes about Wohl's former meme-worthy status, however. There were some other things to consider about his removal. Well, kind of.

Wohl responded to the news with an amazing YouTube video in which he declared that the ban was actually good news, really, because look how viral he'd become before heading to the conservative conference CPAC to push a new conspiracy theory about Democratic lawmaker Ilhan Omar. Guess how that went?

Once again: This man got a profile in USA Today where he claimed to be an important figure in national politics. Just in case you're wondering how 2019 is going.

The Takeaway: It’s worth considering this when it comes to Wohl getting banned from Twitter.

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said Monday that he would support Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and the founder of Bloomberg LP, if he were to run for president.

Buffett made the comments on Monday morning in an interview on CNBC's Squawk Box.

Both men are among the richest people in the world.

Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, said Monday that he would support Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and founder of Bloomberg LP, if he were to announce a 2020 presidential bid.

""If Mike Bloomberg announced tomorrow that he was a candidate, I would say, 'I'm for him,' and I think he would be a very good president,"" he said in an interview with CNBC's Becky Quick.

""He and I disagree on some things, but I think that he knows how to run things. I think that he's got the right goals for America, he understands people, he understands the market system, and he understands the problems of people that don't fit well into the market system.""

Buffett, who on Saturday released his annual letter to shareholders, told CNBC that he wasn't a Democrat through and through, though over the last three decades he's voted for more Democrats than Republicans.

""I'm not a card-carrying Democratic, but I never have been,"" Buffett said. ""I've voted for a fair number of Republicans, I've given money to Republicans.""

Both Buffett and Bloomberg are among the richest people in the world, according to Forbes. Buffett's net worth, as of Forbes' 2018 ranking, was $84 billion, while Bloomberg's was $50 billion.

While it's long been rumored that Bloomberg would run for the highest US office, he told the Associated Press in early February that he would decide by the end of this month if he would enter the race. He officially registered as a Democrat — again — last October.

Bloomberg has rejected the notion that he likely wouldn't enter the 2020 presidential race if Joe Biden, the former vice president, announced a bid.

""My decision doesn't depend on what other people are going to do,"" Bloomberg told the AP. ""My decision depends on whether or not I think I can make a difference.""

In his interview with CNBC Buffett also voiced his displeasure about Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, announcing he would consider running for president in the upcoming election.

""If he ran as an independent, I think he would take votes away from any Democrat, including Bloomberg, if he were running, so I think it would be a real mistake for him to run,"" Buffett said. ""I think, generally, third-party candidates, they're going to hurt one side or the other, and they're more likely to hurt the side that they actually favor, because they're closer to that view.""

He added: ""I hope no third-party candidate runs that pulls any significant amount of votes. I mean, there will always be a couple of people that file, but I think third-party candidates can thwart, actually, the will of the people.""

Now we’ve gotten a look at the official repair guide that details how Apple will handle repairs with non-original batteries.

The new repair document seen by 9to5Mac states at the outset that customers using third-party batteries in Apple devices may still be eligible for warranty service. However, if the non-original battery has caused the problem or device damage, customers will have to pay the out of warranty cost for a repair or replacement.

But in the case that Apple determines the third-party battery hasn’t caused the issue a customer is looking to have resolved, the non-Apple part shouldn’t change the service and warranty eligibility.

Notably, non-Apple parts are defined as third-party batteries as well as counterfeit batteries. This is certainly helpful for customers who unknowingly purchased a non-Apple battery.

The document does note that if an iPhone or other Apple device has a third-party enclosure, logic board, microphone, Lightning port, volume buttons, TrueDepth camera system, and more, repairs will be denied.

Another detail is that if the repair attempt for a device with a third-party battery fails, customers will have to pay the out of warranty cost.

Back in 2017, Apple opened up repairs for iPhones with third-party displays. Apple’s move to include third-party batteries in its repair process will surely be welcomed by customers and groups like iFixit.

However, as mentioned yesterday, some have safety concerns about servicing devices with third-party batteries. The French Confederation of Democratic Labour issued a statement on Twitter yesterday criticizing that Apple made the move without consulting with French authorities.

What do you think? Is this a consumer friendly, and smart move by Apple? Or does it complicate the repair process and pose safety risks for the company’s technicians? Share your thoughts in the comments below!

At an event connected to the annual RSA security conference in San Francisco, Alphabet GOOGL, +0.44% GOOG, +0.45% unveiled Backstory, a big-data software product that intends to collect, retain and maintain a history of network traffic. It is similar to offerings from Splunk SPLK, +0.89% , a pure-play big-data name, as well as larger security players like Qualys Inc. QLYS, +0.94% , though Chronicle insisted there is nothing of its type in existence.

RSA preview: Cybersecurity companies look to artificial intelligence as they struggle to find human workers

Splunk shares sank 5% Monday, after news of the product launch was released during the trading session due to a broken embargo. Enterprise software stocks declined en masse Monday ahead of Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, +1.31% earnings, which were posted after the bell.

Chronicle is a cybersecurity effort formed under the Alphabet umbrella that was designed to take some of the internal security products developed for Google and turn them into products to sell to other companies. Backstory is the second product to launch out of Chronicle after VirusTotal, which seeks to catalog malware threats and help companies detect if any are on their network, but the launch was the first major media event for the company since it “graduated” from Alphabet’s “moonshot factory” to become a stand-alone entity last year.

“As we launch Backstory, our message is that we are here for the long haul,” Chronicle Chief Executive Stephen Gillett said in kicking off the event Monday.

Chronicle, as designed by Alphabet, appears to be an attempt to eventually develop the type of cybersecurity company for which enterprise customers appear desperate, a one-stop shop for all the needs a company could have in the arena. It has a long way to go after launching just its second product Monday, however, and even Backstory faces a lot more competition than just Splunk.

“This is a crowded market with many pure plays that have differentiated products such as Tenable TENB, -0.59% and Qualys, as well as established stalwarts like Palo Alto Networks PANW, +0.84% and Check Point CHKP, -0.15% ,” Daniel Ives, a Wedbush analyst, said in an email exchange with MarketWatch. “Unless Google does a meaningful security acquisition, this product is on the outside looking in with many entrenched players in a crowded market.”

Alphabet, though, claims there is little to no actual competition for Backstory.

“We don’t believe there is anything similar to Backstory available today in terms of the scale of our data management and computation capabilities,” the company said in a media kit handed out ahead of the 1 p.m. Pacific time event.

“Just as Waymo ‘competes’ with GM but really competes with human-driven cars (and all of their crashes, failures, delays and costs), we really compete with doing security intelligence on your own to try to stop cyberattacks.”

Chronicle demonstrated the software at Monday’s event by using the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee as an example, demonstrating that users could search past network traffic to find if a company’s servers had communicated with the Russian web domain that was used in the pre-election hack.

“If the DNC had Backstory on their network, they would have been able to see this activity and they would have been able to stop it,” Mike Wiacek, chief security officer and co-founder of Chronicle, said.

276,Empty,2019-02-25T13:35:03Z,Britain's parliament last month demanded Prime Minister Theresa May renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal that the other members of the European Union say they will not reopen.,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s parliament last month demanded Prime Minister Theresa May renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal that the other members of the European Union say they will not reopen.

With just 32 days until the United Kingdom is due by law to leave the EU, the options include a disorderly Brexit, a delay to Brexit or no Brexit at all.

May is pursuing a renegotiated deal, but faces a growing threat that she will need to choose to delay Brexit or be forced to do so by British lawmakers.

Below is a summary of what is due to happen next:

“HIGH NOON”- FEB. 27

On Tuesday, May will make a statement updating lawmakers on her progress and lawmakers will have an opportunity on Wednesday to debate and vote on the way forward.

Several lawmakers in May’s Conservative Party, including some ministers, have indicated this will be the last chance they give her to find a way through the impasse.

Opposition Labour Party lawmaker Yvette Cooper plans to use that debate to seek lawmakers’ support for legislation that would force the government to decide between leaving without a deal or extending the Article 50 negotiation period if it has not had a deal approved by March 13.

VOTE ON A REVISED DEAL - BY MARCH 12

May has promised to bring back a revised deal to parliament and hold a vote on whether to approve it by March 12.

Before a vote on the exit agreement in January, which May lost heavily, parliament held five days of debate. It is not clear whether there would be another lengthy debate this time.

May is required by law to get parliamentary approval for any exit deal.

EU SUMMIT - MARCH 21-22

EU leaders are due to meet in Brussels. This could be an opportunity for an eleventh-hour deal or it would be the last chance to agree an extension of the Article 50 negotiation period and delay Brexit to avoid no-deal disruption. If the summit goes badly and there is still no deal in sight then May will have to decide whether to delay or go for a no-deal Brexit.

LAST WEEKEND - MARCH 23-24

If a deal is seen as viable at the summit, officials could work through the weekend to nail down the details with a final deal - and a possible extension to June 30 conditional on British parliamentary approval - announced on Sunday, March 24-Monday, March 25.

FINAL WEEK - MARCH 25-29

If a deal could be clinched, then the British parliament could vote on it, possibly on March 26. The European Parliament could ratify the deal that week.

EXIT DAY - MARCH 29?

If May does not get a deal approved by parliament by March 29, Britain faces a disorderly exit or may be forced to seek an extension of Article 50 to give more time to reach an agreement. It is not certain the EU would agree to this.

Some lawmakers, including opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, have said it is now “inevitable” that the government will have to seek an extension, as there will not be enough time to pass the legislation for Britain’s exit before March 29.

The leader of Britain’s lower house of parliament, Andrea Leadsom, has said the date might need to be pushed back by a couple of weeks.

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS

The bloc will vote to elect a new European Parliament on May 23-26. The new chamber would sit from July 2, a date that is shaping up to be the EU’s limit for any extension of Article 50.

The EU says Britain would have to organize European Parliament elections on its soil if it were to delay Brexit beyond that as otherwise its people would be deprived of their democratic representation while still being in the EU. The bloc fears Britain would not do that.

Some in the EU also fear that, should Britain vote, it would elect a staunchly eurosceptic representation to the European Parliament that is already expected to have a larger contingent of EU critics influencing the bloc’s policies.

The main centre-right group, whose leaders include German Chancellor Angela Merkel, could also lose its place as the biggest in the European Parliament; UK Labour seats could help the European Socialists overtake the People’s Party, from which British Conservatives broke away to sit separately.

DELAYED BREXIT - JUNE 30 OR LATER

If a Brexit extension is sought, one date being talked about in Brussels is June 30, the Sunday before the new European Parliament sits at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) on July 2. Some argue for an exit before May 23, the day Britain would otherwise be due to hold an EU election.",Factbox: Through the Brexit Looking Glass - What happens next?,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-whatnext-factbox-idUSKCN1QE1P3

President Donald Trump faces several key challenges to winning re-election next year but he still enjoys the firm support of voters from his party, according to the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. The poll shows Trump has a 46 percent approval rating among voters, which is three points higher than it was in January. Overall, 41 percent of registered voters say they would vote to reelect Trump while 48 percent say they would definitely or likely vote for the Democratic nominee. Although those numbers are slightly worse than what Barack Obama enjoyed at this point in his first term, they’re on par with what Bill Clinton had in January 1995.

Voters also don’t trust Trump and don’t like some of his recent controversial decisions. Fifty-eight percent of voters say they don’t think he’s been honest about the Russia investigation while 60 percent disagree with his decision to declare a national emergency to build a border wall.

Although the numbers would suggest there is a clear opportunity for a Democratic candidate, they also show that Republicans overwhelmingly approve of the president’s job performance. Nearly 90 percent of Republicans say they approve of the job the president is doing and a majority of voters are confident that the country’s economy will continue to do well. The president continues to enjoy majority support among rural and white, male voters. But African-Americans and Latinos overwhelmingly disapprove of the president with 88 percent and 64 percent, respectively.",Four-in-10 Voters Say They Would Vote to Re-Elect Trump Next Year,Slate.com,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/03/four-in-10-voters-vote-trump-2020.html

Chuck Schumer wants Democrats to use the climate change debate to their advantage in 2020. In a New York Times interview published Monday, the Senate minority leader previewed a political strategy based on a barrage of daily floor speeches attacking Republicans for failing to take global warming seriously and a proposal to create a new committee to deal with the issue. “This is the first time Democrats have decided to go on offense on climate change,” he declared.

The promise to take the climate fight to Republicans is a welcome one. It would be a bold rebuttal to GOP leaders who can’t contain their giddiness about the prospects of using the Green New Deal as a political weapon and to the rest of the right as it tries to turn a pressing existential crisis into a joke about cow farts. Schumer’s comments show that he and other Democratic leaders have finally noticed the bevy of polls indicating that Americans—younger ones in particular—are increasingly worried about global warming and believe Democrats are far better suited than Republicans to do something about it. This issue really could be a political winner for Democrats.

Schumer’s words aside, though, it’s hard to spot the actual “offense” in his strategy. This is by design. The unspoken goal of Schumer’s plan is to provide his more moderate colleagues cover—not from the right, which wants to ignore the realities of man-made climate change, but from the activist left, which is demanding urgent action.

Consider what is effectively step one in Schumer’s strategy: He wants the entire Democratic caucus to simply vote “present” if Mitch McConnell forces a Senate vote on the Green New Deal, as the majority leader has promised to do in the coming weeks. Schumer’s ploy is clever in only the most immediate and narrow sense. Yes, it would conceivably take some of the air out of McConnell’s show vote, which itself is a cynical ploy, but it’s not as though Republicans will then throw up their hands and move on. The GOP will continue to use the Green New Deal—and an intentional misreading of it—to paint Democrats as leftist radicals who are coming for Americans’ cars, cows, and general way of life. A “present” vote isn’t going to change that, especially when six of the resolution’s Senate co-sponsors are seeking the Democratic nomination for president. Does Schumer think the GOP ad men are going to bark an order down the hallway to scrap the latest attack ads against Kamala Harris because she voted “present”?

The unspoken goal of Schumer’s plan is to provide his more moderate colleagues cover from the activist left.

Meanwhile, Democrats presenting a united front when there clearly isn’t one would be a setback to the climate movement. It dismisses the Green New Deal as a political talking point that no one in the party is taking seriously, not even its co-sponsors. That would be a real shame since, as I’ve written before, the Green New Deal serves a litmus test on the left, one that can differentiate between those who accept the general reality that humans are warming the planet and those who accept the specific global consensus that governments need to take urgent, concrete steps to address the crisis. A politician can pass that test without signing on to the entire Green New Deal framework as crafted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey, but that politician would need to get specific about which of its goals aren’t feasible or necessary. You don’t have to study the viral video of Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s exchange with young climate activists like the Zapruder film to see how the Green New Deal is exposing a crucial intraparty divide.

Schumer’s plan would enable Feinstein and fellow moderates to continue taking refuge in generalities, as they did last week when all 47 members of the Democratic caucus introduced a nine-line resolution that concluded “the United States and Congress should take immediate action to address the challenge of climate change”—without offering any hint of what that action should be. That’s an important sentiment, but it’s not progress. It’s a return to where the climate debate was before AOC and her Green New Deal came on the scene—a status quo that was defined by the same inaction that Schumer believes favors his party in the political present. Publicly shaming the GOP for its climate denial with floor speeches as Schumer proposes is easy, though it’s probably not effective. Consider what happened four years ago, shortly after the GOP reclaimed control of the Senate in the middle of Obama’s second term: Democrats were convinced they could score a few political points by forcing the GOP to go on record about its climate change denialism; Republicans promptly reminded them it’s impossible to embarrass someone about something he’s publicly proud of. With the world watching, the upper chamber voted not once, but four times to reject amendments acknowledging that humans are contributing to climate change.

If Schumer can persuade his caucus to ignore the Green New Deal, we’d be right back where we were in 2016, when the defining fault line in the climate debate ran so neatly between the two parties that it often went without saying. It was that dynamic that allowed Hillary Clinton to talk a big game about climate change as a major issue of her 2016 campaign one day, then turn around a few days later and publicly dismiss as unrealistic the climate activists urging she do more. The ensuing heckling aside, Clinton could trust that the climate crowd would come around by Election Day, since they had no other choice. If Schumer has his way, the 2020 nominee will be able to do the same.",Schumer’s Climate Change Forecast: Mostly Cloudy,Slate.com,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/03/schumer-climate-change-democrats-2020-strategy-green-new-deal.html

Politicians love introducing tax-cuts, because they're reliable vote-getters, even if they're structured to blow up later by giving massive breaks to the super-rich and more modest breaks to middle-class voters, resulting in mounting deficits and eventual service cuts.

But Trump has managed the impossible: he signed trillions of dollars of tax-cuts into law and lost in the polls as a result.

Trump managed this feat by handing middle-class and poor people tax bills instead of refunds, while cutting in a tiny number of super-rich people for unbelievably large breaks (and the 99% will get stiffed even harder in 2027, when their taxes go up again).

Bill Black proposes a tantalizing thought-experiment: what if Trump had spread the tax breaks around, giving, say, $5,000 to every household with a combined income of less than $75,000? What if he tailored the breaks to his base, farmers, old people, blue-collar workers (while stiffing poor people)?

Not only would this have stimulated the everloving fuck out of the US economy -- wage stagnation and austerity has left the US with tons of underutilized labor and plant that could churn out tons of goods for these people to buy without any inflation to speak of -- but the Democratic leadership would have hated it, because Pelosi, Schumer and the rest of the ""paygo"" crowd are crazy deficit hawks who don't want any unfunded liabilities in federal budgets.

The result would have been a huge PR win for Trump and a massive PR hit for the Democratic establishment. It might have even cost Pelosi the speakership, leaving Trump with a less canny adversary over the next two years.

More importantly, it would have given Trump -- who is much broker than he lets on, and dependent on shady lenders for his funding because no real bank will touch him after all those bankruptcies -- a solid base of his own, separate from the plutocrats who benefited from the tax breaks.

The last sentence understates the scale of political benefits that would have come to Trump had he fulfilled his campaign promise to slash middle-class taxes. It leaves out how much the so-called Democratic centrists’ opposition to such a tax cut would have added to Trump’s popularity while reducing support for Democrats in the 2018 congressional elections. The ‘New Democrats’ and the House Democratic leadership are fervent supporters of “paygo” limitations on budget expenditures. They are far to the right of Republican members of Congress on this issue. More precisely, Republican members of Congress overwhelmingly pretend to care about budget deficits and federal debt only when the President is a Democrat. ‘New Democrats,’ ‘Blue Dog’ Democrats, and Democrats who join “Problem Solvers” and other groups religiously oppose deficits even when increasing the deficit is the best economic action. The result of the ‘centrist’ Democrats’ war against even desirable deficits is that they would have fought and died to oppose a real middle-class Trump tax cut. They would have predicted that it would produce a disaster. Their predictions about the grave and imminent peril of increasing the deficit, as always, would have proven false. Trump would have emerged with his own popularity greatly expanded and enhanced as his greatest rival’s popularity greatly diminished. The Republicans would have held the House, and possibly expanded their majority there and added to their Senate majority. Trump would have demonstrated that he was the expert on the economy, taxes, and the deficit. Pelosi would have demonstrated her recurrent failure to understand the economy, taxes, and the deficit. She would likely have been defeated in 2018 in the Democratic vote for minority leader. Pelosi is a skilled legislative leader, with terrible, closely related, blindspots on deficits and the urgency of dealing with climate change. She acts as if we cannot afford to save the planet by acting decisively against global climate change now. That view is horrific economics and public policy. Similarly, she would have been at her worst in arguing that Trump was endangering the Nation by creating a real trillion-dollar middle-class tax cut. She would have been the face of the Democratic Party in the 2018 elections – the woman and her Party that tried to keep your middle-class family from receiving a $5,000 tax cut. When the economy reacted positively to the resultant stimulus, her humiliation, and that of her Party, would have been complete. Given what Trump knows now about Pelosi’s skill in legislative infighting he should be able to weigh the “opportunity cost” of not using a real middle-class tax cut to maintain control of the House and to discredit and ultimately cause the Democrats to remove Pelosi from leadership. Trump’s cowardly and corrupt surrender to his puppet masters on the tax cut and infrastructure allowed the Democrats to gain control of the House. That made it possible for Pelosi to become Speaker again and to rain down the blows on Trump that have made his life miserable.

Here's something Democrats thought they knew during the last presidential campaign: Wisconsin was safe. It was a lock for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But when the votes were counted, it was a stunning upset for Republican Donald Trump.

In 2020, Democrats apparently aren't taking the state for granted.

Even though the first nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire are some 11 months away, and with Wisconsin's primary not until April 7 of next year, the campaign stops have already begun.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar spoke to a packed bicycle shop and coffee house in Eau Claire two weeks ago. It was the first stop on her very first campaign trip since declaring her candidacy a week earlier. Klobuchar highlighted a family history in the Midwest, including Wisconsin.

""I do not come from money,"" the candidate began. ""My mom was a teacher. My dad was a newspaperman. My grandpa was an iron ore miner, and those relatives in Wisconsin, during the Depression, my grandpa worked in a pie shop.""

Heading to Eau Claire was a practical choice — it's not far from the Wisconsin border with Minnesota, Klobuchar's home state. Iowa is right next door as well.

There was also symbolism in the form of the message it sent to Democrats everywhere that a traditionally blue battleground won't be ignored this time.

Clinton's missed opportunity

In the 2016 election, the Clinton campaign had a relaxed approach to Wisconsin. From the time she accepted the nomination in late July right up to Election Day, Clinton never campaigned in the state in person. She made zero visits to the state in those crucial final months, leaving that task to surrogates.

The Democrats had pretty good reason to take that approach. After all, the last Republican to capture the state's electoral votes was President Ronald Reagan in '84 — and in 2016 the polls in the state pointed to that trend continuing.

""My poll and all 33 other polls in the state showed Clinton leading by an average of about 6 points,"" says pollster Charles Franklin of Marquette University Law School.

Still, Trump's campaign treated Wisconsin like a hotly contested battleground. He made repeated visits there in the final 100 days of the campaign. At a rally in the city Eau Claire in the western, more rural part of the state, he predicted, ""In just one week we are going to win the great state of Wisconsin. And we are going to win back the White House. It's going to happen, folks.""

Ultimately, Trump carried Wisconsin by just 22,177 votes — a winning margin of less than 1 percent. It was part of a trio of upsets in previously blue states that included Michigan and Pennsylvania — giving him the margin he needed to win the White House.

There are a lot of things factoring into that result, of course, but pollster Charles Franklin says two things happened. Trump did well in the rural western side of the state, a more Republican area, but one that Barack Obama had managed to carry. Plus, Franklin adds, turnout in the state's largest urban area, the Democratic stronghold of Milwaukee, was significantly lower than expected. That resulted in fewer votes overall for Clinton in a big city where she needed to run up the score.

Upset victories in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania combined were key to Trump's electoral college victory.

Talk to everybody, everywhere

Democrats have been taking notes. Klobuchar hardly has Wisconsin to herself this time around. Another potential Democratic presidential hopeful dropped in recently, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke. At a tour of the Milwaukee Area Technical College, he said it's good that the state is getting attention. ""Wisconsin — perhaps like other parts of the country, perhaps even including where I'm from in far west Texas — too often is overlooked,"" he said. O'Rourke said he's still deciding whether to enter the presidential race.

Meanwhile, Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairperson Martha Laning says she's been hearing from other candidates about early visits to the state as well.

""It sends a message to the whole nation,"" Laning tells NPR. Of the candidates, she adds that it's evident that after what happened in 2016, ""they're not going to take anything for granted and they're stopping by Wisconsin right now.""

But Laning stresses that candidate visits are only part of it. Yes, there are lessons from Clinton's absence last time, but she acknowledges that the Wisconsin Democrats need to be better at reaching voters in every part of the state — urban and rural, blue and red.

She says the 2018 midterms were a good start, as it was a very strong Democratic year in Wisconsin. They easily re-elected Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, and they defeated Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who had been seeking a third term in office.

Laning says the lesson of 2016's defeat is that you need to talk to voters everywhere, and if you pick up an unexpected vote here or a vote there, it can make the difference when there's another election with a razor-thin margin.

Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor and champion of causes such as gun control and climate change, has ended months of speculation by announcing that he will not run for US president next year.

The 77-year-old, one of the richest men in the world, revealed his decision on Tuesday not to join the crowded Democratic field – currently at 16 candidates – but pledged to pour his vast wealth into the resistance movement against Donald Trump.

“I know we can do better as a country,” he wrote in a Bloomberg News editorial. “And I believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election. But I am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.”

Bloomberg has toyed with a presidential run before as an independent but re-registered as a Democrat last year and spent recent months courting primary voters as a political centrist. However, the fiscal conservative increasingly seemed out of step with a liberal base questioning the morality of economic inequality and the influence of money in politics.

Another billionaire, Tom Steyer, who has been campaigning for Trump’s impeachment, read the runes and decided in January not to make a bid for the White House. It appears that Bloomberg has reached a similar conclusion. His pro-business positions and support for stop-and-frisk policing as mayor of New York would also have come under scrutiny.

Neil Sroka, spokesperson for the progressive political action committee Democracy for America, said: “No surprise. No constituency. He had an additional challenge as a billionaire at a moment when the last thing people want is someone with ungodly sums of money telling them what to do. More importantly, he was pushing an agenda that has little support in the Democratic party and even less outside the Democratic party.”

There will not, after all, be a battle of the septuagenarian New York billionaire businessmen, between Trump and Bloomberg. Sroka added: “It shows Bloomberg has one thing over Trump: he’s not so blindly narcissistic that he got into this race.”

In the editorial, Bloomberg urged Democrats to unify behind a nominee who could defeat Trump, an implied warning against veering to the left as some candidates embrace a Green New Deal and Medicare for All – already painted by Republicans as socialist projects.

Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-declared democratic socialist, is among the early frontrunners. Howard Schultz, the billionaire former chief executive of Starbucks, is considering a run as an independent despite a fierce backlash from voters who fear he will peel off Democratic votes and help re-elect Trump.

Following Bloomberg’s announcement, Schultz tweeted: “I’ve long said there isn’t room for centrist moderation in either party and it appears Mr Bloomberg has come to the same conclusion.”

In a congressional testimony before the US House of Representatives committee, Cohen accused Trump of being “a racist”, “a conman” and “a cheat”.

The testimony is part of an investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is looking into ties between Trump’s campaign officials and Russia. It is also looking into other ways Russia may have influenced the 2016 presidential polls. Russia is also accused of attempting to meddle in the 2016 Brexit referendum.

In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for multiple offences, including lying to the US Congress and for facilitating bribes to two women who allegedly had affairs with Trump. In August 2018, Cohen had pleaded guilty in a New York court to eight counts of tax crimes, making illegal campaign contributions and admitted that he made pre-election payments.

Cohen claimed that Trump’s longtime political advisor Roger Stone in July 2016 had told him that he had been speaking to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and that there would be “massive dump” of emails that would affect Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton’s, presidential campaign.

He also claimed that Trump wanted him to lie about a property deal in Moscow amid his presidential campaign for 2016 elections. “At the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there’s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing,” Cohen said. “In his way, he was telling me to lie.”

Cohen claimed that Trump had also asked him to pay off an adult film star, Stephanie Clifford, with whom Trump had had an affair, Reuters reported. Cohen submitted a copy of $130,000 wire transfer made during the closing days of the presidential campaign to Clifford, whose screen name is Stormy Daniels.

Cohen said while Trump has publicly courted white supremacists and bigots, “in private, he is even worse”. “He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn’t a ‘shithole’,” he told the committee, according to BBC. “This was when Barack Obama was president of the United States.”

He claimed Trump had also said that black people would never vote for him “because they were too stupid”. Since becoming the president, Trump has become the worst version of himself, Cohen said, adding that Trump is “fundamentally disloyal”.

“Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great,” Cohen said. “He had no desire or intention to lead this nation – only to market himself and to build his wealth and power.”

Meanwhile, the US president, who is currently in Vietnam to attend a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, hit back at Cohen saying the lawyer was “lying in order to reduce his prison time”.","'Trump is racist, a conman and a cheat,' says his former lawyer in US congressional testimony - Scroll.in",Scroll.in,https://scroll.in/latest/914855/us-trump-is-racist-a-conman-and-a-cheat-says-his-former-lawyer-in-us-congressional-testimony

Jay Inslee jumped into the 2020 Democratic presidential primary Friday with a promise to put climate change front and center in both his campaign and his potential presidency. Given the serious risks of rising global temperatures, Inslee…","Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee jumped into the 2020 Democratic presidential primary Friday with a promise to put climate change front and center in both his campaign and his potential presidency.

Given the serious risks of rising global temperatures, Inslee told TIME in an interview ahead of his announcement that climate change cannot be one item “on a list of things to do.” He pledged to coordinate an unprecedented effort to tackle the issue.

“Beating climate change has to be the first priority of the United States,” he said. “It has to be the paramount duty. It has to be the organizing principle of the next administration throughout all its agencies.”

The two-term governor, who previously served seven terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, enters a crowded field of candidates, many of whom have better name recognition and more buzz, and he hasn’t featured prominently in Democratic primary polling to date.

But Inslee is betting that voters in early states will be drawn to his record and message on climate change. Inslee pointed to a poll from the Center for American Progress, a progressive group, showing that tackling climate change is a key concern for primary voters in five early voting states, an issue equalled only by universal health care.

To be sure, Democrat candidates all have noted the importance of tackling climate change, but so far none have put it as front and center as Inslee promises to do. Most candidates have endorsed a resolution from the progressive wing of the party calling for a Green New Deal that would seek to supply all of the country’s power by zero-emissions sources by 2030, although some do not necessarily endorse all elements of the plan.

And the topic comes up frequently in speeches and campaign messaging, often as a way of hitting President Donald Trump, who announced in 2017 that the U.S. will leave the Paris Agreement on climate change and previously called climate change a hoax.

Still, none of the other candidates in the field have signaled that climate change will be the centerpiece of their campaign the way that Inslee plans. Inslee will host a series of climate change-related events in Iowa next week before heading to Nevada and California.

Inslee referred to his record on a range of policies from the state’s clean energy standard to a program for electrifying the transportation sector and touted his leadership of an alliance for cities and states to commit to the Paris Agreement. And more than a decade before the Green New Deal entered the national lexicon, Inslee authored a 2007 book calling for a massive spike in government funding for research and development and investment in clean energy that would create so-called green jobs.

While endorsing a Green New Deal has emerged as a litmus test for Democratic presidential candidates hoping to win the support of the party’s progressive wing, some say ranking climate change as the top issue may prove more important down the road.

Scientists say meaningful action on global warming cannot wait — whatever solution a future president may choose to pursue, and an incoming president typically faces a narrow window to burn political capital and enact sweeping new legislation. Trump enacted a tax cut early in his administration, but has struggled to notch legislative victories since then. President Barack Obama chose to put his energy behind the Affordable Care Act early in his presidency rather than his party’s major climate change bill, which passed the House but never received a vote in the Senate.

“You have to be willing to spend your political capital on it,” says Inslee. “I would be willing to do that, and that is the only way this is going to get done.”

Inslee declined to lay out the specific planks of a policy platform, but he said he was looking at a combination of direct investment to stimulate clean technologies and regulations to mandate emissions reductions. Carbon pricing mechanisms should not be taken off the table but are not part of his current thinking, he said, adding that his current work in Washington state will accomplish the same emissions reduction goals as the carbon tax that failed to pass a statewide ballot initiative last year would have.

“Our environmental laws have been extremely successful when we’ve applied them,” he says. “We just haven’t applied them to the most dangerous pollutant at the moment, which is carbon dioxide and methane.”

284,Empty,2019-02-25T14:32:08Z,Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett told CNBC Monday that he would support New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg for president.,"Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett told CNBC on Monday that he would support fellow billionaire and former three-term New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg for president.

""If Mike Bloomberg announced tomorrow that he was a candidate, I would say I'm for him,"" Buffett told Becky Quick in a ""Squawk Box"" Interview from Omaha, Nebraska. ""I think he would be a very good president.""

Buffett said he's never been a card-carrying Democrat, pointing out that he's voted for Democratic candidates and Republican candidates over the years. He said neither party has an edge on virtue.

Without elaborating, Buffett said he and Bloomberg disagree on some things.

However, he added, ""I think that he knows how to run things. I think he's got the right goals for America. He understands people. He understands the market system. And he understands the problems of people"" not in the market.

Bloomberg, 77, is seen as a possible 2020 candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Bloomberg ran as an independent during his last successful campaign, when was re-elected mayor for a third term in 2009. He was a Republican in his first two terms. Bloomberg switched his party affiliation from independent to Democrat in October.

In a recent email to CNBC, top Bloomberg advisor Howard Wolfson hinted at how much his boss would look to invest into his own potential campaign.

""Mike spent more than $100 million in his last mayor's race. Last time I looked, NYC is a fraction of the size of the country as a whole,"" Wolfson said.

For years, Bloomberg had flirted with an independent run for president. But he now believes it would be a mistake. In a January statement, after former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz floated a possible third-party run, Bloomberg said, ""In 2020, the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the president. That's a risk I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford to run it now.""

In Monday's interview, Buffett said he agrees with Bloomberg that a Schultz third-party would take votes away from any Democrat.

Making no evaluation of Schultz as a potential candidate, Buffett added, ""I think generally [that] third-party candidates, they're going to hurt one side or the other, and they're more likely to hurt the side that they actually favor, because they're closer to that view, and so they pull more people away that would otherwise go with the second-best with that view.""

""So I hope no third-party candidate runs,"" he added. ""I think third-party candidates can thwart, actually, the will of the people.""

Buffett was interviewed from the floor of the Berkshire-owned Nebraska Furniture Mart, following Saturday's release of his widely read annual shareholder letter.

Correction: This story was revised to correct when Bloomberg registered as a Democrat. It was last year.

285,Empty,2019-03-01T16:54:00Z,Washington State Governor Jay Inslee’s campaign will tell a lot about Democratic views on climate change—and about the future of single-issue candidates.,"On the one hand, there’s been a dearth of Republicans willing to challenge Donald Trump for the 2020 GOP nomination, despite the president’s weak approval ratings. And on the other, the Libertarian Party still needs a standard-bearer in 2020. Why not kill two birds with one stone?

That is one way to frame a would-be bid for president by Representative Justin Amash, a Michigan Republican. As Roll Call reports, the Libertarian Party has been trying to coax the small-l libertarian to run under its mantle, and Amash says he’s considering it. He’s previously implied that he sees himself as the ideal libertarian candidate.

The pairing would make a certain amount of sense for both parties. The Libertarians had their best showing ever in 2016, with Gary Johnson and his running mate, William Weld, pulling 4.5 million votes. But Johnson has said he won’t run for a third straight cycle this year. Ironically enough, Weld has defected back to the Republican Party and is the only remotely major GOP challenger to Trump with an exploratory committee.

Amash, meanwhile, finds himself in a strange place within his party. He was elected in 2010, as part of the Tea Party wave. At the time, there seemed to be a strong libertarian bent in the new class, but over time that has largely dissipated. Many of the Tea Partiers were in favor of lower taxes and were against Obamacare, but in the years since they’ve either assimilated into the mainstream GOP or pulled it slightly right. Even Rand Paul, scion of the libertarian hero Ron Paul, has become a reliable Republican vote except on a few favorite issues.

Amash, however, has remained stubbornly strong on civil liberties. Even within his first few months on the job, he had developed a reputation for bucking GOP leadership. In 2012, then-Speaker John Boehner removed him from the House Budget Committee for voting against the Republican budget plan; Amash felt it didn’t cut spending fast enough. More recently, he’s often broken with Trump. Amash distinguished himself during the House Oversight Committee’s questioning of Michael Cohen, the president’s former fixer. While other GOP members either yielded their time to Ranking Member Jim Jordan or pursued polemical lines of questioning, Amash seemed genuinely interested in asking questions. And when President Trump visited Grand Rapids, in Amash’s district, last week, the congressman was conspicuously missing from the roll of Republican dignitaries on hand.

Running for president would be a sacrifice for Amash. No one expects the Libertarian candidate to actually win the race and become president; it’s more about pushing libertarian ideals into the discourse. Amash also seems to have a fairly safe seat, meaning he could stay in the House for the foreseeable future. But there’s no clear upward path for him in the Republican Party, especially given his heterodoxy. (Amash passed on a U.S. Senate race in 2014, and the Republican nominee lost by a wide margin to now-Senator Gary Peters.) Anyway, if Amash’s goal was advancing through the hierarchy, he’d probably have approached his career in a different way to begin with.

If Amash decided to run, he’d be joining a crowded field. There are some two dozen announced or possible Democratic contenders. On the Republican side, there’s Trump and Weld. And the Libertarian Party won’t be the only third party to field a candidate.

As the presidential primaries progress, this cheat sheet will be updated regularly.

KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND

Who is she?

Gillibrand has been a senator from New York since 2009, replacing Hillary Clinton. Before that, she served in the U.S. House.

Is she running?

Yes. She launched her campaign officially on March 17.

Why does she want to run?

Gillibrand has emphasized women’s issues, ranging from sexual harassment in the military and more recent #MeToo stories to equal pay, and her role as a mom is central in her announcement video. Once a fairly conservative Democrat, she has moved left in recent years.

Who wants her to run?

Gillibrand could have fairly broad appeal among mainstream Democratic voters, and she hopes that her time representing upstate New York gives her an advantage with nonurban voters. She has, however, earned the enmity of the Clinton world for her criticisms of Bill.

Can she win the nomination?

Perhaps. Her campaign hasn’t managed to gain much traction thus far.

What else do we know?

The automated telephone survey by Forum Research found that 42 per cent of decided and leaning voters would support the Conservative Party in a federal election. The Liberals followed with 33 per cent of respondents indicating they would support the party, while 12 per cent said they intend or would likely vote for the New Democratic Party.

The survey was conducted Feb. 27 and 28 and included 1,301 randomly selected Canadian voters. It has a margin of error of three percentage points, 19 times out of 20. “When you look at our polling numbers, we still have the Tories ahead basically,” said Forum Research president Lorne Bozinoff, whose firm’s polls have put the Conservatives ahead since Sept. 2017. A majority of respondents to the latest poll—60 per cent—also indicated they disapprove of the job Trudeau is doing as prime minister, versus 30 per cent who approve of his job performance and 10 per cent who said they don’t know. Thirty per cent of respondents approved of Trudeau’s job performance, compared with 34 per cent for Scheer as leader of the opposition.

The poll was conducted on the day and day after Jody Wilson-Raybould testified at the House of Commons justice committee. The former attorney general detailed what she said was a months-long campaign of pressure by the prime minister, the clerk of the privy council and high-ranking staff from Trudeau’s office to convince Wilson-Raybould to overrule Canada’s director of public prosecutions and agree to a plea deal—called a deferred prosecution agreement—with the Montreal-based global engineering firm SNC-Lavalin. Such a deal would allow the company to admit wrongdoing in the face of fraud and corruption charges relating to operations in Libya when the dictator Moammar Gadhafi was in power. Instead of a criminal conviction that could bar SNC-Lavalin from federal contracts for 10 years, the company would pay a fine and agree to a series of compliance measures.

Trudeau and Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick have acknowledged the government’s concern for the jobs of almost 9,000 Canadians employed by SNC-Lavalin, as well as the company’s warning that it could be forced to relocate to another country in the event of a conviction. But the prime minister has denied he or anyone in his office did anything inappropriate in discussing the SNC-Lavalin case with Wilson-Raybould when she was attorney general. On Monday, Trudeau acknowledged “more questions need to be answered” after Jane Philpott, a prominent MP who held several key portfolios in the Liberal cabinet, resigned as president of the treasury board. In a public letter, Philpott echoed Wilson-Raybould’s concerns about public prosecutions being free from partisan influence, and said she lost confidence in the government over its handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair. Trudeau’s former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who resigned despite denying that any inappropriate pressure had been brought to bear on Wilson-Raybould, is set to testifying at the justice committee on Wednesday morning.

288,Empty,2019-03-07T16:06:29Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The House is expected to vote Thursday on a resolution ""opposing hate"" as Democrats try to move past a controversy over remarks by freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar that deeply split the party and clouded their agenda.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Divided in debate but mostly united in a final vote, the House passed a resolution condemning anti-Semitism and other bigotry Thursday, with Democrats trying to push past a dispute that has overwhelmed their agenda and exposed fault lines that could shadow them through next year's elections.

The one-sided 407-23 vote belied the emotional infighting over how to respond to freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar's recent comments suggesting House supporters of Israel have dual allegiances. For days, Democrats wrestled with whether or how to punish the lawmaker, arguing over whether Omar, one of two Muslim women in Congress, should be singled out, what other types of bias should be decried in the text and whether the party would tolerate dissenting views on Israel.

Republicans generally joined in the favorable vote, though nearly two-dozen opposed the measure, one calling it a ""sham.""

Generational as well as ideological, the argument was fueled in part by young, liberal lawmakers — and voters — who have become a face of the newly empowered Democratic majority in the House. These lawmakers are critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, rejecting the conservative leader's approach to Palestinians and other issues.

They split sharply from Democratic leaders who seemed caught off guard by the support for Omar and unprepared for the debate. But the leaders regrouped.

""It's not about her. It's about these forms of hatred,"" Speaker Nancy Pelosi said before the vote.

The resolution approved Thursday condemns anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against minorities ""as hateful expressions of intolerance."" Omar, a Somali-American, and fellow Muslims Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Andrew Carson of Indiana, issued a statement praising the ""historic"" vote as the first resolution to condemn ""anti-Muslim bigotry.""

Some Democrats complained that Omar's comments on Israel had ignited all this debate while years of President Donald Trump's racially charged rhetoric had led to no similar congressional action.

The seven-page document details a history of recent attacks not only against Jews in the United States but also Muslims, as it condemns all such discrimination as contradictory to ""the values and aspirations"" of the people of the United States. The vote was delayed for a time on Thursday to include mention of Latinos to address concerns of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. It was inserted under a section on white supremacists who ""weaponize hate for political gain"" over a long list of ""traditionally persecuted peoples.""

An earlier version focused more narrowly on anti-Semitism. The final resolution did not mention Omar by name.

Getting this debate right will be crucial for Democrats in 2020. U.S.-Israel policy is a prominent issue that is exposing the splits between the party's core voters, its liberal flank and the more centrist Americans in Trump country the party hopes to reach.

""What I fear is going on in the House now is an effort to target Congresswoman Omar as a way of stifling that debate. That's wrong,"" said presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent.

""Anti-Semitism is a hateful and dangerous ideology which must be vigorously opposed in the United States and around the world,"" the senator said. ""We must not, however, equate anti-Semitism with legitimate criticism of the right-wing, Netanyahu government in Israel.""

Other Democratic presidential contenders tried to walk a similar line.

California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris said ""we need to speak out against hate."" But she said she also believes ""there is a critical difference between criticism of policy or political leaders, and anti-Semitism.""

A statement from Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said, ""Branding criticism of Israel as automatically anti-Semitic has a chilling effect on our public discourse and makes it harder to achieve a peaceful solution between Israelis and Palestinians.""

His second term ended just a few weeks ago. Now he’s running for President. On Monday, after recent trips to early-voting states—Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina—he made things official, releasing a campaign-announcement video that features him standing in the snow, looking serious and reasonable.

A champion of political moderation and positive campaigning, he’s best known nationally for his least moderate act as governor: signing gun-control legislation in 2013, in the wake of the mass shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, and Aurora, Colorado, which the N.R.A. vehemently opposed. The question of moderation—what it means, who wants it, what it’s good for—seems likely to define Hickenlooper’s run. “Doesn’t seem like moderation is in tune with where Democratic-primary voters are right now,” the “Good Morning America” host George Stephanopoulos said to Hickenlooper on Monday, during an interview. Hickenlooper waved off the concern. “I don’t think voters are interested in labels anymore,” he said. “I think there’s an appetite for people that can get stuff done.”

Other candidates in the race have tried to define themselves in reaction to the Democratic Party’s leftward movement. Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks C.E.O., has denounced the changes he sees in the Party. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator, has cast herself as a realist alternative to politicians calling for Medicare for All and a Green New Deal. Hickenlooper is saying something slightly different. On Monday, Stephanopoulos challenged Hickenlooper to imagine a scenario: it’s 2021, and he’s just been sworn in as the country’s forty-sixth President. But Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky senator who did so much to thwart Barack Obama’s agenda, is still the Senate Majority Leader. “What can you work on together?” Stephanopoulos asked. Hickenlooper, in his answer, spoke not of policy goals but of political approach. “I learned this in the restaurant business: when someone’s angry, you don’t fight back on them or argue with them, you repeat back their words,” he said. “If I got, came into”—he caught himself—“when I come into office, I would go to Mitch McConnell, to his office, and I would sit down with him and say, ‘Now, what is the issue again?’ And we would talk, and I would continue to speak back to him.

292,Empty,2019-02-26T15:12:18Z,Somewhat,"For Democratic candidates now, the question is not so much whether to support a plan to make college more affordable, but what the right approach is for doing so. The details—whether there is an income cap for eligibility; whether the government covers tuition costs up front before grants; whether there are merit or GPA requirements—will determine who will benefit the most, and who will pay for such a plan.

A subtle tweak from Kamala Harris this past January encapsulates the coming debate over the scope of the party’s proposals. The senator from California, while making formal what many had suspected—that she would be running for president—tweaked her language in a slight but potentially significant way. She was supporting free college, but not just any free college: She was pushing for debt-free college. “I am running to declare education is a fundamental right,” she said, “and we will guarantee that right with universal pre-K and debt-free college.”

What was the difference? Free college is a catchall term for a range of college-affordability plans. There are “tuition-free” programs, where the government—or an institution—covers tuition but not the other expenses, such as books, housing, or food; then there are debt-free college plans, which aim to address all those other costs. Harris was getting specific; and she was doing so with the kind of free-college idea—debt-free—that equity advocates tend to prefer.

Oftentimes, tuition-free models are “last dollar,” which means that the government covers tuition after all other grant aid—such as Pell Grants, which are federal grants for low-income students—is applied. Oftentimes those grants cover the full tuition at community colleges, and students aren’t able to use that money for things like books, housing, or food. These are things that they may ultimately have to take on debt to afford. “Progressive candidates need to be talking about debt-free college instead of just free college, and going beyond tuition for low-income students,” Tiffany Jones, the director of higher-education policy at the Education Trust, an advocacy group for low-income students, told me.

Harris’s declaration was a departure from her language in 2016, when she first introduced a plan, toward the end of her Senate campaign, to make community college tuition-free for all, and four-year college tuition-free for families making less than $140,000 a year; it was even a departure from weeks prior, when she pushed for tuition-free college. Her development signaled, perhaps above all, how the Democratic Party has evolved on college affordability.

Read: Why is college in America so expensive?

The United States has a long history of college-access and -affordability policies—the first Morrill Act, the GI Bill, etc.—that did not provide equitable access or universal affordability, particularly for minorities.

The 76-year-old former military ruler took 56 percent of votes against 41 for his closest challenger, businessman and former vice president Atiku Abubakar of the People’s Democratic Party.

Atiku, 72, said he would go to court to contest the results due to a litany of “premeditated malpractices”.

Buhari has a daunting to-do list, from reviving an economy still struggling to recover from a 2016 recession to quelling a decade-old Islamist insurgency in the northeast.

Some 327 people died in election-related violence since the campaign began in October, 67 of them during or after Saturday’s vote, according to the Situation Room monitoring group and security sources.

The violence included insurgents’ attacks to disrupt voting, and clashes between gangs and security forces around poll centres.

Buhari, of the All Progressive Congress party, said he would reform the economy, combat graft and improve security, and urged supporters not to gloat or “humiliate” the opposition.

“We will continue to engage all parties. Our government will remain inclusive and our doors will remain open,” he said while receiving his election certificate.

Atiku rejected the outcome, saying one obvious red flag was that states in the northeast ravaged by insurgents’ attacks generated much higher voter turnouts than peaceful states.

“It is clear that there were manifest and premeditated malpractices in many states which negate the results announced,” he said.

That presaged a legal battle in a terrain where Nigeria’s most senior judge was controversially suspended by Buhari last month after allegations he breached asset declaration rules.

The move brought criticism that the government was meddling with judicial independence.

OVERTURNING RESULTS “VERY UNLIKELY”

The opposition’s fraud accusations have heightened tensions in the region’s most populous nation and biggest oil producer where six decades of independence have seen long periods of military rule, coups and secessionist wars.

But the controversy could also just peter out, as happened recently after a presidential vote in Democratic Republic of Congo. “A legal challenge is very unlikely to overturn the official result,” said John Ashbourne, economist at Capital Economics in London, of the Nigerian election.

The president garnered 15.2 million votes to Atiku’s 11.3 million, on turnout of just 35.6 percent, the electoral commission said.

The vote was delayed by a week after the commission was unable to get ballots and results sheets to all areas.

U.S. observers said that probably reduced turnout.

Buhari campaigned on pledges to fight corruption and overhaul Nigeria’s creaking road and rail network.

Analysts said he may find it easier to pass policies after Bukola Saraki, the former Senate president, lost his senatorial seat in local elections also held on Saturday.

Saraki nominally controlled parliament under the ruling party banner, but bitter disputes with the presidency saw the lawmaker often working to frustrate bills and budgets proposed by Buhari. He decamped to the opposition last year.

“Buhari is likely to get a friendlier Senate president, which could mean more efficient executive-legislative coordination,” said Amaka Anku, Africa director at Eurasia Group.

Buhari also has to deal with the threat from militants in the oil-rich southern Niger Delta region. The Niger Delta Avengers, whose attacks in 2016 pushed the economy into its first recession in 25 years, want their area to get a greater share of oil revenue it produces and had backed Atiku.

The Avengers had warned on Feb. 14 that they would cripple the economy if Buhari was re-elected. The group has not carried out any substantial attacks since January 2017.

“We would have to see if the Avengers will act on their threat. However, these militants are up for sale, so as long as they are granted their privileges they may not be a problem,” said Malte Liewerscheidt, West Africa analyst at Teneo.","Buhari re-elected as Nigerian president, Atiku vows legal challenge",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-election-idUSKCN1QG11U

It’s home not just to the wave of IT offshoring firms of the 1990s and early 2000s, but also to some of the most interesting unicorn tech startups in the world, including Freshworks, Paytm, Oyo and of course Flipkart, which sold to Walmart last year for $16 billion.

India though is also at something of an economic crossroads. Unlike China, which as we discussed yesterday faces a conflict between open entrepreneurship and strict party control in its next stage of development, India must build up its indigenous startups while also opening up to the global economy.

That economic balancing act will be tough. As James Crabtree, a long-time writer of the Financial Times based in Mumbai, argues in his book The Billionaire Raj, India faces a triple threat of “inequality and the new super-rich, crony capitalism, and the travails of the industrial economy” as it seeks to move the country into middle-income status.

You’re reading the Extra Crunch Daily. Like this newsletter? Subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates.

Crabtree, who built up access among India’s traditional business elite over many years, sees a nation that is starving for more government capacity. India has transitioned in a few short decades from a moribund economy languishing under a sclerotic and byzantine bureaucratic model (sometimes referred to as the “license raj”) into an increasingly open and competitive market for goods and services.

Yet, success outside of a scant few industries — namely IT services — has been undergirded by political access and the trading of favors. Crabtree chronicles a whole crop of entrepreneurs from across the country in industries as far afield as mining to liquor to aircraft to show the constant intermixing of Indian business and Indian politics.

That crony capitalism is at the heart of what he dubs today’s “billionaire raj” — a government that isn’t for the ultra-rich so much as it lacks any capacity whatsoever to stand up to its worst excesses and corruption. The book is one part travelogue, one part analysis, and one part biographical bookshelf that together paint a complicated portrait of India’s growth ambitions and challenges to scale.

Given where India’s fortunes have been made the past few decades, the book mostly ignores the tech industry, save for fleeting mentions scattered about. But I asked Crabtree in an interview last week where he saw the country headed, and how technology might underpin that.

“People thought that India was going to become the next hot market for Silicon Valley tech money after China, but it doesn’t look like that will be the case,” he explained. Unlike China, which created friction in market entry for foreign tech companies, India has been reasonably open. “The biggest search engine in India is Google, the biggest social network is Facebook,” he noted. “They don’t make much money in India, but they have spectacular user growth.”

“When I lived in Mumbai, there was a big tech investment wave in the after wave of the Alibaba IPO,” he explained. “There were these great hopes that India would follow the sort of hockey stick growth” seen in China. Yet, the country’s demographics don’t back that up. “India has a tiny middle class — 10-20 million” using a reasonable definition of the term “middle class.” That group is simply not large enough to support the valuation dreams underpinning some of India’s most-discussed unicorns. “Growing users is really easy, but growing revenues is just much more challenging,” he said.

The challenge ahead for India is that a form of economic nationalism is increasingly popular in Delhi. We have covered a bit of this change around data localization / sovereignty, but it is certainly much wider than those policies. “I think there is a slow but steady trend toward closure that is partly to do with India’s domestic politics” and partly due to international climate, Crabtree explained. The thinking is that, “China has produced Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu [… but] India hasn’t produced any major global stars yet.”

Fueling that rift is a sense that foreign tech giants “don’t pay much in the way of tax, they are not Indian companies” and that they “haven’t behaved particularly well.” Crabtree was referring specifically to Facebook’s Free Basics program, which became deeply controversial in the country, although those feelings are not limited to just Facebook.

India has a massive election coming up in just a few weeks, which will decide whether current Indian prime minister Narendra Modi stays in power. Beyond just policy, Crabtree sees a major challenge for all foreign tech companies, but particularly those operating social networks. “The stakes are very high for how social media manages the stresses and strains of a competitive and potentially nasty Indian political campaign,” he said. “If they are blamed for something that went wrong… this would be immensely damaging.”

India has the potential to be the single largest democratic free market economy in the world. But it needs to simultaneously cut down on its corruption, create jobs for millions of new entrants to the labor economy every year, stand up a new generation of digital-first behemoths, all the while balancing the needs of an incredibly diverse and cacophonous democracy buffeted by global markets and tastes. That’s ultimately a tall order, but if India wants to migrate from a “billionaire raj” to an “entrepreneur raj,” it will have to do all of that — at once.

Talking about borders: Talent-friendly immigration driving tech north of the border

Written by Arman Tabatabai

Yesterday, we talked about the growing difficulty of the H-1B visa application and approval process in the US, and how it threatens America’s long-term entrepreneurial edge. In a prime example of the connection between immigration policy and technology leadership — the FT put out a deep-dive analysis on the rapidly growing Toronto tech and startup scene, with much of the expansion attributable to Canada’s talent-friendly immigration policies.

Canada applies the “give grads a visa with their diploma” approach many have preached for in the US, providing multi-year work visas to foreign students upon graduation. And while the US continues to make the individual application process more difficult, Canada has streamlined its process. Applications for highly-skilled workers, as well as their families, are processed within just a couple weeks.

While there are clearly several intertwined factors behind the growth of Toronto as a tech hub, talent is certainly one of them, with the city having added nearly 100,000 jobs in a five-year period. Toronto offers a case-in-point precedent of how cities can use immigration to gain a technological edge, and why the United States’ misdirected crackdown is undermining its own.

Intel cancels agreement with China chipmaker in fight for next generation chip dominance

Written by Arman Tabatabai

Intel continues to shift its strategy as it tries to improve its position for next-generation chip leadership. At the MWC conference in Barcelona, Intel announced that it was terminating a multi-year partnership with one of China’s premier state-backed mobile chipmakers, Unisoc. As part of the original agreement announced roughly a year ago‚ Intel would share its new 5G modem chips with Unisoc to help Intel increase its lagging market share in China, while providing Unisoc technological know-how needed for it to compete with more-advanced competitor offerings.

Like many breakups, the two sides are saying the decision was mutual and not a result of the political tension between the US and Chinese governments. However, the Nikkei Asian Review reports that insiders say the US’ recent harsh tone with Chinese tech and semiconductor companies definitely played a role in the decision.

As we discussed yesterday, Intel has a lot of catching up to do after years of complacency and will now have to find a different avenue to make up ground in the Chinese market. Unisoc is also certainly feeling the pain of the lost knowledge transfer, as market share can disappear quickly in a highly competitive industry where IP is often the secret sauce. The cancellation of what seemed to be a mutually beneficial deal reinforces the fact that the fight for next-generation semiconductor dominance is just as much political as it is financial, if not more so.

Near Baghouz (Syria) (AFP) - US-backed forces evacuated over 40 truckloads of people from the Islamic State group's last Syria redoubt on Monday, as they sought to clear out civilians before a final push to crush the jihadists.

The Syrian Democratic Forces has slowed down its offensive on the final pocket due to the presence of civilians, with just a scrap of the IS ""caliphate"" remaining from a territory that once spanned Syria and Iraq.

An AFP correspondent saw at least 46 trucks crammed with men, women and children approaching an SDF outpost, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of the jihadist bastion.

One vehicle was packed with women clad in black and men who covered their faces. Wounded people were also among the latest evacuees.

Holdout IS fighters and civilians, mostly relatives of jihadists, are trapped inside less than half a square kilometre in the village of Baghouz near the Iraqi border.

The Kurdish-led SDF evacuated nearly 5,000 men, women and children from the jihadist redoubt on Wednesday and Friday, but none over the weekend.

Earlier on Monday, SDF spokesman Mustefa Bali, said thousands remained inside the IS pocket.

""According to what we heard from those who have left, there are nearly 5,000 people still inside,"" Bali told AFP.

At the SDF screening point outside the village, SDF fighters expressed hopes Monday's arrivals would be the last.

""We want it to be over,"" one of them, 29-year-old Mazloum, told AFP.

""Every day we say today is the day but we hope it will all end today and not tomorrow,"" he said.

- 'Potent threat' -

Kurdish foreign affairs official Abdel Karim Omar said the SDF would announce the end of the IS proto-state ""in the next few days"".

""But this does not mean that we have eliminated terrorism, which must be eradicated at the roots,"" he said.

Beyond Baghouz, IS still has thousands of fighters and sleeper cells across several countries.

In Syria, it retains a presence in the vast Badia desert, and the jihadists have claimed deadly attacks in SDF-held territory.

Iraq's President Barham Saleh warned Monday the jihadist threat remains high, despite gains made against IS over the past year.

""We've seen in the past that the mission is yet to be accomplished,"" Saleh said in a Paris speech, evoking the infamous 2003 Iraq claim by former US president George W. Bush.

""You have many, many extremists in many pockets in Syria, causing a potent threat to Syria, Iraq and the Western world,"" he said.

- Secret transfers -

Thousands of suspected IS fighters have attempted to blend in with civilians fleeing the crumbling ""caliphate"".

According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, around 46,000 people, including thousands of jihadists, have streamed out of the Baghouz pocket since early December.

The SDF screens those exiting at an outpost outside the village to weed out potential IS fighters.

After being vetted, women, children, and men not suspected of belonging to the extremist group are transported north to the Kurdish-run camp of Al-Hol, while suspected jihadists are sent to SDF-held detention centres.

""The international community is not currently taking responsibility towards the large number of people leaving the last IS pocket, especially children,"" said Omar, describing Al-Hol as overwhelmed by the arrivals.

At least 78 people, mostly children, have died on the way to the camp or shortly after arriving in recent weeks, according to the International Rescue Committee.

The Observatory on Monday said 1,400 people, mainly IS relatives, were secretly transported from orchards on the outskirts of Baghouz to neighbouring Iraq during the past 24 hours.

Kurdish foreign affairs official did not confirm the transfer, but denied the SDF was responsible.

""In principle, we do not hand over any person passing through our territories to Iraqi authorities or any other party,"" Omar said.

Such transfers can only happen if they were trucked from Baghouz ""by another party"", he explained, without specifying.

Baghdad on Sunday said the SDF have transferred 280 Iraqi nationals accused of fighting alongside IS to Iraqi authorities.

The Iraqi president said Monday his country's courts would prosecute 13 suspected French jihadists, who were turned over to Iraq after being captured by the SDF.",Syria force carries out major evacuation from last IS holdout,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/syria-force-carries-major-evacuation-last-holdout-162952545.html

Sen. Bernie Sanders, a longtime independent, has pledged to govern as a Democrat if elected president in 2020, a move that comes after the Democratic National Committee required all the party’s candidates to “run and serve as a member of the Democratic Party.”

The DNC last year passed the rule, which angered a number of Sanders’ 2016 advisers when it was first proposed. The Sanders campaign confirmed to POLITICO that the Vermont senator signed the pledge, which The Washington Post first reported.

Story Continued Below

Sanders, who ran for president as a Democrat in 2016, held his first rally for his 2020 bid on Saturday in Chicago, where he talked about racial tensions and drew a large crowd.

However, Sanders has also filed paperwork to run for reelection to the Senate in 2024 as an independent.

When the new DNC rule first moved forward, one senior adviser from Sanders’ 2016 campaign criticized the action, saying that he found it a “stunning resolution.”

“I really don’t get the motivation for the resolution at all,” Mark Longabaugh told POLITICO at the time. “You know, Bernie Sanders got 13 million votes in 2016. Thousands, if not millions, of those votes were young people and independents he brought into the Democratic Party.

Too white. That was a correct criticism. That is going to change. We will have a much more diverse campaign,” Sanders said on the syndicated “Breakfast Club” radio show Monday. Sanders also vowed to focus more on preventing incidents of sexual harassment among his campaign staff, like those that occurred during his last bid for the Democratic presidential nomination and for which he recently apologized.

ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Bernie Sanders took his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign to Chicago on Sunday, where he spoke at the city's famed Navy Pier. He plans trips over the next few weeks to Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada and California, states with early contests in the nomination battle.

“I don’t deny” that such problems plagued his 2016 campaign “and I’m embarrassed by that,” he said. “That ain’t gonna happen again. We have instituted the strongest protocol to protect women or anybody against sexual harassment.” Representatives with Sanders’ campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the details of the procedures. Sanders previously told CBS News his new presidential bid will provide training for every employee working for him and give anyone who believes they have been victimized or mistreated the opportunity to speak with people outside of the campaign.

We have instituted the strongest protocol to protect women or anybody against sexual harassment.

Several days before announcing his White House run last week, Sanders met with a group that included senior aides, former campaign staffers and women who alleged sexual harassment while working for his campaign and who discussed their past experiences, CNN reported. “He heard many powerful stories and I think he understood that these are not just one-offs and I got the sense that there was a real desire from him to not see a repeat of this ever again,” a former campaign staffer who asked not to be named told the news network. Sanders has not been implicated in any of the allegations and has said he was unaware of the abuse within a campaign apparatus that he said rapidly grew from a handful of employees to roughly 1,200 workers in a short time.

Mrs Clinton's interview was the first time she definitively rebutted speculation that she might take on Mr Trump again in 2020.

She said she had spoken to some of the declared 2020 Democratic candidates. ""I've told every one of them, don't take anything for granted,"" she said.

Mrs Clinton was the first female presidential nominee for a major US party in the nation's history. Her ascension to the top office was widely seen as all but guaranteed, but she was dogged by accusations of being overly reliant on wealthy donors, too close to Wall Street and out of touch with younger voters.

She was relentlessly pilloried by Mr Trump, who goaded crowds on the campaign trail to chant ""Lock her up"".

Her defeat prompted a period of soul-searching for the Democratic Party, which is now gearing up for a wide-open primary contest that has already seen more than 10 contenders announce a run.

Reacting to Mrs Clinton's decision to stay out of the race, Mr Trump tweeted to say sarcastically that she would ""be sorely missed"".

Mrs Clinton responded by tweeting a clip from the 2004 teen comedy Mean Girls in which a character asks: ""Why are you so obsessed with me?""

Democratic trailblazer shuts the door

The late Senator Ted Kennedy, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination in 1980, used to quip that he didn't think about running for president anymore … but he didn't think about it any less.

Hillary Clinton came ever-so-close to the prize in 2016 and clearly still harbours White House dreams. The reality, however, is a failed nominee hasn't made a second run since Richard Nixon in the 1960s.

Every month or so for the past two years there's been a spate of ""she might run"" speculation - some fuelled by her former staff, some perhaps the product of conservatives looking to rile up their base. There still isn't anyone on the Democratic side who provokes the right quite like the former first lady.

Despite this speculation, Mrs Clinton never took decisive steps toward another campaign - and now she has publicly closed the door.

She'll have to be satisfied with going down in history as the first woman to win a major party's presidential nomination. And while she never did break that final glass ceiling, with six woman Democrats already in the 2020 race, she might also be viewed as a trailblazer, who paved the way for others to follow.

Who is running in 2020?

Vermont senator and 2016 Democrat primary runner-up Bernie Sanders is the latest to throw his hat in the ring for the Democrats. Mr Sanders' name recognition and base of support among the party's left has catapulted him towards the front of the pack.

He joins Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who was the first big name to declare a run, as well as New Jersey Senator Cory Booker and California Senator Kamala Harris.

Also in the running are New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand; Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar; the Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Julian Castro; and the Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg, who is the first openly gay person to run for president.

Some of the most talked-about names are yet to declare their intentions. The former Vice-President, Joe Biden, is considering a run. He enjoys the best name recognition in the country, and some analysts say he would be an early front-runner if he were to enter the race.

Beto O'Rourke, a former congressman from Texas who drew national attention when he ran an unexpectedly close Senate race against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz, has kept fans and potential donors waiting as he weighs his options.

Mr O'Rourke ran an unconventional campaign for the Senate, posting unvarnished social media updates as he drove through all 254 counties in the state, fuelled by millions in small-dollar donations.

In 2018, he asked Sanders to administer the oath of office for his second term and repeatedly gushed about him, and even attended a gathering of the Sanders Institute last November in Burlington, Vermont. His response to Sanders announcing his second run last week: scrambling a trip of his own to Sioux City and Des Moines.

Read: The equalizer—Bill de Blasio vs. inequality

De Blasio could have been prepping to introduce Sanders as a favorite son in Brooklyn on Saturday for what will be the kickoff rally of the second campaign, not far from where the senator grew up and near the neighborhood the mayor used to represent on the city council. The senator’s campaign probably would have been open to that and to the buzz it would have produced about the strength of his 2020 campaign. Or he could be looking to horse-trade his endorsement with one of the many other candidates seeking to prove their own progressive credentials, and build up his power that way.

Instead, de Blasio ducked behind the doorway, just out of sight, until he could make his entrance in the union hall where those 40 people had come to see him on Sunday afternoon. He’d spent the morning doing a photo-op meeting with Tom Vilsack, the former governor and part-time Democratic gatekeeper and elder statesman, and another with Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie, who later pointed out that New York City is bigger than 41 states and that the mayor comes with an “everyday perspective” of how government affects people’s lives.

He waited for his big introduction, piping up “I’m ready!” at one point, and then walked in from the back of the room.

“It’s a very personal reality,” de Blasio explained to reporters about his decision to come to Iowa on Saturday. He didn’t have a timetable for deciding whether he would run, he added on Sunday. He has to talk to his family.

He urged the people who came to the event hosted by the Asian & Latino PAC to invest in wind power (there are turbines all over the state), told them to stop talking about Donald Trump (most Democrats running haven’t been mentioning the president much at all), and recommended that Democrats reach out to farmers (other Democratic presidential hopefuls have been doing events at farms).

It was a New Yorker’s view of what’s happening in Iowa and the rest of the country, and his insistent sense that he knows what to do about it from the people he’s talking to more than a thousand miles away.

He drew the biggest applause when he said Democrats need to get smarter about being bolder, for the sake of their politics and their values. Tax the rich, he said. Don’t let Republicans make Democrats out as the party of the elites.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari won a second term to lead the most populous country in Africa, the country's elections authority said Wednesday, while his main opponent promised to challenge the result in court.

Buhari defeated Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president and businessman, by about 4 million votes.

Turnout was nearly 35 percent of Nigeria's 82 million registered voters, the electoral commission said.

""I thank the millions of Nigerians who voted to re-elect me as your president for the next four years,"" Buhari said in a statement. ""I am deeply humbled and profoundly grateful to you for judging me worthy of continuing to serve you and for your peaceful conduct.""

Just hours before it was set to begin on Feb. 16, the electoral authority delayed the vote by a week, citing logistical challenges. Turnout likely fell after many Nigerians took lengthy bus rides across the country to vote in their hometowns, but could not afford to return the following weekend.

On Wednesday, Abubakar called the election result a ""sham"" and said he would challenge it in court. He accused soldiers in some Nigerian states of turning ""their guns on the very citizens they were meant to protect."" He also said it was a ""statistical impossibility"" that there was higher voter turnout in areas ""ravaged by the war"" against terrorist groups, like Boko Haram, and there were voting disruptions in his party's strongholds.

Abubakar's party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP), called for fresh elections in four states.

""I think it's very unlikely that the election may be repeated, but it depends on the courts,"" political analyst and editor-in-chief Mannir Dan-Ali of Nigeria's Daily Trust newspaper told NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton. ""But it's sometimes long drawn, it can take quite a while before the whole challenge is seen through.""

At least 53 people have died in election-related violence, according to a report by SBM Intelligence and cited by The Associated Press. Buhari said the ""elections were relatively peaceful,"" but that ""troublemakers in a handful of states attempted to disrupt an otherwise orderly process"" and he was ""very sad at the grievous loss of lives.""

In his victory statement, Buhari said his priorities for his next term would be to intensify efforts to bolster Nigeria's security, restructure the economy from its dependence on oil and fight corruption.

With a population of more than 200 million, Nigeria is Africa's most populous country and largest economy, but it remains heavily dependent on oil revenues. ""The country is still emerging from a recession and needs to jump-start the economy,"" Quist-Arcton reports from Abuja.

Buhari, 76, was first elected in 2015 on an anti-corruption platform. He previously ruled the country as a military strongman in the 1980s before re-emerging in politics, saying he embraced democratic values.

Despite Buhari's attention to corruption, Nigeria continued to rank high in perceptions of corruption in the last few years, according tracking group Transparency International's 2018 index. The group said Buhari ""took a number of positive steps in the past three years,"" but ""these efforts have clearly not yielded the desired results. At least, not yet.""

The other pressing issue for Buhari to address is the ongoing violence in the country's northeast connected to the Boko Haram insurgency and conflicts between herders and farmers in central Nigeria. Twenty-nine bodies have been recovered after the latest fighting between herders and farmers on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press, while a group claiming affiliation with Islamic State said it attacked a town on election day.

By Ginger Gibson and James Oliphant

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said this week he was ""very close"" to deciding whether to make a 2020 White House bid and will run only if he thinks he can win the Democratic Party's nomination.

He is not alone in questioning if he is the man for the moment.

The clamor for Biden to join the pack seeking to challenge Republican President Donald Trump has quieted as the Democratic field has grown more crowded and diverse, according to interviews with more than two dozen strategists, activists, party organizers and voters.

Opinion polls show Biden, a former U.S. senator from Delaware who served two terms as former President Barack Obama's vice president, remains popular. But the Democratic Party may no longer need him in order to be competitive against Trump.

""I love Joe Biden. He's a great guy and a great politician,"" said Jerry Shriner, a Democratic National Committee member from Idaho. ""I wish he were the president right now. But I'm not sure I wish he is president in 2021.""

Democrats are in the early stages of an internal debate about how best to challenge Trump in next year's presidential election, weighing factors like electability, ideology and identity.

The strength of the field - expected to include at least six sitting U.S. senators, plus several current or former governors, U.S. House of Representatives members and a former Cabinet secretary - is a factor in Biden's calculations, those close to him say.

He will be more likely to remain on the sidelines if he feels a strong candidate capable of beating Trump is emerging.

But a source close to Biden said: ""If I had to guess, he's probably going to do it.""

Biden associates have held discussions with potential staffers and supporters who could serve political strategy, grassroots organizing and digital campaign roles, according to two sources. One source said those conversations were necessary to quickly ramp up a formal campaign operation should Biden decide to run.

Some party activists say, however, that Biden has not reached out to broad donor networks to gauge the level of monetary support he could expect.

Biden, who mounted failed presidential campaigns in 1998 and 2008, said at an event in Delaware on Tuesday that he did not want a third bid to be ""a fool's errand.""

""What I don’t want to do is take people’s time, effort and commitment without there being a clear shot I could be the nominee,"" he said. ""I think I can.""

'TOO OLD'

Biden chose not to run in 2016 when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was widely considered the heavy favorite for the Democratic nomination. Some political analysts have since speculated he could have won industrial battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that proved crucial to Trump's surprise victory.

Biden's high name recognition among Democratic voters means he likely can afford to wait longer than lesser-known candidates to enter the 2020 race. But even that comes with a risk.

""The longer he waits, the more people are going to start to want to follow some of the new and younger voices they're hearing,"" said Bret Niles, the Democratic Party chairman in Linn County, Iowa.

Biden's age, ideology and record already are drawing scrutiny. If elected, he would be 78 when he was sworn in.

""Joe Biden is too old,"" said Mary Donough, 60, a Democrat from Des Moines, Iowa, who plans to participate in her state's crucial nominating caucus next year and wants a younger candidate to challenge Trump.

""There is just more energy there,"" she said.

Biden's backers will argue his age represents experience, said a former aide who asked to speak on background in order to explain internal talking points.

""Voters look at Donald Trump and they look at what we’re missing, which is someone who understands the institution, someone who is an adult, someone who is seasoned, someone who respects the institutions,"" the former aide said.

If Biden does run, the chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, said on Thursday that Trump and the Republican Party would attack his work as vice president under Obama.

“Go ahead and run,” McDaniel told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Maryland. “Run on your record of stagnant wages, of jobs leaving this country, of manufacturing jobs fleeing United States of America, of bad trade deals, of bad foreign policy.","As Biden weighs 2020 bid, Democrats ask: 'Does he meet the moment?'",Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-weighs-2020-bid-democrats-ask-does-meet-110250067.html

President Donald Trump has accused Democrats in the US House of Representatives of launching a ""fishing expedition in search of a crime"".

He was referring to their inquiry into his alleged obstruction of justice and abuse of power.

On Monday, documents were requested from 81 people and groups, including some of the president's closest allies.

They include some of Mr Trump's aides and campaign staff, family members and business associates.

Mr Trump tweeted his response on Tuesday.

A second tweet published by the president shortly afterwards reads simply: ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!""

The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee oversees the US justice system, including federal law enforcement agencies.

Its Democratic chairman, Jerry Nadler, said in a statement: ""This is a critical time for our nation, and we have a responsibility to investigate these matters and hold hearings for the public to have all the facts.

""Over the last several years, President Trump has evaded accountability for his near-daily attacks on our basic legal, ethical and constitutional rules and norms. Investigating these threats to the rule of law is an obligation of Congress.""

President Trump has previously dismissed Mr Nadler's probe as a ""political hoax"".

In a separate development on Tuesday, New York State insurance regulators announced they were issuing subpoenas to the Trump Organization's longtime insurance broker.

The move by the New York Department of Financial Services comes after Mr Trump's ex-personal lawyer Michael Cohen testified to Congress and alleged that multiple tax and finance crimes were directed by Mr Trump.

And Congressman Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat who sits on the powerful Ways and Means Committee, said his party would formally demand Mr Trump's tax returns this month, report US media.

What is this latest round of investigations about?

Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in January.

More than five House committees are now investigating alleged attempts by Russia to meddle in the 2016 election campaign, the president's tax returns and potential conflicts of interest involving Mr Trump's family.

Those inquiries are in addition to the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is expected to file his report into Russian election interference and associated matters soon.

Mr Nadler's committee has the power to conduct impeachment hearings, which can ultimately lead to a president's removal.

He said it was ""very clear"" that the president had obstructed justice and indulged in other abuses of power but added that it was too early to discuss removing the president from office.

Who received requests?

Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, long-time Trump personal assistant Rhona Graff, ex-White House counsel Don McGahn and current Trump personal lawyer Jay Sekulow are on the list of names released by the House Judiciary Committee.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Both of Mr Trump's sons are on the list of requests

Donald Trump Jr is also on the list. He has previously been forced by members of Congress to answer questions about a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, in which he sat down with a Kremlin-linked lawyer who had offered dirt on Mr Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton.

Others on the list include another of Mr Trump's sons, Eric, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, former aides Steve Bannon and Hope Hicks, and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange have also been sent documents requests by the committee. The organisation, which publishes secret information and news leaks provided by anonymous sources, published emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and released them during the 2016 campaign, causing political embarrassment to Mrs Clinton and her campaign team.

Roger Stone, Mr Trump's confidant, who is currently under investigation by Special Counsel Mueller for allegedly lying to prosecutors about his communications with Wikileaks during the presidential campaign, has also received a request from the committee.

After Mr Stone's arrest in January, he denied that he had played a role as an intermediary between the campaign and Wikileaks.

The documents would be used by the committee to determine which witnesses to call to testify in the coming months, a counsel for the House Judiciary Committee said.

If they do not comply within the next few weeks, subpoenas ordering them to attend will be issued.

'Shotgun approach'

With his announcement, Mr Nadler is taking a scattergun approach to his investigations of the president, the BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher says.

He says the press release announcing the investigations doesn't mention Russia or its alleged election meddling by name.

But the key components of the collusion allegations - the 2016 Trump Tower meeting, the WikiLeaks email dumps, changes to Ukraine policy in the Republican Party platform, and the Trump-Russia business dealings - are all over the document requests.",White House lambasts Trump obstruction and abuse of power probe,BBC News,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47451601
303,Empty,2019-03-05T22:47:32Z,Congress could act as soon as Wednesday on anti-Semitism resolution.,"Congressional Democrats are crafting a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, in an indirect but public rebuke of one of their own, Rep. Ilhan Omar, after the latest in a series of remarks she's made aboutIsrael and its American supporters that have generated a blitz of criticism.

Omar, who was elected alongside Rep. Rashida Tlaib as the first women Muslim members of Congress in U.S. history, continues to speak out against Israel, attracting the scorn of Republicans and Democratic colleagues alike -- and competing resolutions from both parties.

A vote on the Democratic version could occur as early as Wednesday, with the apparent approval of party leaders who have grown tired of Omar's rhetoric and signaled they will allow the resolution to receive a vote.

In February, Omar gained notoriety after she asserted that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group known as AIPAC, was using its influence to pressure Members of Congress to adopt an “allegiance to a foreign country.”



Lawmakers, including her party's leader -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- roundly condemned Omar’s comments as an anti-Semitic trope, and Republicans subsequently deployed a procedural gambit to force the House, including Omar, to vote Feb. 13 to support an amendment condemning anti-Semitism. That effort passed 424-0, with two Republicans voting present and five lawmakers skipping the vote.



The hullabaloo and media attention led to an increased profile for Omar, who just landed a spot on the cover of Rolling Stone alongside Pelosi celebrating the new Democratic majority's diversity.

But now the congresswoman says she’s facing death threats. Perhaps more shocking, the Minnesota Democrat was featured on an Islamophobic poster at the Republican-sponsored WVGOP Day at the West Virginia statehouse tying her to the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.

Unlike before, this time Omar is not apologizing and is pushing back hard, aided by the firepower of other congressional allies like New York Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.



I’m pretty heartbroken that there isn’t more denunciation of this outward and blatant expression of bigotry and Islamophobia by a state party.



IMO those who stood up against anti-Semitism a few weeks ago should also be calling out the Islamophobia here, too. https://t.co/LOealpLAKy — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 3, 2019



Ocasio-Cortez wasn’t alone in condemning the poster. Rep. Nita Lowey, the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, offered her own condemnation of “gross islamophobic stereotypes” – before she added a dig at Omar, tweeting that “Anti-Semitic tropes that accuse Jews of dual loyalty are equally painful and must be roundly condemned.”



Then Lowey, a New York Democrat serving in her 16th term, tweeted this shot at Omar:



Lawmakers must be able to debate w/o prejudice or bigotry. I am saddened that Rep. Omar continues to mischaracterize support for Israel. I urge her to retract this statement and engage in further dialogue with the Jewish community on why these comments are so hurtful. — Nita Lowey (@NitaLowey) March 2, 2019



Omar then continued the public clash, tweeting a long thread that decried any expectation that she should “pledge support to a foreign country in order to serve my country in Congress.”



Our democracy is built on debate, Congresswoman! I should not be expected to have allegiance/pledge support to a foreign country in order to serve my country in Congress or serve on committee. The people of the 5th elected me to serve their interest. I am sure we agree on that! https://t.co/gglAS4FVJW — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) March 3, 2019

Before she was a member of Congress, Omar warned in a 2012 tweet, now deleted, that “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. #Gaza #Palestine #Israel.”



Monday night, another Democratic colleague, Rep. Juan Vargas of California, called on Omar to apologize “for her offensive comments.”



It is disturbing that Rep. Omar continues to perpetuate hurtful anti-Semitic stereotypes that misrepresent our Jewish community. Additionally, questioning support for the U.S.-Israel relationship is unacceptable. (1/2) — Rep. Juan Vargas (@RepJuanVargas) March 4, 2019

Ocasio-Cortez again dove into the fray, launching into another long thread expressing curiosity whether Vargas would “further explain his stance here that it’s unacceptable to even *question* US foreign policy.”



I remember a time when it was “unacceptable” to question the Iraq War.



All of Congress was wrong, including both GOP & Dem Party, and led my generation into a disastrous + wrong war that virtually all would come to regret, except for the one member who stood up: Barbara Lee. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 5, 2019

A draft copy of the four-page Democratic resolution text obtained by ABC News does not name Omar, but summarizes the history of anti-Semitism before rejecting anti-Semitism ""as hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States.""



In the meantime, Republicans are enjoying the Democratic distraction, with the president even taking notice in a tweet.



Representative Ilhan Omar is again under fire for her terrible comments concerning Israel. Jewish groups have just sent a petition to Speaker Pelosi asking her to remove Omar from Foreign Relations Committee. A dark day for Israel! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 5, 2019





House Republicans are rallying around their own resolution condemning anti-Semitism, and are urging Democrats to use this bill text if/when they hold a vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism this week.



The GOP’s text specifically names Tlaib and Omar, as well as white supremacists including Richard Spencer and Robert Bowers, who killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue shooting last October in Pittsburgh.



Rep. Lee Zeldin, a Republican who is Jewish, introduced House Resolution 72 to “condemn anti-Israel and anti-Semitic hatred infiltrating U.S. politics, college campuses and the halls of Congress.” He’s claiming more 100 cosponsors including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Republican Whip Steve Scalise, and Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney.

Zeldin is urging House Democratic leaders to bring his measure to the floor for a vote this week instead – citing “the latest anti-Semitic trope of Representative Ilhan Omar.”



“Rep. Omar’s continued peddling of anti-Semitic trope underscores the urgency to take action,” Zeldin, R-New York, wrote in a statement. “I commend my colleagues who have spoken out against her unrelenting, unabashed anti-Semitic attacks. Rep. Omar knows exactly what she is saying and doing and has been hurling these attacks for years. The hatred that regularly pours out of her heart is a cause of the underlying problem with anti-Semitism in the world and absolutely not the answer to it.”

Zeldin also reiterates that he is still calling on Democratic leaders to remove Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.",House to vote to condemn anti-Semitism in indirect rebuke of Rep.

304,Empty,2019-03-07T22:01:46Z,Brown concluded his path to the nomination was too narrow to be viable.,"Sherrod Brown’s decision to forgo a bid for the White House is the first big surprise of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.

The Ohio Democrat was taking all the necessary steps to assemble a competitive bid. Brown had enlisted a savvy veteran of Iowa as a campaign manager-in-waiting, tapped a star adviser to Hillary Clinton’s orbit to lead efforts in New Hampshire, and his plan to play up his working-class cred gave him a fighting chance in Nevada, where the culinary workers’ union reigns supreme. In pitches to activists and donors alike, Brown was preaching his ability to retake the Midwest.

In interviews he sounded every bit the contender, framing himself as a lifelong progressive who could get white, working-class voters to pull the lever for a Democrat. “I don’t have to show my progressive bona fides. I am who I am. But I’m also going to win the industrial Midwest,” he told TIME in January, riding in his Ohio-made Jeep from Cleveland to Lordstown, Ohio, for a January union-hall conversation with soon-to-be-out-of-work automakers. No President since John F. Kennedy has won the White House without carrying Ohio, which Brown did easily last year, the lone Democrat to win statewide. A Brown candidacy, he said, would expand the electorate in ways Clinton failed. Despite his meager early polling numbers, many Democrats saw him as a sleeper threat.

Which is why it was a shock March 7 when Brown announced he saw his seat in the Senate as the best way for him to continue battling on behalf of working people. “The best place for me to make that fight is in the United States Senate,” he said in a statement.

Sen. Brown and his wife Connie Schultz attend a meet and greet at the home of the Black Hawk County Supervisor Chris Schwartz, in Waterloo, IA on Feb. 2, 2019. Devin Yalkin for TIME

Ultimately, Brown concluded his path was too narrow to be viable. Much of the Democratic base has its eyes on the history-shattering candidacies of Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar or Kamala Harris. Others are thrilled by the likes of social-media darlings Cory Booker and Beto O’Rourke. All signs point to former Vice President Joe Biden jumping in the race in short order. The gruff, plain-spoken Brown had a tough path to match would-have-been rivals’ charisma. While he may have offered Democrats their best shot at a Midwest revival that is desperately needed should the party stand a chance at the White House, he was unlikely to survive a crowded primary, one adviser told TIME.

On top of the political questions, Brown had personal concerns. He consistently came back to the toll it could take on his family, especially his wife, the Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist Connie Schultz. As Brown weighed a campaign, a Republican research firm filed a public-records request of her emails at Kent State University, where Schultz teaches journalism. If Brown were to run, it was unlikely Schultz would have been able to continue write her syndicated column.

For her part, Schultz was game for the race if it meant booting Trump. “Our number-one goal must be to defeat Donald Trump. He is such as dangerous man,” Schultz told TIME earlier this year. But she noted a campaign would come with costs. “He really wants to be the best Senator he can be. If you run for President, you’ve got to make some choices.”

In recent weeks, Brown—the 66-year-old son of a Republican doctor and a Democratic activist—had grown increasingly frustrated with reporters asking him to weigh in on topics that weren’t on his agenda. For instance, during one February session with reporters in Washington, the conversation kept coming back to an environmental proposal offered by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “I want to get something done now,” he told a breakfast organized by the Christian Science Monitor. “I don’t need to co-sponsor every bill that others think they need to co-sponsor to show my progressive politics.”

Despite the hints of trepidation, the decision still came as a surprise. Brown had spent the last few weeks visiting early-nominating states, including South Carolina this past weekend. He drew curious crowds for his conversations with voters and caucus-goers about what he described as “the dignity of work,” a line borrowed from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Local party bosses were on hand to offer encouragement and to answer questions about idiosyncrasies of the early states. His financial supporters had a first wave of donations at the ready. All signs pointed to a launch this month. During his preliminary travel, advisers said, Brown heard strong encouragement. But, as his wife liked to remind him, the same people say the same thing when the next candidate comes to town.

Even though he won’t be on the ballot, Brown could still be a major figure in the 2020 race. Ohio’s politics are tricky, and there are few in the Democratic Party who have so successfully navigated its intricacies. Only once since 1974 has Brown lost a race in Ohio. The failure of the blue firewall in Ohio in 2016 was a warning sign more broadly. If Trump was breaking through there, what was happening in places like Michigan’s Genesee and Wayne Counties, or Kenosha County in Wisconsin—areas that saw sharp drop-offs in performance from Barack Obama in 2012 to Hillary Clinton in 2016.

With a finely tuned populist message, Democrats may be able to pierce Trump’s rhetoric there. While Trump claims the economy is roaring, the industrial Midwest could prove his biggest vulnerability. Just a day before Brown bowed out of a race he hadn’t yet joined, General Motors shuttered its final production plant in Ohio, a facility in Lordstown. Just 18 months ago, 5,000 people were working there on 6.2 million square feet of factory floor. Another 75 factories in Ohio supplied parts for the plant.

Brown’s thesis is one that other Democrats are studying. It’s why, when they ran into each other last weekend in South Carolina, Booker made a point of listening to his Senate colleague’s pitch. It’s one Brown has been making for months, including a day TIME tagged along with him during an Ohio blizzard. “National Democrats really see elections as you choose between the progressive base and working-class voters,” Brown said, with the low hum of the Beatles playing in the background. “You don’t win Ohio, you don’t win the Heartland, you don’t win the Electoral College by making the choice. You win by talking to both groups.”

Yet for all his convictions about how to win the presidency, he couldn’t bring himself to try. From his first run for the Ohio Legislature as a fresh-faced Yale graduate, Brown has made little effort to conceal his disdain for the frivolity of politics. Even as he weighed a campaign, he downplayed the suggestions he run.

“If you’re a sentient human being and you’re fairly high ranked in office, House or Senate. and you don’t drool when you speak, someone will come up and say, ‘You should be President,’” Brown told TIME in January. “I’ve heard that all my life. … But I never really thought, ‘I want to run for President.’”

Ultimately, he decided he did not. At least not under these conditions.

In the GOP-majority Senate, three Republicans already back the measure, just …","(Bloomberg) -- Senate Republicans must now decide whether to stop President Donald Trump from using an emergency declaration to pay for his border wall, and support from just four GOP members might be enough to send him a measure blocking his plan.

But Trump has promised to issue his first veto if a resolution of disapproval reaches his desk, and Congress appears far short of the votes for an override.

The Democratic-controlled House voted 245-182 Tuesday for a resolution designed to stop Trump from taking billions from other parts of the federal budget to build his promised wall. In the GOP-majority Senate, three Republicans already back the measure, just one short of the number needed to adopt it if the 47 Democratic caucus members stick together. Neither chamber is close to the two-thirds majority needed for an override.

By law, the Senate will have 18 calendar days to consider the House measure, H.J.Res. 46, or act on its own version.

The issues underpinning the emergency declaration likely will feature prominently in the 2020 elections -- with Trump asserting Democrats don’t want to secure the U.S. border with Mexico, and Democrats saying the president is wasting money on an ineffective and purely symbolic tool to keep undocumented immigrants out of the U.S.

The resolution also highlights a power struggle between Congress and the White House over how much control the legislative branch should cede to the executive branch.

Diverting Funds

Republicans leaders defended Trump’s emergency declaration to redirect Defense Department funds without congressional approval as necessary to defend the southern border. House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California called the resolution a “purely political statement.”

“Not only does the president have the legal authority to declare this national emergency under two federal statutes, the move is far from unprecedented,” McCarthy said in a statement, noting 31 national emergencies that are still in effect.

Presidents have issued almost 60 declarations since the National Emergencies Act was enacted by Congress in 1976. The law requires Congress to review the declaration as a check on executive power, and Senate adoption of the House resolution would be the first time Congress has voted to end an emergency declaration.

There has been bipartisan unease with Trump’s move to shift money outside of the normal congressional process to fund a border wall he promised supporters during the 2016 campaign.

Setting Precedent

Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky was one of 13 House Republicans who joined Democrats in backing the resolution.

He said he supports Trump and agrees with the need for a border barrier, but supported the resolution “in order to be consistent in preserving the constitutional structure of our republic.” Massie and other Republicans have warned about the precedent set by Trump’s declaration, which future presidents could use to redirect government funds to their preferred policy goals.

“There is a crisis at our border, but it’s not an emergency when Congress doesn’t spend money how the President wants,” Massie said on Twitter. “The President’s constitutional remedy is to veto spending bills that aren’t suitable to him, yet he has chosen to sign many bills that did not fund the wall.”

Trump signed the first spending bill of his presidency last year, even though he complained that Republican majorities in both chambers didn’t appropriate enough for the wall. He then surprised GOP leaders in December by rejecting a Republican spending bill that included $1.3 billion for a border barrier, which caused the 35-day lapse in government funding that forced some federal agencies -- including the Department of Homeland Security -- to close.

That impasse was resolved when Trump agreed to sign a bipartisan spending bill that provided the $1.4 billion for physical barriers on the border, including 55 miles of new construction. At the same time, he signed an emergency declaration to shift $3.5 billion from military construction accounts to the border wall.

Trump is also attempting to tap $600 million from the Treasury asset forfeiture fund, and $2.5 billion from a Defense Department anti-drug program -- moves that don’t rely on the emergency order.",Republican Senators’ Choice: Back or Oppose Trump on Border Emergency,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/house-votes-block-trump-apos-233428611.html

The post The Working Families Party Helped Democrats Regain Power in New York. Now Democrats Are Trying to Kill …","Democrats and progressive groups across the state of New York are pushing back hard against an effort to ban fusion voting, a system that allows multiple parties to nominate the same candidate. The assault, according to those on the receiving end, is being driven by Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s ongoing hostility toward the Working Families Party, which has been a primary beneficiary of fusion voting in the state.

A majority of Democrats in the state Senate, the entire New York congressional delegation, and a large swath of grassroots groups have all weighed in against the move, which would gut the Working Families Party and handicap the Democratic Party along the way.

“Banning fusion is both substantively misguided and costly for Democrats,” wrote the state’s congressional delegation in an open letter in February, signed by everyone from Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “It could threaten to put marginal members, who won by just thousands of votes, in jeopardy, and also make it harder to gain more seats in 2020. Without fusion, it leaves the WFP ballot line open to be hijacked by opportunistic spoilers and damages Democratic prospects.”

The dynamics of the fight have implications for the future direction of the national Democratic Party, as well. At its core, the debate is about whether centrist Democrats are willing to be partners in a coalition with progressives if and when the progressives are the ones driving the agenda — as is increasingly the case in New York. Should an Elizabeth Warren or a Bernie Sanders become the party’s presidential nominee, Democrats like Cuomo would be forced into a difficult decision: Support the Democratic Party and back the left, which means upsetting the status quo; or support the status quo, which means keeping Republicans in power.

Cuomo’s approach to the rising progressive energy in New York suggests that, at least for him, the decision is an easy one: Attack the left. The New York State Democratic Committee, which is effectively controlled by Cuomo, voted to ban fusion voting at its convention on Monday. Backers of the ban have said they will push to include it in the state’s must-pass budget, an attempt to force the hand of Democrats who oppose it.

The governor has not personally endorsed this particular effort at a ban, but opponents say his fingerprints are all over it. The loudest advocate of the ban is state party chair Jay Jacobs, who Cuomo appointed to the position in January. Cuomo’s office did not respond to a request for comment, but his spokesperson Rich Azzopardi has responded to the outcry with a tweet that appeared to distance Cuomo from the move.

“Everyone knows that the person who would benefit the most is in the executive chamber.”

State Sen. Jessica Ramos, who unseated a Cuomo-backed Democrat in a primary last year, said there’s no confusion about Cuomo’s role. “I am fairly certain that those who have been threatened by this movement — and are interested in protecting the status quo and the establishment — are behind this. Everyone knows that the person who would benefit the most is in the executive chamber,” Ramos told The Intercept. Ramos, along with a majority of the Democrats in the state Senate, have signed a letter demanding that the ban not be included in the budget, which must be passed by April 1.

The motion to ban fusion voting originated from the state party’s progressive caucus, whose leaders say that while Cuomo may be pleased with what they’re doing, they’re not doing it on his behalf. Rachel Lavine, chair of the caucus, said that upwards of 20 county party chairs approached the caucus, asking for help banning fusion voting. “It’s incredibly onerous for local chairs and activists,” she said. “I’m not gonna say that Cuomo won’t be happy by it, but we’re not people who are Cuomo’s lackeys.”

“The goal is not to kill the WFP,” Lavine added. “They can do what they do in the 46 other states that don’t have it: Run on your own line. If you wanna be a Democrat, run as a Democrat.”

Elisa Sumner, vice chair of the progressive caucus, said she resents the suggestion that she’s doing Cuomo’s bidding; she has been fighting against fusion since 2009, partly because of the way it forces the major parties to cater to the minor ones. “We have to grovel to get their [ballot] lines,” she said.

Under fusion voting, which only exists in New York and a handful of other states, a candidate may appear on more than one ballot line, and votes for that candidate are fused together when tallied on Election Day. The system allows more than two parties to thrive, while lessening the risk that third-party spoiler candidates will take down a would-be ally.

That’s especially important while the party is being remade from the bottom up, Ramos said. “Everyone knows that the Democratic Party is going through an evolution,” she said. “Many of us are trying to bring the party into a more progressive and less neoliberal place and the only way we can do that, especially during this transition period, is to ensure that we have a ballot line where people feel comfortable casting a protest vote that still supports the real Democrats in races.”

The fractures between New York’s Democratic Party bosses and the WFP-backed progressives became exceedingly clear last year, when Cuomo faced a primary challenge from the left and a number of conservative Democrats he supported were voted out of office.

Cynthia Nixon, Cuomo’s primary challenger, was endorsed by the WFP. The governor spent $30 million to beat her in the Democratic primary, after which she withdrew her name from the WFP line. That’s a typical move from WFP-backed candidates who, if they lose their primaries, take their names off the ballot so as not to draw votes away from the Democratic nominee and risk throwing the race to a Republican.

Cuomo’s answer to the WFP has been to attempt to destroy it.

The WFP also targeted Cuomo allies in the legislature, backing a swath of candidates, including Ramos, who challenged members of what had been known as the Independent Democratic Conference. The IDC was a Cuomo-backed caucus of state Senate Democrats who aligned themselves in Albany with Republicans. The convoluted arrangement helped Republicans control the chamber, which had the dual effect of blocking the progressive agenda while increasing Cuomo’s power, as he became an essential dealmaker. “You knew that your only hope was to convince the governor to take pity on you and actually want to work on your issue and figure out how to get it through the Republicans. That was the main reason he created the IDC, was to create that [power] center for himself,” said Ramos, speaking from her experiences as an activist in Albany prior to the IDC’s dissolution.

Under pressure from progressive activists, the IDC disbanded in 2018, but the electorate wanted more. Six of the eight members were ousted by WFP-backed candidates last year, reshaping statewide politics and uncorking a wave of progressive legislation in Albany, including a sweeping expansion of reproductive freedom and the state’s version of the DREAM Act.

Cuomo’s answer to the WFP has been to attempt to destroy it. During last year’s primary season, he forced major unions to leave the WFP. He then poached the party’s original electoral star, Letitia James. A longtime activist, James was the first New York politician elected outright on the WFP ticket when she won a city council race in 2003. Last year, Cuomo offered to endorse her for attorney general and raise money for her campaign — but only if she refused the WFP’s endorsement. James took the deal and is now the attorney general.

But the WFP, on the back of its IDC takedown, is still thriving. Its candidate for public advocate, Jumaane Williams, won a landslide election to the second-highest position in New York City last week. In January, state lawmakers passed the DREAM Act, legislation that, among other things, makes scholarships available to undocumented college students.

Ironically, Sen. Diane Savino, a former IDC member and one of only two who were re-elected, claimed last year that the WFP was scapegoating the IDC and unfairly blaming it for standing in the way of the state’s DREAM Act. After winning her primary last year, Savino pledged to end fusion voting when she returned to Albany.",The Working Families Party Helped Democrats Regain Power in New York.

“I don’t think any of them have,” the California Democrat told the magazine.

She had it wrong, though: The committee’s nine Democratic members took a combined $198,000 from fossil fuel industry political action committees connected to oil, gas, mining and utilities in the 2018 midterm elections, as HuffPost previously reported. The bulk of that sum, $117,000, went to Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), making up 6 percent of all his contributions, according to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics.

The committee, created after the Democratic Party won a majority in the House of Representatives last year, aims to promote policies to combat climate change. No Republicans have opted to serve on it. Activists believe members should refuse fossil fuel money as a sign of their independence from the industry that has attempted to stall climate action while contributing greatly to the problem.

“This is about [finding] people who care very much about the issue and know very much about the issue,” Pelosi said of the panel.

Some committee members have made efforts to distance themselves from fossil fuel companies. Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) signed a pledge promising not to take money from those or any corporate PACs, with others planning to follow suit. Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) divested up to $100,000 worth of shares of a mutual fund with fossil fuel utility holdings in January after a watchdog group called her out.

“We’re thinking big on this,” Pelosi said. “We’re not holding [it against] somebody if she got a utility contribution within her lifetime.”

She added: “I mean, my daughter is really on everybody’s case about taking contributions, so I know the program. But I just want the best possible people.”

According to Castor, the committee will work “in the spirit of the Green New Deal,” progressive Democrats’ proposal to move to 100 percent renewable energy over a decade with a jobs guarantee.

The defense spending figure, set at 1.19 trillion yuan ($177.49 billion), is closely watched worldwide for clues to China’s strategic intentions as it develops new military capabilities, including stealth fighters, aircraft carriers and anti-satellite missiles.

The 2019 defense spending increase comes as China’s economic growth target for the year was set at 6.0 to 6.5 percent.

“We will implement the military strategy for the new era, strengthen military training under combat conditions, and firmly protect China’s sovereignty, security and development interests,” Premier Li Keqiang told parliament.

“We will further implement the military-civilian integration strategy, and speed up efforts to make innovations in defense-related science and technology,” he added.

China’s military build-up has unnerved its neighbors, particularly because of its increasing assertiveness in territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas and over Taiwan, a self-ruled territory Beijing claims as its own.

A government spokesman on Monday said China would keep up a “reasonable and appropriate” increase in defense spending to satisfy its national security and military reforms.

On its website, the official People’s Liberation Army Daily said in a report on the defense budget that the armed forces would “focus on supporting national defense and military reform and comprehensively promoting national defense and military modernization”.

Beijing does not provide a breakdown of its defense budget, leading neighbors and other military powers to complain that its lack of transparency has added to regional tensions.

“China has increased defense spending at a high rate for some time and Japan would like to see a high level of transparency in regard to its defense policy and militarization,” the Japanese government’s spokesman Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Tuesday.

“We will continue to monitor the situation closely and at the same time will look to engage further with China in security dialogue in order to seek clarification.”

Last year, defense spending was set to increase 8.1 percent, compared to a 7 percent rise in 2017, and 7.6 percent in 2016. The five years before that had seen double-digit increases.

‘SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE’

China’s defense spending ranks as the world’s second largest, lagging behind the United States. By comparison, U.S. President Donald Trump has backed plans to request $750 billion from Congress for U.S. defense spending in 2019.

But diplomats and military experts say China’s defense numbers probably underestimate true military spending for the People’s Liberation Army, the world’s largest armed forces, which are in the midst of an impressive modernization program overseen by President Xi Jinping.

China says it is committed to peaceful development, and regularly denounces those it says seek to hype up the “China threat” theory.

“China does not export revolution, hunger or poverty and does not interfere in other countries internal affairs. So where does this threat thing come from?” official news portal China Military Online wrote in a commentary on Tuesday.

Sam Roggeveen, visiting fellow at the Strategic and Defense Studies Center at Australian National University, said the budget figure marked a “substantial increase” in the size of China’s military.

“China has long maintained its military is for the defense of its borders but that definition has broadened over the years,” Roggeveen said. “The West will be very interested to see what the funds are used for, particularly if it used on assets that can project force over great distances.”

China’s military has been particularly focused on democratic Taiwan recently and is nervous President Tsai Ing-wen wants to move the island towards a formal declaration of independence, a red line for China, which views Taiwan as its territory.

Li said China will “resolutely oppose and deter any separatist schemes or activities seeking Taiwan independence, and resolutely protect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.

Tsai, who has repeatedly warned of the threat from Beijing, says she wants to maintain the status quo with China but will defend the island’s security and democracy.

“China repeatedly claims that they won’t give up annexing Taiwan by force, so we are always being very cautious,” Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang told parliament on Tuesday when asked by a lawmaker about the Chinese military threat.

I put a simple question to him: “Would you like to be president?” He dodges it over and over by talking about how much he wants to do his job as governor well. Finally he says, Well, Joe Biden is running anyway. A lot of people think Biden is going to run, I acknowledge, and the former vice president certainly seems to be moving in that direction. But Biden looked like he was about to run in 2015 too, only to end speculation at the last minute. So: What if he doesn’t? “Call me back,” Cuomo says, and puts his hand out immediately to shake, ending a conversation that lasted through a bathroom break and a theatrical phone call with his daughter, in which he begged her not to try cooking him dinner because she’d make too much of a mess of the pots.

Read: Andrew Cuomo sealed his victory with one last power move A Cuomo interview is a manic chess game. It’s hard not to feel his hand trying to guide every move, constantly recalculating and recalibrating, and going off the record to embellish a point or ingratiate himself. It’s also hard not to feel his actual hand: Sort of for emphasis and sort of for dominance, he’ll grab a foot or knee, quickly lean forward with his big body, and stare until he’s not the one who breaks. He never wants to be the one who breaks. Cuomo doesn’t do much reflecting on himself, especially in public. But in two long interviews in person, and over the phone, on the record and off, we spent well over five hours talking about why he thinks so many Democrats hate him, the psychodrama that gets read into every mention of his father, and what he thinks Nancy Pelosi and others in Washington have to learn from him. At one point, he even started drafting on the fly what he’d want in his own eulogy. Cuomo can be irritating, confounding, and egotistical. He can also be engaging, intense, and charismatic. He deliberately stands apart from the leftward tilt of his party, but his record of bills signed into law on many core progressive issues is unmatched by any other Democrat, in D.C. or the states, with the possible exception of Jerry Brown. He wins in landslides, but most politicians in New York and beyond can’t stand him.

Read: ‘Wop’ doesn’t mean what Andrew Cuomo thinks it means He doesn’t fit easily into the Democratic Party and has, at least for now, taken himself out of the two-year-long battle over its identity. Is there a place in national politics for a man who has spent a career lighting bridges on fire and obsessing over power plays in Albany that don’t matter at all outside New York? Is there a place for a person who gets tagged as a moderate? Who doesn’t get into the presidential mix himself? And yet: As Democrats are desperate to show they can bring more results than promises, he is a three-term governor of one of the biggest, most complicated states, with a long list of accomplishments. As Democrats worry that the party’s 2020 nominee won’t be able to take on Donald Trump, he is another brash Queens guy, and just as eager to throw around his machismo and bravado. He’s waiting on Biden. Other than that, Cuomo clearly thinks he has a stronger case to make than any of the people running right now. But not so strong that he’s ready to actually make it. Now in his third term, Cuomo is the longest currently serving governor in America. He handily defeated Cynthia Nixon, a leftist, lesbian television actress, last fall. Cuomo won more votes, as he and his staff eagerly point out and then point out again, than anyone else in the history of New York. He will note that anyone else in this case includes both Franklin D. Roosevelt and Mario Cuomo, his father and role model and constant reference point.

Thanks to his father, who in December 1991 famously had a plane on the runway ready to go to New Hampshire to file his presidential run, then announced that he couldn’t do it because the state Senate Republicans were fighting him over the budget, Cuomo gets tagged as a new Hamlet on the Hudson, this time with the ghost of Mario on the parapets. Read: Is the 'Cynthia Effect' real? Mario Cuomo, of course, was the great liberal hero who gave the amazing Democratic National Convention keynote in 1984 taking on Ronald Reagan and his vision for America. Reagan talked about America as a “city on a hill,” Cuomo said, but “not everyone is sharing in this city’s splendor and glory.” The Democrats, led by their nominee, Walter Mondale, and heading for their greatest electoral loss ever, were for a brief moment reminded, and inspired, by what they stood for. Andrew Cuomo has a long draft of an op-ed that he started writing last summer, laying out a case for what the Democratic Party should and can be, but that he has so far held off from publishing anywhere. The differences between the Cuomos are huge: Mario would blow up in a rage, while Andrew tends to bide his time for revenge; Mario was more of a book guy, while Andrew is more of a car guy. Andrew ran his father’s campaigns as his political bruiser; Mario wrote policy memos for his son’s campaigns and taped cards from supporters to them with long notes explaining why he should call them. Then, as if out of a novel, Mario died on the night of Andrew’s second inauguration four years ago, hours after listening to the swearing-in over the phone. Andrew barely gives a speech without mentioning his father; in his inaugural address in January, he said, “I took him from his bed that afternoon, and we put him to rest. I loved him so, so, so much.”

Read: The New York Democrat Who Progressive Activists Are Targeting Next Speaking to me a few weeks after the speech, Cuomo said he’s always amused to see what gets read into their relationship. For many, he says, it’s a Rorschach test of “how they relate to their own fathers and what they think about that.” There was, and is, no competition, he says. “He was my best friend. He was my best ally. My best colleague. Brilliant. Principled,” he says. When Mario would show up at his son’s campaign events, Andrew remembers telling the crowd, “You know, my father believes that nobody looks at the first name on the ballot when they walk into the booth. So they think they just voted for Cuomo. He thinks they were voting for him. So he really believes he won.” The crowd would laugh, Andrew says. “And it was a vindication of him. That’s a very sweet thing that a son can also do for a father.” Mario Cuomo was the one who came up with “Campaign in poetry, govern in prose” line. Andrew Cuomo campaigns in Robert Browning monologues and governs in wannabe John le Carré. A few hours before our first interview in January, two days after New Year’s, Cuomo did his brash, I-get-things-done routine in announcing a big new plan to stop what would have been a two-year shutdown of the L train, which connects parts of Brooklyn that don’t have any other subway access to Lower Manhattan. It had been running through tunnels that have been crumbling since they flooded with seawater when Hurricane Sandy hit in 2012.

People had been flipping out about the impending shutdown for years. Thousands had moved to new neighborhoods to avoid it. Stores were going out of business. Then Cuomo entered the picture with a flourish, first with a surprise December tour of the tunnels that for some reason he did in the middle of the night, and then with this rollout in early January, at which he was joined at his Manhattan office by a panel of experts who’d spent the holidays working up plans. They explained how they would keep the L train running by coating the crumbling tunnel walls with a polymer, rather than rebuilding them, and doing it at night, with relatively minimal disruption. No shutdown. You’d think people would be happy. That’s not how New York works. The reporters arrived confident in their own instant high-level engineering expertise. Why hadn’t the administration thought of this before? They’d had years to find a solution, they’d done studies, and all of a sudden Cuomo was riding in at the last minute to save the day? Well, Cuomo said, he’d decided to give it one last shot, and lucky for him, the experts he’d tapped had a series of technological epiphanies. Okay, the reporters said, but how could they trust that the untested technology would work? It wasn’t untested, Cuomo said. It was just new to America—they’d mashed together solutions from Europe and Asia and come up with a plan. Okay, but if it hadn’t been done in America before, how were American workers going to do it? Well, Cuomo said, they’d be trained. But what about this material they were going to coat the tunnel walls with—how could anyone trust that it would hold? “It’s not glue that you’re caulking your bathroom with. It’s a fiberglass polymer,” Cuomo ribbed back.

The press conference was a 90-minute absurdist parody. When it was over, the academic experts that Cuomo had convened rode down in the elevator together, trying to make sense of what they’d just lived through. The subways in New York have become a well-known joke in the past few years. Trains run late and stop in tunnels, holding for what seems like no reason at all. (Naturally, a delay of my own almost made me late to this very press conference.) Fares keep going up. Every improvement project is behind schedule. During the primary, when Cynthia Nixon made the failing subways a centerpiece of her campaign—she also got stuck in a few kismet delays, including when she was on the way to her own kickoff rally last spring—Cuomo responded by saying he didn’t control the MTA and couldn’t be blamed for what was going wrong. Yet here he was, when he could be the hero in solving a problem with the MTA, taking the credit for what was going right. He decided to fix the problem, he convened the experts, he announced the solution. And because it felt like such a sudden, deus ex machina fix, many started to suspect that it wouldn’t actually happen, or that maybe, years from now, probably long after Cuomo was gone, the not-fully-tested solution would collapse and people would die. Meanwhile, the reporters, angry at the latest abuse of Cuomo’s staff—leaking the news to The New York Times—loaded their coverage with doubts and unanswered questions. A response that had begun with Pat Kiernan, the best-known NY1 news anchor, nearly dancing in the street by an L stop had by the evening completely soured.

This is what happens. Even when there is good news, Cuomo’s scheming breeds suspicion from reporters, activists, and other politicians. And in the end, this mistrust often poisons whatever victories he has. What comes up most in talking about Cuomo is how people hate him. Especially liberals. So much. In their bones, and in their souls, and in their Twitter feeds. Why? Everything, they say: He’s a sellout. A moderate. Maybe even a closet Republican. He maneuvered to support that breakaway group of Democrats in the state Senate so that he wouldn’t get boxed in to a more liberal agenda that he didn’t want (which Cuomo denied in words while acting in ways that helped them directly and indirectly). He is in a constant grudge match with his old staffer and current New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio that makes both come off like toddlers poking each other in the back seat of a car. (“Do you feel like it’s gotten too petty at points?” I ask Cuomo, to which he responds, “I don’t believe I have gotten too petty.”) He set off rage locally and nationally for putting out a flyer in his reelection campaign that not so subtly accused Cynthia Nixon of being an anti-Semite—and then refused to take responsibility for it. Progressives also took offense at the way he threw himself at landing the Amazon headquarters, even joking once that he’d be ready to change his name to Amazon Cuomo to seal the deal for bringing 25,000 jobs to a new headquarters in Queens. When the company pulled out on February 14 because of continuing resistance from left-leaning local politicians, despite the deal’s popularity with the public, Cuomo responded by lashing out at the “small group [of] politicians [who] put their own narrow political interests above their community,” adding, “They should be held accountable for this lost economic opportunity.” As recently as this week, Cuomo was working behind the scenes to lure Amazon back to Queens, reaching out directly to Jeff Bezos, the company’s founder, The New York Times reported.

Starting with gay marriage, Cuomo’s string of big progressive accomplishments have all left a trail of enemies in the Democratic Party. Democrats had been talking about passing a gay-marriage bill for years. But they couldn’t muster the votes when they last controlled both houses of the legislature, in 2009–10. When Cuomo first took office as governor, in 2011, the state Senate had flipped Republican, thanks in part to the breakaway caucus of moderate Democrats who threw their lot in with the GOP. The so-called Independent Democratic Conference wasn’t voted out of power until the midterms last fall, finally returning Senate control to the Democrats. The newly elected Cuomo gathered allies and advocates shortly after assuming office and told them he was going to take control of the process. The horse-trading and arm-twisting began—starting with Danny O’Donnell, an openly gay Democratic assemblyman from Manhattan who’d been the lead sponsor of the bill for a decade. Cuomo wanted O’Donnell to give over the management of the bill to his team. O’Donnell resisted and told Cuomo’s team members they didn’t know what they were doing. Read: Why New York Democrats Have Turned Against Andrew Cuomo Now Cuomo was invested, and he needed the win. One morning, the assemblyman remembers getting a phone call from the governor’s then chief of staff. Here’s the way it’s going to work, O’Donnell says he was told. Either he could give up and let Cuomo pass the bill, or he could make things difficult. If he made things difficult, he should think about the consequences. At some point soon, Cuomo’s chief of staff said, he himself wouldn’t be in government anymore, and he’d be making a lot of money in the private sector, but he’d wake up every day thinking of how to make O’Donnell’s life miserable.

“You’ll never work again,” O’Donnell remembers being told. “I’ll make it my mission in life to destroy you.” O’Donnell gave in. A few months later, the bill passed, with four Republicans voting for it in the Senate. At the time, New York was the biggest state, and one of the first, to legalize gay marriage. It got done. O’Donnell stood behind Cuomo at the bill signing. But he says he still hasn’t forgiven him for what happened. “It’s only about getting him credit,” O’Donnell tells me. “He only cares about credit.” O’Donnell married his husband in 2012. He didn’t endorse Cuomo for reelection in 2014 or 2018. But the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group, endorsed Cuomo both times—and featured him as a speaker at the group’s annual New York gala this month. Almost every legislator in Albany is furious with Cuomo about something. Most are furious with him about many things and can rattle off a list of clashes and slights and screaming matches. For Democrats, those have all come together into the mega-outrage of turning around on eight years of deals with Republicans to promote his Justice Agenda, which Cuomo unveiled in December. Its components range from legalizing marijuana to a middle-class tax cut to a state-level Green New Deal. Unveiling it in December, Cuomo made himself out as the modern-day Franklin Roosevelt, explicitly. “While our ship of state is sailing well, the ocean in which it is sailing is tempest-tossed,” he said, trying for poetry at the beginning of his remarks during an event announcing his plans, in a room that had been packed with leading supporters to clap for him. “There are no more excuses, my friend,” he said, in a very Cuomo flourish. “Now is the time to lead.”

Nixon responded, from her post-primary political retirement, by taking credit on Twitter for everything he’d proposed, arguing that her losing campaign was “worth it” for moving him to the left. Democrats laughed at the governor who’d spent the previous eight years triangulating for suddenly turning himself into the man storming the gates. “These are bills the Assembly has already done and our members have long fought for,” Mike Whyland, the communications director for Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, tweeted in frustration on New Year’s Day, as Cuomo boasted in his inaugural address about his ideas on what to do next. People in Albany will yell at Cuomo behind closed doors, but Heastie himself later declined to comment. “The governor is the Tom Brady of New York politics,” Cuomo’s chief of staff, Melissa DeRosa, insists. “People will complain, people will privately backbite, but at the end of the day, they know that he’s able to put the ball in the end zone. That’s the disconnect.” Cuomo says he sees that discord as the world of advocates being too caught up in their own agendas to care about the people they represent. “The ‘professional left’ to me is the greatest scam in history. What does it mean, ‘professional left’? Basically, a sham set of groups that are fronts for labor unions,” Cuomo says. “They were all with Cynthia Nixon, the professional left.” He drew a distinction between the professional left and regular liberal Democratic voters, with whom he says he has a 70 percent approval rating—and with whose votes he “blew out the standard-bearer of the professional left.”

Or, as DeRosa summarized it in our conversation: “What 2018 proved is just how irrelevant they are. If you’re trying to shoot the bear, you’d better kill the bear. All they did was prove their impotence by going up as hard as they did and coming up short.” The people Cuomo counts as the professional left have an even worse opinion of him, and his record is irrelevant to them. He’s raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour in New York City. In-state college tuition is now free, which he announced at an event with Bernie Sanders. Twelve-week paid family leave is the law across the state. New York has some of the strongest gun laws in the country, which Cuomo rammed through in the weeks after the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, while Barack Obama was still naming the members of the special commission he ordered, which made the big move of … ordering up more mental-health studies. And then, of course, there was the bill legalizing gay marriage back in 2011, when that was an out-on-a-limb achievement. Joe Biden didn’t accidentally disclose the Obama administration’s support for same-sex marriage until 2012. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington congresswoman and co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, dismisses Cuomo as “a politician’s politician. He is not a movement politician; he’s not the person who comes up with the bold ideas first and does the work to push it forward.” Most of Cuomo’s progressive accomplishments, such as gay marriage, are what big donors want anyway, she says. When I pointed to issues such as raising the minimum wage or offering free public college, Jayapal said, “You can be a politician’s politician and tough to move on an issue until you see a public out there that’s clamoring. You still deserve credit for getting it done, but where were you when an issue was not popular?”

Representative Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, the other co-chair, started giggling when I asked him whether he considered Cuomo a progressive. What about his progressive accomplishments? I asked him. “New York’s such an interesting state,” he said, ducking the questions. “I don’t know enough about him.” But he knew about progressives saying they hate Cuomo, he said. I asked him whether he knew anything about what’s behind that hatred. “Not really,” Pocan said. Over the course of a few weeks, I tried to get Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, a grassroots political movement aimed at electing progressives, to talk about Cuomo. Levin had laid into the governor on Twitter several times during last year’s primary race, in which Indivisible had endorsed Nixon. Eventually Levin passed the request on to the communications director, who provided by email a quote to be attributed to María Urbina, the group’s national political director. “In national progressive circles, it’s well known that he propped the state senate group known as the IDC up for many years prior to his reelection,” the statement read, referring to the group of breakaway moderate Democrats who voted with Republicans and kept the chamber in the GOP’s hands for the past eight years. “He will have to contend with that record just like anyone else if he wants to win the trust of Democratic voters and progressive grassroots activists.” She didn’t follow up when asked about the laws he passed.

Other progressive Democrats see him, less flatteringly, as a model for how a throwback Democrat who still idolizes Bill Clinton gets dragged into what the party is becoming. But when all the rage against Cuomo was put to the test last year, he got 66 percent of the vote in a primary in one of the bluest states in the nation, in which he was running as a moderate older white man from a political dynasty against Cynthia Nixon in a year dominated by anti-establishment and female politics. Even in one of the bluest states in the country, the number of primary voters interested in the kind of aggressive progressive politics that have come to dominate the conversation among Democrats nationally proved to be less than 35 percent. In the same congressional district that elected Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a giant-toppling primary in June, Cuomo beat Nixon by 38 points in September. He made sure to remind me of that too. He makes sure to remind a lot of people about that. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, who worked with Cuomo when he was in the state assembly, understands his method and continues to be an ally: “There will be a hard-left crowd that is never satisfied, but when you look at the things that he has accomplished with respect to gun safety, a $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, criminal-justice reform, and marriage equality, he has made a tremendous difference in the lives of millions of New Yorkers.”

Jeffries was elected the fourth-highest-ranking Democrat in the House in December, and many people see him as a future speaker. In the meantime, Jeffries says that Cuomo “can serve as a model for executive leadership that Democrats can look to once we seize the White House in 2020.” Cuomo insists he’s deferred to Biden for 2020, though it’s obvious to some who’ve talked to him that White House dreams still lurk in his head, and that a part of him would like to be running the country and putting his stamp, his way, on the Democratic Party and beyond. He believes the way to win is the same way he’s won in New York: by being a walking, talking embodiment of the modern political cliché that Twitter isn’t real life. When he looks at the Democrats who are already in the race, he makes a point of noting how many of them he knows, even as he makes clear that he doesn’t think any of them measure up. “I know how to do what everybody’s talking about doing. They’re all talking about how to fly an airplane. None of them have flown. And that’s a big difference when you get in the seat and you buckle the seat belt. And we just had a guy who spoke about flying a plane. And never flew. It’s not as easy as it looks. I know how to do affordable housing. I know how to bring jobs to the middle class. I know how to build infrastructure,” he told me, in one of his typical brush-offs of Trump. Cuomo has had two White House meetings with Trump, who he doesn’t believe can govern much at all. The first came in late November. Cuomo had asked for the meeting to discuss federal funding for a big tunnel from New Jersey to Manhattan. Trump, he says, was all about the border wall, with constant digressions.

“Experience matters, because in a private life, you regulate what you subject yourself to. You’re feeling under siege, you’re feeling insecure, you take it easy. You stay home. In this business, you can’t step out of the batter’s box,” Cuomo says. “He is personally and emotionally motivated. He is without long-term strategy and tactics, and he’s scared.” Scared of what? I ask. “All these investigations. All these people, what do they know?” Cuomo says. Trump “led the life he led, played life the way he played it. Now the closest people to him are talking. That’s frightening. I think it has him clinging tighter to his base. Uh, which is not enough to win.” I ask him to assess Trump’s reelection chances. “He’s lost a lot [of supporters] who have lost faith in him. Once you lose faith in the person, the message loses credibility,” Cuomo says. “It was a vision, and he came in credible. He was apparently a billionaire—who knows what he really is. He was a businessman, outsider, successful, articulate. And a fresh face. He had all that going for him. Now he is mercurial. Obnoxious. Alienating.” Democrats, Cuomo says, still don’t get it: Voters across America don’t want bold policy proposals; they want money in their pockets and worries off their plates. They don’t trust government, and they don’t trust the Democrats as the party of government, because they’ve heard years of high-minded promises and they’re still struggling. They want to know what they’re getting for their anxiety and their anger beyond more words about ideas that will never go anywhere or, if they do, will only benefit others.

“The Republicans do it negatively. ‘They did nothing for you. Absolutely nothing. Everything is for somebody else—you got nothing,’” he says, explaining his sense of the GOP line. “All right. If you believe in the positive, then you ought to fill that void with the positive. No, the Democratic Party hasn’t done enough. If I pushed you, you would say, ‘Well, Obama’s affordable health care.’ Yes. A positive. I did the best health exchange in the country; we affected about 2 million people. Positive. Not enough to fill the void, but a positive. Uh, but not enough. Are we doing enough in this state? Still not enough.” Four million people got raises when he signed off on the minimum-wage increase—and those are 4 million voters, Cuomo points out. Everyone got paid family leave. Everyone who was worried about saving enough money to send kids to college saw tuition disappear at state schools. Thousands of people have jobs because of all his building projects, and hundreds of thousands more see those projects under way and can see government at work. When Election Day rolled around, Cuomo says, they voted based on that, not on the chatter. Clearly, in the context of the 2020 presidential race, Cuomo wants his fellow Democrats to give him credit for what he thinks is cracking the code to political effectiveness. He wants to be called a progressive. And he wants it to be seen as his choice not to run for president—not that he’s been scared out of the race by any of the people who are running or any of the issues about his past and the feelings he inspires. The word he kept using for himself was model, as in, he is the model for Democratic success.

Biden and Cuomo talk often. The two share an assessment of what voters actually want, and it’s part of what’s convincing the former vice president that—against most normal calculations that would take him out of the race for president—there is a pathway for him right down the ignored center of the Democratic Party and the country. “He knows what he’s talking about, he’s experienced, he is relatable, he knows how to get things done, he wants to get things done, he’s not blowing smoke, he’s not a blue-sky puffer,” Cuomo says, explaining his support for the former vice president. “He’s not, ‘Health care for all, Social Security for all! Everything for all!’” Our first interview, back in early January, was on the day Nancy Pelosi officially took the gavel to become House speaker again. If Pelosi wants to keep the majority, Cuomo believes, she’ll need to protect the people in swing districts more than the ones who’ve been the most vocal about moving the party to the left. What she’s going through reminds him of how he says he’s trying to keep Democrats from overreaching in Albany, as they did the last time they had full control, back in 2009. They lost the state Senate in 2010, after a sprint of dysfunction, corruption, and city-minded fiscal moves. Cuomo said in his inauguration speech that he feels “liberated” now that the Democrats got the state Senate back in November. Since the primaries, leaders in the legislature and their allies among advocates have been bubbling about boxing Cuomo in to embrace their agenda. But he’s moved quickly to co-opt control and says that he’s the real progressive—the one who’s been getting it done all along.

Take the minimum wage, he says. He signed a bill raising it to $15 an hour in New York City and a lower rate for upstate, among other compromises, which he says were the only way he could get Republicans to support any of the changes. “They wouldn’t give it to me. Everything was half a loaf. Three-quarters of a loaf. Four-fifths of a loaf,” he says. “But it was never everything I wanted. Half a loaf is better than nothing. But that’s what I’ve been living with.” I tell Cuomo that there are people who are just as convinced that he’s a bad person, that he’s scheming all the time, playing people off each other, hogging the spotlight for his own tactical gains. What’s bottled up bursts out. “Look, I’ve done focus groups out the wazoo. ‘How could he do business with the Republicans?’ Seven years I stood next to them and praised them,” Cuomo says. “If you’re a purist Democrat, you can’t rationalize that I worked with Republicans.” I ask Cuomo, if he sees himself as the model for the country, how progressive he is prepared to go. “Single payer. Okay. Pass it. I’ll sign it. You pass it, I’ll sign it,” Cuomo says. But … would he want to sign it? “No, but no sane person will pass it,” he says. So he’s daring the legislature to pass it? “Oh no. If they pass it, I’ll sign it,” he says. Even though he thinks it’ll blow up the state budget? “Yeah, well, you’d double everybody’s taxes. You want to do that? Let’s go,” he says. “They can never pass it. But I have no problem with the dare. Every union is against it. The hospitals are against it. The Civil Service Employees Association is against it. The 1199 health-care union is against it. That is the only issue. Marijuana, I’m there. Voting rights, I’m there. Contraceptive Care Act? I’m there first. Anything else you can name, I’m there.”

His thinking on health care will undoubtedly affect his role as policy chair for the Democratic Governors Association, though no one is quite clear what that entails. He puts out statements about bills and court decisions when he can find a connection to New York. And he’s trying to turn into a cause the provision in Trump’s tax law that limits the federal deduction for state and local taxes to $10,000, effectively a backdoor tax increase for many in high-tax states such as New York. He went back to the White House in February to meet with Trump on this, though this time their meeting was just a discussion over sodas. He came out insisting that House Democrats “should not do anything of any significance” until the president restores the deduction, and last week he got the governors of New Jersey, Illinois, Connecticut, and Oregon to join him at a press conference at which he declared that Trump had started “an economic civil war between Republican states and Democratic states.” He followed it up on Monday with a big event in New York, where he had Nancy Pelosi join him at the table as he signed a new gun law, which creates a provision for judges and others to stop sales to anyone deemed an immediate risk. Cuomo spent years saying he was so uninterested in national politics that he wouldn’t even leave the state on vacation. Then came the primary last year, and he started piping up against Trump every chance he got. Now he’s looking for a way to stay involved.","Andrew Cuomo’s Case for 2020—No, Really",Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/03/andrew-cuomo-thinks-hes-best-democrat-beat-trump/583642/

Washington (AFP) - President Donald Trump branded Democratic opponents ""crazy"" and guilty of overreach Tuesday in a fevered response to a huge new probe of his alleged crimes.

In a burst of early morning tweets, the president said the House Judiciary Committee investigation launched Monday was ""the greatest overreach in the history of our Country.""

""The real crime is what the Dems are doing, and have done!"" he said.

Another tweet labelled Democratic leaders ""stone cold CRAZY.""

""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"" said another.

Trump's exclamation mark -- and capital letter -- laden outbursts indicated a rising temperature in a White House under assault from multiple directions.

Democrats, who took control of the House of Representatives last November, suspect Trump of a slew of potentially impeachable offenses, including obstruction of justice and abuse of office.

The powerful judiciary committee is demanding information from 81 Trump-connected individuals and entities, including his sons.

The new front opened just as Trump braces for the results of an independent probe into his dealings with Russia by special prosecutor Robert Mueller.

Rumors that Mueller is close to ending his two-year investigation have set Washington on edge.

Debate over whether the prosecutor's findings should be made immediately public is already underway, with Democrats warning that attempts at a cover-up by the White House could lead them to subpoena Mueller to testify.

- Republicans waver -

Trump's response to the pressure has been consistent with his longtime playbook: to insult accusers, admit no weakness, and rely on backing from his ultra-loyal political base.

Polls show that the president's support among Republican voters remains strong, even if Democratic voters are just as convinced in opposition.

However, cracks in Republican support at the top echelons of the party have appeared.

When the Democratic majority in the House voted to overturn Trump's controversial use of emergency powers to force funding for US-Mexico border wall construction, that was expected.

However, four Republican senators have broken ranks this week to join their Democratic opponents in the upper house, meaning the motion can pass there too.

Trump will likely be able to brush aside that rebuke by using the first veto of his presidency. However, the fact that he has lost the guaranteed backing of his party in the Senate could point to trouble ahead.

- 2020 election link -

In Trump's combative vision of politics, the looming probes are not all bad news.

The White House is already framing the Democratic onslaught as symptomatic of leftist radicalism supposedly threatening the country.

Trump has made the specter of far-left socialism a growing part of his 2020 reelection campaign, even claiming that Democrats want to replicate the violent chaos underway in Venezuela.

""Democrats are harassing the president to distract from their radical agenda of making America a socialist country, killing babies after they're born, and pushing a 'green new deal' that would destroy jobs and bankrupt America,"" Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said late Monday.

On Tuesday, Trump told reporters that Democratic probes were pure politicking.

""Basically they've started the campaign,"" he said, adding that voters would see through this. ""The people understand it. When they've looked at it they just say 'presidential harassment.'""

Trump's other main angle of attack has been to dismiss the validity of the Mueller probe, which he has repeatedly dubbed a ""witch hunt"" and ""phony"" in hopes of reducing its credibility.

He called it a ""hoax"" again on Tuesday.

But in an indication that the president's rhetorical bombshells risk misfiring, former Trump White House lawyer Ty Cobb went public Tuesday with a surprising defense of Mueller, calling him an ""American hero.""

""I don't feel the investigation is a witch hunt,"" Cobb told ABC News podcast ""The Investigation.""

A poll by Quinnipiac University found that 64 percent of Americans believe that Trump committed crimes before winning the presidency, although there was an even split over whether they thought any were committed afterward.

Fifty-nine percent of Americans do not back the opening of impeachment proceedings, though 58 percent do support congressional probes into allegations of wrongdoing, the poll found.",Trump lashes out at 'crazy' opponents as pressure mounts,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-lashes-crazy-opponents-pressure-mounts-163002780.html

Michael George Haddad for BuzzFeed News

NASHUA, New Hampshire — When a group of voters leaving an event for Sen. Elizabeth Warren piled into an elevator, buttoning up coats and putting on gloves, the conversation immediately turned to a familiar topic. “They’re all good — all of the Democrats,” one woman said. “The question is, who’s going to be able to go up against Trump? Take all his bullshit and throw it back to at him.” “Honestly,” a stranger agreed. “That’s all I care about.” “They have to be as ruthless as he is,” a third woman said.



But the first woman disagreed. “Not even ruthless — just smart. That’s all I want.” They laughed. As the elevator door opened, one added: “Let’s just beat the bastard.” In past presidential elections, Democrats sought out candidates who shared their values and priorities. But this time, in the shadow of President Donald Trump, polls show many Democratic voters are prioritizing one thing: electability. In some circles, the word “electable” has become a proxy for moderate — a political centrist whose policies appeal to swing voters in states Trump won in 2016. Sen. Amy Klobuchar has electability, some say, because she won reelection by broad margins in Minnesota, a state where Trump barely lost in 2016. Allies of Joe Biden, with his history of bipartisanship and working-class centrism, claim electability is his strongest case for the Democratic nomination.

Who might not have it? Mostly candidates in the most progressive wing of the party: Elizabeth Warren might have an “electability problem.” So, some have worried, might Bernie Sanders. But the vast majority of Democratic voters aren’t thinking about electability in terms of ideology, geography, or electoral margin, according to interviews with more than 50 Democratic voters in early primary states. Far from tying electability to centrism or moderation, voters said they cared about rhetoric, personality, energy, and momentum when deciding if a candidate could win. Many others said they were looking primarily for someone who spoke specifically to the concerns of working-class people. Some wanted a fighter who could parry Trump’s rhetoric. Just two said they were looking for a political moderate. Their answers illustrate a conundrum for Democratic candidates in 2020. What is seemingly a broad voter consensus — that Democratic voters are searching for electability — is, in reality, a much more varied desire. What voters are actually saying also undercuts a narrative about the choices Democrats will make in the 2020 primaries. While polls have forced Democrats to reckon with choices between candidates who agree with them on issues and those who might beat Trump, voters overwhelmingly said they saw little conflict between the issues they cared about, like Medicare for All and income inequality, and a candidate’s electability. Jonathan Lamb, a meteorologist in West Ashley, South Carolina, attended an event for Sen. Kamala Harris in February to “get a feel for whether she’s electable — though I don’t know how you quantify that.” “I put a lot of weight into how they speak,” he said. He was passionate about lots of “political hot potatoes,” like gun control and reproductive rights, but in the end, his decision would come down to one thing: “I’m just trying to imagine this person debating Donald Trump, and how they would hold up.” Anita Wilkie of Plymouth, New Hampshire, said her priority was to find a candidate who could beat Trump in 2020; she had been making the rounds to candidates’ early events, looking for someone who she thought would be electable. “That’s it, that’s exactly it,” she said at an event for Sen. Elizabeth Warren in February. “I was telling my sister this morning, ‘I know each candidate is not going to agree with what I want; it can’t happen that way. It’s the electability.’”

“It’s gotta touch me, not just in my heart, but in my gut.”

But what “electability” would look like, Wilkie couldn’t quite say. “It’s gotta touch me,” she said. “It’s gotta touch me, not just in my heart, but in my gut. I go by my gut feeling.” On the eve of the 2018 midterms, the center-left think tank Third Way, which has opposed many far-left policies, posed a question for Democrats and independents in battleground districts across the country. To win future elections, would they want to see the Democratic Party “move to the left to generate enthusiasm” or “appeal to a broad range of voters, including people who may have voted for Donald Trump in 2016”? Seventy percent of respondents said they wanted the party to seek broad appeal instead of move to the left; the think tank touted it as evidence of support for their politics. Voters in New Hampshire and South Carolina often spoke of “broad appeal” too — something many said was the most important thing for a candidate to have in order to beat Trump. But they didn’t see appeal as Third Way envisioned it — as a choice between policy directions.

Ethan Miller / Getty Images Sen. Kamala Harris at a town hall meeting at Canyon Springs High School on March 1 in North Las Vegas, Nevada.

Many voters looking to find a candidate with “broad appeal” said they were looking at the way candidates spoke — hoping to find someone who “phrased things in a mainstream way,” as one voter said, or who “emphasized the working people.” Others said they were looking at who appealed widely by speaking to the concerns of racial minorities; one said that to him, “broad appeal” meant speaking better to white women. Electability was “absolutely” important to Kathy, a university employee who attended an event for Warren at Plymouth State University in New Hampshire. “They have to be able to speak to everyone’s concerns, not just a narrow segment,” she said. That ability wasn’t rooted in whether someone was progressive or moderate, Kathy said. “In the age of Trump, the way you talk about things is really important. Even more than what you say, it’s how you say it.” Some pollsters have set up Democrats for a conflict between prioritizing the issues they care about and doing whatever they can to beat Trump. Monmouth, in February, asked whether Democrats would prefer “a Democrat you agree with on most issues but would have a hard time beating Donald Trump” to one who they did not agree with but could more easily defeat Trump. Most picked the Democrat who would beat Trump more easily. But in interviews, most Democratic voters rejected the idea that the two choices were at odds. Progressives, especially, said they thought that being on the far left edge of issues would be a boost against Trump, rather than a hindrance. Some said they thought progressive policies themselves were the missing piece to a candidate who had “broad appeal.”

The president first donated to Ms Harris in 2011 as she was running for attorney general. That donation amounted to $5,000 (£3,793). He then donated another $1,000 (£758) to her re-election campaign in 2013, Washington newspaper McClatchy reported on Monday.

Ivanka Trump also donated thousands of dollars to the Democratic senator. In 2014 she donated a reported $2,000 (£1,517) to Ms Harris’ re-election efforts.

A spokesperson for the senator’s 2020 presidential campaign confirmed the president’s donations to her previous campaigns in a statement to McClatchy. They noted Ms Harris eventually donated the total sum of Mr Trump’s contributions to a non-profit Central American advocacy group.

Mr Trump’s support for the Democrat came at the same time as he was attacking Barack Obama on a variety of cable news shows and online, claiming he was not actually a US citizen and lacked the necessary qualifications to serve in the White House.

The president and Ms Harris’ political views are in stark contrast and the two have exchanged harsh criticisms since Mr Trump assumed the Oval Office.

In 2018, he claimed Ms Harris was responsible for “supporting the animals of MS-13,” after the Los Angeles-based gang began drawing national attention for a series of violent crimes.

Ms Harris told The Root last week she believed Mr Trump was racist, saying, “I don’t think you can reach any other conclusion.”

Much of the Trump family’s political donations went to Democrats across the country before the president expressed interest in running for the White House.

While the vast majority of his contributions to political campaigns were directed to Democrats throughout his entire career, donations began increasing in 2010 and were instead allotted to Republicans, with the party being the sole recipient of his donations by 2011.

Despite accruing donations from wealthy donors throughout her political career, Ms Harris managed to raise an impressive $1.5m (£1.14m) in donations within the first 24 hours of launching her White House bid against Mr Trump, with the average donation amounting to less than $40, according to her campaign.",Donald and Ivanka Trump donated thousands to Kamala Harris as she rose in California politics,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/donald-ivanka-trump-donated-thousands-190016060.html

In testimony to a House of Commons committee examining the prime minister’s actions, Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney general, recalled asking Mr. Trudeau: “Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the A.G.? I would strongly advise against it.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has cancelled his visit to the Queen City on Tuesday.

Trudeau was scheduled to speak at Canadian Tire in south Regina on climate change incentive rebates, as well as appear at an event at the Conexus Arts Centre. The event has been postponed to a later date, the Liberals said on Tuesday morning.

There were reports on social media that Trudeau’s visit was cancelled after Canadian Tire received complaints about the event. But, a spokeswoman for the company said Trudeau changed his schedule.

His itinerary changed on Tuesday morning and he will now be in private meetings in Ottawa.

Trudeau will also not visit Regina on Wednesday.

There is no word on why his schedule changed.

The cancellation comes after Treasury Board president Jane Philpott resigned from cabinet amidst the SNC-Lavalin scandal on Monday.

A second member of Trudeau’s Cabinet resigned on Monday, saying she had lost confidence in how the government had dealt with allegations that officials inappropriately pressured former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to try to help construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

Treasury Board President Jane Philpott was one of the most respected members of government and political observers described her departure as a major blow.

Trudeau, who came to power in November 2015 promising to do more for women, has now lost two high-profile female ministers and his principal personal secretary in less than a month as the crisis deepens.

A government official said while Trudeau was disappointed by Philpott’s resignation, he would not be changing tack.

“We will not lose sight of the big picture, we will not lose sight of the reasons that people elected us,” said the official, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.

Trudeau told a Liberal rally on Monday night that he took Philpott’s concerns seriously while noting that “we are allowed to have disagreements and debate.”

NERVOUS LIBERAL LEGISLATORS

Some nervous Liberal legislators say Trudeau needs to make changes to his inner circle and complain about a lack of communication from top aides.

But a Liberal with close experience of working with the prime minister said a major shift in tactics was very unlikely.

“He will always double down when under pressure,” said the Liberal. “That’s his way.”

An Ipsos poll for Global News released on Tuesday showed the Conservatives would get 40 percent support from decided voters compared with just 31 percent for Trudeau, more than enough to ensure his defeat.

Penny Collenette, an adjunct professor at the University of Ottawa and former national director of the Liberal Party, said Trudeau needed to quickly give his version of events.

“Governments survive resignations from high-profile cabinet ministers ... it doesn’t have to be fatal at all. But we’re now into the fourth week and every day that goes by without this closing is a day lost for this government in an election year,” she said by phone.

Gerald Butts, who quit last month as Trudeau’s chief aide, is due to testify to the House of Commons justice committee about the allegations on Wednesday.

There are no immediate signs of an attempt to pressure Trudeau to leave, if only because it can take years to force out a Canadian leader who does not want to go.

The heads of political parties are elected by members at formal conventions and cannot be sacked after a snap vote by parliamentarians, as is the case in Britain and Australia.

In statements to domestic media, every one of the 33 remaining Cabinet members - including Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland - issued statements backing Trudeau.

“Removing a leader just a few months before an election would be suicide,” said another Liberal.

Trudeau dismisses opposition calls for a public inquiry, noting that Canada’s independent ethics commissioner is looking into the allegations. The commissioner, though, can take months to wrap up a probe and there is no guarantee the results would be released before the vote in October.",Canada's bruised Trudeau expected to fight political firestorm,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-politics-snc-lavalin-idUSKCN1QM2OG

The crisis has prompted the resignations of former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, the Treasury Board president, Jane Philpott, and Trudeau’s closest political aide, Gerald Butts. It also raised questions about Trudeau’s handling of the affair and polls show his Liberals could lose an election this October.

WHAT ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST TRUDEAU

Trudeau has been dogged by allegations that he and his officials improperly leaned on Wilson-Raybould to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a criminal trial. Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee last week that officials imposed “consistent and sustained pressure” on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

WHAT IS SNC-LAVALIN’S INVOLVEMENT?

Montreal-based construction and engineering firm SNC-Lavalin was charged in 2015 by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada with bribing Libyan officials to influence the awarding of contracts between 2001 and 2011.

The company had tried unsuccessfully to avoid trial, arguing instead for a negotiated settlement since it had cleaned shop by changing executives and overhauling its ethics and compliance systems in recent years. The preliminary hearings in the case are ongoing.

The company has historically had close ties to the Liberals. In 2016, SNC-Lavalin admitted that some former executives had illegally arranged donations of more than C$80,000 to the Liberals from 2004 to 2011.

WHY IS SNC-LAVALIN CRITICAL TO TRUDEAU AND LIBERALS?

SNC-Lavalin has about 9,000 employees in Canada, including about 3,400 in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec, which also includes Trudeau’s parliamentary constituency. The Liberals say they need to pick up enough seats in Quebec in the October election to stand a chance of retaining a majority government.

Officials, citing conversations they said they had with the company, say they feared SNC-Lavalin would cut jobs or move its headquarters out of Quebec if found guilty. The company faces being barred from bidding on Canadian federal procurement contracts for 10 years, if found guilty.

“We will not comment on this matter,” SNC-Lavalin spokesman Nicolas Ryan said on Thursday when asked if the company had warned Trudeau of possible job losses in case of a guilty verdict.

WHY DOES CRISIS THREATEN TRUDEAU’S POLITICAL FUTURE?

Critics accuse Trudeau of double standards and breaking the promises he made to do politics differently. Trudeau, 47, came to power in November 2015 promising more accountability and a greater number of women in the Cabinet. He now finds himself accused of trying to help arrange an old-style backroom deal with a major company as his officials leaned on a high-profile woman Cabinet minister. The departure of Philpott, another well-regarded minister and a close friend of Wilson-Raybould, has dented Trudeau’s credibility.

No one inside the ruling Liberals has mounted an open challenge to Trudeau, since to do so would take time and open up splits inside the party. The heads of political parties in Canada are elected by party members at formal conventions and cannot be ousted after a snap vote by parliamentarians, as is the case in the UK and Australia. Opinion polls show the controversy is costing the Liberals.

A weekly tracking poll released by Nanos Research on Tuesday put the Conservatives at 35 percent public support, with the Liberals at 34 percent. A Jan. 8 poll by the same firm had the Liberals at 39 percent and the Conservatives at 33 percent. Each poll was based on a random phone survey of 1,000 Canadians.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

Political analysts say Trudeau is safe for now, since he has made clear he wants to stay on and there are no challengers inside the party. The federal Parliament is not sitting next week, depriving the opposition of the chance to grill Trudeau, and the week after will see the release of the federal budget.

The two main opposition parties - the right-of-center Conservatives and the left-leaning New Democrats are demanding a public inquiry into the affair. But the Liberals oppose the idea, since probes take months to complete and are likely to trigger negative headlines.

Wilson-Raybould said she did not consider officials had broken any laws, so a probe by police is unlikely. Canada’s independent ethics commissioner is looking into the allegations, but past experience shows such investigations can take months to wrap up and there is no guarantee the results would be released before the vote in October.

After holding a news conference in Ottawa early Thursday to answer questions about the latest testimony about the SNC-Lavalin affair, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau flew off, bound for Iqaluit.

He was to apologize for how past governments mistreated Inuit who went south for tuberculosis care in the middle of the last century, some of whom died and were buried rather than being returned to their families.

Story continues below advertisement

But, an early morning windstorm in Iqaluit quickly turned into a blizzard that by the lunch hour forced his plane to divert to Happy Valley-Goose Bay, N.L.

While Prime Minister’s Office staff in the capital of Nunavut voiced hope initially that Mr. Trudeau could arrive later in the evening, the whiteout conditions and wind chill temperatures of -45 C – winds gusted to nearly 80 kilometres an hour – soon made it evident the event would be postponed until Friday morning at the earliest. Friday, the weather forecast calls for light snow rather than a blizzard.

The apology has been in the works for the better part of two years since Mr. Trudeau signed an Inuit-Crown partnership agreement in 2017.

Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the organization that speaks for Inuit in Nunavut, has said it wants to help family members locate burial sites of those who died during tuberculosis treatment from the 1940s through the 1960s and whose bodies were buried in southern Canada.

A dinner feast that was planned for the event Thursday, which was to include samplings of narwhal and caribou, was also postponed as Iqaluit was virtually shut down.

“Services such as water delivery, waste management, garbage pickup and snow removal are being suspended, and city facilities are being closed to the public, until further notice, due to severe weather conditions,” the city said in a statement posted on social media. Taxis and local residents were also advised to stay off city roads.

Tuberculosis rates among Inuit are still 290 times higher than among Canadian-born non-Indigenous people, according to a 2018 paper from the Public Health Agency of Canada.

China’s Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that it is blocking some imports of Canadian canola due to fears of insect infestation. Richardson International Ltd., one of Canada’s largest grain producers, said Tuesday that the country had revoked its permit to export canola there amid infestation allegations. Canada disputes that claim.

Notley, in a Wednesday statement, came out swinging, noting that Richardson International Ltd. exports 30 per cent of Alberta’s canola.

“Today, we learned that the Chinese government is barring a huge chunk of our canola shipments from entering their country. This is wrong and it’s unfair,” said Notley.

“Seventy per cent of agri-food exports to China from Alberta are canola-related products. And canola farming contributes billions to the Canadian economy.

“So, today, I’m calling on the prime minister to get back on the job and fight for our canola farmers and the jobs they support. We are calling on Ottawa to stop its navel-gazing about its internal controversies and fight back.”

The premier went on to demand Ottawa “be in Canada’s corner.”

“Alberta farmers and Alberta workers stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars and up to 3,000 jobs if this is not resolved,” said Notley.

“We need certainty.”

Federal Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau in a Wednesday statement called the issue a top priority for the Canadian government and said she is in talks with provincial partners.

“Our government understands the importance of the canola industry to the Canadian economy,” said Bibeau. “We are taking a science-based approach to finding a solution.”

Some observers are speculating that the block may be the latest swipe against the Canadian government for arresting a top Chinese tech executive.

“We’ve seen a huge drop-off in canola prices, especially over the past couple of weeks,” said Bruce Burnett, director of weather and markets at Glacier FarmMedia.

He called it a major drop for the commodity, which likely wouldn’t have happened without the backdrop of a deteriorating relationship between China and Canada. The fallout follows the arrest of Chinese tech giant Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on Dec. 1, 2018.

On Dec. 3, the May futures contract, which Burnett noted was not the most actively traded at the time, closed at $496 per tonne. Wednesday afternoon, it was trading at about $456 — a roughly eight per cent drop. It was expected that exports to China would remain strong through most of the crop year, he said, with fairly solid prices.

Canada exported about $3.6 billion worth of canola seed, oil and meal to China in 2017, according to the Canola Council of Canada’s most recent figures.

Now that China has blocked Richardson’s shipments, the question becomes: what will happen to other companies, Burnett said.

It’s possible others could have their permits revoked. But, unlike Winnipeg-based Richardson, other players in Canada tend to be part of large multinational organizations. Regina-based Viterra Inc., for example, is part of Switzerland-based Glencore International.

While it’s hard to read the minds of what the Chinese government is thinking, it’s likely these companies will be very cautious, he said.

“There’s large amounts of money involved here that the companies will be very wary of shipping cargoes that could be rejected or that type of thing.”

Sherwood Park’s Ward Toma, general manager of Alberta Canola Producers Commission, said his group has been working with the Canola Council of Canada, which has been working with federal government officials in contact with the Chinese government.

“Right now we’re just hoping for a fast resolution, there’s been very little info of what is going on and we’re waiting to hear more,” Toma said Wednesday afternoon.

“The longer this drags out, the better the chance that canola prices that farmers get paid will decline. That will impact sales and everyone along the canola chain will be impacted by it.”

Al Mussel, research lead and founder of Agri-Food Economic Systems Inc., said it’s a convenient time for China to decrease the amount of canola it imports because the country is grappling with an outbreak of African Swine Fever, a fatal disease that targets pigs.

That means China doesn’t need as much canola to feed its pig herd, said Mussell, adding that some estimate the country will drop its pork production by up to 20 per cent this year.

CTV News spoke with Philpott at the Ottawa airport on Monday night. She said she spoke with Trudeau about her departure from cabinet on Monday morning.

Reacting to her departure, Trudeau said he knows Philpott had ""felt this way for some time,"" and told supporters gathered at a climate change rally in Toronto that he is taking the ongoing affair that has dominated headlines for nearly a month ""very seriously.""

In a statement posted to her MP website, Philpott said that the recent events, including the SNC-Lavalin scandal, ""have shaken the federal government in recent weeks and after serious reflection, I have concluded that I must resign as a member of cabinet.""

Trudeau has been facing calls to resign after former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould testified at the House Justice Committee last week that she faced high-level ""veiled threats"" and ""sustained"" political interference to try to get her to instruct federal prosecutors to drop the criminal prosecution of the Quebec construction and engineering company that is facing bribery and corruption charges.

In her resignation letter Philpott cites the convention of cabinet solidarity—where ministers must always be prepared to defend other ministers publicly—in saying that it has become ""untenable"" to continue to serve in cabinet.

Trudeau vowed to continue the work Philpott was a part of. ""In a democracy like ours and in a space where we value our diversity so strongly, we're allowed to have disagreements and debate,"" Trudeau said. ""This matter has generated an important discussion: how democratic institutions, specifically the federal ministry and the staff and officials that support it, conduct themselves, is critical and core to all of our principles.""

Trudeau said that while there are still more questions to be answered, there will be more to be said in the ""coming days and weeks.""

He implored the largely cheering crowd, peppered with a handful of hecklers, to be mindful of the ""bigger picture"" that his government was elected on.

Philpott said the evidence of alleged pressure offered by her friend and former fellow minister has ""raised serious concerns"" for her.

""The solemn principles at stake are the independence and integrity of our justice system…. Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised,"" Philpott said in her resignation letter to Trudeau.

In a statement Trudeau's office said that he spoke with Philpott about her decision to resign, and that he ""accepted"" it and thanked her for her service.

Public Services and Procurement and Accessibility Minister Carla Qualtrough is assuming Philpott's portfolio in an acting capacity. It's yet to be seen if this will prompt the third cabinet shuffle in as many months, or whether a sole person will be named to that role. Treasury Board President is a role typically held by a more senior minister.

CTV News reached out to all 33 remaining ministers' offices, and all have responded, confirming that they still have confidence in the prime minister and many also saying that they have no intention of resigning from cabinet.

""I have absolute confidence in our government, and our Prime Minister, and will continue the vital work of advancing reconciliation and self-determination as the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations,"" said Indigenous Crown Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett.

""Canadians elected this government on the promise of a strong economy and a Canada that works for everybody. Under this Prime Minister we have delivered on that promise… Not only do I support the prime minister, I’m proud of him and how he continues to fight for Canadians, for jobs and for equality,"" said Small Business and Export Promotion Minister Mary Ng. She used to work in the PMO as director of appointments.

Scheer calls other ministers to follow

In a press conference, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said that Philpott's resignation ""clearly demonstrates a government in total chaos led by a disgraced prime minister.""

He made a direct call to other Liberal cabinet ministers to think about following suit.

""Is this what you got into politics for?"" Scheer said. ""If not, it’s time for them to stand up and be heard, like Jane Philpott did today.""

Scheer said that the remaining cabinet ministers either need to force Trudeau to stand down or disassociate themselves from the scandal.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said in a tweet that Philpott's resignation ""now more than ever"" compels the need for a public inquiry. He said it raises ""serious questions"" about the alleged interference of Trudeau's government and its commitment to reconciliation.

The New Democrats are calling for Trudeau to testify under oath about the whole scandal.

""Jane Philpott has made her decision based on information she received from cabinet; Canadians deserve to know what happened as well,"" Singh said in the statement.

Philpott's record in cabinet

Philpott was first elected in 2015 to represent Markham-Stouffville in Ontario and has held three different ministerial portfolios.

She was first named as federal health minister and was central to installing a physician-assisted dying regime.

Then, Trudeau created the ministry of Indigenous services and tapped Philpott to head it. There, she was tasked with working to reset the nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous people, chipping away at boil water advisories in First Nations communities and drafting child welfare legislation.

Then in January, when longtime Liberal Scott Brison announced he was leaving cabinet in desire of a new challenge and more family time, she was shuffled in to fill his role at the Treasury Board.

Many considered her to be one of the highest-performing cabinet ministers.

In her statement Philpott says it has been an honour to ""play a leading role"" in several big government initiatives, from working to rebuild the nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous people, to legislating physician-assisted death. She said it ""grieves"" her to leave but she had to act on her principles.

On CTV's Power Play, Liberal MP and parliamentary secretary to Qualtrough, Steven MacKinnon, called Philpott a ""highly-respected minister"" but downplayed this high-profile departure as being symptomatic of a larger problem. He called it a ""disagreement"" over the ""philosophy and the approach"" to the SNC-Lavalin case.

NDP MP and Indigenous affairs critic Charlie Angus said that her resignation was a ""watershed moment"" in the SNC-Lavalin scandal, as well as a ""sad day"" for Canada as ""nobody in government has done more to push reconciliation"" than she had.

Staying on as MP

Like Wilson-Raybould, Philpott intends to continue to keep her role as a Liberal MP. She won her riding in 2015 with 49.2 per cent of the vote.

Trudeau has said he’s still reflecting on whether or not Wilson-Raybould will be welcome in the Liberal caucus based on her testimony, and it’s to be seen whether he’ll offer a similar remark about Philpott.

Prior to her career in politics, Philpott was a family doctor.

After Wilson-Raybould resigned, Philpott tweeted a photo of the two of them, saying that Wilson-Raybould taught her ""so much,"" and that she knows she would ""continue to serve Canadians.""

On Monday Wilson-Raybould posted her own kind words about her friend and colleague, calling her ""incomparable,"" and a ""mother of country.""

""For almost four years our country has witnessed your constant & unassailable commitment to always doing what is right & best for Cdns. You are a leader of vision & strength & I look forward to continuing to work alongside you,"" Wilson-Raybould tweeted.

Reacting to the sudden resignation, fellow Liberal MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes—who announced this weekend that she won’t be running again—tweeted: ""When you add women, please do not expect the status quo. Expect us to make correct decisions, stand for what is right and exit when values are compromised.""

A second Liberal MP, Wayne Long, has spoken out—not the first time for him on this case—to say Philpott’s resignation further bolsters the argument that an independent investigation is needed.

""I am deeply troubled by the fact that Ms. Philpott felt the need to resign as a result of our government’s handling of this matter,"" Long said in a statement. ""I believe that we will not be able to successfully return our focus to this work until they have those answers.""

Strategists, experts weigh in

Lori Williams, political science professor at Mount Royal University in Calgary, said that Philpott’s departure is a ""tremendous loss for the government.""

In an interview on CTV News Channel Williams said that it is ""very difficult to imagine what the government can now do to try to recover.""

""Clearly, conversations have been happening for some time and the concerns that were raised were not being addressed to the satisfaction of former minister Philpott,"" she said.

On CTV's Power Play, Summa Strategies vice president and former Conservative staffer Kate Harrison said that ahead of the previous election, the Liberal Party recruited a number of established professionals who were not partisans, on the promise to do politics in a less partisan way. Harrison said that Philpott’s resignation is the result of not delivering on that promise.

""There is a real danger of other, new recruits being extremely dissatisfied and disaffected by the way this government has run. It is not government-by-cabinet as it was purported to be,"" Harrison said.

He sure got…,"OTTAWA — Feminism has been a key element of the Liberal party’s appeal to voters since the 2015 election campaign but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s handling of the fallout from the SNC-Lavalin affair shows that he’s a hypocrite, opposition parties say.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould resigned from Trudeau’s cabinet in mid-February and has alleged that Trudeau and his staff subjected her to relentless pressure to help Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal prosecution on bribery and fraud charges.

Then, this week, Jane Philpott followed her out. A former health minister and Indigenous-services minister who was president of the federal Treasury Board when she quit the cabinet, Philpott was widely seen as one of Trudeau’s most capable ministers.

I think women across the country are looking at that and understanding it

Both had been symbols of the Liberals’ ability to recruit strong female candidates: Wilson-Raybould is a lawyer and former regional chief of the British Columbia Assembly of First Nations; Philpott is a family doctor with extensive experience abroad. Both were first-time candidates for the Liberals in 2015.

After Wilson-Raybould resigned, Trudeau repeatedly called her “Jody” in defending his actions toward her — a small indignity but one many noticed. Philpott’s resignation letter included a long explanation of the principles of cabinet solidarity and mutual support and how she believed she could no longer sustain them. Asked about her departure, Finance Minister Bill Morneau began by observing that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott are close friends.

Are you kidding me? You pompous mansplainer. The MINISTER said her problem was that she couldn’t tow the cabinet line and did the right thing to resign. But – you know how women are…… we are just so *emotional*. What an ass. https://t.co/FFNwyqgW1U — Lisa Raitt (@lraitt) March 5, 2019

“The attempt by the cabinet to highlight a personal relationship as an explanation as to why the cabinet minister resigned is completely false,” Conservative deputy leader Lisa Raitt said in an interview. “That is not a fair commentary because it has nothing to do with friendship and everything to do with her (Philpott’s) set of values and how she felt about standing there and toeing the cabinet line when she didn’t believe a word that the prime minister was saying.”

The Liberals use their feminist agenda as a talking point but undermine powerful women by referring to them with gendered language and old tropes, Raitt said.

The departures of the two ministers show that women who speak truth to power and have strong principles need not seek cabinet posts, the NDP’s women’s-equality critic Irene Mathyssen agreed on Tuesday.

“I think women across the country are looking at that and understanding it,” she said.

A poll by Ipsos for Global News, which the company released Tuesday, found women responding to the pollsters were more critical of Trudeau’s handling of the affair than men. Female respondents were more likely than male respondents to believe Wilson-Raybould’s account of events than Trudeau’s, more likely to believe that the story isn’t overblown and deserves the attention it is getting, more likely to want a public inquiry or police investigation.

Female cabinet ministers stuck up for the Liberals and Trudeau on Tuesday. Speaking in Longueuil, Que., on Tuesday, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said the prime minister has her confidence, adding she appreciates the prime minister sees her family — she has three children — as an advantage rather than an problem.

“It is a huge privilege for me to serve in this government, to serve as foreign minister for Canada,” she said.

Small Business Minister Mary Ng said in an interview that she does not see the cabinet departures as having an impact on the Liberal government’s feminist agenda.

“I look at the work that we are doing,” she told The Canadian Press. “Of course I’m disappointed that both Jody and Jane have chosen to step down from cabinet but the work that we are doing as a cabinet and as government, particularly for women, is extraordinary.”",Liberals' feminist agenda undermined by their reaction to cabinet resignations: opposition - National Post,Nationalpost.com,https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/wilson-raybould-and-philpott-departures-do-not-affect-feminist-agenda-ng

Lametti was pressed about the issue in an interview with Mercedes Stephenson on The West Block Sunday, as the government faces criticism over allegations of attempted meddling in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Lametti, who was appointed in January after his predecessor Jody Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to veterans affairs, was asked about the reasons a government should interfere in a corruption trial.

“If someone approached you and said an election is at stake, would that be a persuasive argument to you?” Stephenson asked.

WATCH: Lametti not ruling out “legal option” to give SNC-Lavalin a special deal

He said it “depends on the context” and added that he doesn’t know if the contact between Wilson-Raybould and key figures in the Trudeau government on SNC-Lavalin was appropriate or inappropriate because he doesn’t know the details.

When asked how winning an election could be an appropriate reason for an attorney general to intervene in the justice system, Lametti did not directly address the question.

Instead, he provided the example of the U.K. attorney general abandoning an inquiry on a Saudi Arabian arms deal at the behest of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair over national security concerns and how that was later found to be appropriate.

Lametti said “political considerations are appropriate for discussion around the cabinet table and, therefore, with the attorney general” in accordance with the Shawcross principle, which allows for consultation but stresses that decisions rest with the attorney general.

WATCH: MPs on what comes next in the SNC-Lavalin affair

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has denied allegations that he or his staff have acted inappropriately in reference to the possibility of cutting a deal for SNC-Lavalin — and said he does not agree with the version of events presented during Wilson-Raybould’s marathon testimony before the House of Commons justice committee Wednesday.

He has said, however, that the government has a responsibility to look out for jobs and the economy. SNC-Lavalin is a big employer in seat-rich Quebec, and a conviction on fraud and corruption charges would prevent it from competing for lucrative public contracts.

Lametti, a Montreal MP, also didn’t rule out the possibility of a future remediation agreement, a deal that would allow SNC-Lavalin to admit wrongdoing and pay a fine but avoid a ban on bidding for government work. He said it was a legal option but refused to say whether he is considering it.

He said that attorney general decisions can always be changed if new information comes to light.

“You do have an ongoing obligation as attorney general, in terms of your relationship to prosecutions and the prosecution service, to be open to new facts,” he said. “I can’t speak to the actual facts [of the SNC-Lavalin affair] but I know that in principle, an attorney general has to remain open so, in that sense, no decision is ever final.”

Dr. Philpott, as a medical school classmate, I am immensely proud of you today. You thought a great deal about what to do, and acted in a fashion consistent with your principles. This was obvious in your previous two cabinet portfolios, as you managed to get a great deal done in a calm, appropriate fashion that was pretty low key, except for those who were paying attention. In a polarized political world, those with integrity deserve all our respect, even if we disagree with their views on certain positions. This gives a little hope that discussion, compromise and consensus can be reached without breaking appropriate ethical boundaries, even if there is disagreement. Your constituents in Markham-Stouffville must be very proud you today.

Mr. Atoz:

View full co…","China’s Foreign Ministry grabbed a chance to question the state of judicial independence in Canada on Friday, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government faced accusations at home that it had tried to intervene to stop a corruption trial.

Trudeau’s domestic troubles have attracted attention in Chinese state media due to his previous assertion that his government cannot interfere in the case of a senior Huawei executive arrested in Canada and now fighting extradition to the United States.

READ MORE: China wants Canada to overrule courts and release Meng Wanzhou, but it won’t do that, Trudeau says

China has repeatedly called for the release of Meng Wanzhou, the telecommunication giant’s chief financial officer, arrested in Vancouver in December at Washington’s request. In late January the U.S. Justice Department charged Huawei and Meng with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.

At a regular daily news briefing in Beijing, China’s Foreign Ministry took the opportunity to take Canada to task over possible double standards, by commenting on a domestic Canadian political issue that does not otherwise involve China.

Trudeau has disputed allegations by his former justice minister that government officials inappropriately pressured her to help the SNC-Lavalin construction firm avoid a corruption trial.

Asked by a state media journalist if it was contradictory for Trudeau to say he couldn’t interfere in Meng’s case and yet his government be accused of trying to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he “really liked this question.”

“Of course I think that this is a question that should be asked of the Canadian government,” Lu said.

“In fact on this case you have mentioned, people in Canada are paying it a great deal of attention,” he added. “In fact, not only Chinese and Canadian citizens, but the whole world are extremely interested to hear how the Canadian government answers this question.”

The Independent In 20…,"International Women’s Day, which takes place Friday, is usually Justin Trudeau’s time to shine — a day our self-proclaimed feminist prime minister pulls out all the stops to champion gender equality.

In 2016, riding high on the viral validation of his because-it’s-the-current-year shrug with regards to his new gender-balanced cabinet, Trudeau wrote a Globe and Mail op-ed, stating: “Equality is not a threat, it is an opportunity.”

In 2017, he was interviewed by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg about how men need to be partners in the fight for gender equality — a post his team was trying to promote in hopes, perhaps, of eclipsing his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau’s International Women’s Day post, which caught a lot of flak because it was … about her husband.

Last year, Trudeau even accepted an award for his record on feminism — the 2018 Catalyst for Change Award — at a lunch hosted by Equal Voice Canada, an organization that boosts women in Canadian politics.

READ MORE: Liberals’ feminist agenda still intact despite departure of Philpott, Wilson-Raybould — minister

But here we are, on the cusp of International Women’s Day 2019. Which happens to be an election year. Whatever celebratory activity Trudeau has planned will be cast with a pall of controversy, his feminist cred called into question based on his alleged treatment of key women in his formerly gender-balanced cabinet. This pall imperils not only his carefully crafted feminist brand, but also the hard work his government has done to make life better for Canadian women.

WATCH: Wilson-Raybould — I was pressured to ‘help out’ in SNC case

No, Trudeau’s International Women’s Day will instead be overshadowed by the departures of two powerhouse women from his cabinet and, of course, by the appearance of his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, before a justice committee responding to allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office inappropriately pressured then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Wilson-Raybould had stepped down from cabinet before giving her testimony last week — describing in detail, with timestamps and everything, the patronizing way in which the Trudeau government allegedly tried to wear her down.

On Monday, another star minister, Jane Philpott, exited as well, saying in a statement that she could not remain in cabinet because she had “lost confidence” in how this matter was handled. Just a day earlier, outspoken Liberal MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes said she was not going to run for the Liberals again this fall.

READ MORE: ‘I have lost confidence’ — Jane Philpott resigns from cabinet over Trudeau’s handling of SNC-Lavalin affair

It’s a bad look for the Liberals, and it gets worse with every beat of silence and every well-meaning defence of the government. Unhelpfully, Trudeau’s other purportedly feminist high-profile cabinet member, Finance Minister Bill Morneau, refused on Monday to take his former colleagues’ strongly worded statements at face value, dismissing their departures as if they were high school girls in a loyal clique. But perhaps his words were illuminating of how Trudeau and his fellow higher-ups really feel about women standing up for their right to be respected, to support one another within a government that claims to support women but perhaps doesn’t much like that happening within its own ranks if it isn’t in service to the prime minister.

WATCH: Politicians react to resignation of former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott

Yes, loyalty is important, and another star minister, Chrystia Freeland, is out there defending the PM. But if any of the tension at all within the ranks of government was gendered, it doesn’t make the prime minister a “fake feminist,” as his detractors are gleefully accusing him of being. But it does risk making this government — which has so loudly and so proudly stood for women — appear hypocritical. I wonder, for example, if there would have been the same lengthy and numerous attempts to grind down a male attorney general as there were to try to get Wilson-Raybould to change her mind.

There is no such thing as a perfect feminist. But when the most powerful person in the country has staked his name on it, the expectations and costs are ultimately higher.

In his many public discussions about feminism, Trudeau himself has pointed out the problem of retention of women in the workplace — about how to keep women in their roles and how to even advance them to positions of leadership where they get to call the shots. Clearly, he knows exactly how difficult this task can be.

Which is why this is all so unfortunate. Trudeau’s government has walked the talk, at least where policy is concerned. It’s all put at risk because he allegedly could not be the kind of feminist who respects fellow powerhouse feminists who happen to be women.

READ MORE: Gerald Butts says ‘grey area’ between political staff, Wilson-Raybould on SNC-Lavalin affair

Before all of this hit the fan, Oxfam Canada prepared a scorecard on Trudeau’s feminism and released it this week. The organization gave the Trudeau government major props for representation, leadership and global development (thanks, in large part, to the decision to convene a G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council, create the Department for Women and Gender Equality, and fund the Feminist International Assistance Policy). It also said the government’s feminist efforts have “undoubtedly started to pay off,” with meaningful funding for grassroots feminist groups — particularly those trying to end violence against women — and tabled pay equity legislation.

The 2018 budget was the first one to apply a gender lens, analyzing how policies impact women differently from men on everything from job creation to climate change. And so on March 19, all eyes will be on budget 2019 — which will essentially serve as the Liberals’ campaign platform. Oxfam says more investment is needed — real money — to bolster those policies and make better, tangible change on the ground. That can’t happen if the Liberals get voted out in favour of the Conservatives or even the NDP, which has perhaps intentionally not talked about gender issues to the same degree, given that it’s been such a key part of the Liberals’ brand. Will they be any better?

This controversy — if it lingers and continues to do damage to the Liberals — will all, ultimately, come at a cost to Canadian women.

Trudeau is winning no awards this International Women’s Day. It remains to be seen if he can repair this damage and win the election.

Terry Pedwell, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- The federal government is planning to open up a database of more than 9,000 files to allow Inuit families to learn about relatives lost during the tuberculosis outbreaks of the mid-20th century.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is travelling this week to Iqaluit, is expected to outline how the database will work Thursday as he delivers an apology on behalf of the government for the mistreatment of Inuit during the epidemics.

The database will, for the first time, help Inuit families in northern Canada contact representatives within their land claim organizations who can help conduct an in-depth to determine what happened to their relatives.

The aim is to help locate the gravesites of family members who were transported to southern Canada for TB treatment between the 1940s and the late 1960s.

""We know that we won't be able to find everyone,"" said one source familiar with the announcement, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to talk about matters that have yet to be made public.

The documents in the database could lead some searchers to a dead end, ""but some might lead to actual gravesites.""

The apology and database are part of a process called Nanilavut, which means ""let's find them"" in Inuktitut.

The Canadian Public Health Association has estimated about one-third of Canada's Inuit population became infected with TB during the outbreaks. Many of those who died were never returned to their families but were instead buried in unmarked plots.

The search for relatives began in 2008 when a family in Nunavut reached out in hopes of finding a lost loved one who was taken south for TB treatment.

Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the organization that speaks for Inuit in Nunavut, contacted the federal government, which soon afterward began to uncover more information about other cases of Inuit who had died but whose bodies were never returned north.

A working group was formed and since then, the four agencies representing Inuit in Canada have been compiling as much information as they could find.

The database now contains more than 9,000 records including hospital documents and transport records, but much of the information is incomplete.

""Some (of the documents) are lists of names; some could be duplicates or multiple records for the same person with names spelled in different ways,"" said another source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity in advance of the public announcement.

""In some cases there will be names. In some cases people will be identified by their ""E"" numbers.""

The ""E"" numbers -- or sometimes ""W"" numbers -- were what federal authorities at the time used to identify individual Inuit, rather than using their names.

""This is sort of another part of the inhumane treatment that Inuit suffered at that time,"" said the source. ""They were given these numbered discs and that was how they were known -- not by their names, but by their numbers.""

There are four northern land claim regions involved in the project, in the territory of Nunavut, Nunavik in northern Quebec, Nunatsiavut in northern Labrador and the Inuvialuit settlement region of the Northwest Territories.

The database will be open to family members with documents identifying their loved ones.

It is hoped that, once families come forward, the database will grow and potentially help other families who don't have documents available to them to begin searching for missing relatives.

Over the last decade, a number of groups and individuals have tried to identify Inuit who died in southern Canada while receiving treatment for tuberculosis.

In 2010, members of the United Church in the Mohawk community of Kahnawake, southwest of Montreal, erected a memorial stone after identifying 15 Inuit buried in a Protestant cemetery.

They ranged in age from two months to 74 years old and records identified most of them by only one name.",Trudeau to apologize for federal mistreatment of TB-infected Inuit in Iqaluit - CTV News,Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/trudeau-to-apologize-for-federal-mistreatment-of-tb-infected-inuit-in-iqaluit-1.4324139

On Thursday, Ottawa finally acquiesced, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canada will become a partner in the Lunar Orbiting Platform-Gateway, a facility that the U.S. space agency, NASA, envisions as both a proving ground for space technology and a precursor to an eventual human mission to Mars.

“Today, we are stepping up,” the Prime Minister said during a press conference at Canadian Space Agency headquarters in Saint-Hubert, near Montreal. “Canada is going to the moon.”

The announcement means that Canada is the first partner to officially commit to the Gateway after the United States, although Europe, Japan and Russia have all indicated their interest and are expected to follow suit in the coming months.

The centrepiece of Canada’s involvement in the new platform will be supplying a robotic arm that Mr. Trudeau called “Canadarm 3,” a successor to the Canadarm 2, the unit that is depicted on the back of the Canadian five dollar bill and that has become crucial to operations aboard the International Space Station.

The commitment is the largest for the country’s space program in over a decade and will inject $2.05-billion into Canada’s space sector over the next 24 years. It also creates a focus for the Canadian Space Agency, which has been seen as adrift in recent years without a long-term plan or direction from political leaders about what happens after the space station.

The agency’s official entry into project, also sets the stage for Canadian astronauts to visit and work aboard the deep space outpost.

“Our objective is to have a Canadian on the Gateway within the next 10 years, as soon as the Gateway is completed,” said Gilles Leclerc, the agency’s director-general of exploration.

Jennifer Sidey-Gibbons, who was selected in 2017 to be a Canadian astronaut, said the prospect of a future mission to the Gateway was an opportunity almost too great for words.

“To hear the moon discussed as something we’re pushing towards is phenomenal,” she said.

Because of its remote location, it is expected that the Gateway will be unoccupied most of the time. The new Canadarm and other systems on board the platform will be more reliant on artificial intelligence with less real-time input from mission controllers on Earth.

Mr. Leclerc added that Canada’s partnership in the Gateway would also open the possibility of access for scientists and Canadian companies to use the outpost as a base for conducting robotic mission on the lunar surface.

“It’s a door opener,” said Gordon Osinski, a planetary scientist at the University of Western Ontario. “Now that Canada’s at the table for a return to the moon it creates a way for scientists and engineers [at Canadian universities] to participate too.”

Thursday’s announcement also includes a $150-million allocation to the agency over the next five years for an accelerator program to spur projects by Canadian companies to develop technologies related to the Gateway. The program includes support for remote health technologies – a facet of human space exploration where the space agency hopes to develop a second niche alongside Canada’s established track record building space robotics.

Navdeep Bains, Minister for Innovation, Science and Economic Development, said that up to 200 companies stand to benefit from the initiative. The new funding will be included in the 2019 federal budget that is set to be tabled on March 19.

But the biggest potential winner is likely to be MDA, the company that built and operates Canadarm 2. While MDA is now part of Maxar, a U.S.-based aerospace firm, its robotics division remains in Brampton, Ont.

MDA has already been working on preliminary contracts to develop technologies toward Canadarm 3 and is a likely front-runner for the main contract to build the new arm.

For the past 10 months the company has led a vigorous public relations campaign under the banner “Don’t Let Go” to encourage the federal government to sign onto the Gateway.

In televised testimony Wednesday in Ottawa, Gerald Butts laid out his version of events that have put the Canadian prime minister in political jeopardy ahead of an election. His comments come a week after former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould alleged Trudeau, Butts and others pressured her to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. settle corruption charges out of court.

Trudeau’s former principal secretary said the prime minister’s marching orders to staff were to bear in mind potential job losses at the Montreal-based firm, and to work with the public service to consider all legal options. Wilson-Raybould was merely asked to consider a second opinion, he said, adding the final decision was hers to make.

“We felt that outside advice was appropriate because of the extraordinary circumstances,” Butts told lawmakers on the House of Commons justice committee. “We also made clear that if the attorney general accepted our proposal and took external advice, she was equally free to reject that advice.”

The former top prime ministerial aide, in his opening remarks, detailed conversations with Wilson-Raybould and said the topic of SNC-Lavalin came up only rarely. She never made her concerns plain to him early on, or wrote to Trudeau saying her decision was final, he said.

Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to a different job in January. Butts said that decision had nothing to do with SNC-Lavalin, and that her objections around SNC only ramped up around that time.

The story broke Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail newspaper reported — citing anonymous sources — that Wilson-Raybould felt pressured to intervene. She then quit cabinet and gave her version of events in explosive testimony last week. A second minister, Jane Philpott, resigned this week over Trudeau’s handling of the matter.

Butts left his job as principal secretary on Feb. 18, saying it was in the best interest of the government for him to step down.

When it comes to Canadians’ reactions to the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal, it appears that opinions could not be more starkly different between the provinces of Quebec and Alberta.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spent much of his day Thursday in his home province, where SNC-Lavalin is headquartered. His message that his government was standing up for SNC-Lavalin jobs appears to have found some ground there, where the company is widely considered a “crown jewel” of Quebec’s economy.

“I think the economical imperatives here are very important,” a man told CTV News on the streets of Papineau, the Montreal electoral district that has been held by Trudeau for more than a decade.

Yves Boisvery is a columnist with the Montreal digital newspaper La Presse.

“In Quebec, it is more seen as a way to find a solution to save an important strategic company,” Boisvery told CTV News.

SNC-Lavalin employs roughly 9,000 people in Canada, and 3,400 of those jobs are in Quebec.

“There were many and broad conversations about the importance of defending jobs, not just in Quebec but right across the country,” Trudeau told reporters from Quebec on Thursday.

But in the aftermath of former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould’s explosive testimony in Parliament Wednesday, the tone in some editorials has begun to shift.

In the newspaper Le Journal de Montreal, for example, columnist Richard Martineau argued Thursday that Trudeau isn’t trying to save jobs so much as shore up support for this year’s federal election.

THE VIEW FROM ALBERTA

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley appeared before the Senate in Ottawa Thursday to give her take on Bill C-69, which would change how energy projects -- such as pipelines -- are assessed.

“I know that right now, Ottawa is a little consumed with the SNC-Lavalin affair,” Notley said from the capital. “But I need you to know that when Alberta's energy industry is hurting, the whole country pays a price.”

Notley, however, deflected any suggestion that Ottawa is playing favourites with Quebec.

“I don't want to pit the two against each other,” she said.

Some 3,000 kilometres, many Albertans, however, do feel like favouritism is at play at a time when their economy is struggling amid low oil prices.

“Alberta is getting short shifted,” one man told CTV News on Thursday from a Calgary coffee shop.

Another said that the duelling crises have left him resigned and angry.

“Resignation, like there's nothing you can do about it,” he said. “And anger that the central eastern culture could care less, quite frankly.”

Lori Williams, a political scientist with Calgary’s Mount Royal University, says that many in Alberta feel that the system is inherently unfair.

“We give into equalization (payments), Quebec receives from equalization,” she told CTV News. “We have concerns about jobs and Quebec jobs seem to count more.”",From 'solution' to 'anger': Reactions to SNC-Lavalin in Que. and Alta. - CTV News,Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/from-solution-to-anger-reactions-to-snc-lavalin-in-que-and-alta-1.4317874

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Thursday that Canada will be a partner in a NASA-led project to establish an outpost for lunar exploration.

“Canada is going to the moon,” Trudeau declared as he made the announcement at the Canadian Space Agency in the Montreal suburb of Longueuil.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is embarking on the creation of its new Lunar Gateway, a space station that will orbit the moon. The station is expected to be fully functional around 2026.

“The Lunar Gateway will be one of the most ambitious projects ever undertaken by human beings to date,” Trudeau said. “Not only will this moon outpost allow for a long-term lunar presence but it will also serve as a launch pad to Mars and beyond.”

The plan calls for a “sustainable lunar architecture” that would allow people and equipment to go back and forth to the moon regularly, NASA says. It is described as a first step toward deeper space exploration.

Trudeau said the partnership in the Lunar Gateway will be part of a new federal space strategy that will see the government invest $2.05 billion over 24 years. He said the investment will create hundreds of well-paying jobs and contribute $100 million annually to Canada’s gross domestic product.

Canada’s key contribution to the Lunar Gateway will be developing a smart robotic system, to be known as Canadarm 3. The mechanism will repair and maintain the outpost, which will be about one-fifth the size of the International Space Station.

“Canadarm was essential to the space shuttle, Canadarm 2 built the International Space Station, so it’s only fitting and right that the arm that will repair and maintain the Lunar Gateway will yet again be made in Canada by Canadians,” Trudeau said.

Last November, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine visited Ottawa to make a pitch for Canadian involvement in the moon project. He said at the time that he hoped Canadian expertise in artificial intelligence and robotics could yield a new Canadarm. “If Canadians want to be involved in missions to the surface of the moon with astronauts, we welcome that,” he added.

U.S. ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft said in a statement that Thursday’s announcement marks “the beginning of a new era of U.S.-Canada space co-operation.”

Wilson-Raybould ​gave her account of the SNC-Lavalin​ controversy to the House of Commons justice committee over several hours on Wednesday.

The former attorney general said she faced a campaign of sustained pressure — including from the prime minister and his staff — to secure an agreement to resolve the criminal case against the Quebec engineering firm, which is facing fraud and corruption charges.

Wilson-Raybould said the pleas persisted despite her insistence she had made a decision not to intervene in the case.

While Justin Trudeau has said he disagrees unequivocally with his former justice minister’s version of events, he has also made comments suggesting he believes the difference between his story and hers comes down to perspective.

“Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy, and that’s exactly what we’ve done every step of the way,” he said Thursday.​ “We’ve also done it in a way that has respected our laws and respected the independence of the judiciary — of that there actually is no doubt.

“There are disagreements in perspective on this, but I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job and we were doing it in a way that respects and defends our institutions.”

On the Roy Green Show on Saturday, pollster Darrell Bricker said Trudeau’s public comments on the SNC-Lavalin case have not helped.

“So far, the prime minister has done nothing to quell the problems that he has,” said Bricker, Global CEO of Public Affairs for Ipsos. “In fact, every time he stands in front of the camera he seems to make it worse.”

LISTEN: Bill Wilson joins the Roy Green show



He said Trudeau will have a difficult time coming back from the allegations in the months before the October election, though the party does have time to present a compelling case to Canadians — if it has one.

“Once those kinds of things happen, this is going to dog them all the way through to the election campaign. And governments that are dogged by this kind of thing have a very difficult time convincing Canadians that they actually deserve another term,” he said.

In the meantime, Bricker said, the Conservatives have been steadily pulling ahead in the polls. An Ipsos poll conducted between Feb. 14 and 18, found that, if an election were held today, the Tories would receive 36 per cent of the decided popular vote versus 34 per cent for the Liberals.

Attorney General David Lametti says he didn’t know that his predecessor, Jody Wilson-Raybould, had already made a decision not to cut SNC-Lavalin a deal to avoid criminal trial when he took over the post and began learning about the matter before him.

He was also mum on whether knowing that would keep him from reversing the decision.

“I had not,” Lametti when asked if he had known about the decision in an interview airing Sunday with The West Block‘s Mercedes Stephenson.

“I was a Montreal MP, as I’ve said, so I was generally aware of the file but I didn’t have any specific knowledge — I mean, I had the knowledge that you and I both had, reading the newspapers and seeing what’s out on the media.”

Lametti was also asked whether it would have given him pause to know Wilson-Raybould had already said no.

“At that point, I didn’t know all the facts — at this point, I still don’t know all the facts — so it’s a hypothetical question that I can’t answer,” he said.

In the interview, Lametti addressed questions in the wake of explosive testimony from Wilson-Raybould before a House of Commons justice committee earlier this week. In that testimony, she described co-ordination within the Department of Justice prior to the shuffle in order to brief Lametti on the issue as soon as he was appointed so that the new attorney general could speak with the prime minister as soon as possible.

“In other words, that the new minister will need to prepare, be prepared to speak to the prime minister on this file. The deputy recounts this to my chief of staff, who tells me about the conversation,” Wilson-Raybould added.

Wilson-Raybould was removed from the post of attorney general on Jan. 14, 2019.

She said she was notified of that decision on Jan. 7 and said at the time that she had told the prime minister and his then-principal secretary, Gerald Butts, she believed it to be because of her decision not to intervene to help cut SNC-Lavalin a deal to avoid criminal trial and potential conviction on corruption and fraud charges.

“They denied this to be the case,” she told the committee.

Butts is one of three witnesses set to testify before the same committee next week over allegations of attempted political interference.

Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick and Nathalie Drouin, the deputy attorney general, will also appear.

Wernick will likely face questions over the description of a Dec. 19, 2018, conversation he had with Wilson-Raybould, in which he allegedly told her that her decision not to intervene to offer a deal to SNC-Lavalin might not matter.

Justin Trudeau is to offer the apology in person while visiting Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut.

Perhaps more importantly, sources familiar with today’s planned event, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an announcement that isn’t yet public, say the prime minister will also announce the opening of a database that Inuit families can soon use to find loved ones who died when they were transported south for treatment.

Lawyer Marie Henein issued the ultimatum during a brief pre-trial hearing on Wednesday even as Butts, who recently resigned as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s top aide, was testifying before a House of Commons committee on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Henein noted that she has been fighting since October for records from the Prime Minister’s Office and the Privy Council Office, including with subpoenas last month for Trudeau’s, Butts’s and Wernick’s emails, BlackBerry messages and other communications.

WATCH: Government official charged with leaking confidential information in Mark Norman case

Those records were expected to form part of Henein’s argument later this month, during what’s called an abuse-of-process hearing, that there was no legitimate reason for Norman to be charged in the first place.

But Henein — who has previously accused the Trudeau government of trying to delay Norman’s politically charged trial, which is scheduled to begin in August and run through the fall election _ said the timeline for the abuse-of-process hearing is now in jeopardy.

“We will not be in a position to proceed with the March dates,” Henein told Judge Heather Perkins-McVey. “It’s impossible because we just don’t have the documents produced even for Your Honour to review.”

“If we don’t have this brought to conclusion, I’m going to be seeking subpoenas for Mr. Butts, Mr. Wernick, all these individuals from the (Privy Council Office) … to come before Your Honour and explain precisely what searches have gone on and where these documents are.”

The federal government is planning to open up a database of more than 9,000 files to allow Inuit families to learn about relatives lost during the tuberculosis outbreaks of the mid-20th century.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is travelling this week to Iqaluit, is expected to outline how the database will work Thursday as he delivers an apology on behalf of the government for the mistreatment of Inuit during the epidemics.

The database will, for the first time, help Inuit families in northern Canada contact representatives within their land claim organizations who can help conduct an in-depth to determine what happened to their relatives.

The aim is to help locate the gravesites of family members who were transported to southern Canada for TB treatment between the 1940s and the late 1960s.

“We know that we won’t be able to find everyone,” said one source familiar with the announcement, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to talk about matters that have yet to be made public.

The documents in the database could lead some searchers to a dead end, “but some might lead to actual gravesites.”

The apology and database are part of a process called Nanilavut, which means “let’s find them” in Inuktitut.

The Canadian Public Health Association has estimated about one-third of Canada’s Inuit population became infected with TB during the outbreaks. Many of those who died were never returned to their families but were instead buried in unmarked plots.

The search for relatives began in 2008 when a family in Nunavut reached out in hopes of finding a lost loved one who was taken south for TB treatment.

Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the organization that speaks for Inuit in Nunavut, contacted the federal government, which soon afterward began to uncover more information about other cases of Inuit who had died but whose bodies were never returned north.

A working group was formed and since then, the four agencies representing Inuit in Canada have been compiling as much information as they could find.

The database now contains more than 9,000 records including hospital documents and transport records, but much of the information is incomplete.

“Some (of the documents) are lists of names; some could be duplicates or multiple records for the same person with names spelled in different ways,” said another source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity in advance of the public announcement.

“In some cases there will be names. In some cases people will be identified by their ”E“ numbers.”

The “E” numbers – or sometimes “W” numbers – were what federal authorities at the time used to identify individual Inuit, rather than using their names.

“This is sort of another part of the inhumane treatment that Inuit suffered at that time,” said the source. “They were given these numbered discs and that was how they were known – not by their names, but by their numbers.”

There are four northern land claim regions involved in the project, in the territory of Nunavut, Nunavik in northern Quebec, Nunatsiavut in northern Labrador and the Inuvialuit settlement region of the Northwest Territories.

The database will be open to family members with documents identifying their loved ones.

It is hoped that, once families come forward, the database will grow and potentially help other families who don’t have documents available to them to begin searching for missing relatives.

Over the last decade, a number of groups and individuals have tried to identify Inuit who died in southern Canada while receiving treatment for tuberculosis.

In 2010, members of the United Church in the Mohawk community of Kahnawake, southwest of Montreal, erected a memorial stone after identifying 15 Inuit buried in a Protestant cemetery.

Teresa Wright, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is promising to remove federal sales tax from Canadians' home-heating bills as part of an early election campaign commitment.

If elected in the October federal election, Scheer says he would offer rebates to Canadians for the five per cent tax charged on all residential home energy, including heating oil, electricity, natural gas, propane, wood pellets and other heating sources.

Scheer estimates this could save Canadians an average of $107 per year.

The rebate would be capped at a maximum of $200 per household and would not be available for commercial energy costs.

The heating bills for investment properties would also not be eligible.

People who live in provinces that have harmonized provincial and federal sales taxes would get the same rebate.

“Heating your home in winter isn't a luxury for Canadians. It is a necessity,” Scheer said. “We don't tax other basic necessities like groceries and we shouldn't be taxing home heating.”

The Conservatives estimate the measure would cost the federal treasury $1.6 billion.

Scheer's promise comes as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has launched a campaign - complete with a series of Liberal party ads - aimed at drawing the public's attention to his carbon-pricing plan and how money raised from his imminent carbon tax will be rebated directly to residents of the four provinces that have no equivalent measures of their own.

The Trudeau government is requiring provinces to impose a price on carbon emissions, starting at $20 per tonne this year and rising by $10 per tonne annually until it hits $50 in 2022. Ottawa is imposing its own tax on Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick, as they continue to refuse to impose their own carbon pricing plan that meets federal targets.

Scheer has been a vocal opponent of the carbon tax and said the sales-tax cut would come along with scrapping the carbon tax if he becomes prime minister.",Scheer makes election promise to remove GST from home-heating bills - CTV News,Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/scheer-makes-election-promise-to-remove-gst-from-home-heating-bills-1.4324156

In the SNC-Lavalin case, they pressure a minister over prosecution, allow criminal charges to lapse and invent bureaucratic ploys to bend and mitigate the law.

But at this end of Canada, the Liberals insist on hyper-respect for every law, regulation, concept, process and social notion that might possibly be used to delay a pipeline.

SNC-Lavalin is a Quebec-based company accused of fraud and bribery while doing business in Libya. Essentially, it’s charged with engaging in corrupt behaviour abroad that it would not employ at home.

As the past couple of weeks have shown, the cabinet and government will contort themselves to keep this company out of criminal court.

A conviction would ban the company from bidding on Canadian projects for 10 years. On Monday, the Globe and Mail reported that officials are now writing rules to allow “flexibility” in the length of a bidding ban.

Two senior officials of the company recently escaped criminal charges because judges ruled that prosecutors took too long to bring the cases to trial.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was unhappy with what she evidently considered undue pressure to drop prosecution. She resigned and will soon appear before a committee.

Now, consider the handling of Trans Mountain by these same people.

The bedraggled project, far more important economically than any possible benefit from SNC-Lavalin, has been subject to endless public scrutiny.

The first proponent, Kinder Morgan, complied with every regulatory demand, completed extensive public consultations and negotiations — including dozens of financial benefit agreements with communities and First Nations — and has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

The project won 17 straight court challenges against other Indigenous groups, activists, and the cities of Burnaby and Vancouver.

But the obstruction played out for so long that the company left Canada, selling the project to Ottawa for $4.5 billion.

Construction began. Then, last Aug. 30, Trans Mountain ran into three Federal Court of Appeal judges who decided the permit was invalid.

The decision was not hostile to the pipeline itself. It was mainly critical of some consultation and environmental issues involving killer whales.

At that crucial moment, Ottawa might have applied some SNC-Lavalin-style vigour to the ruling.

Without any secretive actions, Ottawa could have appealed, ordered construction to continue, worked to fulfil the court’s demands and contested every application for an injunction.

The Liberals could also have passed a federal law enabling the pipeline. That was actually promised at one point. But the pledge sank without a bubble in the toxically conflicted cabinet.

Last Friday, the National Energy Board approved the project for the second time, adding 16 recommendations to its long list of previous conditions.

That might have been the moment for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself to promise quick cabinet approval.

But no, there’s not even a commitment to issue a new permit within cabinet’s 90-day guideline.

And all along, the Liberals have been busy erecting more legal barriers to energy and resource projects.

The best single article on this national disaster comes from former columnist Jeffrey Simpson, who recently wrote a long study for the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.

It details the impediments the Liberals have created, from giving the environment minister undue control over energy and resources to inferring veto powers for groups that will never agree to a project under any conditions and inventing extra-legal concepts like “social licence.”

Two bills — C-69 and C-48 — are now close to passage. The first would regulate new projects into oblivion. The second would prohibit Alberta products (not B.C. natural gas) from shipping by tanker off B.C.’s northern coast.

Absurdly, the Senate dominated by Ontario and Quebec is the last line of defence against these atrocious bills.

Counting the cost of delays and diversions so far, the C.D. Howe Institute estimates the loss in investment at $100 billion in 2017-18 alone.

Related

Along the way, the Liberals have virtually ceded a key power that holds Canada together, federal control over interprovincial shipping. At the same time, their bills would severely dilute provincial ownership and development of natural resources.

Such is the discriminatory regime the Liberals are creating for Western Canada’s resources. You can be sure they will enforce every nuance.

For SNC-Lavalin, though, existing law is a malleable thing, uniquely adaptable to partisan Liberal needs.

This double standard goes beyond simply hypocrisy. It’s a destructive message to the whole country about who counts, and who doesn’t.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made three changes to his cabinet, and the most high-profile move saw Lawrence MacAulay take over the veterans affairs portfolio.

READ MORE: Trudeau shuffles MacAulay, Monsef, Bibeau to new cabinet roles after Wilson-Raybould’s resignation

MacAulay is the 10th politician to take over the role since February 2006. That turnover rate ranks near the top for ministry positions at the federal level.

Since the Liberals were elected, five MPs have held the title of minister for veterans affairs, matching the five Conservatives who held the position during Stephen Harper’s time in office.

Calgary MP Kent Hehr oversaw the portfolio from November 2015 to August 2017, followed by Seamus O’Regan, who was minister until Jan. 14, 2019.

Jody Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to the position but stepped down after less than a month in the midst of the SNC-Lavalin affair. Minister of Defense Harjit Sajjan looked after the portfolio in a temporary capacity until MacAulay was sworn in.

When asked about the high turnover of the position, MacAulay said he’s just honoured that Trudeau picked him for the job.

“Our government has made a lot of changes in veterans affairs, but I’m not going to get into the details,” said MacAulay. “To represent veterans at the cabinet table is a distinct honour.”

Allan Hunter with Veterans Canada said the revolving door of politicians is getting in the way of helping Canadians who have served.

“The constant shuffling of the veterans affairs portfolio tells you that there’s not a big interest from the people in government to deal with the issues,” said Hunter. “Our veterans are in crisis.”

Hunter added that even if MacAulay gets to work immediately, the upcoming election will probably mean more changes.

“There’s a pretty good likelihood we’re going to go to another minister with the new government, regardless of what party is in power,” said Hunter. “Once again, we have a role that’s all about the figurehead and not about (the people) they serve, which are veterans and Canadians.”

There are a few positive points that veterans can take away from Friday’s announcement.

LONGUEUIL, Que. – Canada will be a partner in a NASA-led project to establish an outpost for lunar exploration as part of a revitalized national space program, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Thursday

“Canada is going to the moon,” Trudeau declared as he made the announcement at the Canadian Space Agency in the Montreal suburb of Longueuil.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced last summer it is embarking on the creation of its new Lunar Gateway, a space station that will orbit the moon and serve as a springboard for deep-space missions.

The station, about one-fifth the size of the International Space Station, is expected to be fully functional around 2026 and will serve as mission control for lunar missions.

“The Lunar Gateway will be one of the most ambitious projects ever undertaken by human beings to date,” Trudeau said. “Not only will this moon outpost allow for a long-term lunar presence but it will also serve as a launch pad to Mars and beyond.”

The plan calls for a “sustainable lunar architecture” that would allow people and equipment to go back and forth to the moon regularly, NASA says.

Trudeau said the partnership in the Lunar Gateway will be part of a new federal space strategy that will see the government invest $2.05 billion over 24 years. He said the investment will create hundreds of well-paying jobs and contribute $100 million annually to Canada’s gross domestic product thanks to the growing space economy.

“It’s a long-term commitment. It demonstrates we’re in it for the long run,” said Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains.

Canada’s key contribution to the Lunar Gateway will be developing a smart robotic system, to be known as Canadarm 3. The mechanism will repair and maintain the outpost.

“Canadarm was essential to the space shuttle, Canadarm 2 built the International Space Station, so it’s only fitting and right that the arm that will repair and maintain the Lunar Gateway will yet again be made in Canada by Canadians,” Trudeau said.

He got a first-hand look at some of the technology while touring the agency with daughter Ella-Grace, manipulating a camera fixed to the space station and testing out a rover in an agency lab. He later spoke to high school students in a town hall setting.

Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques, speaking from the space station where he’s on a six-month mission, said that unlike his current workplace, Gateway will not be able to be operated from the ground. Because of the distance, it will have to be autonomous, relying on robotics and artificial intelligence.

“I’m proud and thrilled that Canada will continue the adventure and join in the next chapter of space exploration,” Saint-Jacques said. “Gateway will be an outpost where humans can live in lunar orbit, where we will learn to work even more autonomously from mother Earth than we have been doing so far.”

Last November, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine visited Ottawa to make a pitch for Canadian involvement in the moon project. He said at the time that he hoped Canadian expertise in artificial intelligence and robotics could yield a new Canadarm. “If Canadians want to be involved in missions to the surface of the moon with astronauts, we welcome that,” he added.

U.S. ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft said in a statement that Thursday’s announcement marks “the beginning of a new era of U.S.-Canada space co-operation.”

The Gateway project will provide Canadian astronauts time in orbit, said Gilles Leclerc, director general of space exploration for the Canadian Space Agency. He said the arrangement still has to be negotiated, but he expects it will be similar to the agreement governing the space station. In Canada’s case, it provides the robotics and has the right to conduct experiments and send crew to the space station.

Leclerc said it’s an exciting time in space – particularly with commercial human space flight on the horizon. But the Gateway project fits Canada’s space goals.

“The realistic approach is contributing Canadian technologies that’s not going to only get us flights but give benefits in terms of the science and real benefits on Earth,” Leclerc said.",Trudeau announces Canada will be partner in NASA-led Lunar Gateway project - CanadianManufacturing.com,Canadianmanufacturing.com,https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/manufacturing/trudeau-announces-canada-will-be-partner-in-nasa-led-lunar-gateway-project-227964/

The tension traces back to a suicide bombing that killed 40 paramilitary police in Indian-controlled Kashmir on Feb. 14. India blamed Pakistan for harbouring the terror group responsible for the bombing and launched an air strike into Pakistani territory on Tuesday.

The two sides shot down one another’s aircraft on Wednesday, and shots have been fired on both sides of the disputed region.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insisted Thursday that there was nothing sinister about his role in a scandal swamping his government and threatening his reelection prospects.

At a formal press conference, he spoke in detail for the first time about the episode. He admitted to urging his former attorney general to reach an out-of-court settlement with a company from his home turf facing corruption charges.

But he repeatedly said it was all in the name of protecting jobs and pensioners.

""I continue to say there was no inappropriate pressure,"" he said. ""There was no breakdown of our system, of the rule of law, of the integrity of our institutions.""

The damage from his former attorney general's accusations has been swift and significant. The fallout has divided Trudeau's party, cost him two cabinet members, prompted two parliamentary probes, forced the resignation of a top aide and friend, and sent his personal poll numbers plummeting with an election months away.

""This has been a tough few weeks,"" Trudeau said.

Trudeau's version of events is that he simply stated to his former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould the fact that the Quebec-based construction company, SNC-Lavalin, is a major employer. He also noted at the press conference that a leading public pension fund owns part of the company that is in legal jeopardy.

“I wish she had come forward to me in the fall subsequent to that meeting to highlight that"" she felt it was inappropriate that we continued to discuss the matter throughout the fall, Trudeau said. ""She did not.”

While Trudeau largely stuck to the points he wanted to make, he appeared less stiff than in recent public appearances where he was repeatedly peppered with questions about his handling of the affair.

Trudeau repeatedly evaded stating whether he or his staff brought up both his and Quebec Liberals' electoral prospects during conversations with Wilson-Raybould, saying “there were detailed conversations on a broad range of things that were discussed” and “laid bare” in the testimonies of the last few days.

Wilson-Raybould said she was demoted in January after resisting pressure, for months last year, to deliver the settlement agreement to the company — headquartered near the prime minister's home district in Montreal.

And she went public with those concerns.

Wilson-Raybould said Trudeau himself briefly participated in a sustained campaign to twist her arm. She added the caveat that, in her opinion, the prime minister did not break any laws.

Trudeau said at Thursday's news conference that he had no idea that she felt she was under such pressure from various people in government.

He said she never mentioned it to him.

But he added that the episode does raise some questions about the structure of the cabinet.

""There are many things we would have liked to have done differently,"" Trudeau said.

One of those things: He said he will seek external advice about splitting up the roles of AG and the more political job of justice minister, now held by a single member of the Cabinet.

Wilson-Raybould was being pulled in two directions — by the pressures of the Liberal government on the one hand, and on the other by her department's decision to keep seeking criminal charges against Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin.

Also this week, longtime Trudeau aide Gerald Butts defended the government's behavior and challenged Wilson-Raybould's characterization of events.

A civil servant also testified to Parliament that she tried informing senior officials that a settlement with the company was legal — but Wilson-Raybould wouldn't let her.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s introduction: For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin. These events involved 11 people (excluding myself and my political staff) – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance. This included in-person conversations, telephone calls, emails, and text messages. There were approximately 10 phone calls and 10 meetings specifically about SNC-Lavalin that I and/or my staff was a part of.

On an interaction with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: PM: I was quite taken aback. My response – and I remember this vividly – was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye – I asked: “Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.” The Prime Minister said “No, No, No – we just need to find a solution.”

On a conversation with Privy Clerk Michael Wernick: He said that the PM wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can within the legitimate toolbox. The Clerk said that the PM is quite determined, quite firm but he wants to know why the DPA route which Parliament provided for isn’t being used. He said, “I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.”

On a meeting with Finance Minister Bill Morneau: Still on September 19, I spoke to Minister Morneau on this matter when we were in the House. He again stressed the need to save jobs, and I told him that engagements from his office to mine on SNC had to stop – that they were inappropriate.

In a text message with chief of staff Jessica Prince about an interaction with adviser Gerald Butts: Gerry said, “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.” At least they are finally being honest about what they are asking you to do! Don’t care about the PPSC’s independence. Katie was like “we don’t want to debate legalities anymore.” … They kept being like “we aren’t lawyers, but there has to be some solution here”.’

As John Ibbitson writes for The Globe, Michael Wernick, the Clerk of the Privy Council, tried to make the case for the Trudeau government’s defence in the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Story continues below advertisement

The Clerk of the Privy Council wanted to prove that Jody Wilson-Raybould was wrong to claim she was pressed to override the prosecution of the Quebec-based engineering giant when she was attorney-general. Instead, in blunt, sometimes confrontational, testimony before the House of Commons justice committee, Mr. Wernick confirmed most of what The Globe and Mail had previously reported, and in seeking to prove no pressure had been applied, appeared to prove instead that plenty of pressure had been applied.

4:17 p.m. ET

“There is no solution here that does not include interference,” Gerald Butts said to Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff Jessica Prince in a meeting that did not include Ms. Wilson-Raybould. Ms. Prince shared this via text message after the meeting on Dec. 18.

“If they don’t get a DPA they will leave Montreal,” Wilson-Raybould said she was told about SNC-Lavalin and the need to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with the Montreal company — Steven Chase (@stevenchase) February 27, 2019

Wilson-Raybould thanks Canadians for their patience during the weeks since The Globe broke the initial story on Feb. 7.

The DPA that Ms. Wilson-Raybould is referencing is a “deferred prosecution agreement” or remediation agreement that provides an alternative to prosecution. In such deals, a company accepts responsibility for the wrongdoing and pays a financial penalty, relinquishes benefits gained from the wrongdoing and puts in place compliance measures. It was introduced in 2018 as an amendement to the Criminal Code.

“It is unfair that the actions of one or more rogue employees should tarnish a company’s reputation, as well as jeopardize its future success and its employees’ livelihoods,” SNC argued in a brief to federal officials in October, 2017.

Jody Wilson-Raybould begins her testimony, saying for four months between September and December 2018, she “sustained a consistent effort from people in the government"" to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin case. These events involved 11 people.

Global News SNC selected for $660M light-rail transit contract in Ottawa BNNBloomberg.ca What would a 10-year ban on federal contracts actually mean for SNC-Lavalin? The Globe and…,"MONTREAL — As a scandal surrounding SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.‘s lobbying efforts to avoid criminal charges continues to plague the federal government, it remains unclear exactly what a conviction would mean for the company.

The engineering and construction giant is facing criminal prosecution over alleged bribes to Libyan government officials while pursuing business in that country. Under the current rules, a conviction includes a 10-year ban on federal contracts.

READ MORE: Trudeau admits ‘erosion of trust’ during SNC-Lavalin affair but does not apologize

CEO Neil Bruce, who assumed leadership in 2015, has repeatedly said the organization has turned over a new leaf, and that a prosecution at this date would only punish “innocent employees.”‘

Nearly one-third of SNC-Lavalin’s $9.3 billion in revenues in 2017 came from Canada, down from roughly 60 per cent of revenue in 2014. Analysts estimate that up to one-half of home-turf revenues stem from federal contracts.

Analyst Yuri Lynk of Canaccord Genuity said the reputational damage of a looming corruption case could hurt the company more than a decade-long ban on federal contract bidding.

“It hurts their reputation,” he said. “Their competitors would always be reminding clients that you’re dealing with someone with outstanding charges against it in its own country.”

On Oct. 10, shares plunged more than 13 per cent after news broke that federal prosecutors had declined to negotiate the charges, making prosecution appear imminent.

In the ensuing political scandal, various Liberal officials have made remarks about the spectre of large job losses and the risk that SNC-Lavalin would pull up stakes from Montreal to settle overseas in London.

WATCH: Scheer says he stands by call for Justin Trudeau’s resignation

The company currently employs about 10,000 people in the United Kingdom, more than the 8,500 or so stationed in Canada. However, the advantages of moving abroad are unclear.

“What’s moving to London really going to do?” Lynk asked, noting SNC-Lavalin would face the same bidding restrictions in Canada should a 10-year ban come down.

The U.K. serves as a major base for engineering companies in the European Union, but that bridge may crumble with the country’s impending departure from the EU.

“One of our major concerns around the U.K. is the impact of Brexit…so it’s not as simple as, ‘Hey, let’s go from Montreal to Manchester and call it a day,'” said analyst Chris Murray of Altacorp Capital.

WATCH: Jagmeet Singh says he was ‘disappointed’ by Trudeau’s address on SNC-Lavalin

Canada’s recent free trade deal with the EU allows European companies to bid on Canadian government contracts, potentially opening a door to SNC-Lavalin through subsidiaries, such as the London-based WS Atkins, that are not listed in the criminal case, analyst Derek Spronck of RBC Dominion Securities said in a research note.

Other experts say that even if the company shifts its focus further abroad, a criminal conviction in Canada could land it on blacklists in other countries.

In Canada, the restriction would apply to contracts that are “issued by a federal department or agency and contain the integrity provisions,” Public Services and Procurement Canada said in an email. It is not clear whether a ban would apply to major provincial or municipal contracts that happen to receive federal funding.

One possible workaround lies in the public services minister having the power to reduce or waive bidding bans under certain circumstances, said international trade lawyer Lawrence Herman.

“This is not a law but rather a policy under the government’s integrity regime,” he said in an email.

Moreover, the government is now considering changes to those ethical procurement rules, with Public Services holding a month-long public consultation last fall on a proposed “ineligibility and suspension policy” that would give officials more flexibility to set the ban period.

Analysts say a remediation agreement would likely lead to a major stock bump, sorely desired after shares have been hovering at seven-year lows of around $36.

It might also lessen the appeal for SNC to sell part of its 16.77 per cent stake in Ontario’s 407 ETR highway. The company has been mulling a partial sale for at least six months, which would hand it a slice of the $2.2 billion some analysts say the stake is worth.

SNC-Lavalin is working on the five biggest infrastructure projects in Canada, according to trade magazine ReNew Canada. Those contracts alone amount to $52.8 billion, and include projects for Bruce Power and the Darlington nuclear plant in Ontario as well as the Site C dam in B.C.

In 2013 SNC-Lavalin was barred from bidding on any construction project backed by the World Bank for up to 10 years. It also paid undisclosed restitution in 2017 to seven Quebec municipalities as part of the Quebec government’s program to recover money paid in connection with public contracts obtained as far back as 1996 as a result of fraud or fraudulent tactics.

All bets are now off about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's political survival.

An ethics scandal has plunged Canada's government into disarray, with the prime minister himself facing unprecedented political peril.

Story Continued Below

A flood of new details allege Trudeau and several senior government officials repeatedly pressured his former attorney general to drop corruption charges against a large construction company and reach a settlement agreement. Trudeau's political opponents sent police a letter Thursday requesting an investigation and called for Trudeau's resignation.

""He can no longer, and in good standing with a clear conscience, lead this nation,"" said Conservative Andrew Scheer, who hopes to replace Trudeau.

The prime minister brushed off that request and said Canadians will have a chance to judge him for themselves in an election this fall.

Until recently, his reelection appeared to be nearly a lock. The latest polls now show him slipping into a tight race — and those surveys don't even capture the latest influx of damaging detail.

""It’s like someone threw the chessboard into the air,"" said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs. ""The pieces haven’t landed yet. ... This was already a close race. [Trudeau's Liberals] couldn’t afford to stumble. And, yesterday was much more than a stumble.""

The turning point was testimony Wednesday at a spectacular Justice Committee hearing in the Canadian House of Commons: On the same day Michael Cohen torched President Donald Trump at a committee hearing, a spurned ally of Trudeau's was scorching him too.

Former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould, who was dropped by Trudeau but continues to sit in his party’s caucus, broke her silence after weeks of speculation about what she might say.

In painstaking detail she demolished the talking point from the government that Trudeau played no role in pressuring her to cut a plea deal with a Montreal-based company. Wilson-Raybould described and shared notes from about 10 meetings and 10 phone calls with 11 senior members of the government, including Trudeau. She said after she repeatedly fought pressure last fall from officials in Trudeau's office and other departments to deliver a non-prosecution agreement, the prime minister brought it up with her.

She said Trudeau noted in a meeting last September that the company, SNC-Lavalin, is a major, longstanding employer in his home town.

Wilson-Raybould also said the prime minister and others raised the suggestion that cutting a deal could help the provincial wing of their Liberal party in an election last October, which it ultimately lost.

""At that point the prime minister jumped in, stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that 'I am [a member of Parliament] in Quebec.' ... I was quite taken aback,"" Wilson-Raybould said. ""My response — and I vividly remember this as well — was to ask the prime minister a direct question while looking him in the eye. I asked, 'Are you politically interfering with my role?'""

She said Trudeau said he wasn't interfering.

But she was soon demoted to a lesser role in the cabinet, replaced with a new attorney general from Trudeau's home town, and she recently quit her cabinet post.

Wilson-Raybould, who remains a member of Parliament, told the committee hearing that she was, ""having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre,"" the Watergate purging of the Justice Department.

The sole bright spot on the darkest day of Trudeau's term came when the former minister was asked whether Trudeau or others had committed a crime.

""I don't believe that,"" she replied.

The opposition seized the moment anyway: The Conservative leader hoping to replace Trudeau in an election later this year sent police a letter requesting an investigation.

Scheer asked the Mounties to investigate whether the acts described violated two criminal code items: one on obstruction of justice, the other against pressuring the attorney general. The RCMP has not commented.

He also called on Trudeau to resign.

“I was sickened and appalled by [the] story of inappropriate, and frankly bordering on illegal, pressure,” Scheer said. ""Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet must now find a way forward, without him. … They have a duty to govern this nation, not help a disgraced prime minister hang onto power.”

Trudeau disputed the characterization of events, but did not deny asking her to spare the company. He insisted he never directed the minister to drop charges.

“There are disagreements in perspective on this,"" Trudeau said Thursday. ""But I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job and we were doing it in a way that respects and defends our institutions.""

He also sidestepped questions about calling a broader public inquiry, beyond ongoing parliamentary and ethics investigations.

One option available in theory is an early election.

If the opposition wants Trudeau gone, and if Trudeau said his fate is ultimately up to voters, they could call for an early election. The current election is officially set for Oct. 21, but the Canadian constitution allows a vote at any time.

Several members of the Trudeau government dismissed the idea. A spokesperson for the prime minister, Eleanore Catenaro, said Trudeau squashed the idea of an early election call in a December interview.

""His comments still stand,"" Catenaro said.

And asked about early election talk, Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr said Thursday: “[There's been] none that I’ve heard.""

Minister of Innovation Navdeep Bains was with Trudeau at a press conference announcing a 24-year Canadian commitment to NASA's deep-space exploration project.

He sounded a similar note.

“We’re just focused on our mandate,"" Bains said in an interview. ""We’re focused on executing our work for Canadians.”

The numbers, provided exclusively to The Globe and Mail and CTV News, are based on a Nanos poll of 750 Canadians from Feb. 28 to March 1. The poll comes after testimony from former justice minister and attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould to a parliamentary justice committee on Feb. 27, when she alleged “consistent and sustained” political pressure from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other senior officials to shelve the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Before the committee, Ms. Wilson-Raybould alleged inappropriate conduct on the part of Mr. Trudeau and 11 people in the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office and the Office of the Minister of Finance. This included Mr. Trudeau’s chief of staff, Katie Telford, and former principal secretary Gerald Butts, as well as Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his chief of staff, Ben Chin. The committee will hear this week from Mr. Butts, who resigned shortly after Ms. Wilson-Raybould quit cabinet on Feb. 12, and hear again from Mr. Wernick.

SNC-Lavalin, Jody Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau’s PMO: The story so far

SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges over allegations of bribery in Libya between 2001 and 2011, has been seeking a negotiated settlement in which a company admits wrongdoing and pays a fine, but avoids a trial. Last September, however, the federal director of public prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, informed the company that the prosecution would continue.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould could have publicly directed Ms. Roussel to settle the charges against SNC and allow a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA). She chose not to and was later shuffled out of the justice portfolio to veterans affairs, a move largely seen as a demotion. The final decision in the SNC-Lavalin case rested with her as attorney-general.

Mr. Trudeau said he disagrees with Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s characterization of discussions she had with him and others about the case. The Liberal government has insisted she was not directed to change her mind, and has frequently invoked the Shawcross Doctrine, a legal principle, to defend its right to discuss with an attorney-general the economic consequences of allowing a company to be prosecuted and convicted.

In the Nanos poll, 55 per cent of Canadians nationally think SNC-Lavalin should face a criminal trial, while 35 per cent said they prefer remediation and 10 per cent said they were unsure. Respondents were asked the same questions from Feb. 23 to 26, before Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony to the committee, and reported similar results: 53 per cent in support of a criminal trial, 35 per cent for remediation and 12 per cent unsure.

The poll showed the lowest regional support for a criminal trial in Quebec, where SNC-Lavalin employs thousands of people. Only 41 per cent of respondents in Quebec said they support a trial, while 48 per cent prefer a negotiated remediation agreement and 11 per cent were unsure.

“The key narrative is that the public prosecutor felt that criminal charges should proceed and I think that for average Canadians who are not legal experts, they accept that at face value,” Mr. Nanos said.

The poll also tracked Canadians’ confidence in the federal leaders before and after Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony. From Feb. 23 to 26 (before the testimony), 23 per cent of Canadians said Green Party Leader Elizabeth May was the most ethical leader, followed by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer at 21 per cent, Mr. Trudeau at 17 per cent and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh at 6 per cent.

Respondents were asked the same question from Feb. 28 to March 1, after Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony. The poll saw an increase in confidence in Ms. May, with 29 per cent of respondents saying she is the most ethical leader, followed by Mr. Scheer at 21 per cent, Mr. Trudeau at 12 per cent – a five-percentage-point decrease from the time frame before Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony – and Mr. Singh at 7 per cent.

“What this means is that people are disappointed with the mainline parties and the way politics is traditionally done. And Elizabeth May is kind of a safe haven for Canadians as a choice on the ethics front,” Mr. Nanos said. “The Conservatives should not think that they have any kind of ethics advantage.”

Justice, jobs and SNC-Lavalin: How much does the engineering giant matter to the economy?

Mr. Scheer, who has called for Mr. Trudeau’s resignation over his handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair, has faced repeated questions over how his party would have handled the case. Speaking to CTV’s Question Period Sunday, he said the Tories would consider making the attorney-general job separate from the justice minister’s role in cabinet, as suggested by Ms. Wilson-Raybould last week before the committee.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould spoke out Saturday, revealing to the Vancouver Sun her intentions to remain in the Liberal caucus and run for re-election under the party banner this fall, amid the tensions over her handling of the SNC-Lavalin case.

In a letter to the Prime Minister Sunday, NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus urged Mr. Trudeau to ask for Mr. Wernick’s resignation over his role as a “central player in a very political controversy.” Meanwhile, Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion has also launched an inquiry in the matter.

The Nanos poll was conducted by phone and online random survey over two time frames. The first wave, from Feb. 23 to 26, surveyed 1,000 Canadians and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The second wave of polling surveyed 750 people and drew from the same 1,000 respondents who participated in the first wave; the second wave has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.",More than half of Canadians say charges against SNC-Lavalin should go to criminal trial: poll - The Globe and Mail,The Globe And Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-more-than-half-of-canadians-say-charges-against-snc-lavalin-should-go/

View full coverage on Google News","OTTAWA – Jody Wilson-Raybould has accepted the House Justice Committee's invitation to testify on the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair on Wednesday, now that the government has waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence.

Her appearance will be the first time she speaks publicly and in detail in the 20 days since the allegations of political pressure being placed on her by members of the PMO in regards to an ongoing criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, were reported in The Globe and Mail.

Wilson-Raybould sent a letter to the committee Tuesday afternoon confirming she’d testify at 3:15 p.m. ET on Wednesday, which was the time the committee had requested.

Leaving the building where her lawyer has an office, CTV News asked Wilson-Raybould whether she felt satisfied with the terms under which she’s been permitted to speak, and she did not respond.

In requesting she attend imminently, the committee cited the Order in Council that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued Monday evening. The committee said it now has the clarity on confidence, privilege, and a parliamentary convention known as ""sub judice"" which deals with speaking about cases currently before the courts. These were issues that both Wilson-Raybould and the MPs who are conducting the probe were looking for more legal assurances on before having her appear.

The committee has agreed to a request Wilson-Raybould made in writing on Monday: that she be granted an ""extended opening statement"" lasting 30 minutes during which she would be able to go through everything she recalls about communications she was involved in regarding SNC-Lavalin. Most opening statements at committees are limited to 10 minutes.

The meeting is currently scheduled to span two hours, most of which will be Wilson-Raybould taking questions from MPs, and will take place inside one of the new committee meeting rooms in West Block. Wilson-Raybould is the only witness scheduled for the meeting.

""We're pleased to hear her take on things,"" said committee chair Anthony Housefather. ""I think it's important to the members of the committee to do our work, and to Canadians to hear from Ms. Wilson-Raybould, and I'm happy she’s agreed to come tomorrow,"" he said.

NDP MP Nathan Cullen said her testimony is ""pivotal,"" but expressed frustration that she was appearing in the afternoon, and not before the final prime minister's question period for a few weeks. On Wednesdays when he is in town, Trudeau takes every question asked during question period. Cullen said this could mean that the opposition won't have the ability to put to Trudeau what Wilson-Raybould has to say, until mid-March when the House of Commons reconvenes after a two-week hiatus where MPs are in their ridings.

Conservative MP Lisa Raitt said she'll be asking Wilson-Raybould whether in her view the pressure was appropriate and for more detail about many aspects of the entire affair from her perspective.

""The unanswered question I have is why did she resign? What was it either in what Mr. Lametti said or in what the prime minister said that caused her to realize she didn't have the confidence of the cabinet any longer?"" Raitt said.

In her Monday letter Wilson-Raybould said that she is ""anxious"" to appear and wrote that she'd be happy to stay for as long as the committee wishes to answer questions. Last week in the House of Commons she rose to say that she hopes she would be granted the ability to “speak my truth,” in relation to the allegations.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters on his way to Tuesday morning's cabinet meeting that he is ""pleased"" that Wilson-Raybould will be able to ""share her perspective.""

""It's important that people get an opportunity to testify or share their point of view at committee. As we said, waving the privilege, waiving cabinet confidentiality is something that we had to take very seriously,” Trudeau said.

""It's just important that she speak and that all of the mystery goes. This is important for all of us to get on with our work,"" said Crown Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett on her way out of cabinet on Tuesday. ""There is a view that in terms of the story, we need to hear her side of it,"" she said.

Over the last few weeks the opposition parties have focused in on this scandal, with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer calling it a ""textbook case of government corruption with those at the very top of the prime minister's office implicated in what could very well be the obstruction of justice."" The opposition Conservatives and New Democrats have sought to have Trudeau and several senior PMO staff believed to be central to the story testify, and a public inquiry called, with no success.

Tuesday, Government House Leader Bardish Chagger criticized the opposition and its messaging throughout this ongoing controversy.

""Once upon a time it was a message that 'oh the committee will never meet on this issue.' They're meeting on this issue. Then we started talking about 'oh, witnesses will never be allowed to appear.' Witnesses are appearing. They’re being asked tough questions. 'Oh, the former Attorney General will not be allowed to appear.' Guess what? She is appearing. 'Oh the Prime Minister is not going to let her speak.' The Prime Minister has done whatever he can to work with the current Attorney General to ensure that the opportunity is there,"" Chagger said.

'There were contacts between lawyers'

On his way into cabinet Tuesday morning, Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti said that, before waiving attorney-client privilege and cabinet confidence, federal lawyers were in touch with Wilson-Raybould's counsel.

""It is fair to say that there were contacts between lawyers but I won't go any further than that,"" Lametti told reporters Tuesday morning.

In her letter of resignation as Veterans Affairs Minister Wilson-Raybould said she retained former Supreme Court judge Thomas Cromwell to provide advice on speaking publicly about the scandal. Up until now she has maintained solicitor-client privilege as the reason she’s been unable to speak to the allegations.

This specific waiver only permits Wilson-Raybould to speak about the matter to the House Justice Committee, however, as part of its study into the SNC-Lavalin affair, and to the federal ethics commissioner who has also launched an investigation.

""We have, I believe as a government, worked to demonstrate transparency as well as balancing the fact that there is ongoing litigation we do not want to compromise, so we feel we’ve done that with this agreement,"" Lametti said.

The government made the directive in an Order in Council posted Monday evening. The order authorizes her, as well as ""any person who directly participated in discussions with her,"" to speak to the committee and ethics commissioner, about the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The order relates to any information or communications that have to do with Wilson-Raybould's time as the attorney general and exercising her authority under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, and only in regards to the two ongoing probes of the matter, and not a blanket permission for Wilson-Raybould to speak.

As well, the order states that Director of Public Prosecutions Kathleen Roussel is exempted from this waiving of privilege and any information or conversations between Wilson-Raybould and Roussel cannot be disclosed, ""in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,"" the prime minister's office states in the Order in Council.

Recap on the story so far

On Feb. 7, citing unnamed sources, The Globe and Mail reported that Trudeau's office pressed Wilson-Raybould to drop a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin when she was attorney general. It was alleged that the PMO wanted Wilson-Raybould to instruct federal prosecutors to change course and pursue a remediation agreement rather than criminal prosecution in the corruption and fraud case against the Quebec engineering and construction giant. CTV News has not independently verified the story.

Remediation agreements — or Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs) — can include having the company accept responsibility, denounce the wrongdoing, vow to implement corrective measures, and pay financial penalties.

In contrast, if the company was criminally convicted it would be banned from securing Canadian government contracts for a decade, potentially putting jobs on the line.

When she was attorney general, Wilson-Raybould had the ability to direct the Director of Public Prosecutions to take a different route with the charges against SNC-Lavalin but she did not, despite several meetings and conversations before and after federal prosecutors decided to carry on with the criminal case in the fall.

In January, Wilson-Raybould was shuffled into the veterans affairs portfolio, and was replaced as attorney general and justice minister by David Lametti, a Quebec MP. Wilson-Raybould accepted her new position, but then resigned from cabinet days after the Globe story broke amid the opposition framing this as her being demoted for not changing her position on a deferred prosecution.

The House Justice Committee began probing the matter last week. As part of the study the committee has already heard from Lametti, his deputy minister, and top bureaucrat Michael Wernick, who gave blunt and detailed testimony in which he sought to reframe the Globe report, saying that while it's likely Wilson-Raybould could have felt pressured, it's a question of whether that constitutes as ""inappropriate pressure,"" or pressure that comes with being part of the inner circle that makes key decisions with national implications.

Then on Monday the committee heard from a slate of academic witnesses on the underlying legal aspects at the heart of the affair. These include the legal provision known as remediation or deferred prosecution agreements, which were tucked into a recent omnibus bill following heavy SNC-Lavalin lobbying, and the Shawcross doctrine; which has to do with the independence of the attorney general in making decisions.

These witnesses offered their hypothetical perspectives about the propriety of attorney generals making prosecutorial decisions, when the various principles are activated, and the balance of seeking advice from cabinet colleagues without succumbing to or factoring in politics.

Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a legal counsel with Woodward and Company LLP, and law professor at the University of British Columbia, told the committee that what needs to be understood is how the situation unfolded.

""If the purpose was to persuade the attorney general as chief prosecutor to take a different position on a prosecution, it triggers a serious rule-of-law concern, and how will we know whether that’s serious or not? Well, obviously you need to hear from those who may have been involved,"" Turpel-Lafond told the committee on Monday.

To date, the government maintains that nothing improper occurred, though Trudeau's principal secretary resigned over the matter on Feb. 18, denying any wrongdoing.

Since the scandal hit Parliament Hill, federal ethics commissioner Mario Dion has launched an investigation, which Liberals continue to point to as the best avenue for examining the case, though such probes can often take months to complete.",Wilson-Raybould to testify on SNC-Lavalin affair on Wednesday - CTV News,Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/wilson-raybould-to-testify-on-snc-lavalin-affair-on-wednesday-1.4313176

According to the State Department’s annual accounting of such gifts, Chinese President Xi Jinping gave Trump and first lady Melania Trump the two most expensive presents in 2017: an ornate calligraphy display and presentation box worth $14,400 and a porcelain dinnerware set that includes plates imprinted with the pink house at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort worth $16,250. Like all of the other gifts to Trump, his wife, daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, those were turned over to the National Archives.

The Saudis and Gulf Arab states gave at least $24,120 in gifts to the Trumps. Those included a $6,400 ruby and emerald pendant necklace from Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, a gold-plated fighter jet model worth $4,850 from Bahrain’s crown prince, a $3,700 bronze statue of three oryx from the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, a set of gold-plated Kuwaiti coins worth $1,610 from Kuwait’s emir and “royal” perfume in a reptile-skin carrying case worth $1,260 from the deputy prime minister of Oman.

Others in the Middle East did not stint when it came to presents for the first family, according to the 64-page list compiled by the State Department’s Office of Protocol, which is to be published in the Federal Register on Thursday.

The Trumps received a personalized hardcover book of Psalms worth $4,500 from the rabbi in charge of the Western Wall in Jerusalem, a gold and diamond necklace and similar pendant from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre valued at $5,800 and a mother-of-pearl Nativity scene worth $4,200 from the Greek Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem.

Even Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, before the Trump administration started a series of moves to downgrade U.S. relations with the Palestinians, was generous. He gave Trump and the first lady a copy of a neo-Byzantine Nativity scene, a half-length portrait of Melania Trump and photograph with a total estimated value of $6,770, according to the list.

Other world leaders who have fallen from Trump’s favor were among the 2017 gift-givers, including Germany’s Angela Merkel, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Canada’s Justin Trudeau. Merkel gave the Trumps Mont Blanc pens and paper worth $5,264; Macron a map from 1783 of the United States worth $1,100 and Trudeau a sandstone statue of a male lion wearing a crown valued at $450.

Some gifts seemed designed to appeal to the president’s ego. Those included a $1,880 gemstone portrait of Trump in front of an American flag from Vietnam’s prime minister and a photo album titled “President Donald J. Trump in New York” from Poland’s president that contains black and white photographs of the president and polychrome photos of Trump Tower and was valued at $850.

Clothing, art, jewelry and accessories were favorite gifts to the first lady from foreign leaders,

The wife of Japan’s prime minister gave her a $2,200 pair of Mikimoto diamond and pearl earrings and a $3,000 gold and acrylic painting, while Italy’s prime minister gave her a $3,400 Ferragamo handbag. Belgium’s prime minister and his partner gave Melania Trump two handbags from the designer Delvaux worth $1,020 and $2,273. Ivanka Trump also got a Delvaux handbag from the Belgian leader that was worth $1,023. Meanwhile, the Saudi government gave Melania and Ivanka Trump embroidered garments, including at least one abaya, worth $1,500.

Kushner, Ivanka Trump’s husband, reported receiving only six gifts from foreign officials in 2017, the most valuable of which was a $3,630 fountain pen given to him by Jordan’s king.

Canada’s Prime Minister is facing intense pressure to reveal exactly what he knows about whether officials from his office inappropriately pressured a former cabinet minister to interfere with a prosecution on construction giant SNC-Lavalin. Jody Wilson-Raybould, Canada’s former justice secretary and attorney general, has said she hopes to “tell her truth” when she appears before the Commons’ justice committee later today amid accusations ‘a line was clearly crossed’.

Ms Wilson-Raybould quit the Cabinet last month and is consulting lawyers as to what she can say on the scandal. Last week, Canada’s top civil servant Michael Wernick denied any wrongdoing when he testified to the justice committee but admitted Ms Wilson-Raybould would likely “express concern” about a series of meetings on SNC-Lavalin when she speaks. Mr Singh, head of Canada’s third biggest party, said his by-election victory “allows me to ramp up the pressure on Mr Trudeau and on the Liberal government”.

Jagmeet Singh has promised to 'ramp up the pressure' on Justin Trudeau

He added: “It allows me to really put into focus the question, ‘Is this Liberal government more interest in helping their well-connected, powerful friends like SNC-Lavalin?’”. The 40-year-old has made waves in Canadian politics as the first person of a minority ethnic group to become leader of a major party. Mr Singh was chosen to replace Tom Mulcair in October last year as the former NDP leader lost a leadership review.

Jody Wilson-Raybould says she hopes to ""tell my truth"" on the SNC-Lavalin scandal later today

He finally won a Commons seat by seizing Vancouver constituency Burnaby South with 39 percent of the vote this week. The win means he can now face Mr Trudeau in parliament directly, joining opposition Conservative calls for a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair. Mr Trudeau has dismissed a full-scale investigation, saying the Ethics Commissioner’s examination into events is enough to answer Canadians’ questions.

Cohen’s testimony was significant, and it could hurt President Trump. But Wilson-Raybould may end up bringing down the current Canadian government.

The former attorney general spent more than four hours testifying before the House of Commons Justice Committee, confirming major details of a corruption scandal that has engulfed Canadian politics and implicates Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself. At its core, Raybould’s testimony offered us deep insights into the insidious nature of crony capitalism, and the destructive impact it has on individuals, institutions, and the rule of law.

Last month a Canadian newspaper published a report alleging that Trudeau and senior officials had pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a corruption and fraud case against SNC-Lavalin, a global Montréal-based engineering firm. Wilson-Raybould stood her ground and refused, and a few months later she was pushed out of her role as attorney general in a move widely seen as a demotion. At the time, before the scandal broke, Wilson-Raybould released a cryptic departure letter in which she said that “it is a pillar of our democracy that our system of justice be free from even the perception of political interference.”

Last week, Wilson-Raybould confirmed the allegations, telling the Justice Committee, “I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada.” The scandal has already claimed the scalp of Gerry Butts, Trudeau’s close friend and principal secretary, and a senior cabinet minister has since resigned over the affair.

The company at the center of the scandal, SNC-Lavalin, has a history of shady dealings. The corruption charges include allegations the company paid $48 million in bribes to Libyan government officials between 2001 and 2011, and conviction may result in SNC-Lavalin being barred from federal government contracts for a decade, a major source of its revenue. In 2018, the Trudeau government quietly amended Canada’s Criminal Code to create “deferred prosecution agreements.” SNC-Lavalin had lobbied heavily for DPAs, as they would allow companies like SNC-Lavalin accused of offenses like corruption to avoid criminal charges. The pressure on Wilson-Raybould was specifically to get her to intervene and grant SNC one of these DPAs.

Why would a government ostensibly committed to the rule of law abandon this principle to protect a disreputable company? The answer is simple: crony capitalism.

SNC-Lavalin has been called a “crown-jewel of Québec.” It is based in Montréal, has some 3,400 employees in the province, and is often seen as a source of pride for Québec. Québec’s pension fund even owns around 20 percent of SNC’s shares. Québec is a vote-rich province crucial to the success of Trudeau and the Liberals in the upcoming federal election. Québec’s provincial government has insisted on protecting the employees of the company and the provincial pension fund, and warned of the consequences of failing to do so. In their repeated attempts to interfere, Trudeau and his officials were keen to remind Wilson-Raybould of this. In her testimony, Wilson-Raybould claimed in a conversation that Trudeau had reminded her that “I [Trudeau] am an MP in Québec – the member for Papineau.”

The line between direct subsidies and public contracts is often blurred, which creates obvious incentives for corruption. A company reliant on public contracts doesn’t just innovate by being more productive, but rather by ensuring those public dollars keep rolling in. SNC-Lavalin, which is currently banned from World Bank projects because of another corruption scandal in Bangladesh, “innovated” in the best way it could, by ensuring that it was awarded public contracts by whatever means necessary. It is inevitable that this kind of behavior will eventually seep into other aspects of government and law as well.

Rule of law is a bedrock principle in liberal democracies like Canada and the United States. It means applying the law to everyone equally, without arbitrary exceptions. Crony capitalism has a corrosive impact on these values, as the interests of a specific company eat away at the impartial application of the law. Protecting the rich and well-connected is often cloaked in the language of “protecting jobs” and the interests of individual companies get equated with the economic interests of an entire community.

Crony capitalism corrupts everything it touches, and Justin Trudeau’s government, whose re-election this year is looking increasingly unlikely, may end up being the latest thing poisoned by this insidious practice.

In a serious blow to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a second member of his cabinet in Canada resigned saying she had lost confidence in how the government had dealt with an escalating political scandal.

The departure of recently appointed Treasury Board President Jane Philpott, who was in charge of government spending, deprives Trudeau of another powerful female member of cabinet just months before an election that polls show he could lose.

Philpott expressed unhappiness about the government's response to allegations that officials inappropriately pressured former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help major construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial.

The political scandal gripping Mr Trudeau's Liberal Party began when his former justice minister claimed on Wednesday that she had been pressured to drop the prosecution of SNC-Lavin, a construction firm in the prime minister's home province.

In her testimony, justice minister Jody WIlson-Raybould claimed she endured a ""sustained"" pressure to abandon a prosecution of the construction giant by Mr Trudeau's staff.

It is the first time the Prime Minister has been implicated in the scandal and the claims threaten to inflict significant political damage on the Liberals just months ahead of what polls suggest will be a hard-fought election.

America closed its consulate-general in Jerusalem, which had acted as a de facto embassy to the Palestinians. The State Department said this did not signal a change in policy; the consulate’s operations will be handled by the new American embassy to Israel in the city.

Lowering the horizon

China’s prime minister, Li Keqiang, said the country would aim for GDP growth this year of between 6% and 6.5%, down from 6.6% last year and the slowest rate in nearly three decades. He was speaking at the start of the annual ten-day session of China’s rubber-stamp parliament. Mr Li said the economy faced danger from abroad, a reference to the trade war with America.

America’s border-protection agency reported a sharp rise in the number of migrants trying to cross from Mexico illegally. More than 76,000 people tried to cross in February, the highest number for that month in 12 years. Families and children without parents accounted for 60% of the 66,450 who were apprehended; they came predominantly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Illegal crossings remain far below their peak in the 1990s.

China on Monday accused detained Canadian citizen Michael Kovrig of stealing state secrets passed on to him from another detained Canadian, businessman Michael Spavor, in a move likely to increase tension between Ottawa and Beijing.

The telecom gear maker is also preparing a lawsuit against the U.S. government over a law that restricts its market access.

It was the latest escalation of an unprecedented crisis for Huawei, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker and No. 2 manufacturer of smartphones, as Washington calls on governments around the world to stop using its gear, particularly in the next generation of telecommunication networks, known as 5G.

Spavor, a business consultant with deep ties to Pyongyang, had been trying to drum up international interest in investing in North Korean economic projects. He and Kovrig, a former diplomat, were picked up in December, shortly after Canada arrested Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, who faces extradition to the United States.

The Communist Party’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission said Kovrig had often entered China using an ordinary passport and business visas, “stealing and spying on sensitive Chinese information and intelligence via a contact in China.”

“We are obviously very concerned with this position that China has taken,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said about the accusations on Monday. “We’ve been engaging and standing up for the two Canadians who have been arbitrarily detained by China from the very beginning.”

Lawyers for Meng are suing the Canadian government, its border agency and federal police, alleging their client was detained, searched and interrogated for three hours in violation of her constitutional rights.

Canada arrested Meng in Vancouver on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States, which has charged her with bank and wire fraud to violate American sanctions against Iran by doing business through a subsidiary it tried to hide.

HUAWEI TO SUE

In another escalation of the trans-Pacific dispute, Huawei plans to announce a lawsuit against the U.S. government on Thursday on grounds related to a defense bill, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

Huawei will challenge an addition to the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) signed last year, which controlled U.S. government contracts with Chinese companies and strengthened the role of the panel that reviews foreign investment proposals. Beijing has condemned the NDAA act as targeting China.

Trump last year signed the law that limits Huawei and ZTE Corp’s access to U.S. government and military contracts. That is part of an all-out U.S. effort to close the two companies’ access to not only the U.S. market but major telecoms markets around the world where 5G networks are being designed and built.

U.S. lawmakers introduced bills earlier this year that would ban the sale of U.S. chips or other components to Chinese telecommunications companies that violate U.S. sanctions or export control laws.

U.S. officials have alleged Chinese telecom manufacturers are producing equipment that allows their government to spy on users abroad, including Western researchers working on leading-edge technologies. Beijing and the Chinese companies have repeatedly denied such allegations.

Trump is considering declaring a national emergency that would bar U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by Huawei and ZTE, three sources familiar with the situation told Reuters in December.

The Justice Department has also charged Huawei with stealing robotic technology from T-Mobile US Inc.

Trump said in February he may or may not include Huawei and ZTE in the trade deal being negotiated with China. Trump told reporters at the White House that U.S. officials were not talking about dropping charges against Huawei.

Also on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he thought his country and China were “on the cusp” of a deal to end their trade war.

HUAWEI CFO IN LIMBO

Meng, who is out on bail, is due to appear in a Vancouver court on Wednesday, when a date will be set for her extradition hearing. Ottawa rejects Chinese calls to release Meng, saying it cannot interfere with the judiciary.

The Canadian government approved her extradition proceedings on Friday. China, whose relations with Canada have deteriorated badly over the affair, denounced the decision and repeated previous demands for Meng’s release.

It could be years before Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, is sent to the United States since Canada’s slow-moving justice system allows many decisions to be appealed.

A final decision will likely come down to the federal justice minister, who will face the choice of angering the United States by rejecting the extradition bid, or China by accepting it.","China charges Canadian, Huawei to sue as spat escalates",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huawei-tech-idUSKCN1QL1X4

One of Canadian PM Justin Trudeau's top ministers has quit saying she has lost confidence in the government's handling of a corruption inquiry.

Treasury Board President Jane Philpott said: ""I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities, constitutional obligations.""

Mr Trudeau said he was disappointed by the resignation, but understood it.

He has denied political meddling to shield engineering firm SNC-Lavalin from a bribery trial.

Opposition Conservatives last week called on the Liberal PM to resign.

A number of opinion polls indicate Mr Trudeau's popularity is slipping in the run-up to a general election scheduled for October.

What did Jane Philpott say?

The cabinet minister announced her decision to step down on Monday, posting her resignation letter detailing her ""serious concerns"" with ""evidence of efforts by politicians and/or officials to pressure the former Attorney General to intervene in the criminal case involving SNC-Lavalin"".

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Trudeau was heckled at various points as he gave an address, though it is unclear why

""There can be a cost to acting on one's principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them,"" she said in a statement.

Her letter said it had become ""untenable"" for her to continue to serve in the cabinet.

""It is a fundamental doctrine of the rule of law that our Attorney General should not be subjected to political pressure or interference regarding the exercise of her prosecutorial discretion in criminal cases,"" she wrote.

""Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised.""

The former family physician has held key portfolios in Mr Trudeau's cabinet - health, indigenous services and, until this week, treasury board president - since being elected in 2015.

She will remain on as a Liberal member of Parliament.

What about Mr Trudeau's response?

In a short statement, Mr Trudeau thanked Ms Philpott for ""her years of service and her dedication to Canadians"".

And commenting on the growing political scandal at a rally in Toronto later, the prime minister said: ""Concerns of this nature must be taken seriously and I can ensure you that I am.""

What is the SNC-Lavalin affair?

Quebec-based SNC-Lavalin is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies.

The firm and two of its subsidiaries face fraud and corruption charges in connection with about C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001-11.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

SNC-Lavalin says it would be unfair to penalise the company as a whole and its thousands of employees for the wrongdoing of former executives.

The matter is proceeding to trial and the company says it will ""vigorously defend itself"" against the allegations.

A conviction could result in a decade-long ban on bidding on Canadian federal contracts, which would be a major financial blow to the firm.

Who else has resigned?

This is the third high-profile resignation following accusations Mr Trudeau and some of his top aides tried to shield SNC-Lavalin from a corruption trial.

Former attorney general and justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould resigned suddenly from Cabinet in February.

On 18 February, Mr Trudeau's top aide, Gerald Butts, announced he would quit, denying in a statement that he or anyone on his staff had done anything wrong but saying he had to leave so as not to be a distraction from the team's ""vital work"".

He is expected to speak on Wednesday before the House of Commons Justice Committee, which is looking into the matter.

What are the political interference claims?

Ms Wilson-Raybould has said she and her staff faced four months of a ""sustained"" and ""inappropriate effort"" late last year to push for a possible deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin.

That agreement would have allowed the firm to avoid a criminal trial and instead agree to alternative terms or conditions, like penalties or enhanced compliance measures.

The Liberal government brought in the remediation agreement regime in 2018 as part of a massive budget bill following lobbying efforts by the company.

Ms Wilson-Raybould says she resisted that pressure and believes she was shuffled out of the justice portfolio as a consequence.

A former Canadian justice minister says she faced attempts at interference and ""veiled threats"" from top government officials seeking a legal favour for a firm facing a corruption trial.

Jody Wilson-Raybould said she was pressed repeatedly to ""find a solution"" for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

PM Justin Trudeau said he disagreed with the minister's testimony and he and his staff acted appropriately.

Opposition leader Andrew Scheer has called on him to resign.

""He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,"" the Conservative leader told reporters, adding that he was calling for a full police investigation.

That agreement would have allowed the firm to avoid a criminal trial and instead agree to alternative terms or conditions, like penalties or enhanced compliance measures.

It was an option rejected in September by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada - an independent authority whose main objective is to prosecute federal offences - and one she supported.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said she and her aides were pulled into multiple conversations and meetings - ""a barrage of people hounding me and my staff"" - with Mr Trudeau, senior aides from his office and the finance department, and a top bureaucrat.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Wilson-Raybould says she felt political pressure and ""veiled threats"" from government officials

In those various meetings, they repeatedly raised concerns about the possibility of job losses and potential political ramifications of a trial long after that decision had been made.

""Within these conversations, there were expressed statements regarding the necessity of interference in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential of consequences and veiled threats if a deferred prosecution agreement was not made available to SNC,"" she said.

Mr Trudeau's Liberals have struggled to contain the controversy over the past three weeks.

Though she has been a key figure at the centre of the affair, Ms Wilson-Raybould had not yet not spoken publicly, citing solicitor-client privilege.

That privilege was waived by the government on Monday, paving the way for her appearance before the committee on Wednesday.

What has happened so far?

This began in early February, when the Globe and Mail newspaper reported on allegations of political interference in the case against SNC-Lavalin.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has faced repeated questions about the matter from opposition parties

The newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources, that Mr Trudeau's office pressured Ms Wilson-Raybould to push the public prosecution service to consider a deferred prosecution agreement.

Ms Wilson-Raybould was attorney general and justice minister until January, when she was shuffled into the veterans affairs portfolio, a move widely seen as a demotion.

An attorney general is supposed to act independently with respect of his or her prosecutorial function.

On 12 February, Ms Wilson-Raybould resigned suddenly from Cabinet, though she remains a Liberal member of Parliament.

Finally on 18 February, Mr Trudeau's top aide Gerald Butts announced he was resigning, denying in a statement that he or anyone on his staff did anything wrong but saying he had to leave so as not to be a distraction from the ""vital work"" being done by the team.

Mr Trudeau and his officials have denied anything improper took place but have struggled to contain the crisis.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday evening, he said he was worried about jobs at SNC Lavalin and how pensioners would be affected.

Opinion polls indicate the matter is beginning to hurt the Liberals with months to go until the coming general election.

What is happening with SNC Lavalin?

The Quebec-based firm is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies.

The company and two of its subsidiaries face fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

The agreement - similar to regimes in the US and the UK - essentially suspends prosecution while allowing a firm to agree instead to alternative terms or conditions.

SNC-Lavalin and its supporters say it would be unfair to penalise the company as a whole and its thousands of employees for the wrongdoings of former executives.

Preliminary hearings for the charges are currently before the courts. The company says it will ""vigorously defend itself"" against the allegations.

Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, was detained in Vancouver last December and is under house arrest. In late January the US Justice Department charged Meng and Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.

Meng is due to appear in a Vancouver court at 10 am Pacific time (1800 GMT) on March 6, when a date will be set for her extradition hearing. “Today, department of Justice Canada officials issued an authority to proceed, formally commencing an extradition process in the case of Ms. Meng Wanzhou,” the government said in a statement.

China, whose relations with Canada have deteriorated badly over the affair, denounced the decision and repeated previous demands for Meng’s release. U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said Washington thanked the Canadian government for its assistance. “We greatly appreciate Canada’s steadfast commitment to the rule of law,” she said in a statement.

Legal experts had predicted the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would give the go-ahead for extradition proceedings, given the close judicial relationship between Canada and the United States.

But it could be years before Meng is sent to the United States, since Canada’s slow-moving justice system allows many decisions to be appealed.

A final decision will likely come down to the federal justice minister, who will face the choice of angering the United States by rejecting the extradition bid, or China by accepting it.

Professor Wesley Wark of the University of Ottawa’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs said “the Canadians will take a beating throughout this whole process” from China.

“I suspect the Trudeau government is desperately hoping that the Americans reach a deal with the Chinese,” he said by phone.

U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters in December he would intervene if it served national security interests or helped close a trade deal with China, prompting Ottawa to stress the extradition process should not be politicized. Last week Trump played down the idea of dropping the charges.

After Meng’s detention, China arrested two Canadians on national security grounds, and a Chinese court later sentenced to death a Canadian man who previously had only been jailed for drug smuggling.

Brock University professor Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat who served two postings in China, said Beijing was likely to retaliate further.

“They’re not going to take this lying down … one shudders to think what the consequences could be,” he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp, saying Beijing might crack down on Canadian canola shipments or stop Chinese students from going to Canada.

Ottawa rejects Chinese calls to release Meng, saying it cannot interfere with the judiciary.

“The Chinese side is utterly dissatisfied with and firmly opposes the issuance of (the) authority to proceed,” the embassy in Ottawa said in a statement. Beijing had earlier questioned the state of judicial independence in Canada, noting the government faces accusations that it tried to intervene to stop a corruption trial.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has denied wrongdoing after he tried to shield one of the country's biggest firms from a corruption trial.

Mr Trudeau said any lobbying by him or his inner circle for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was done to protect jobs.

In explosive testimony, ex-Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said she faced ""sustained"" pressure to abandon prosecution of the Quebec-based firm.

Opposition Conservatives are calling on the Liberal PM to resign.

They are also demanding a public inquiry following Ms Wilson-Raybould's testimony on Wednesday before the Commons justice committee in Ottawa.

How did Trudeau defend himself?

Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, Mr Trudeau said he disagreed with his former justice minister's ""characterisation"" of events and maintained his staff followed the rules.

The prime minster said he had full confidence in an inquiry by a parliamentary justice committee into the affair and in an investigation by the federal ethics commissioner, and would ""participate fully"" in that process.

Opposition parties have been ramping up pressure on the prime minister and the Conservatives have said the Royal Canadian Mounted Police must immediately open an investigation.

Mr Trudeau said that to his knowledge no member of his staff has been contacted by the RCMP.

The prime minster has insisted for weeks that all communications between himself, federal officials and Ms Wilson-Raybould were above board.

He says that any advocacy for SNC-Lavalin was done in the interest of protecting Canadian jobs that no lines were crossed.

What does the ex-justice minister allege?

Ms Wilson-Raybould told the justice committee on Wednesday she had faced attempts at interference and ""veiled threats"" from top government officials seeking a legal favour for the Montreal construction firm.

The former justice minister and attorney general said she and her staff endured four months - between last September and December - of a ""sustained"" and ""inappropriate effort"" to push for a possible deferred prosecution agreement for the construction company.

That agreement would have allowed the firm to avoid a criminal trial and instead agree to alternative terms or conditions, like penalties or enhanced compliance measures.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said that while some discussions about the ramifications of the decision were normal, the pressure went well beyond what was appropriate given her role as attorney general.

In Canada, an attorney general is supposed to act independently with respect of his or her prosecutorial function and decisions are not supposed to be politically motivated.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said that in various meetings, Mr Trudeau and senior staff repeatedly raised concerns about the possibility of job losses and potential political ramifications of a trial.

She said she had made clear she was not prepared to help the company avoid a trial and that she believes it was why she was demoted in a Cabinet shuffle in January, which Mr Trudeau denies.

Ms Wilson-Raybould also said during her testimony she did not believe any laws were broken.

What is SNC-Lavalin accused of?

The company and two of its subsidiaries face fraud and corruption charges in relation to about C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001-11.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

SNC-Lavalin and its supporters say it would be unfair to penalise the company as a whole and its thousands of employees for the wrongdoings of former executives.

Preliminary hearings have begun and the company says it will ""vigorously defend itself"" against the allegations.

A conviction on fraud and corruption charges could result in a decade-long ban on bidding on federal contracts, which would be a major financial hit for the firm.

What's the company background?

SNC-Lavalin is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies and employs some 9,000 people in Canada.

The firm has deep roots in the vote-rich province of Quebec, which is expected to be a battleground in this October's general election.

This is not the first time SNC-Lavalin has found itself in trouble.

In 2016, the agency that oversees Canadian federal elections said former executives had devised a scheme to illegally donate C$118,000 to the federal Liberals and Conservatives between 2004-11. The bulk of the funds went to the prime minister's Liberal Party.

In 2013, the World Bank barred the firm and its affiliates for up to 10 years from bidding on contracts with the agency for ""misconduct"" in a bridge contract in Bangladesh, the longest debarment period ever handed down in a settlement.

How bad is this for Trudeau?

Political commentators suggest Ms Wilson-Raybould's remarks are deeply damaging for Mr Trudeau and the Liberals.

Writing in the Toronto Star, columnist Chantal Hebert says the prime minister was ""already up to his neck in the SNC-Lavalin mess"".

""On Wednesday, former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould pushed his head down further. It will be harder for the Liberal government to dig itself out of the deep hole she dug before the next campaign.""

In the National Post, columnist Andrew Coyne said Ms Wilson-Raybould's testimony suggested ""an attitude that appears to pervade this government: that the law is not an institution to be revered, but just another obstacle to get around, by whatever means necessary.""

Columnist Patrick Lagace, writing in Montreal newspaper La Presse, said her remarks suggest that ""for the Prime Minister and people acting on his orders, the rule of law and the independence of the Attorney General were at least negotiable"".

Trudeau's Liberal government has been on the defensive for a month over allegations by former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould that officials inappropriately pressured her last year to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal trial.

""I can repeat and reassure Canadians that there was no breakdown of our systems, of our rule of law, of the integrity of our institutions,"" Trudeau told a news conference.

The crisis has prompted the resignation of two high- profile Liberal cabinet ministers and Trudeau's closest political aide, Gerald Butts.

Polls show that Trudeau's Liberals trail the official opposition Conservatives ahead of the October election.

Butts, testifying to the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday, denied he had crossed the line by asking Wilson-Raybould to consider offering SNC-Lavalin a deal to avoid a trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

""There was never any inappropriate pressure,"" Trudeau said.

""I have never raised partisan considerations"" with former attorney general Wilson-Raybould, Trudeau added.

Although Trudeau has addressed the crisis a number of times in previous press conferences, this was the first time he has called a press conference to specifically talk about the affair.

""As we look back over the past weeks, there are many lessons to be learned and many things we would have liked to have done differently,"" Trudeau said.

'Erosion of trust'

SNC-Lavalin, which employs 9,000 people in Canada, was seeking a so-called ""deferred prosecution agreement"" to allow the firm to escape with a fine. Wilson-Raybould had the power to scrap the decision to go to trial but decided against it.

170526103137890

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee last week that officials, citing the need to protect jobs, kept on pressing her to reconsider even after she made clear her mind was made up.

""We considered she was still open to hearing different arguments, different approaches on what her decision could be. As we now learn through this testimony, that was not the case,"" said Trudeau.

He said relations between his office and Wilson-Raybould had clearly been fraying for months.

""I was not aware of that erosion of trust. As prime minister ... I should have been,"" Trudeau said.

Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly demoted to the veterans affairs ministry in January. She resigned on February 12.

Wilson-Raybould testified last she believes she lost the justice job because she didn't give in to ""sustained"" and ""inappropriate pressure"" to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin.

Butts said on Wednesday the SNC-Lavalin issue had nothing to do with the cabinet shuffle, which he said was prompted by the political retirement of Treasury Board Minister Scott Brison.","Trudeau: Mistakes made in SNC-Lavalin affair, no rules broken",Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/03/trudeau-mistakes-snc-lavalin-affair-rules-broken-190307151310145.html

The departure of recently appointed Treasury Board President Jane Philpott, who was in overall charge of government spending, deprives Trudeau of another powerful female Cabinet minister just months ahead of an election that polls show he could lose.

Philpott expressed unhappiness about the government’s response to allegations that officials inappropriately pressured former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help major construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc (SNC.TO) avoid a corruption trial.

“Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised,” Philpott said in a statement.

Trudeau told a Liberal Party rally in Toronto that he was disappointed but understood why she had left.

“Concerns of this nature must be taken seriously and I can ensure you that I am,” said Trudeau, who did not specifically address Philpott’s stated reasons for leaving. He also thanked her for serving in his Cabinet - something he notably did not do when Wilson-Raybould quit.

Philpott is a close friend of Wilson-Raybould, who resigned on Feb. 12 after she was unexpectedly demoted in January. Wilson-Raybould said last week she was convinced her refusal to help SNC-Lavalin was behind the demotion.

Andrew Scheer, head of the official opposition Conservative Party, repeated calls for Trudeau to quit amid the “ethical rot” he said was undermining the rule of law.

The departure of Philpott, who was appointed on Jan. 14, is another setback for a prime minister who came to power in November 2015 promising “sunny ways,” more accountability in politics and a greater number of women ministers.

“What should be worrisome for the Trudeau Liberals is that the two Cabinet resignations have been on issues of principle and ethics,” said Nanos Research pollster Nik Nanos.

“The second resignation begs the question – what did happen and could there be more resignations,” he said by email.

SIGNS OF STRAIN

Other members of the government, including Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, said they would stay in the Cabinet.

Philpott said evidence of efforts by politicians and officials to pressure Wilson-Raybould had raised serious concerns. Wilson-Raybould tweeted to Philpott that “you are a leader of vision and strength and I look forward to continuing to work alongside you.”

Philpott, 58, was widely regarded as one of the best of Trudeau’s Cabinet ministers. She previously served as minister of health and minister of indigenous services.

Most Liberal members of parliament have so far backed Trudeau but there are signs of strain.

Legislator Wayne Long said he was “deeply troubled” by Philpott’s departure and called for a full public inquiry into the matter, something Trudeau has rejected.

Celina Caesar-Chavannes, a parliamentarian who is not seeking re-election, tweeted that “when you add women, please do not expect the status quo. Expect us to make correct decisions, stand for what is right and exit when values are compromised.”

Trudeau called a news conference to address allegations that improper pressure was put on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a criminal trial.

“There was no breakdown of our systems, of our rule of law, of the integrity of our institutions,” Trudeau, the Liberal Party leader, told reporters. “There was never any inappropriate pressure.”

Trudeau, 47, came to power in November 2015 promising “sunny ways,” more accountability and a greater number of women in the Cabinet. Yet two-high powered female ministers have quit over the case and he now finds himself accused of trying to arrange a backroom deal with a major company.

Trudeau and other officials deny doing anything improper by asking Wilson-Raybould to consider offering SNC-Lavalin a deal to avoid a trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. Wilson-Raybould had the power to scrap the decision to go to trial and impose a fine but decided against it.

Trudeau, who discussed the matter with Wilson-Raybould on Sept. 17, said: “I stressed the importance of protecting Canadian jobs and reiterated that this issue was one of significant national importance.”

The crisis has prompted the resignations of Wilson-Raybould, Treasury Board President Jane Philpott and Trudeau’s closest political aide, Gerald Butts.

“There are many lessons to be learned and many things we would have liked to have done differently,” Trudeau said, adding he should have been aware Wilson-Raybould was unhappy.

A weekly tracking poll released by Nanos Research on Tuesday put the Conservatives at 35 percent public support, with the Liberals at 34 percent. A Jan. 8 Nanos poll put the Liberals at 39 percent and the Conservatives at 33 percent.

CONSERVATIVE CRITICISM

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer repeated calls for Trudeau to resign and said the prime minister’s comments had been “a completely phony act of fake sincerity.” He told reporters Trudeau had “acted like someone who has something to hide.”

Some Liberal legislators complained privately that Trudeau’s team had mishandled the matter. One senior party member, who had previously voiced concerns, said Trudeau was right not to apologize.

Under current laws, SNC-Lavalin could be banned from federal procurement contracts for 10 years if found guilty.

Trudeau’s officials, citing the potential for job losses, said they wanted Wilson-Raybould to consider a so-called deferred prosecution agreement, which would mean imposing a large fine on the company instead.

SNC-Lavalin, which employs 9,000 people in Canada, has close connections to the government. Kevin Lynch, the company’s chair, was once head of the federal civil service.

The company is based in the populous, largely French-speaking province of Quebec, where Trudeau’s Liberals lead in the polls but say they need to win more seats to have a chance in the October election.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee last week that officials, citing the need to protect jobs, kept on pressing her to think again even after she made clear she felt the company needed to face a trial.

“We considered she was still open to hearing different arguments, different approaches on what her decision could be. As we now learn ... that was not the case,” Trudeau said.

If elected in the October federal election, Scheer says he would offer rebates to Canadians for the five per cent tax charged on all residential home energy, including heating oil, electricity, natural gas, propane, wood pellets and other heating sources.

Scheer estimates this could save Canadians an average of $107 per year.

The rebate would be capped at a maximum of $200 per household and would not be available for commercial energy costs.

The heating bills for investment properties would also not be eligible.

People who live in provinces that have harmonized provincial and federal sales taxes would get the same rebate.

""Heating your home in winter isn't a luxury for Canadians. It is a necessity,"" Scheer said. ""We don't tax other basic necessities like groceries and we shouldn't be taxing home heating.""

The Conservatives estimate the measure would cost the federal treasury $1.6 billion.

Scheer's promise comes as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has launched a campaign — complete with a series of Liberal party ads — aimed at drawing the public's attention to his carbon-pricing plan and how money raised from his imminent carbon tax will be rebated directly to residents of the four provinces that have no equivalent measures of their own.

The Trudeau government is requiring provinces to impose a price on carbon emissions, starting at $20 per tonne this year and rising by $10 per tonne annually until it hits $50 in 2022. Ottawa is imposing its own tax on Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick, as they continue to refuse to impose their own carbon pricing plan that meets federal targets.

The federal Justice Department is giving the go-ahead for an extradition case to proceed against Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, who is wanted in the United States on fraud allegations. Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press

The Canadian government has given the green light for hearings on whether to hand Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou over to U.S. law authorities.

Ms. Meng, a Chinese citizen, was arrested while changing planes at Vancouver International Airport in December, causing a diplomatic rift between Canada and China.

The federal government took pains to defend Friday’s decision to approve extradition hearings, saying in a news release that Canada is following the letter of the law governing such proceedings.

“Canada is a country governed by the rule of law,” a Department of Justice statement said. “The decision on whether to issue an Authority to Proceed was made by Department of Justice ... officials who are part of a non-partisan public service.”

The development drew more ire on Friday from Beijing. China has accused Canada of collaborating with the United States to harass Ms. Meng, a top executive with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., China’s biggest private company.

The Chinese embassy in Canada, which has previously called the Meng arrest a “political conspiracy,"" on Friday questioned whether the Canadian government is really bound by the “rule of law” in this case, and urged Ottawa to let Ms. Meng go.

“The Chinese side is utterly dissatisfied with and firmly opposes the issuance of Authority to Proceed by the Department of Justice Canada on the case of Meng Wanzhou,” the embassy said.

“This is not a merely judicial case, but a political persecution against a Chinese high-tech enterprise. The subsequent developments have proved this. The so-called ‘rule of law’ and ‘judicial independence’ asserted by Canada cannot cover up the mistakes made by the Canadian side on the case of Meng Wanzhou.”

Only days after Ms. Meng’s arrest, and after Beijing threatened “serious consequences” if she was not released, two Canadians were detained in China in apparent retaliation. China’s foreign ministry says both men – former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor – are being held on suspicion of endangering national security. A Chinese court later sentenced to death a Canadian who had previously been jailed for drug smuggling.

U.S. prosecutors accuse Ms. Meng and Huawei of fraud to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran. Her defence will hinge on allegations that the U.S. charges are politically motivated, and on proving she did nothing wrong under Canadian law, her lead counsel, Richard Peck, told The Globe and Mail last month.

The Trudeau government has said it is simply complying with the terms of Canada’s extradition treaty with the United States.

On Friday, the Department of Justice said a review of evidence submitted by the United States has satisfied the conditions required to proceed with an extradition hearing.

“The department is satisfied that the requirements set out by the Extradition Act for the issuance of an Authority to Proceed have been met and there is sufficient evidence to be put before an extradition judge for decision.”

The Canadian government noted that the proceeding will not determine whether Ms. Meng is guilty of anything. “An extradition hearing is not a trial, nor does it render a verdict of guilt or innocence. If a person is ultimately extradited from Canada to face prosecution in another country, the individual will have a trial in that country.”

The Chinese government remains unconvinced the Trudeau government has no margin to manoeuvre.

Hours before the Department of Justice announcement on Friday, China’s Foreign Ministry took Canada to task over possible double standards by commenting at a regular daily news briefing in Beijing on allegations of political interference in the prosecution of Montreal engineering and construction giant SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.

Former justice minister and attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould testified this week that Mr. Trudeau and senior officials in the Prime Minister’s Office inappropriately pressed her to help the construction giant avoid trial on charges of corruption and fraud. (Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh are calling on Mr. Trudeau to bring the House of Commons back next week even though a break is scheduled.)

Asked by a state media journalist if it was contradictory for Mr. Trudeau to say he could not interfere in Ms. Meng’s case while his government stands accused of trying to intervene on behalf of SNC-Lavalin, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he “really liked this question.”

“Of course, I think that this is a question that should be asked of the Canadian government,” the spokesman said. “Not only Chinese and Canadian citizens, but the whole world is extremely interested to hear how the Canadian government answers this question.”

Both Ms. Meng and Huawei have denied the U.S. allegations.

University of Ottawa security expert Wesley Wark said extradition could be a lengthy process if there are appeals, and he added that he would not be surprised if Ms. Meng is released as part of a U.S.-China trade deal. “The best outcome for everyone is if the United States and China come to a trade agreement.”

The British Columbia Supreme Court has scheduled an appearance for March 6 to set the date for the extradition hearing.

Ms. Meng’s defence team said in a statement that it is disappointed that Justice Minister David Lametti is proceeding with the extradition hearing, citing what it called “the political nature of the U.S. charges” and U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion in mid-December that he might use the Huawei executive as a pawn in trade talks.

James Wu, executive president of the Canada China City Friendship Association, called the Canadian government’s decision to proceed with hearings wrong and unwise.

“The whole world knows that Mr. Trump is using this case as a bargaining chip, and that it’s obviously a political issue, but the Canadian government cannot make a wise decision, which makes us very angry,” Mr. Wu said.

“The relationship between Canada and China has already been damaged, and this thing will further damage the friendly relationship between the two countries.”

However, Jimmy Yan, a B.C. lawyer who is a frequent commentator on legal issues in the Chinese-language media, said while concerns over U.S. political motivation are legitimate, Canada is merely fulfilling its obligation to an extradition partner.

“This is an opportunity and, equally, a challenge for Canada to demonstrate the independence and fairness of our court system,” Mr. Yan said. “There is adequate room for Ms. Meng to defend herself.”

392,Empty,2019-02-25T14:46:09Z,Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer wants Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to appear as a witness at the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair.,"The Trudeau government issued a broad waiver on Monday allowing former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to tell the Commons justice committee details of her conversations with government officials about the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In an order-in-council (OIC) posted online, the government says Wilson-Raybould — ""and any persons who directly participated in discussions with her relating to the exercise of her authority under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin"" — can report to the committee and to the federal ethics commissioner any cabinet confidences ""in any information or communications that were directly discussed with her respecting the exercise of that authority while she held that office.""

The OIC also ""waives ... to the extent they apply, solicitor-client privilege and any other relevant duty of confidentiality to the Government of Canada"" regarding what Wilson-Raybould discussed with other government officials as justice minister ""respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin while she held that office.""

The waiver does not extend, however, to any communications between Wilson-Raybould and the director of public prosecutions on SNC-Lavalin while she was justice minister — ""in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,"" says the text of the order.

The order sets the stage for what could be an extraordinary session of the justice committee. Wilson-Raybould was expected to speak before the committee this week; a time has not yet been set for her appearance.

The justice committee is examining the growing controversy touched off by a Feb. 7 Globe and Mail report that said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin to help the company avoid criminal prosecution on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya — and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the Justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs.

Wilson-Raybould quit cabinet entirely on Feb. 12. She's offered no comment since on the SNC-Lavalin affair or the company's attempts to secure a remediation agreement to avoid criminal prosecution, arguing that she's still bound by solicitor-client confidentiality from her time as federal attorney general.

The OIC clears a few things up in advance of Wilson-Raybould's appearance before the committee. The ex-minister, who said she is ""anxious"" to testify before the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair, wrote to committee chair Liberal MP Anthony Housefather today saying it would be useful for the committee to have an ""authoritative statement"" on the scope of what she can say prior to her appearance.

""I am anxious to appear at the first available time,"" she wrote. ""However, I believe that in advance of my appearance the members of the committee and I should have as much clarity as we can in relation to the possible constraints on the matters about which I may properly testify.""

Wilson-Raybould, who has retained retired Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell as counsel, also requested an extended period of 30 minutes to make an opening statement to the committee.

Under pressure to waive solicitor-client privilege for his former justice minister and attorney general, Trudeau said earlier today Wilson-Raybould would be given leeway to speak.

Earlier today, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau to testify at the committee, insisting Canadians should be outraged by the allegations of political interference in a criminal case.

A motion tabled by the Conservatives said Trudeau should be called to answer questions given his ""alleged direct involvement in a sustained effort to influence SNC-Lavalin's criminal prosecution."" It called on the prime minister to appear at a two-hour televised committee under oath sometime before Mar. 15.

The motion was defeated in the Commons this evening.

During a news conference on Parliament Hill Monday, Scheer described the SNC-Lavalin affair as an unprecedented attempt to alter the course of justice through political interference.

""Politicians don't get to execute our justice system,"" he said.

""What we've seen unfold over the last two weeks is a textbook case of government corruption, with those at the very top of the Prime Minister's Office implicated in what could be the obstruction of justice.""

It's rare for a prime minister to appear before a committee.

On Sept. 7, 2006, then-prime minister Stephen Harper appeared before a special committee on Senate reform.

Former prime ministers have occasionally appeared before Commons committee hearings. Former prime minister Paul Martin appeared before a committee on the Kelowna Accord on Nov. 9, 2006 and Brian Mulroney spoke before a committee looking into the Airbus settlement on Dec. 13, 2007.

Last week, Canada's top civil servant Michael Wernick told the justice committee that he warned Wilson-Raybould that there would be economic ""consequences"" from prosecuting SNC-Lavalin, including big job losses. But he maintained that he, Trudeau and officials in the Prime Minister's Office did not impose any inappropriate pressure on the minister.

Trudeau said Friday that Wernick is an ""extraordinary public servant"" who has served Canada with ""integrity and brilliance.""

""I would recommend that people pay close heed to the words of the clerk of the Privy Council,"" the PM said. ""His service to this country over decades in the public service leaves him well-positioned to understand what institutions are grounded in, and make sure that we're doing the right things as a government.""

In September 2018, the government amended the Criminal Code to allow for remediation agreements, enabling prosecutors to use them as an alternative to a criminal trial ""at their discretion to address specified economic crimes if they consider it to be in the public interest and appropriate in the circumstances,"" according to the Department of Justice website.

If the accused organization upholds the terms and conditions of the agreement, charges can be stayed and a criminal prosecution avoided.

Shawcross doctrine

According to the government website, the purpose of remediation agreements is to denounce wrongdoing and hold the organization to account, while reducing harm to innocent employees, shareholders and other third parties. The organization would have to accept responsibility for the wrongdoing and pay a financial penalty.

In the case of SNC-Lavalin, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada opted not to pursue a remediation agreement and chose instead to proceed with prosecution. It advised the company of that decision on Sept. 4, 2018.

Wilson-Raybould, as attorney general at the time, had authority to override the decision and halt prosecution. Wernick confirmed last week several meetings were held on the topic — including a telephone call on Dec. 19 he initiated, during which he warned Wilson-Raybould of the economic consequences of prosecuting a company that employs about 9,000 people.

He insisted there was never ""inappropriate"" interference.

According to the so-called Shawcross doctrine, the attorney general must consider the impact of prosecution on the public interest. The attorney general can consult with cabinet colleagues, but those discussions are limited to hearing advice, not receiving directions.

Delay advising investors

Arguing in favour of calling Trudeau to speak to the committee, Conservative justice critic and deputy leader Lisa Raitt said it's in the public interest to have the prime minister testify in order to bring together the various threads of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Raitt also asked why SNC-Lavalin was told of the prosecutor's decision on Sept. 4 but didn't disclose that information to its shareholders until Oct. 10.

""Who in the Prime Minister's Office, what cabinet minister, or even did the prime minister give assurances to SNC-Lavalin that they would not have to disclose a material fact to their shareholders because they were going to sort it all out?"" she asked.

Five legal experts appeared before the committee today; some couched their comments by saying they don't have all the facts yet.

Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond is a senior associate counsel at Woodward and Company LLP and a professor at the Peter Allard School of Law, University of British Columbia. She told the committee the law imposes limits on anyone trying to influence an attorney general acting in the role of chief prosecutor.

'Crisis' in rule of law

""Those engaging in that must point to lawful authority that actually backs up their actions, and I would say the Shawcross doctrine is a flimsy authority,"" she said.

Turpel-Lafond said she believes it's important to hear from all of those involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair, not just Wilson-Raybould, because the situation is escalating to the level of a ""crisis in the rule of law.""

She said the RCMP integrity unit could investigate the matter — if it isn't doing so already — to determine if there was a ""subtext"" to the discussions between various officials and Wilson-Raybould regarding the criminal prosecution.

""If there's evidence that a prosecutor is fired and there was an attempt to influence or direct her attention to something that didn't have lawful authority, then it does raise the spectre of obstruction of justice, because obstruction of justice requires this sort of fear-favour element,"" she said.

Maxime St-Hilaire, associate professor at the Faculty of Law, Université de Sherbrooke, said he finds it difficult to understand how information conveyed to an attorney general would be useful after a decision had been made to not overturn a prosecution.

""If there are cabinet discussions after that decision has been made, then I find that quite difficult to understand,"" he said.

393,Empty,2019-03-05T01:10:07Z,Latest departure is another setback for a prime minister who came to power promising more accountability in politics.,"In a serious blow to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a second member of his cabinet in Canada resigned saying she had lost confidence in how the government had dealt with an escalating political scandal.

The departure of recently appointed Treasury Board President Jane Philpott, who was in charge of government spending, deprives Trudeau of another powerful female member of cabinet just months before an election that polls show he could lose.

Philpott expressed unhappiness about the government's response to allegations that officials inappropriately pressured former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help major construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial.

""Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised,"" Philpott said in a statement. ""I have concluded that I must resign as a member of cabinet.""

Trudeau told a Liberal Party rally in Toronto he was disappointed but understood why she had left.

""Concerns of this nature must be taken seriously and I can ensure you that I am,"" said Trudeau, who did not specifically address Philpott's stated reasons for leaving. He also thanked her for serving in his cabinet - something he notably did not do when Wilson-Raybould quit.

Philpott is a close friend of Wilson-Raybould, who herself resigned on February 12 after she was unexpectedly demoted in January. Wilson-Raybould said last week she was convinced her refusal to help SNC-Lavalin was behind the demotion.

Trudeau has insisted he made clear to her the ""decision around SNC-Lavalin was Wilson-Raybould's and hers alone to make"".

'Total chaos'

Andrew Scheer, head of the official opposition Conservative Party, repeated calls for Trudeau to quit amid ""ethical rot"" he said was undermining the rule of law.

""Jane Philpott's resignation from cabinet clearly demonstrates a government in total chaos led by a disgraced prime minister consumed with scandal and focused only on his political survival,"" Scheer told reporters in Toronto.

The departure of Philpott is another setback for a prime minister who came to power in November 2015 promising ""sunny ways"", more accountability in politics, and a greater number of female ministers.

""What should be worrisome for the Trudeau Liberals is that the two cabinet resignations have been on issues of principle and ethics,"" said Nanos Research pollster Nik Nanos.

""The second resignation begs the question - what did happen and could there be more resignations,"" he said by email.

Philpott, 58, was widely regarded as one of the best of Trudeau's cabinet ministers. She had previously served as minister of health and minister of indigenous services.","In major blow to Canada's PM Trudeau, second minister quits",Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/03/major-blow-canada-pm-trudeau-minister-quits-190305004901305.html

OTTAWA—The Trudeau government has refused an opposition demand to recall Parliament to deal with the SNC-Lavalin affair, and is setting the stage to counter Jody Wilson-Raybould’s allegations of improper political meddling in the company’s criminal trial.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, however, will be far from Ottawa as the MPs look into the allegations.

Cameron Ahmad, a spokesman for the prime minister, said Friday the government has no intention of recalling the Commons, but will continue to cooperate and watch the work of the Commons justice committee as it probes the affair.

The House of Commons has risen for a two-week break, but the opposition parties say Trudeau owes the country a detailed explanation of his actions.

He is expected to attend a climate-change rally in Toronto Monday evening, the start of a number of events planned across the country next week in which his office says he will talk to Canadians about his “ climate action ” incentive plan — which the Conservatives call a “carbon tax.”

“If what is alleged is true, it is, indeed, worrisome that someone pressured her and that worries me a lot,” said Quebec provincial justice minister Sonia Lebel, who was the chief prosecutor for the Charbonneau commission into corruption in that province.

Wilson-Raybould’s testimony has captivated the interest of Canadians unlike many inside-Ottawa stories. It’s shifted the conversation even in Quebec in newspaper editorial pages and beyond, where initially there had been sympathy for the company’s arguments.

The federal opposition parties intend to keep the focus on Wilson-Raybould’s stunning allegations.

In their letter to Trudeau, they slammed his failure to address the questions she raised.

“So far, your only defence is to disagree with Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s justice committee testimony, but you have thus far failed to provide Canadians with your account of these events. This is absolutely unacceptable,” wrote Scheer and Singh.

“You also continue to hide behind the Ethics Commmisioner, who, as you are aware, has no mandate whatsoever to investigate political interference into criminal proceedings.

“As the leaders of Canada’s two main opposition parties, we stand united in our belief that you owe Canadians nothing less than full transparency in this matter.”

Despite the break in parliamentary sittings, the Commons justice committee will reconvene Wednesday to hear testimony by Trudeau’s former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who resigned and denied wrongdoing in the SNC-Lavalin case.

Butts is expected to offer the first account by a key political actor on Trudeau’s side, of the government’s dealings with the former attorney-general.

The committee has previously heard a partial account from Michael Wernick, clerk of the privy council and a supposedly non-partisan public servant, but has yet to hear from anyone on the political staff in the Prime Minister’s Office.

Wernick and deputy justice minister Nathalie Drouin will also reappear to answer questions raised by Wilson-Raybould.

Butts is almost as high as it gets.

So far, the Liberal-dominated justice committee has refused opposition requests to call Trudeau’s chief of staff Katie Telford, among others, who were fingered by Wilson-Raybould in a list of 11 people she suggested were acting to pressure her.

In an exhaustive account Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould laid out the “sustained” efforts, including what she said were “veiled threats” by the prime minister through his representatives to persuade her to overrule the public prosecutions director and offer to mediate criminal charges against the Quebec engineering and construction company.

The Vancouver MP, who remains in Trudeau’s Liberal caucus for now, says she resisted what she called their inappropriate “political and partisan” pressure, and said she believes she was moved out of her job as justice minister and attorney general as a result — all of which the prime minister denies.

The prime minister, meanwhile, has now “familiarized himself” with all of her testimony, and has not yet made a decision on her future in the caucus, his office said.

On Friday, one of Trudeau’s ministers from Quebec, where SNC-Lavalin is headquartered, promoted the kind of deal SNC-Lavalin is seeking to settle criminal charges — that Wilson-Raybould had expressly refused.

Marie-Claude Bibeau emerged from Rideau Hall as the new — and first female — minister of agriculture and said “deferred prosecution agreements” are a “tool,” not a way to escape blame.

“A deferred prosecution agreement is not a free ride,” said Bibeau.

“It’s a way to provide for justice, but to punish people differently in terms of any individuals who are responsible and the corporation, while, at the same time, protecting innocent parties, such as employees, retirees, partners and suppliers.”

Bibeau repeated the prime minister’s claim that his government is obliged to consider “9,000 jobs” he says are in play. She upped the ante, saying that “when you include suppliers in the equation, we’re talking about as many as 100,000 people across Canada who are affected.”

“So I do think we have to look at all the options within the proper legal framework and the budget.”

The Quebec company is charged with bribery and fraud in a Libyan payment scheme to win contracts from Moammar Gadhafi’s regime. It wants to negotiate an agreement that would allow the company to avoid a potential criminal conviction and federal contracting ban in exchange for an admission of wrongdoing, a steep fine and corporate reforms and independent oversight.

It has gone to court to seek judicial review of the decision by the director of public prosecutions — Wilson-Raybould upheld this — to deny it a remediation or deferred prosecution agreement.

A Federal Court judge has reserved her decision on the company’s challenge.

In the meantime the preliminary inquiry into the criminal charges resumes April 1.

While talking to journalists in Montreal, Trudeau, who is the leader of the ruling Liberal Party of Canada, made it clear that he would not resign, despite demands from the opposition. He added that he would carefully read the allegations of the former Prosecutor General that numerous officials from his administration tried to force her to intervene to help the Montreal firm avoid criminal proceedings.

According to Wilson-Raybould's testimony, cited by AP, she asked Trudeau if he was politically interfering with her role as attorney general and told him she would strongly advise against it.

Liberal MPs, heading into a crucial re-election campaign, …","Jody Wilson-Raybould said she wanted to tell her truth on the SNC-Lavalin story. The story she told Wednesday at the Commons justice committee is so vastly different from everything the prime minister has said until now that the two versions simply can't be reconciled.

The former attorney general spoke of veiled threats if she didn't intervene in the criminal prosecution of the giant Montreal construction firm. She spoke of constant and sustained efforts over a four-month period last fall by some of the most powerful people in government to ensure SNC-Lavalin avoided a trial.

The pressure began right at the top, she said, starting with Justin Trudeau, his top adviser and the country's most senior bureaucrat.

All of them have denied doing, saying or counselling her to do anything improper.

Wilson-Raybould, citing from memory and what she called her ""copious"" note-taking, gave a very different view.

Disagreeing is, of course, part of any political discussion. But this is no ordinary disagreement over policy. This dispute exposes a clear rift inside cabinet, and inside the Liberal caucus.

'I was taken aback'

In her testimony, Wilson-Raybould said the interventions, in some ten phone calls and an equal number of meetings, played on similar themes: SNC-Lavalin would pull out of Quebec. Jobs would be lost. She was pushed, on a number of occasions, to get an outside legal opinion.

Most significantly, Wilson-Raybould said she was told by Justin Trudeau on Sept. 17 that refusing to give the company the option of entering into a remediation agreement instead of standing trial would go over badly in Quebec, home to his own riding, where a provincial election was underway.

""I was taken aback,"" Wilson-Raybould told the committee in her nearly 40-minute opening statement.

""My response, and I remember this vividly, was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye. I asked 'are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.""

WATCH | Wilson-Raybould says she experienced 'sustained pressure' on SNC-Lavalin

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the gov't to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion..."" 1:08

Trudeau, she added, said that wasn't his goal. That much, at least, is consistent with the prime minister's repeated statements that he assured her the decision on whether SNC-Lavalin is prosecuted was hers to make, and hers alone.

Except the efforts to get her to change her mind didn't end there, Wilson-Raybould said Wednesday, nor were they confined to the prime minister.

Wilson-Raybould stood her ground. She would not interfere. Less than a month later, she was out as attorney general, shuffled off to Veterans Affairs.

For a prime minister who has spent much of the past three weeks talking about his government's respect for democratic institutions, for the rule of law, Wilson-Raybould's testimony is more than her finally giving her side of a ""he said, she said.""

Her testimony gave Canadians a carefully constructed timeline, based on her own memory, detailed notes and transcripts of texts. Her testimony also gave the Opposition a political cudgel, which Conservative leader Andrew Scheer immediately seized as he called for a probe by the RCMP.

Canadians now have two dramatically different versions of what happened. Liberal MPs, heading into a crucial re-election campaign, are already choosing sides.

Challenged by her colleagues

At committee, Wilson-Raybould found herself in the odd position of being supported by opposition MPs on the committee, and challenged by her own colleagues in a hearing that featured six rounds of questions, lasting nearly four hours.

Liberal MPs peppered her with questions. Why didn't she resign last fall if she felt she was being pressured to override the decision to prosecute for political reasons? Why didn't she go the prime minister to complain? Does she still have confidence in the prime minister?

Conservatives and New Democrats praised her courage for speaking out.

""We have witnessed not a lesson in politics but a lesson in integrity,"" said New Democrat MP Charlie Angus.

The political bombshell launched Wednesday by Jody Wilson-Raybould created new possibilities and pitfalls in the ramp-up to a federal election, say senior strategists.

“It does sound a bit shrill and predictable,” says Watt. “I think they pulled the alarm.

For the Tories, the gift of Liberal scandal delivered by the then attorney-general’s allegations of political interference against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his staff prompted a swift call by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer for Trudeau’s resignation. Wilson-Raybould told a Commons committee about “sustained” efforts to persuade her to overrule the public prosecutions director and offer to mediate criminal charges against the giant Quebec firm SNC-Lavalin .

“He’ll have to backfill with highly specific reasons and explanations for why that is the appropriate remedy … I think he’s going to have to come out with a much more lawyerly attack on the prime minister’s behaviour.”

“I don’t think public opinion is set on this. There presumably are other shoes to drop that we can’t see right now.”

There remains much unknown about what happened — and a long way to go before the October election date — for any certainty on how much Wednesday’s bombshell will reshape Ottawa’s political landscape. With only one side of the story told in detail so far, the narrative is still in flux and possibilities for new revelations very much in play, says Watt.

So Scheer’s challenge, says Watt, is keeping momentum and turning the rather arcane rule-of-law subtleties of attorney-general independence into an election issue for Canadians focused on jobs, health care and raising their children.

“We’ve seen lots of shooting stars where the parliamentary press gallery is running around saying this government is going down. They light up and disappear. Mr. Scheer has got to keep the focus on this. He has to use this to show the prime minister is not who you thought he was. That’s where this can be enterprise-threatening.”

Rather than demanding the prime minister’s head, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called for a public inquiry “that would have independence to assess the truth.”

Solid strategy, assesses Robin V. Sears, a longtime NDP strategist who runs Earnscliffe Strategy Group in Ottawa.

“The problem with Mr. Scheer’s response is where does he go from here? Should Trudeau jump off a cliff? Jagmeet and his advisers were smart because they’ve now got a vehicle in which they can keep dropping evidence to argue for a public inquiry step by step.”

Trudeau’s response to Wilson-Raybould’s forensic, detailed deconstruction of meetings and conversations have amounted to sound-bite dismissals made during other announcements. That decision not to address any of the substantive allegations in similar fashion is a curiosity, says Sears.

“A little contrition would have gone a long way. I think there’s just a sense of chaos around the centre of the government … I don’t get the sense there’s a strategic plan being executed.”

And consider, he says, that it was all easily avoided.

“It was entirely predictable that when they dumped Jody, she would seek revenge. Had anyone given any thought to that? Obviously not. This is really amateurish communications management.”

So what of the Liberal fortunes?

“I don’t know how the story goes away for a long time,” says Penny Collenette, a former Liberal organizer and law professor at the University of Ottawa. “I think people really want the truth. If there’s two truths, then Canadians are smart. They’ll figure it out. They’ll decide. Everybody needs to know what happened and what went on.”

For her part, Collenette called Wilson-Raybould’s testimony “very credible, very honest. The detail is what made her very believable.”

But any notions that Wilson-Raybould’s political flame throwing could bring down the government are dramatically premature, political watchers agree.

“Prime ministers are very resilient people, believe me,” said Collenette. Wilson-Raybould “has said she wants to remain. And if the tent is large enough to keep her there, that would be terrific.”

One-off incidents like this typically don’t have enough oxygen to support sustained public outrage required to topple a government, said Watt.

“You have to have a pattern. Will it reduce the majority? Almost certainly. And if this becomes a pattern or triggers a series of leaks and brown envelopes, that’s much more problematic. That’s when you’ve got a problem.”

Andrew Scheer said late on Wednesday that Trudeau ""has lost moral authority to govern"" and ""must resign"" at once.

""Mr Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation,"" he added.

For weeks, Trudeau's government has been rocked by allegations first reported by The Globe and Mail newspaper that undue pressure was put on Jody Wilson-Raybould, the country's former attorney general, for an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin.

Earlier on Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould accused Trudeau's inner circle of pressuring her to defer the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, one of the world's top construction and engineering firms based in Montreal.

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin,"" Wilson-Raybould told a committee in the House of Commons.

She also told the committee that she faced ""veiled threats"" and advice from Canada's top bureaucrat, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, that ""a collision with the prime minister on these matters should be avoided"".

Wilson-Raybould, who was also minister of justice, said she believes she was shuffled to another portfolio in January over her refusal to take action in the case.

Trudeau responded that he ""completely disagrees with the former attorney general's characterisation of events"".

When asked about calls for his resignation, Trudeau told reporters on Wednesday that ""Canadians will have a very clear choice in a few months time about who they want to be prime minister of this country and what party they want to form government"". Parliamentary elections are scheduled for October.

On Thursday, Trudeau won the public support of a top political ally, indicating there was no immediate pressure inside the Liberal Party to remove him.

""I have 100 percent faith in the prime minister,"" said Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, one of the most prominent members of Trudeau's Cabinet.

Alleged bribery

SNC-Lavalin was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Muammar Gaddafi's reign.

The firm, its international arm and another subsidiary are accused of having offered $36m in bribes to officials and of defrauding the Libyan government of $98m.

The charges relate to the world's largest irrigation project - the Great Man Made River Project, which aimed to provide fresh water to the cities of Tripoli, Benghazi and Sirte.

SNC-Lavalin has argued that those responsible for alleged wrongdoing left it long ago, and that holding it accountable for their criminal actions would severely hurt its business.

The company heavily lobbied the government, including senior officials in Trudeau's office, for an out-of-court settlement that would include paying a fine and agreeing to put in place compliance measures.

Trial set to proceed

But Wilson-Raybould refused to ask prosecutors to settle, and the trial is set to proceed.

She quit Trudeau's cabinet earlier this month. Trudeau's longtime friend and principal secretary Gerry Butts also resigned days later. Questions remain over their specific reasons for leaving.

Trudeau has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing, saying again Wednesday that he had made clear to his former attorney general that the ""decision around SNC-Lavalin was Jody Wilson-Raybould's and hers alone to make"", which she confirmed in her testimony.

""I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,"" he said.

Wilson-Raybould testified, ""The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution for SNC, citing that if there is no DPA (deferred prosecution agreement), there would be many jobs lost and that SNC would move from Montreal.""

She added, ""I told him that I had done my due diligence and had made up my mind on SNC and that I was not going to interfere with the decision of the director (of public prosecutions).""

Wilson-Raybould went on to say that 11 government officials, including the finance minister, raised similar concerns that SNC-Lavalin might move its headquarters to London without a deal, or could face massive job losses if it was found guilty at trial - in an election year.

They ""urged me to take partisan political considerations into account, which was clearly improper,"" she said.

She added that they continued to ""hound"" her from September to December after she made her decision not to offer SNC-Lavalin a deal and had made it known.

If the fallout from alleged interference by the Prime Minister’s Office in criminal proceedings against SNC-Lavalin and last week’s testimony from former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould on the matter to the Commons Justice Committee looked to be ongoing, however, Trudeau resolutely stayed on message at the Music Hall. (“It shouldn’t be free to pollute anywhere in the country”). But he did acknowledge the elephant thundering about the room off the top of his speech.

“While I am disappointed, I understand her decision to step down and I want to thank her for her service,” he said of Philpott, who removed herself from her position as Treasury Board president on Monday, saying she had “lost confidence” in the Trudeau government over its handling of the SNC-Lavalin matter. Trudeau was praising her efforts in removing boil-water advisories on reserves, pursuing “next gen” solutions for Phoenix pay system and for her work on climate change when the first protester of the evening piped up to call attention to a potential crack in the Liberal’s climate-action plan: the Canadian government’s acquisition of the soon-to-be-expanded Trans-Mountain pipeline. Those pipeline plans have caused a disconnect between the government’s professed desire to repair institutional relations with Indigenous peoples, and the unwillingness of many of those peoples to let pipelines pass through their territories. “I remember when you bought a pipeline!” “Stop Canadian genocide!” Such cries erupted often during Trudeau’s speech, and a proper shoving match ensued on the floor when a protester threw what appeared to be a scarf towards the podium.

“That’s what democracy is about: the opportunity to share a wide variety of opinions,” said Trudeau, keeping his cool during the flare-ups but also tilting a little more loudly and decisively towards electioneering mode as the evening wore on and such Liberal accomplishments as the child tax benefit and “the lowest unemployment in 40 years” crept into the script. Still, overall, the evening’s refrain was that the Liberals are the only federal party in a real position to do something against the forces of climate change and “we don’t have a moment to spare.” Ontario Premier Doug Ford — a noted public enemy of the Liberal carbon tax — did get a veiled acknowledgement in the PM’s remark that forward thinking on solving the problem of climate change “is not about fighting progress in court,” but most of Trudeau’s environmental ire on the night was reserved for Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer.

“And yet, in spite of the evidence, some politicians still don’t get it. Believe it or not, there are some who think we should do nothing on climate change,” said Trudeau. “It was in April of last year that Andrew Scheer announced he would soon be unveiling his climate-change plan. Well, here we are in March of 2019 — 309 days later — and he has released nothing ... “If you don’t have a plan for climate change, then you don’t have a plan for the economy and you certainly don’t have a plan for Canada’s future.” Trudeau left swiftly and did not make himself available to the many reporters with questions about things other than the Liberal climate-action plan on their minds.

403,Empty,2019-03-01T09:00:00Z,"As the Conservatives make a formal request for the RCMP to launch a criminal investigation following Jody Wilson-Raybould's testimony in the SNC-Lavalin affair, the legal community remains mixed on whether there was actually an obstruction of justice.","Many words have been tossed around to describe the allegations that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould in the SNC-Lavalin affair: bombshell, shocking, explosive, inappropriate.

But one word could take this scandal from a House of Commons committee room to a courtroom: illegal.

In the mad dash following Wilson-Raybould's dazzling testimony before the House of Commons justice committee Wednesday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer held a news conference calling for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to launch a criminal investigation into the government's actions.

""I was sickened and appalled by her story of inappropriate and, frankly, illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest officials of Justin Trudeau's government,"" he told reporters Wednesday night.

Scheer followed up Thursday with a letter to RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki, citing sections of the Criminal Code related to provoking fear in an attorney general and obstructing or defeating the course of justice.

""She confirmed veiled threats of consequences if she did not bend to the political wishes of the Liberal Party and the financial interests of the shareholders of SNC-Lavalin. It was also clear that these actions rose to the highest ranks of the government,"" he wrote.

While clearly upset by her government's handling of the file, Wilson-Raybould, who was at one point Canada's most senior lawyer, clearly disagrees something criminal occurred.

In front of the committee she was asked multiple times if the pressure exerted on her broke the law.

""In my opinion, it's not illegal,"" she told the committee.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould highlighted ten important interactions in the SNC-Lavalin affair during her bombshell testimony before the House of Commons Justice Committee. 4:53

For legal animals in Ottawa, it's been a neck-aching round of whiplash trying to figure out who is right.

""Neither opinion settles the matter,"" said Ottawa-based defence lawyer Michael Spratt. ""It's not clearly not obstruction.""

According to the Criminal Code, obstructing justice covers ""everyone who wilfully attempts in any manner … to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice.""

In her testimony, Wilson-Raybould said she faced intense political pressure and veiled threats related to the SNC-Lavalin affair, and was warned directly by Trudeau about the negative consequences if the company faced prosecution. SNC-Lavalin was facing corruption charges for contracts in Libya and was lobbying for a remediation agreement as an alternative to criminal prosecution.

Examine the case, Conservative MacKay says

Former Conservative justice minister Peter MacKay said there's enough from Wilson-Raybould's testimony to warrant further examination — either through a public inquiry or a criminal investigation.

""What's happened here is that somebody in the office gave her the impression there would be consequences if she was not to follow the instructions, and when that didn't happen we know that she did lose her job,"" he said.

""I come back to the definition of the Criminal Code section which speaks of perverting justice, it speaks of interference, it speaks of in some way trying to shape the outcome of a prosecution, and the elements appear to be there.""

Criminal defence lawyer Joseph Neuberger said an obstruction of justice charge wouldn't be hard to prove in court. He pointed to a meeting Gerry Butts, the prime minister's former principal secretary, had with Wilson-Raybould's trusted chief of staff Jessica Prince where he allegedly said, ""There is no solution here that doesn't involve some interference.""

""If that is not a smoking gun when it comes to actual interference and obstruction, I don't know what is,"" said Neuberger.

""This has stepped over the bounds of inappropriate; it has certainly crossed into the realm of criminal conduct.""

Spratt said he doesn't think the case is a ""slam dunk,"" for police and prosecutors, but ""it's starting to sound a lot like obstruction.""

Canadian Civil Liberties Association executive director Michael Bryant, who in the first few days of the scandal called for a police investigation, now says this issue isn't as clear cut.

""The evidence for obstruction of justice requires evidence of intent. So you need to have evidence of the prime minister intended to obstruct justice, and we didn't hear any of that,"" he said Thursday.

""I don't think that we should politicize a criminal investigation by the RCMP any more than we should criminalize a prosecutorial decision against SNC-Lavalin. I don't think it's for Parliament to be telling the police what to do.""

Nothing criminal, Liberal Cotler says

It's a view shared, in part, by Irwin Cotler, another former justice minister.

""I don't see anything criminal going on,"" the former Liberal cabinet minister said. ""I do think that what's been happening here is really a reflection of the ongoing dynamics between the offices of the minister of justice, the other members of cabinet and her responsibilities as attorney general.""

Cotler, who has advocated for the roles of attorney general and justice minister be separated, said it's possible officials with the Prime Minister's Office, Privy Council Office and minister of finance didn't intend to exert inappropriate direction on Wilson-Raybould, but over time it felt like concentrated and sustained pressure.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould referred to it as ""a barrage of people hounding me and my staff.""

""I know this may sound somewhat, perhaps, speaking paradoxically when I say that both sides may be telling the truth, but that was my feeling that she was really telling it as she saw it, as she experienced it,"" said Cotler.

Watch the explainer below on the key players in the SNC-Lavalin controversy:

A Power & Politics explainer. 2:26

The RCMP, as expected, won't comment on the calls for an investigation, but the force did acknowledge it's reviewing Scheer's letter.

""The RCMP does not confirm or deny the existence of a criminal investigation unless charges would be laid,"" said a spokesperson.

For his part, Trudeau said no one from his team has been questioned by RCMP officers.

""We have confidence in the processes in place. The justice committee is pursuing its study, and we will of course respect the independence and indeed the work of the committee"" he told reporters Thursday.

""We will also look very closely and participate fully in the ethics commissioner's investigation into this.""

Former AGs weigh in

Meanwhile, late Thursday, two former federal attorneys general — MacKay, who served in the role under former prime minister Stephen Harper, and Douglas Grinslade Lewis, who served under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney — penned a letter to the RCMP asking for a police investigation into the matter.

The letter was also signed by three former provincial attorneys general: Jonathan Denis, Progressive Conservative, from Alberta; Cecil Clarke, Progressive Conservative, from Nova Scotia; and Colin Gableman, NDP, from British Columbia.",Legal community mixed on whether SNC-Lavalin scandal warrants criminal probe,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-investigation-obstruction-quetions-1.5037252

It’s clear Wilson-Raybould was removed from her position as justice minister for “doing her job,” said Mary-Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a former Saskatchewan provincial court judge who currently teaches and practises law.

“It’s fair to say it’s a constitutional crisis,” Turpel-Lafond said Wednesday night, invoking a term often used to describe the breakdown of the rules underpinning a system of government. The events, as outlined by Wilson-Raybould in marathon testimony before the House of Commons justice committee, “shake the foundations of our very system,” Turpel-Lafond said. Wilson-Raybould told MPs she was repeatedly and inappropriately pressured by senior members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s staff, as well as the country’s top bureaucrat, to cut a deal for SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal trial on charges of fraud and corruption.

Wilson-Raybould refused, and found herself shuffled to a different cabinet portfolio in January. Former Ontario attorney general Michael Bryant agreed the scandal amounts to a constitutional crisis, saying Trudeau seems insistent on “interfering with the prosecution.”

“That conflicts with a system that requires independence from political influence. It opens the door to prosecuting enemies of the government and giving immunity to its friends which is despotic,” Bryant, who is now the executive director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, told the Star. He said the actions of the PMO, as laid out by Wilson-Raybould, undermine public faith in the independence of the judicial process. In the fallout from Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau and Michael Wernick, the clerk of the privy council, to resign. Irwin Cotler, a former Liberal attorney general of Canada, said he doesn’t believe Trudeau should step down or that “there was an intent on the part of the government to cross the line.” “I believe that they felt they were asking her to engage in what they believed was a matter of public policy for the importance of Canada and the importance of Quebec, jobs and the like, which she acknowledged was OK,” Cotler said. But at a minimum, Turpel-Lafond said the RCMP’s integrity section must investigate, noting that 11 highly placed people in the PMO, the public service and cabinet were named by Wilson-Raybould as lobbying her or her staff on the issue. “The consequences for that is that our reputation as a nation of the rule of law will be in tatters if we do not take steps,” Turpel-Lafond said. “And the steps need to be significant, decisive.” Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

The poll by Forum Research, provided exclusively to the Star, included 1,301 randomly selected Canadian adults who responded to an interactive telephone survey on Wednesday and Thursday — the day of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s stunning justice committee testimony in Ottawa and the day after.

A majority of respondents — 55 per cent — said they could “confidently explain the situation related to the Prime Minister´s Office and SNC Lavalin,” including 27 per cent who said they can “very confidently” explain it. Meanwhile, 57 per cent said the situation has “worsened” their opinion of Trudeau, versus 36 per cent who said it has had “no effect” and 7 per cent who said their view of the prime minister has been improved by the situation. Results of the poll are considered accurate +/- 3 per cent, 19 times out of 20.

The controversy erupted Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail reported that officials in the Prime Minister’s Office pressured the former attorney general to intervene in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin to strike a mediation deal with the global engineering and construction giant that is based in Montreal. Trudeau and his office have repeatedly denied there was inappropriate pressure, while Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick — Canada’s top bureaucrat who works directly with the prime minister — has acknowledged Wilson-Raybould came under pressure to make the “right” decision on whether or not to halt the SNC-Lavalin prosecution. Trudeau and his government have said the company employs thousands of Canadians and that they wanted to consider the impact of a criminal conviction — which could include a 10-year ban from lucrative government contracts — on the multinational corporation.

On Wednesday, after Trudeau agreed to partially lift cabinet confidentiality and solicitor-client privilege that prevented her from speaking publicly about the matter, Wilson-Raybould accused the prime minister and his top officials of a “consistent and sustained” campaign over four months to pressure her into suspending the SNC-Lavalin prosecution. While she said she does not believe the pressure amounted to criminal interference in a judicial decision, Wilson-Raybould said it made her feel “a very heightened level of anxiety” and that it was “entirely political and entirely inappropriate.” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has called on Trudeau and Wernick to resign, and wrote to the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police calling for a criminal investigation. Five former attorneys generals from Conservative and NDP governments added their voices to that call Thursday night. On Friday, after Trudeau shuffled existing members of his cabinet to fill the spot left by Wilson-Raybould when she resigned in the wake of the controversy, Scheer and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called on Trudeau to cancel the scheduled parliamentary break next week so that MPs can remain in Ottawa to hold the government to account on Wilson-Raybould’s testimony. The NDP and Green party have called for a public inquiry, but Trudeau and the Liberals have said they are confident hearings at the Commons justice committee and an investigation by the House of Commons conflict of interest commissioner can determine what happened. Bozinoff, the Forum president, said that while the majority of respondents to his poll said the situation has soured their view of Trudeau, it is not clear how that will affect the federal election this fall. That’s because of regional differences in the results, he said. Regional breakdowns, which have much lower sample sizes, indicate that 76 per cent of respondents from Alberta said the situation has worsened their view of Trudeau, compared with 52 per cent in Ontario and 48 per cent in Quebec. Bozinoff said the controversy may be mostly turning off people who weren’t going to support the Trudeau team anyway. “So far, this thing is reinforcing — I think — people’s previously held opinions, he said. At the same time, he noted that 59 per cent said the situation will impact how they vote this fall, including 36 per cent who said it will have a “strong impact” on their vote. “This thing is ongoing and who knows what’s going to happen.

The allegations by Jody Wils…,"The leader of Canada’s main opposition party Wednesday demanded Prime Minister Justin Trudeau quit after a former justice minister said government officials inappropriately pressured her to help a major firm avoid a bribery trial.

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould dramatically deepened the biggest crisis of Trudeau’s tenure just months ahead of an October election in which his Liberals face a tough fight.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that she had confronted Trudeau over what she called inappropriate pressure to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. evade a corruption trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, demanded the resignation of what he called a disgraced prime minister.

“He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,” Scheer told reporters, calling for police to immediately probe the matter. Trudeau was to address reporters later Wednesday.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed “consistent and sustained pressure” on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

“In my view, these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter and that this pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,” she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould, who named several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister.

Trudeau and other officials deny inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould. But the case forced the resignation of Trudeau’s principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

Philpott…","By David Ljunggren and Julie Gordon

OTTAWA (Reuters) - In a serious blow to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a second member of his Cabinet resigned on Monday, saying she had lost confidence in how the government had dealt with an escalating political scandal.

The departure of recently appointed Treasury Board President Jane Philpott, who was in overall charge of government spending, deprives Trudeau of another powerful female Cabinet minister just months ahead of an election that polls show he could lose.

Philpott expressed unhappiness about the government's response to allegations that officials inappropriately pressured former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help major construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial.

""Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised,"" Philpott said in a statement.

Trudeau told a Liberal Party rally in Toronto that he was disappointed but understood why she had left.

""Concerns of this nature must be taken seriously and I can ensure you that I am,"" said Trudeau, who did not specifically address Philpott's stated reasons for leaving. He also thanked her for serving in his Cabinet - something he notably did not do when Wilson-Raybould quit.

Philpott is a close friend of Wilson-Raybould, who resigned on Feb. 12 after she was unexpectedly demoted in January. Wilson-Raybould said last week she was convinced her refusal to help SNC-Lavalin was behind the demotion.

Andrew Scheer, head of the official opposition Conservative Party, repeated calls for Trudeau to quit amid the ""ethical rot"" he said was undermining the rule of law.

The departure of Philpott, who was appointed on Jan. 14, is another setback for a prime minister who came to power in November 2015 promising ""sunny ways,"" more accountability in politics and a greater number of women ministers.

""What should be worrisome for the Trudeau Liberals is that the two Cabinet resignations have been on issues of principle and ethics,"" said Nanos Research pollster Nik Nanos.

""The second resignation begs the question – what did happen and could there be more resignations,"" he said by email.

SIGNS OF STRAIN

Other members of the government, including Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, said they would stay in the Cabinet.

Philpott said evidence of efforts by politicians and officials to pressure Wilson-Raybould had raised serious concerns. Wilson-Raybould tweeted to Philpott that ""you are a leader of vision and strength and I look forward to continuing to work alongside you.""

Philpott, 58, was widely regarded as one of the best of Trudeau's Cabinet ministers. She previously served as minister of health and minister of indigenous services.

Most Liberal members of parliament have so far backed Trudeau but there are signs of strain.

Legislator Wayne Long said he was ""deeply troubled"" by Philpott's departure and called for a full public inquiry into the matter, something Trudeau has rejected.

Celina Caesar-Chavannes, a parliamentarian who is not seeking re-election, tweeted that ""when you add women, please do not expect the status quo. Expect us to make correct decisions, stand for what is right and exit when values are compromised.""

Gerald Butts, who quit as Trudeau's principal secretary last month over the SNC-Lavalin affair, will testify to the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday.

In her testimony to the committee last week, Wilson-Raybould singled out Butts as one official who tried particularly hard to change her mind. Under questioning, she said she did not consider officials had broken any laws.

409,Empty,2019-03-05T23:19:33Z,The SNC-Lavalin affair has reduced the Liberals to a risky strategem: betting their opponents are a bigger turn-off than they are The post ‘The other guys suck’ is not a campaign platform appeared first on Macleans.ca.,"Monday afternoon’s cabinet resignation by Jane Philpott plunged Justin Trudeau deeper into the most rapidly festering crisis of his government’s term. On Monday evening, Trudeau sought refuge by time-travelling back to the fall of 2015, when he was pluckily racing from third place to first, and when SNC-Lavalin was still a bribery-marred infrastructure giant that at least didn’t help create existential problems for his political career.

Here was slightly retro Trudeau, now Prime Minister but still with red tie loosened under an open collar button, white sleeves rolled up just so. He offered platitudes about hard work in a voice that was home-stretch hoarse. He even ended his rally speech the same was as in days of yore: “Let’s go knock doors because we know better is always possible!”

Sure, Trudeau touched the fresh departure of a second cabinet minister, and even laid hints at a strategic change of tone in his scattershot defence of this messy affair. But he quickly dispensed with those lines in favour of a nascent stump speech. “At the same time, my friends, we need to keep in mind the bigger picture behind this fantastic movement we have built, and continue to build.” At this event, his focus was mainly on the Liberal climate change plan as a point of sharp contrast with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, whose approach to climate change remains unknown. “The first thing he’d do as Prime Minister is make pollution free again,” Trudeau said, cuing up the partisans’ boo-hiss-shame.

From almost every Liberal’s rhetoric in their last nerve-fraying few weeks, it’s been apparent that they’d try to leg out this scandal and, from here to October’s election, lean in hard on what helped bring victory four years ago: Trudeau’s campaign charisma and the comparative shoddiness of his rivals. They’ve all but embraced the default campaign credo of many an incumbent—“don’t compare me to the Almighty; compare me to the alternative.”

That adage has taken a funny, meandering path to 2019. Earlier this decade, Barack Obama wielded it ahead of his 2012 re-election bid. He’d borrowed it from his vice-president, Joe Biden, who’d borrowed it from Kevin White a 1970s Boston mayor. White imported the phrase from—wait for it—1972 Canada. The Liberals were pushing for a second term, straining to offset disappointment in the first incarnation of Trudeaumania. Pierre Trudeau’s majority government was reduced to a minority that year, with only two seats more than the Conservatives.

At present, voters seem inclined to support the alternative, because the ethical lapses and the behind-the-scenes pressure applied to former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould register too many notches below Almighty-level behaviour. The Liberals have plunged several points in the polls, giving the Conservatives their largest lead since Trudeau’s embarrassing trip to India, according to CBC poll-tracker Éric Grenier. On one level, this could remind the Grits that political fortunes can rebound from a controversy’s headline-producing nadir—October is a long time from now, Liberals comfort each other by saying lately—but the SNC-Lavalin affair has produced two cabinet resignations (and counting) more than what now seems a comparatively innocuous overseas misadventure.

They may try to wave off this political quagmire and transport back to a time when Trudeau lacked such grim ethical baggage. They may prefer a straight head-to-head with Scheer on policy (and dismiss Jagmeet Singh’s NDP entirely, in part to depict 2019’s election as a binary choice).The Liberals did, after all, survive the first election after the sponsorship scandal with a minority (2004) and were leading in the polls through much of the second one (2006) before losing to Stephen Harper’s Conservatives. But that was only after Paul Martin had replaced Jean Chretien, the Prime Minister who presided over that ugly bout of grift-and-graft. In today’s scandal, barring future developments, the person at the top of the Liberal ticket has been personally fingered as responsible.

Trudeau is clearly aiming to make this election heavily about the planet’s future and climate change. But on its face, this strategem also seems fraught. First, because the Conservatives seem content to make this fall’s vote a referendum on the carbon tax. Second, because voters who will think first and foremost about the climate might also gulp anxiously about a political party that bought an oil pipeline project. Third, because the most slogan-like line from last night’s speech—“It’s 2019, and if you don’t have a plan for climate change, then you don’t have a plan for the economy and you certainly don’t have a plan for Canada’s future”—may last only until Scheer actually brings forth some sort of plan. And then, Trudeau might be reduced to debating details, not putting his own imperfect plan up against a void.

Trudeau’s team also seems to want to shrug off ethical choices on their leader’s part yet hammer Scheer on his. His speech at last month’s multi-purpose rally of western truckers who want pipelines and, toxically, don’t want certain immigrants seems to now be at the centre of that argument. “There are a number of people who are incredibly worried that we are going to lose the progress that we have made and we are going to see a government that is led by an individual who has coddled Yellow Vesters,” Toronto MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith told CBC on Tuesday.

Certainly, problematic links to xenophobes and problematic trampling over prosecutorial independence are separate, hard-to-compare concerns. But these are, it seems, the alternatives voters will have to reckon with.

Besides that critical race in B.C.'s Burnaby South for Jagmeet Singh, there are two other byelections being held in the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe and Outremont in Quebec.

Burnaby South is one place where all three major parties have been competitive in past elections. The NDP held onto the seat by a hair more than one per cent of the votes in 2015.

The Liberals, who usually put up a strong showing in Burnaby, faced challenges in this campaign.

Their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Singh said he's not taking anything for granted, but he's confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off.

""I think people are very disappointed with what's going on with the Liberal government,"" he said.

But the NDP is also squaring off against the Liberals in another race — to defend former leader Tom Mulcair's seat in the downtown Montreal riding of Outremont.

The provincial polls suggest that the Liberals should win the riding easily.

The NDP's support in Quebec has been fading, and the riding was a Liberal stronghold before Mulcair seized it in a 2007 byelection, the first-ever win in the province for the NDP and one that helped set the stage for the Orange Wave that swept the province in 2011.

Countrywide, that Orange Wave is now little more than a ripple. The NDP has been dropping in the polls and now sits at just 14 per cent in the CBC Poll Tracker — a result which, if replicated on election night in October, would be the worst result for the party in nearly 20 years.

Singh also presents unique challenges in Quebec ridings.

Julia Sanchez, the NDP's candidate in Monday's Outremont byelection, told The Canadian Press people in the riding talk to her about climate change, wealth inequality — and sometimes what the leader of her party wears on his head.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is Sikh and wears a turban, making him conspicuously religious in the eyes of a heavily secular province. His French is also weaker than the two previous party leaders, complicating the job of appealing to Quebec voters.

Even in multicultural Outremont, located in the geographic centre of the island of Montreal with one of the largest ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in North America, Singh's religious clothing is on some voters' minds.

""Some people are concerned about [the turban],"" Sanchez said during a recent interview following a candidate debate in the riding. She said when she knocks on doors, ""It's definitely not the main thing people bring up .... It does come up.""

Sanchez is running against Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan, Conservative Jasmine Louras, Bloc candidate Michel Duchesne, PPC candidate James Seale and Green party deputy leader Daniel Green.

York-Simcoe

York-Simcoe is almost certainly a safe Conservative seat. The Tories won it by 45 points in 2011 and still held it by 12 points in 2015 when Stephen Harper was defeated.

Tory candidate Scot Davidson told CBC News on Saturday he's confident the affluent riding will stay blue.

OTTAWA—Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is promising to remove federal sales tax from Canadians’ home-heating bills as part of an early election campaign commitment.

The heating bills for investment properties would also not be eligible.

The rebate would be capped at a maximum of $200 per household and would not be available for commercial energy costs.

Scheer estimates this could save Canadians an average of $107 per year.

People who live in provinces that have harmonized provincial and federal sales taxes would get the same rebate.

“Heating your home in winter isn’t a luxury for Canadians. It is a necessity,” Scheer said. “We don’t tax other basic necessities like groceries and we shouldn’t be taxing home heating.”

The Conservatives estimate the measure would cost the federal treasury $1.6 billion.

Scheer’s promise comes as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has launched a campaign — complete with a series of Liberal party ads — aimed at drawing the public’s attention to his carbon-pricing plan and how money raised from his imminent carbon tax will be rebated directly to residents of the four provinces that have no equivalent measures of their own.

The Trudeau government is requiring provinces to impose a price on carbon emissions, starting at $20 per tonne this year and rising by $10 per tonne annually until it hits $50 in 2022. Ottawa is imposing its own tax on Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick, as they continue to refuse to impose their own carbon pricing plan that meets federal targets.

Scheer has been a vocal opponent of the carbon tax and said the sales-tax cut would come along with scrapping the carbon tax if he becomes prime minister.",Scheer makes election promise to remove GST from home-heating bills,Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/03/06/scheer-makes-election-promise-to-remove-gst-from-home-heating-bills.html
413,Empty,2019-02-26T17:15:07Z,"The votes in York Simcoe, Burnaby South and Outremont revealed political vulnerabilities across the country, Chantal Hébert writes.","Here is a look at some of bright and dark spots brought to light by the votes in York Simcoe, Burnaby South and Outremont:

Hold the champagne! If Monday’s much-anticipated byelection results suggest anything, it is that none of the main federal parties is where it should want to be a little more than six months from the official start of a national election campaign.

In fact, even as polls show the unresolved crisis is taking a toll on the prime minister’s party, voters in the three ridings in play on Monday did not seem inclined to discipline the Liberals for their latest alleged ethical transgression.

At 40 per cent, their score in Outremont was their best since the 2004 sponsorship scandal. That is just the latest sign that the crisis over the government’s handling of SNC-Lavalin’s judicial file is unlikely to turn into a train wreck of similar proportions for Trudeau in Quebec in the fall election.

Only one in five voters cast a ballot in Outremont and York Simcoe. The turnout in Burnaby South was 30 per cent.

That being said, the Liberals lost close to 10 points from their 2015 scores in each of the two non-Quebec ridings in the last election. A similar drop across Ontario and B.C. this fall would see Trudeau and his party back in opposition.

His entry in the House of Commons at a particularly challenging time for the ruling Liberals will offer the NDP leader as close to a second chance to make a good first impression as a politician can hope for.

Singh will have to hit the ground running, for Monday’s returns also brought the expected confirmation that the party is headed nowhere fast in the province that gave it the most seats in the last two federal elections.

Yes, the New Democrats held on to second place in Outremont with 26 per cent of the vote, and yes, it is a score they would have been proud of in the pre-Thomas Mulcair era. But that number reflects an 18-point loss in support. It would not take a drop anywhere near that large to wipe the NDP off the face of Quebec this fall. Just last week, two more NDP MPs from Quebec announced they would not be seeking re-election.

The Conservative performance was symptomatic of all that ails Andrew Scheer’s party as it looks to the general election.

Its vote share went up in the riding where it least needed to do better — giving it a win in Ontario’s York Simcoe with 54 per cent of the vote as opposed to the 50 per cent it got in 2015. But the CPC lost ground in the other two ridings, suggesting the non-Liberal vote has yet to coalesce behind Scheer.

At seven per cent in Outremont, the Conservatives might as well have stayed home. In Burnaby South, their third-place finish with 22 per cent of ballots cast was overshadowed by Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party capturing 10.6% of the vote.

The good news for the CPC is that its right-wing rival’s score is more reflective of the personal appeal of the local candidate than that of the fledging party. At barely two per cent in Outremont and York Simcoe, Bernier’s first electoral tests in his home province and in Ontario were flops.

But perhaps the worst night on the field of expectations goes to the Bloc Québécois. This was the struggling sovereigntist party’s first byelection under new leader Yves-François Blanchet, and the first vote to showcase a sovereigntist option on the ballot since the Parti Québécois rout in last fall’s provincial election.

Outremont would not top any list of winnable BQ ridings but prior to Mulcair’s appearance on the scene in a 2 007 byelection, the sovereigntist party routinely won about a third of the vote. On Monday it only took one vote in 10.

The BQ was even beaten for third place by the Green Party. In veteran environmentalist Daniel Green, Elizabeth May recruited a rare big-name candidate for her party in Quebec and that certainly made a difference.

But the Greens’ 12 per cent finish is also a reminder that, these days, more Quebec voters are inclined to use their ballots to send a pro-environment message than a pro-sovereignty one.

Two-hundred and thirty-four days stand between today and the next federal election. That’s so many news cycles; so many chances for a gang of savvy politicians, stuck in a rut, to earn redemption; so much time. Unless, for these governing Liberals, every one of those days is anything like the last one.

Maclean’s writer Andrew MacDougall knows hellish news days, having toiled in Stephen Harper’s prime minister’s office and emerged intact. He writes that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau‘s response to Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, hastily delivered the same evening, only confirmed the worst of his instincts:

You tell Canadians—in that sanctimonious and overly serious tone you adopt when you’re under the cosh—who have watched Wilson-Raybould rattle their confidence in Canada’s institutions to now have confidence in the ethics commissioner, an office that has already found you guilty of breaking another law, but isn’t equipped to investigate the allegations unfurled by Wilson-Raybould. And while you’re busy doing that, you have your office tell media that nobody else will be resigning based on Wilson-Raybould’s testimony. In other words, every move you make tonight makes you look like the un-smart, un-serious man that so many of your political opponents have always insisted you are. [Maclean’s]

His truth: At his second encounter with reporters in just over 12 hours, the Prime Minister was again, of course, asked to answer the same questions we’re all bound to hear ad nauseum. When he was asked about Wilson-Raybould’s future as a Liberal, Trudeau invoked that well-worn tool of verbal vagueness: the passive voice. “I have taken knowledge of her testimony,” he said, “and there are still reflections to have on next steps.” So that’s a maybe? [CBC News]

Trudeau’s lieutenants dutifully distanced themselves from both Wilson-Raybould and her decision. First up was Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland: “I believe that [JWR] spoke, as she said she wanted to do, her truth. Having said that, I am clearly of the view that the Prime Minister would never apply improper pressure.” Finance Minister Bill Morneau later stood up for his chief of staff, Ben Chin, telling reporters he never crossed any lines with JWR. “My staff, appropriately, would make her staff aware of the economic consequences of decisions, about the importance of thinking about jobs.” [CBC News, National Observer]

Speaking of cabinet, the PM will this morning fill the gap at veterans affairs left vacant when Wilson-Raybould stepped down. CBC News reports the shuffle will involve only a “handful” of existing ministers. [CBC News]

He’s baaaaaack! A scant 10 days after Gerald Butts quit his post as Trudeau’s principal secretary, he’s asked for—and received—a little more time in the spotlight. In a letter to House justice committee chair Anthony Housefather, Butts offered that his “evidence will be of assistance” and that he only requires “a short period of time” to seek legal advice on that evidence—and, apparently certain “relevant documents.” [The letter, CTV News]

Elizabeth May, who recently polled as Canada’s most ethical federal leader, scored a standing-o from the opposition benches for, among other things, calling on the PM to sack Michael Wernick, the Privy Council clerk whose conduct came under intense scrutiny in the wake of Wilson-Raybould’s testimony. [Nanos poll, Steve Paikin tweet]

Oh, and Opposition leader Andrew Scheer has asked the RCMP to investigate what he says could be criminal acts on the part of several top officials—including the PM. You read that right. Scheer, who’s alleging PMO political interference for partisan gain, is asking the RCMP to investigate his political opponent. There’s a name for that. Surely unrelated, five former attorneys general, four Tories and a New Democrat, also wrote to the RCMP. [Huffington Post, The Five AGs]

Elsewhere on the JWR file: Liberal MP Jati Sidhu certainly had a bad day. A newspaper in his riding quoted Sidhu as saying Wilson-Raybould’s testimony was based on “sour grapes,” that she “couldn’t handle the stress” of her job, and that her dad, outspoken Indigenous leader Bill Wilson, might be “pulling the strings.” Sidhu later apologized in the House. [Abbotsford News]

The Liberals would much rather have Canada talk about almost anything other than the news of the day—say, their plans to build—what else?—a robotic arm for a new moon-orbiting space station, or their “historic” attempt to fix Indigenous child welfare in Canada, or even their opening of a new, kinda-cool-sounding science-driven winery in Nova Scotia. But that’s the price of defensive talking points that utterly fail to distract a single reporter. [This is one excited astronaut, Perry Bellegarde tweet, Wine not?]

Today, Wilson-Raybould’s replacement as attorney general, David Lametti, is in Montreal, where he’ll announce funding (stay tuned for how much) meant to “help Canadians gain the skills that will allow them to fully participate in the digital economy.” One wonders how many onlookers at La Grande Bibliothèque will be preoccupied with another of the minister’s files.

Since taking office in 2015, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has become a progressive icon due to his Liberal Party's championing of climate change action and refugee rights, as well as Trudeau's youthful looks and often charming demeanor.

Now Trudeau is embroiled in an escalating scandal that has triggered the resignations of his own principal secretary, a kind of senior political adviser, as well as two top Cabinet members, the second one stepping down on Monday.

The first Cabinet officer was former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould, who has accused Trudeau of secretly attempting to direct her handling of a high-level criminal prosecution.

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion,"" Wilson-Raybould told a parliamentary committee on Feb. 27.

At issue is the prosecution of a Montreal-based engineering firm called SNC Lavalin, which has more than 50,000 employees worldwide. The company faces criminal charges that it engaged in a long-term bribery and corruption scheme in Libya that involved funneling tens of millions of dollars to the family of former dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

If found guilty, the company could be banned from bidding on federal contracts in Canada. Last month, the Globe & Mail published an investigative report claiming Trudeau intervened in the matter, an account Wilson-Raybould corroborated. In her testimony, she said members of Trudeau's team pressured her repeatedly over a period of months in 2018 to reach a negotiated settlement with SNC Lavalin.

Their goal, she said, was to protect jobs while also bolstering the Liberal Party's political standing in the province of Quebec ahead of next October's general election.

On Monday, a second minister, Jane Philpott, stepped down from her post as Canada's Treasury Board president. ""It is a fundamental doctrine of the rule of law that our attorney-general should not be subjected to political pressure or interference regarding the exercise of her prosecutorial discretion in criminal cases,"" Philpott wrote in a letter to Trudeau.

The leader of Canada's Conservative opposition, Andrew Scheer, has been a frequent critic of Trudeau. Scheer is demanding a criminal probe of Trudeau's actions by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and has urged the prime minister to resign. ""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer told reporters.

Trudeau has defended his government's actions. During a news conference Monday, he said his staff advocated for the interests of an important Canadian jobs provider, while also respecting the rule of law. ""Canadians expect us to do those two things at the same time and that's what we will always do,"" Trudeau said.

But with national elections scheduled for the fall, the scandal shows no sign of abating. This week, Canada's most influential news magazine, Maclean's, published an article about the affair titled ""Justin Trudeau, Imposter."" The prime minister's former close confidante and political adviser, Gerry Butts, is scheduled to testify about his role in the Lavalin matter before a parliament committee on Wednesday.

""There is quite a bit of damage to Trudeau's brand,"" said Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. ""He said he would change politics, and in the end he's just a politician like any other.""",Second Member Quits Justin Trudeau's Cabinet Over Allegations Against Canadian PM,Npr.org,https://www.npr.org/2019/03/04/700261811/second-member-quits-justin-trudeaus-cabinet-over-allegations-against-canadian-pm
416,Empty,2019-03-07T15:53:57Z,Justin Trudeau’s inept handling of explosive allegations prompts a second minister to resign,"A T A CAMPAIGN-STYLE rally in Toronto on March 4th, Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, began his speech on a downbeat note. Although the purpose of the rally was to tout the climate-change policies of his Liberal government, Mr Trudeau had to start by acknowledging that he had lost one of his most respected ministers. Hours before he took the podium, Jane Philpott quit as head of the Treasury Board, which oversees government spending. Her departure was an expression of dismay at Mr Trudeau’s handling of the worst scandal to befall his government since it took office in October 2015. Two members of his cabinet and his closest aide have resigned so far. His fans’ cheers in Toronto could not disguise the fact that his government is in crisis. Mr Trudeau’s hope of re-election in October this year has been dented.

The controversy has raged since February 7th, when the Globe and Mail, a newspaper, published a report alleging that Mr Trudeau and his aides had put improper pressure on the justice minister and attorney-general, Jody Wilson-Raybould. Quoting unnamed sources, the report said that Mr Trudeau and his team wanted Ms Wilson-Raybould to decide against the prosecution of SNC -Lavalin, a Quebec-based construction firm, on charges of bribing officials in Libya when the country was ruled by Muammar Qaddafi. They pressed her to offer instead a deferred-prosecution agreement, in which the firm would have acknowledged wrongdoing and paid a large fine. When she resisted, Mr Trudeau demoted her to minister of veterans’ affairs, the newspaper claimed.

Ms Wilson-Raybould quit the cabinet on February 12th. Her own account, in testimony before the House of Commons’ justice committee two weeks later, largely backed the newspaper’s. She testified that in meetings and phone calls Mr Trudeau and his officials repeatedly urged her to block a prosecution. Gerald Butts, the aide who resigned, disputed her account in testimony on March 6th, saying that he had asked her only to consider the consequences for 9,000 SNC -Lavalin workers.

Mr Trudeau’s defence has been feeble. He moved Ms Wilson-Raybould, he said, because another minister’s retirement had opened a spot that he needed to fill. Few Canadians believe that. Mr Trudeau admits to talking to her about the case. But he insists he did nothing unethical and points out that he did not order her to change her decision. The prosecution is going ahead. Ms Philpott’s resignation undermined those arguments. The “independence and integrity of our justice system” is at stake, she wrote in her resignation letter. As The Economist went to press Mr Trudeau was expected to explain further at a press conference.

“There’s no easy way out of this for the government,” says Darrell Bricker of Ipsos, a pollster. Most Canadians think Ms Wilson-Raybould’s story is more believable than the prime minister’s, polls show. Even though no one is accusing Mr Trudeau or his aides of doing anything criminal, the scandal has tarnished the Liberals’ image as “prince charmings who can do no wrong”, in the phrase once used by an opposition politician. Andrew Scheer, the leader of the Conservative Party, has demanded Mr Trudeau’s resignation. Groups representing women and indigenous Canadians are angry at his treatment of a female minister with aboriginal roots.

Mr Trudeau’s career is by no means finished. The Liberals’ lag in the polls is so far small. Neither Mr Scheer nor Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the left-wing New Democratic Party, looks to most Canadians like a credible prime minister. And voters have reasons to back the one they have. The unemployment rate of 5.8% is close to a 40-year low. Economic growth has been strong, though it is starting to weaken. That, plus the introduction of a child benefit in 2016, has led to a drop in poverty.

Most important for Mr Trudeau is that the remaining cabinet ministers have pledged to stick by him.

The new moon race

Fifty years is a long time, even on the moon.

The first footprints that Neil Armstrong made on the evening of July 20, 1969, were likely obliterated when Apollo 11's landing module blasted off the next day, and the American flag that the crew left behind was long ago bleached white by ultraviolet rays. Although the tools, towels, cameras and other objects they dumped to lessen the load are still up there along with the bags of astronaut poop, all now covered with a layer of fine, lunar dust.

It's been 16,877 days and counting since Apollo 17, the last manned mission to our closest celestial neighbour.

But now it seems that everyone is in a hurry to go back.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took a brief break from crisis management this morning to announce that Canada will join the U.S.-led Lunar Gateway project that could put astronauts back on the moon's surface as soon as 2028.

The international scheme calls for the construction of an orbiting moon station starting next year, followed by what NASA calls ""sustainable lunar architecture"" — aka a moon base — that will serve as both a research station and proving ground for an eventual Mars mission.

And the U.S. space agency recently announced plans for one of its private space partners to land a new robotic probe on the moon by the end of 2019, and last week unveiled a dozen scientific payloads.

The sudden resurgence of interest has everything to do with competition.

The Chinese government achieved a space first by landing a probe and rover on the far-side of the moon at the beginning of January, a likely precursor to their own crewed mission.

The Kremlin reportedly has plans to put Russian cosmonauts on the moon by 2031, and construct its own lunar base by 2035.

A lander built by a private Israeli firm, Beresheet, blasted off on a SpaceX rocket last week, and may or may not be headed for a moon landing following a software glitch.

Israeli technicians work on the moon lander Beresheet (the Hebrew word for Genesis) that launched on its mission to the moon on Feb. 21. (Yoav Weiss)

India, which sent its first probe to the moon in 2008, has a second mission teed up and ready to go. It plans a manned mission by December 2021, the Indian Space Research Organization said in January.

And Taiwan has ramped up its space program, with the moon as the ultimate goal.

The private sector will surely play a big role in future moon missions.

A Japanese firm, ispace, is building two spacecraft that it hopes to send to the moon via SpaceX launches in 2020 and 2021. It is busy recruiting corporate partners, like NGK Spark Plug Co., to help underwrite the cost.

NASA, which hasn't had its own manned launch capability since the Shuttle program ended in 2011 — it has been contracting the job out to the Russians at as much as $82 million US a seat — is counting on Boeing and SpaceX for a made-in-America solution.

Kailasavadivoo Sivan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization, outlines upcoming moon missions at ISRO headquarters in Bangalore on Jan. 11. ISRO plans to launch a lunar probe by December 2020, a second by July 2021, and a manned mission by December 2021, he said. (Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images)

Progress has been slow, but Elon Musk's company is scheduled to send its Crew Dragon capsule on a dry run to the International Space Station this coming weekend, with plans to ferry its first astronauts in July, should all go well.

Boeing's Starliner test-flight should happen later this spring.

All of that has to do with cost.

NASA's 2019 budget is an impressive-sounding $21.5 billion US, but that's less than half a per cent of Washington's total spending, and about 50 per cent of the purchasing power the agency wielded during the Apollo glory years.

(Trudeau today earmarked $2.05 billion over the next 24 years for Canada's space program, including $150 million over five years for the Lunar Gateway.)

Despite the recent surge in interest, the new space race still lacks the 1960s urgency and investment provided by the Cold War.

Although Donald Trump, who has something of a space fixation, was reportedly willing to spend almost anything to ensure a Mars landing — as long as it occurred during his time in office.

Team of Vipers, the recent West-wing tell-all by former aide Cliff Sims, details an April 2017 Oval Office event during which the U.S. President put his then-NASA administrator on the spot, demanding a manned Mars mission before the 2020 election.

The NASA chief gently explained that the actual timeline — signed into law by Trump just a month earlier — is in the 2030s, and given the logistical challenges probably can't be advanced much, even with an unlimited budget.

Trump, writes Sims, was ""visibly disappointed.""

At Issue

It's been another wild week in Canadian politics, producer Arielle Piat-Sauvé writes.

Almost three weeks after allegations of political interference by the prime minister's office first came to light in a Globe and Mail report, we've finally heard from the person at the centre of it all — Jody Wilson-Raybould.

And after keeping her silence for weeks, the former Minister of Justice and Attorney General had a lot to say at yesterday's Commons justice committee hearing.

Jody Wilson-Raybould gives her testimony about the SNC-Lavalin affair before a justice committee hearing on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday. The Montreal-based firm was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts. (Lars Hagberg/AFP/Getty Images)

During her 40-minute-long opening statement, Wilson-Raybould presented her detailed account of events in chronological order. She then spent another three-and-a-half hours answering questions.

It's clear to anyone listening to the almost four-hour testimony that her account of what happened differs from that of the Clerk of the Privy Council and the prime minister.

Wilson-Raybould says she faced veiled threats and repeated political pressure to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin affair. The prime minister refuted Wilson-Raybould's testimony and reiterated that he believes there was no inappropriate pressure.

In his latest column, Andrew Coyne says either Wilson-Raybould is flat-out lying, or the prime minister and his people are.

Paul Wells describes the former Attorney General's account as a sickening, smug protection racket, and says the rules need to be the rules.

And last night, the leader of the opposition, Andrew Scheer, went as far as to call on Trudeau to resign.

Right now it looks like Canadians will have to decide whose narrative they believe, the prime minister's or Wilson-Raybould's.

As Chantal Hébert said during our special Wednesday At Issue, Wilson-Raybould has placed the prime minister right in the middle of the controversy — and they are supposed to be on the same team. Today, Hébert writes that the Liberals will likely be heading into the fall election campaign with the SNC-Lavalin affair still hanging around the party's neck.

So why is Wilson-Raybould remaining in the Liberal caucus? And what's the government's next move?

One thing we can be certain of is that this topic will dominate Question Period today.

Needless to say, lots for the At Issue panel tonight. Rosie Barton is away this week, but Chantal, Andrew and Paul will join host Ian Hanomansing. We'll tackle the latest on the SNC-Lavalin controversy and take some viewer questions.

Hope you can tune in!

Meghan Markle is at the centre of a war of words being fought on social media, writes London bureau reporter Kayla Hounsell.

I had been combing through the online vitriol about Meghan Markle for a while when my producer, Lily Martin, came across the work of social data journalist Gemma Joyce.

She had noticed so much nastiness online about the Duchess of Sussex, she decided to dig deep to find out who was saying what.

While it was already clear there were many distasteful and racist comments, I thought Joyce could give us some actual data. We made the trip to Brighton, England, to meet with her.

Joyce showed us a wall of screens in her office, displaying bar graphs, pie charts and maps. They indicated the most popular hashtag about Meghan Markle is #Megxit. You guessed it, a play on Brexit. People want Meghan to ""leave"" the way Britain is leaving the European Union.

#Moonbump is also growing in popularity, referring to the Duchess's baby bump.

""There is this theory going around that she is faking her pregnancy, which to me sounds a little bit mad,"" Joyce says.

Perhaps not surprisingly, 80 per cent of this discussion is being generated by women, but what's really interesting is that the majority of them are not in the United Kingdom. The United States, where Meghan was an actress before marrying into the Royal Family, is fuelling the conversation, followed by the U.K., with Canada coming in third.

Joyce points out that while there is a lot of online abuse, there are also Meghan supporters, and they have a hashtag too. They're the Megulators.

""It's not that, you know, the trolls are really winning,"" she says. ""But at the same time, just looking at the kind of hatred around it is quite depressing really.""

Posted

It has been a long time in politics since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won the general election in 2015, surfing into office on a wave of optimism.

Key points: Canada's former justice minister alleges close Trudeau aides pressured her to settle a bribery case for a major construction firm

In testimony to the House of Commons, the ex-minister said there had been veiled threats and the intervention was ""not appropriate""

Mr Trudeau says he and his staff have done nothing wrong, but the scandal comes months out from an election

While the progressive, self-confessed feminist Prime Minister immediately became one of the internet's favourite world leaders, scandals and missteps have taken the shine off him at home.

None more so than this week when one of Mr Trudeau's former Cabinet colleagues fronted the House of Commons justice committee and delivered four hours of dramatic testimony alleging inappropriate political pressure.

Afterwards, Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer said Mr Trudeau had ""lost moral authority to govern"" and ""must resign"".

So where did this all start?

The justice minister and the corruption trial

Back in 2015, the year Mr Trudeau came into office, allegations surfaced that a major Canadian construction firm had bribed Libyan officials.

The firm, SNC-Lavalin, was charged. It tried to avoid prosecution and a trial, instead wanting to settle the case with a fine.

But the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided to pursue the firm over the bribery allegations rather than negotiating a remediation agreement.

At the time that was a real concern for Mr Trudeau because if the company was found guilty it would have barred it from government contracts for 10 years — possibly endangering the firm and thousands of its employees.

As justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould had the authority to overrule the DPP and demand a settlement instead.

She chose not to intervene, instead agreeing with the DPP that the case should go to trial.

Ms Wilson-Raybould was eventually bumped to the veterans' affairs portfolio in a surprise reshuffle that was widely seen as a demotion, before she resigned around the time the interference scandal hit the papers.

She now says she felt consistent political pressure from senior political staffers, including Mr Trudeau's principal secretary, to help SNC-Lavalin evade a trial.

In testimony to the House of Commons on Wednesday (local time), she said she had 10 phone calls and 10 in-person meetings with members of the Prime Minister's Office who lobbied her to order a settlement.

She said the lobbying continued under the argument of ""finding a solution"", despite her making her decision clear about not intervening.

""This pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,"" she said in her testimony, adding that some officials had made veiled threats against her.

The head of the federal civil service, according to Ms Wilson-Raybould, told her Mr Trudeau would ""find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kind [of] mood and I wanted you to be aware of that"".

Ms Wilson-Raybould alleged that at one stage the Prime Minister stressed to her that there was an election in Quebec and that she was ""an MP in Quebec"".

What does Trudeau have to say about it?

After his former justice minister's testimony this week, Mr Trudeau gave a press conference and denied wrongdoing, saying he had been thinking about potential job losses.

""I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,"" Mr Trudeau said.

""I therefore completely disagree with [Ms Wilson-Raybould's] characterisation of events.""

The Prime Minister brushed off Opposition demands for him to step down.

Mr Trudeau's principal secretary Gerald Butts also denied applying inappropriate pressure on Ms Wilson-Raybould as the scandal broke, but he later resigned.

He has said he would like to testify to the House of Commons committee, so this issue is unlikely to disappear in the crucial few months before Canada's federal election — scheduled for sometime before October 21.

'That India trip' is also a problem for Trudeau

Mr Trudeau's image as a media-savvy and charismatic leader took a major battering in early 2018 in a trip that was labelled by many as a ""PR nightmare"".

""One need only to refer to 'that India trip' and for the foreseeable future we'll all know exactly what that means,"" commentator Rob Breckinridge wrote.

In the Washington Post, India-based journalist Barkha Dutt wrote: ""Suddenly, all that charisma and cuteness seems constructed, manufactured and, above all, not serious.""

The photogenic PM was meant to be on a diplomatic trip to India but it descended into a lengthy series of cultural photo ops involving his family that seemed more at home in a family trip album.

They went everywhere — from the Trudeaus in Indian garb at the ashram where Mahatma Gandhi lived to slipping on a traditional Indian wedding dress and dancing with Bollywood stars.

Mr Trudeau did meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, eventually, but was criticised for the meeting happening so late in the tour.

The trip damaged Mr Trudeau's reputation at home, making him more irritating than adorable, journalist Micheline Maynard wrote.

The cherry on top: A new NAFTA agreement delivering a worse deal

US President Donald Trump's insistence on tearing up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has also put Mr Trudeau in a difficult situation.

In negotiating a new free-trade deal — the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement (USMCA) — Canada had to accept some restrictions and open up its protected dairy market to the US.

This has incensed farmers who held Mr Trudeau to a pledge to protect the dairy industry from cheap milk in the US.

While the new deal was agreed to by the three nations, it has yet to be ratified and still faces opposition from Canada and Mexico, which want the US to drop new tariffs on steel.

420,Empty,2019-03-01T14:21:25Z,"And now, corruption news from north of the border The post Justin Trudeau’s days as PM may be numbered appeared first on Hot Air.","Remember when Justin Trudeau was the new, liberal golden boy of international politics? He’s been somewhat pushed off the stage by Emmanuel Macron in recent years, but following his Liberal Party’s stunning election victory in 2015, he was on top of the world. He’s also made a habit of verbally crossing swords with President Trump from time to time, just to keep his liberal bona fides in proper order. His approval ratings in the Great White North have traditionally been well above water.

That may be coming to an end, however. Canada’s next federal elections are coming up in October of this year and almost all the news for Trudeau has been bad lately. While it hasn’t surfaced on American cable news networks very often, the Prime Minister is in hot water over an emerging corruption scandal that has opponents calling for his resignation. It’s alleged that Trudeau pressured his former Attorney General to drop corruption charges against a major construction company and quietly pursue a settlement agreement instead.

All bets are now off about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s political survival. An ethics scandal has plunged Canada’s government into disarray, with the prime minister himself facing unprecedented political peril. A flood of new details allege Trudeau and several senior government officials repeatedly pressured his former attorney general to drop corruption charges against a large construction company and reach a settlement agreement. Trudeau’s political opponents sent police a letter Thursday requesting an investigation and called for Trudeau’s resignation. “He can no longer, and in good standing with a clear conscience, lead this nation,” said Conservative Andrew Scheer, who hopes to replace Trudeau.

This may sound like small potatoes compared to the regular cornucopia of scandals we get in the United States, but the details are fairly stunning. When the allegation of interfering with the Attorney General’s office first emerged, Trudeau’s team flatly denied there had been any such involvement. But this week, the former Attorney General in question, Jody Wilson-Raybould, provided testimony and notes from meetings and phone calls detailing the conversations she’d had with the Prime Minister’s staff and even Trudeau himself.

Compounding matters is the fact that the company, SNC-Lavalin, is a major employer in Quebec where Trudeau is a member of Parliament. The AG testified that Trudeau himself had reminded her that there was an election coming up in Quebec and this would look very bad. Wilson-Raybould was then demoted by the PM and replaced by a new official from Trudeau’s home province.

All of this adds up to a story that’s taking much of the bloom off of Trudeau’s rose. The polling was already showing him in a tight race before the AG’s testimony and now it’s shaping up to be even worse. We should also keep in mind that the Canadians haven’t traditionally been shy about swapping out the party in power. Prior to the Liberal Party’s sweeping victory in 2015, the Conservative Party held a solid majority of their own following the 2011 elections under Stephen Harper.

All bets are now off about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's political survival.

An ethics scandal has plunged Canada's government into disarray, with the prime minister himself facing unprecedented political peril.

A flood of new details allege Trudeau and several senior government officials repeatedly pressured his former attorney general to drop corruption charges against a large construction company and reach a settlement agreement. Trudeau's political opponents sent police a letter Thursday requesting an investigation and called for Trudeau's resignation.

""He can no longer, and in good standing with a clear conscience, lead this nation,"" said Conservative Andrew Scheer, who hopes to replace Trudeau.

The prime minister brushed off that request and said Canadians will have a chance to judge him for themselves in an election this fall.

Until recently, his reelection appeared to be nearly a lock. The latest polls now show him slipping into a tight race — and those surveys don't even capture the latest influx of damaging detail.

""It’s like someone threw the chessboard into the air,"" said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs. ""The pieces haven’t landed yet ... This was already a close race. [Trudeau's Liberals] couldn’t afford to stumble. And, yesterday was much more than a stumble.""

The turning point was testimony Wednesday at a spectacular justice committee hearing in the Canadian House of Commons: On the same day Michael Cohen torched President Donald Trump at a committee hearing, a spurned ally of Trudeau's was scorching him too.

Former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould, who was dropped by Trudeau but continues to sit in his party’s caucus, broke her silence after weeks of speculation about what she might say.

In painstaking detail she demolished the talking point from the government that Trudeau played no role in pressuring her to cut a plea deal with a Montreal-based company. Wilson-Raybould described and shared notes from about 10 meetings and 10 phone calls with 11 senior members of the government, including Trudeau. She said after she repeatedly fought pressure last fall from officials in Trudeau's office and other departments to deliver a non-prosecution agreement, the prime minister brought it up with her.

She said Trudeau noted in a meeting last September that the company, SNC-Lavalin, is a major, longstanding employer in his home town.

Wilson-Raybould also said the prime minister and others raised the suggestion that cutting a deal could help the provincial wing of their Liberal party in an election last October, which it ultimately lost.

""At that point the prime minister jumped in, stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that 'I am [a member of Parliament] in Quebec.' ... I was quite taken aback,"" Wilson-Raybould said. ""My response — and I vividly remember this as well — was to ask the prime minister a direct question while looking him in the eye. I asked, 'Are you politically interfering with my role?'""

She said Trudeau said he wasn't interfering.

But she was soon demoted to a lesser role in the Cabinet, replaced with a new attorney general from Trudeau's home town, and she recently quit her Cabinet post.

Wilson-Raybould, who remains a member of parliament, told the committee hearing that she was, ""having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre,"" the Watergate purging of the Justice Department.

The sole bright spot on the darkest day of Trudeau's term came when the former minister was asked whether Trudeau or others had committed a crime.

""I don't believe that,"" she replied.

The opposition seized the moment anyway: The Conservative leader hoping to replace Trudeau in an election later this year sent police a letter requesting an investigation.

Andrew Scheer asked the Mounties to investigate whether the acts described violated two criminal code items: one on obstruction of justice, the other against pressuring the attorney general. The RCMP has not commented.

He also called on Trudeau to resign.

“I was sickened and appalled by [the] story of inappropriate, and frankly bordering on illegal, pressure,” Scheer said. ""Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet must now find a way forward, without him … They have a duty to govern this nation, not help a disgraced prime minister hang onto power.”

Trudeau disputed the characterization of events, but did not deny asking her to spare the company. He insisted he never directed the minister to drop charges.

“There are disagreements in perspective on this,"" Trudeau said Thursday. ""But I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job and we were doing it in a way that respects and defends our institutions.""

He also sidestepped questions about calling a broader public inquiry, beyond ongoing parliamentary and ethics investigations.

One option available in theory is an early election.

If the opposition wants Trudeau gone, and if Trudeau said his fate is ultimately up to voters, they could call for an early election. The current election is officially set for October 23, but the Canadian constitution allows a vote at any time.

Several members of the Trudeau government dismissed the idea. A spokesperson for the prime minister, Eleanore Catenaro, said Trudeau squashed the idea of an early election call in a December interview.

""His comments still stand,"" Catenaro said.

And asked about early election talk, Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr said Thursday: “[There's been] none that I’ve heard.""

Minister of Innovation Navdeep Bains was with Trudeau at a press conference announcing a 24-year Canadian commitment to NASA's deep-space exploration project.

He sounded a similar note.

“We’re just focused on our mandate,"" Bains said in an interview. ""We’re focused on executing our work for Canadians.”

OTTAWA: In a serious blow to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a second member of his Cabinet resigned on Monday (Mar 4), saying she had lost confidence in how the government had dealt with an escalating political scandal.

The departure of recently appointed Treasury Board President Jane Philpott, who was in overall charge of government spending, deprives Trudeau of another powerful female member of cabinet just months ahead of an election that polls show he could lose.

Philpott expressed unhappiness about the government's response to allegations that officials inappropriately pressured former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help major construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial.

""Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised,"" Philpott said in a statement.

""I have concluded that I must resign as a member of cabinet.""

Philpott is a close friend of Wilson-Raybould, who herself resigned on Feb 12 after she was unexpectedly demoted in January. Wilson-Raybould said last week she was convinced her refusal to help SNC-Lavalin was behind the demotion.

Andrew Scheer, head of the official opposition Conservative Party, repeated calls for Trudeau to quit amid ""ethical rot"" he said was undermining the rule of law.

""Jane Philpott's resignation from cabinet clearly demonstrates a government in total chaos led by a disgraced prime minister consumed with scandal and focused only on his political survival,"" he told reporters in Toronto.

Trudeau has accepted the resignation and will address the matter later on Monday, said a spokesman.

The departure of Philpott, who was appointed on Jan 14, is another setback for a prime minister who came to power in November 2015 promising ""sunny ways"", more accountability in politics and a greater number of women ministers.

""What should be worrisome for the Trudeau Liberals is that the two cabinet resignations have been on issues of principle and ethics,"" said Nanos Research pollster Nik Nanos.

""The second resignation begs the question – what did happen and could there be more resignations,"" he said by email.

Other members of Trudeau's government, including Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said they would stay in the cabinet.

Philpott said evidence of efforts by politicians and officials to pressure Wilson-Raybould had raised serious concerns. Wilson-Raybould tweeted to Philpott that ""you are a leader of vision and strength and I look forward to continuing to work alongside you.""

Philpott, 58, was widely regarded as one of the best of Trudeau's cabinet ministers. She had previously served as minister of health and minister of indigenous services.

Most Liberal members of parliament have so far backed Trudeau but there are signs of strain.

Celina Caesar-Chavannes, a Liberal legislator who is not seeking re-election, tweeted that ""when you add women, please do not expect the status quo. Expect us to make correct decisions, stand for what is right and exit when values are compromised.""

Gerald Butts, who quit as Trudeau's principal secretary last month over the SNC-Lavalin affair, will testify to the House of Commons justice committee from 10am to noon local time (11pm to 1am Singapore time) on Wednesday.

In her testimony to the committee last week, Wilson-Raybould singled out Butts as one official who tried particularly hard to change her mind. Under questioning she said she did not consider officials had broken any laws.

CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER Justin Trudeau has denied accusations of “inappropriate” meddling in the prosecution of a corporate giant but did not apologise over the scandal.

Facing calls to resign, Trudeau addressed the allegations news conference today in Ottawa, saying he had learned “lessons” from the crisis but denying any wrongdoing.

Trudeau’s inner circle is accused of pressuring his former attorney general to shield Canadian engineering giant SNC-Lavalin from a bribery trial.

The case has already triggered the resignation of Trudeau’s right-hand man and two cabinet ministers, with support for the prime minister and his Liberals falling for the first time behind the opposition Tories – seven months from a general election.

Addressing the media today, the 47-year-old Trudeau acknowledged that he raised the pending trial during a meeting last September with then attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould – whose resignation sparked the crisis. Trudeau said that they discussed its possible impact on jobs in his Montreal electoral base.

“But this comment was not partisan in nature,” the prime minister said today.

During days of testimony before the House of Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould said she experienced “consistent and sustained” pressure from Trudeau’s inner circle to interfere in the case, including “veiled threats”.

“There was no inappropriate pressure,” said Trudeau, who has stood by his previous claim he made clear to Wilson-Raybould that any decision was hers alone.

‘Erosion of trust’

Trudeau did take some responsibility for the breakdown in relations between his office and Wilson-Raybould, Canada’s first indigenous attorney general.

She claims she was ousted from the justice ministry over the case and quit the government last month.

“As we look over the past weeks, there are many lessons to be learned and many things we would have liked to have done differently,” the prime minister said today.

“I was not aware of that erosion of trust. As prime minister, I should have been,” he said, vowing to “do better next time.”

But he added that Wilson-Raybould should have been more forthcoming with her concerns. “She did not come to me and I wish she had,” he said.

Rejecting Trudeau’s account this afternoon, opposition leader Andrew Scheer told a news conference in Toronto that “the erosion of trust has been between Justin Trudeau and Canadians”.

“It’s now beyond dispute that he and his office bullied and threatened Ms Wilson-Raybould to get her to let SNC-Lavalin off the hook (and) when she resisted the attempts he fired her,” Scheer said.

The Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin was charged with corruption four years ago for allegedly paying $47 million (€31 million) in bribes between 2001 and 2011 to secure Libyan government contracts under the rule of Muammar Gaddafi and of defrauding the Libyan government.",Unapologetic Trudeau denies interfering in prosecution of Canadian engineering firm,Thejournal.ie,https://www.thejournal.ie/trudeau-scandal-canada-4529647-Mar2019/

Justin Trudeau's right-hand-man says the prime minister did nothing improper as a deepening political crisis threatens the government's re-election chances. Here's what you need to know.

In a nutshell

Mr Trudeau has been accused of pressuring his former attorney general to cut a deal with a company facing corruption charges - and retaliating when she refused to play ball.

The revelations could cost Trudeau the October general election, some pundits say.

The former AG, Jody Wilson-Raybould, says Trudeau and his staff spent months trying to convince her that taking the company to trial would cost Canadians jobs, and their party votes.

She also says she was subject to ""veiled threats"", which she believes were made good when she was shuffled out of her department.

Now another minister, Jane Philpott, has quit saying it was ""untenable"" for her to continue due to ""serious concerns"" raised by the case.

But Gerald Butts, Mr Trudeau's former principal secretary, says there was no political pressure - only concerns for how the prosecution could affect local economies.

Who are the players?

The spurned ex-minister: Jody Wilson-Raybould was Canada's attorney general and justice minister. Unlike in the UK, the two roles are held by the same person.

She was also Canada's first indigenous justice minister and worked on a number of pieces of landmark legislation, including legalising cannabis and assisted dying.

In January, she was shuffled from the justice department to the department of veterans' affairs - a move many saw as a demotion.

The corporation: SNC-Lavalin is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies.

The company faces fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, when Muammar Gaddafi was in power.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

The PM: Justin Trudeau is Canada's prime minister. He won a majority government in 2015 on a platform of transparency, gender equality and a commitment to reconciliation with Canada's indigenous peoples.

He faces a federal election in October 2019.

The Trudeau ally who quit: Jane Philpott is described as one of his most trusted ministers.

But her resignation statement explaining why she was quitting as Treasury Board president could not have been more pointed.

Citing the SNC-Lavallin affair, she said: ""I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities, constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one's principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.""

Trudeau's right-hand man: Gerald Butts has been described as the ""most important Liberal in Canada today"" whose last name is not ""Trudeau"". But all that changed in February, when Mr Butts resigned amid rumours he had pressured the justice minister to cut a deal with SNC-Lavalin.

Mr Butts is one of Mr Trudeau's closest allies, and the two have been friends since their university days in Montreal.

He is credited with helping Mr Trudeau win the Liberal party leadership in 2013 and was a key architect in the Liberal party's sweeping 2015 electoral victory.

Why would Trudeau care about SNC-Lavalin?

SNC-Lavalin is based in Quebec, a swing province that has long been viewed as essential ground for the Liberal Party to win during an election - which is coming up in October.

When the Liberals win Quebec, they often win a majority of seats in parliament. When they lose, they lose badly.

At the time that Wilson-Raybould says she was being pressured to cut a deal, Quebec was also in the middle of a heated provincial election that eventually led to the ousting of Quebec Liberal premier Philippe Couillard.

Wilson-Raybould says the federal Liberal Party kept raising the Quebec election as one of the reasons why she should consider cutting a deal with SNC-Lavalin.

What does Trudeau say?

Trudeau has denied wrongdoing and says any lobbying by him or his inner circle for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was done to protect jobs.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, Mr Trudeau said he disagreed with her ""characterisation"" of events and maintained his staff followed the rules.

What could the fallout be?

Trudeau's longtime friend and principal secretary Gerald Butts has already resigned.

Many speculate that other top officials that Wilson-Raybould named may follow.

Canada's ethics commissioner is investigating Wilson-Raybould's accusations to see if any conflict-of-interest rules were broken. For her part, Wilson-Raybould says she believes no laws were broken, but that the prime minister's office acted improperly.

But the real question is what this could mean for Trudeau and his election in the fall.

Conservative leader of the opposition Andrew Scheer has already called for Trudeau's resignation, saying he no longer has the ""moral authority"" to lead.

That seems unlikely, but what is likely - at least according to columnist Chantal Hebert and other political pundits - is that ""the Liberals will likely go in the fall election campaign with the SNC-Lavalin albatross still hanging around their party's neck"".",Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould: The scandal that could unseat Canada's PM,BBC News,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47408239
426,Empty,2019-03-05T16:23:49Z,A scandal has cost him two cabinet ministers,"ALLEGATIONS THAT Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, put pressure last year on Jody Wilson-Raybould, then justice minister and attorney-general, to drop a criminal case against a large construction company have dominated the news for almost a month. Ms Wilson-Raybould says that the Liberal prime minister and his officials pushed her to suspend the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin for bribing Libyan officials prior to 2011, and fine the company instead. Mr Trudeau admits that he raised the matter with Ms Wilson-Raybould because he wanted to protect 9,000 jobs, but denies that he and his officials did anything inappropriate. He did not override Ms Wilson-Raybould’s decision to proceed with a trial. And she has not accused him or his aides of criminal behaviour. So why is Mr Trudeau in trouble?

When Mr Trudeau led the Liberals to victory in the election in October 2015, he called himself a feminist, promised to improve Canada’s troubled relations with indigenous peoples and pledged to conduct an open and transparent government. These promises look empty after Ms Wilson-Raybould, an indigenous politician, told the parliamentary justice committee investigating the affair on February 27th that the prime minister and his officials had tried to strong-arm her. The most senior bureaucrat in Ottawa issued “veiled threats” of what would happen if she did not change her mind, she testified. (That bureaucrat, who has testified previously, is due to appear before the committee again on March 6th.) She believes that she was demoted in January to the more junior post of minister of veterans’ affairs as punishment for resisting. She resigned from cabinet last month but still sits as a Liberal MP.

Opposition parties have piled in, hoping to do as much damage as possible to the Liberal brand during this last session of parliament before Canadians vote in the next parliamentary election, due in October. Andrew Scheer, the Conservative leader, says Mr Trudeau should resign. The prime minister’s damage-control efforts received a blow on March 4th when Jane Philpott, one of his most competent and respected ministers, quit as president of the treasury board, the government’s main administrative department. Ms Philpott said the pressure on Ms Wilson-Raybould raised serious concerns about the independence of Canada’s justice system. “Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and how it has responded to the issues raised,” she wrote. China has seized on the controversy to argue that Canada’s judiciary did not behave independently of government when it ordered the arrest in December of Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Huawei, a big Chinese telecoms company, at the request of American prosecutors. The dispute has poisoned relations between Canada and China.

Mr Trudeau faces more pitfalls. Gerald Butts, his former principal secretary, is to testify before the justice committee on March 6th. Ms Wilson-Raybould says he exerted some of the pressure. The parliamentary ethics commissioner and justice committee will issue separate reports. Mr Trudeau must still decide whether he wants Ms Wilson-Raybould and Ms Philpott to remain members of the Liberal caucus now that they have lost confidence in his government. Expelling them could be explosive.

Even before the Globe and Mail, a national newspaper, first published the allegations of backroom pressure on Ms Wilson-Raybould, the Liberals were dropping in the polls. Some indicate that the Conservatives would win if an election were called today. Most Canadians say the economy, rather than issues like SNC-Lavalin, will determine their vote in October. Unfortunately for Mr Trudeau, the latest statistics show that the economy has stopped growing.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Justin Trudeau to resign Wednesday, saying former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's troubling testimony about SNC-Lavalin proved the prime minister has lost the moral authority to govern.

Scheer threw down the gauntlet immediately after a three-hour Commons' justice committee meeting in which Wilson-Raybould said she felt pressure from Trudeau and others to head off a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""And that is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.""

But Trudeau quickly rebuffed Scheer's demand as he touted his government's record defending jobs and ""the independence of our judiciary,"" adding Canadians will decide later this year whether to re-elect the Liberals or hand power to the Conservatives.

Trudeau said an “erosion of trust” between himself and Wilson-Raybould led to the blow-up which has seen the former attorney general and justice minister quit cabinet and declare that she has no confidence in the government under Trudeau.

While acknowledging that he could have acted differently as events around SNC-Lavalin unfolded, Trudeau stopped short of apologizing for the interactions he and other senior officials had with the former attorney general and justice minister about the Quebec engineering giant's case.

""Each of these interactions was a conversation among colleagues about how to tackle the challenging issue. Each came at a time when my staff and I believed that former minister of justice and attorney general was open to considering other aspects of the public interest, however, I now understand that she saw it differently,"" Trudeau said at a press conference in Ottawa.

Scheer spoke later in the day, reiterating his previous call for Trudeau to resign. He described Trudeau’s press conference as “a complete, phony act of fake sincerity” and accused the prime minister of lying to the country.

“It’s now beyond dispute that he and his office bullied and threatened Ms. Wilson-Raybould in an attempt to get her to let SNC-Lavalin off the hook. When she resisted these attempts, he fired her,” he said.

Scheer accused Trudeau of neglecting all other government business to focus on “damage control” around Wilson-Raybould and SNC-Lavalin.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who has called for an independent public inquiry into the matter, tweeted that he saw Trudeau’s remarks as the Prime Minister “blaming everyone but himself” and attempting to discredit Wilson-Raybould’s claims.

“The ‘erosion of trust’ is with [Canadians],” he said.

Trudeau said that he was not aware of the breakdown of the relationship with Wilson-Raybould and he should have been. He also confirmed that he did raise that he was the MP for Papineau, Que. in a conversation with Wilson-Raybould on this file, but denied that it was done in a partisan way. He said it was about defending jobs and the community that he represents.

Asked for his thoughts on whether Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott – the former Treasury Board president who left cabinet Monday out of solidarity with Wilson-Raybould – could remain in the Liberal caucus, Trudeau noted that both women had stated a desire to stay.

Thursday’s press conference also saw Trudeau reference his father, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, who he does not often talk about publicly. He said that he has always considered the Ministry of Justice to be “of particular importance and interest” due to his father’s influence.

“Throughout his career, he was dedicated to that principle of justice – the just society, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and his approach of justice and fairness infused everything he did and certainly was something that he raised me with,” he said.

The prime minister has announced that he plans to seek external expert advice on the dual role of minister of justice and attorney general, and the operating policies of cabinet, the public service and political staff in regards to how they handle legal matters.

Central to this scandal was Wilson-Raybould holding both titles at the time she alleges she faced high-level ""veiled threats"" and months of ""sustained"" pressure to interfere in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, which is facing bribery and corruption charges in Libya. That’s because of a principle that asserts that an attorney general is able to consult cabinet colleagues but cannot be directed or considerably pushed towards making a decision related to a prosecution.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons Justice Committee last week that she had faced a months-long campaign of political interference. The committee heard Wednesday from Gerald Butts, who explained the series of events as normal government business.

Updated at 9:26 p.m. ET

A close ally of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau testified before Parliament on Wednesday, hoping to quell a growing political scandal that has already forced three high-level resignations.

""At the end of the day, we really didn't feel that anybody was doing anything wrong,"" said Gerald Butts, a principal secretary and top aide to Trudeau. Butts abruptly stepped down last month.

At issue are allegations made by Canada's former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, who says Trudeau and his inner circle intervened inappropriately in the criminal prosecution of a powerful engineering firm, SNC Lavalin, headquartered in Trudeau's home city of Montréal in Quebec province. The firm is accused of an international bribery and fraud scheme worth tens of millions of dollars.

It is a perilous moment for Trudeau, in part because many of those leveling accusations against him are friends, former allies and members of his own Cabinet.

His office announced that the prime minister will speak directly to Canadians about the crisis Thursday morning in Ottawa and take questions from reporters.

During explosive testimony last week, Wilson-Raybould said Trudeau, Butts and others pressured her over a series of months to soften prosecution of Lavalin in order to shore up the Liberal Party's popularity in Quebec ahead of this year's elections. She says they threatened her with political repercussions if she didn't comply.

""I was having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre,"" Wilson-Raybould told a parliamentary committee, referring to the ousting of multiple Nixon administration officials in one day during the Watergate scandal.

She was later stripped of her post as attorney general and eventually resigned from Trudeau's Cabinet.

In his own testimony, Butts attempted to refute Wilson-Raybould's account, suggesting that high-level discussions of the Lavalin matter focused appropriately on how the case might affect jobs and employment, not on political repercussions of the case. He said Trudeau urged Wilson-Raybould to seek additional legal opinions before deciding how the prosecution would be handled.

Butts said he was startled when he learned that Wilson-Raybould felt the secret talks had threatened the independence of the criminal justice system.

""I asked her in a surprised tone whether she was questioning the integrity of the Prime Minister,"" he told members of Parliament.

During roughly two hours of testimony, Butts faced often hostile and skeptical questions. They came from members of Canada's largest opposition party, the Conservatives, but also from lawmakers representing Trudeau's Liberal Party and two influential left-of-center parties, the New Democratic Party and the Greens.

""I will let you know, I completely believe every word we heard from Jody Wilson-Raybould without a doubt,"" said Green Party leader Elizabeth May, a longtime Trudeau friend, during her question time. May went on to accuse Trudeau's staff of making ""veiled threats"" against the attorney general over the Lavalin matter.

In a further blow to Trudeau, his treasury board chair, Jane Philpott, stepped down Monday after blasting the prime minister's team in a scathing public letter.

""It is a fundamental doctrine of the rule of law that our attorney-general should not be subjected to political pressure or interference regarding the exercise of her prosecutorial discretion in criminal cases,"" Philpott wrote.

The timing couldn't be worse for Trudeau. Canadians go to the polls in October to decide whether he deserves another term. Meanwhile, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer has called for Trudeau to resign and insisted on a new criminal probe into the case by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

The prime minister himself has said repeatedly that he did nothing wrong. He told reporters Monday that he intervened in the Lavalin case in hopes of preserving thousands of Canadian jobs but never challenged the independence of Canada's judiciary or the rule of law. ""This matter is to be determined by the attorney general,"" he said.",Top Aide To Canada's Trudeau Pushes Back Amid Brewing Political Scandal,Npr.org,https://www.npr.org/2019/03/06/700827370/top-aide-to-canadas-trudeau-pushes-back-amid-brewing-political-scandal

The Vancouver-area race was largely seen as a test of Singh's leadership, as he faced off against Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee, a former B.C. MLA, and Conservative candidate Jay Shin, a lawyer and newcomer to politics.

In 2017, Singh made history when he became the first non-white leader of a major Canadian federal party. Since then, he's led the NDP without a federal seat.

In his victory speech on Monday night, Singh said it was a ""new day.""

""When I was growing up I could have never imagined someone like me running for prime minister, but guess what we just told a lot of kids out there that yes, you can,"" he said.

""And I know that carries a lot of responsibility and I understand that responsibility and I want you to know that when I take my seat in the House of Commons I will work very hard to make you all very proud.""

Singh touts health care, housing

While Singh highlighted some of the issues critical to Burnaby South, he also touted a national platform — calling for expanded health coverage, building half a million affordable housing units across Canada, transitioning to a green economy, and working towards reconciliation with Indigenous communities.

Watch part of Jagmeet Singh's victory speech here:

NDP leader rallies supporters after Burnaby South win, calls for change in Ottawa 1:18

Singh criticized the Liberals and Conservatives and called out the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

He also addressed growing distrust of immigration.

""New Canadians and people who are fleeing are not responsible for the problems that we're faced with,"" he said.

""We'll address that uncertainty and fear by giving people something to hope, something to dream.""

With all polls reporting, the NDP claimed 39 per cent of the vote, the Liberals 26 per cent, the Conservatives 22.5 per cent, and the People's Party 10.6 per cent.

Just under 29 per cent of registered voters cast a ballot, not including electors who registered on election day.

Rough Liberal ride

The Liberals usually put up a strong showing in Burnaby. In the 2015 federal election, the Liberals came within 547 votes of the winning NDP candidate, Kennedy Stewart, who resigned the seat in September 2018 for a successful run at Vancouver's mayoralty.

But this time around, they faced challenges in the campaign.

Their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online.

In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin — a scandal Singh alluded to in his speech.

""We have eight more months to let the people know we have a government … that doesn't give handouts to SNC-Lavalin, but stands up for everyday Canadians,"" he said.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says Canada can make different choices and get better results 1:59

But Lee, who replaced Wang as the Liberal candidate in January, said that as he went door-to-door constituents were concerned with local issues like housing and transportation, not the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

He said the Liberals ran a strong campaign and he is considering running again in the fall.

""I look forward to more debate ... in elections, sometimes it's difficult to get the message across so I believe in the fall [it will] be much better.""

Singh addresses Quebec

The NDP also faced a test in the Montreal-area riding of Outremont on Monday, which was vacated by the party's former leader, Thomas Mulcair. Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan was the successful candidate in that riding.

Singh made a special pitch to Quebec, saying he knew Outremont would be a tough riding, but that the NDP supports legislation supported by many Quebecers, primarily surrounding green energy and the environment.

The NDP has struggled since Singh became leader in 2017. The party now sits at 14 per cent nationally, 11 per cent in Quebec and 16 per cent in B.C., according to CBC's Poll Tracker.

No doubt, SAD had been ignoring me since long and even they had stopped calling me for party meetings, but still I remained active in the area and did lot of development works in the area for my constituency.”

About local leadership and ticket aspirants opposing Ghubaya, Jakhar said,”I am aware of the opposition from within the Congress against Ghubaya, the same has been conveyed to the party president. Now, the final decision lies with the AICC president. No doubt he is also in the race of ticket seekers from Ferozepur and his name will also be considered along with others.”

Ghubaya had defeated Sunil Jakhar in 2014 Lok Sabha polls with a margin of 31,420 votes on a Shiromani Akali Dal ticket. In 2009, he had defeated Congress’s Jagmeet Brar with more 20,000 votes. Jagmeet is not part of Congress anymore. Ferozepur Lok Sabha constituency has about 3.5 lakh of Arora community voters while an equal number of Rai Sikh voters. Nearly 1.5 lakh votes belong to the Bagria community. Kamboj and Jatt Sikh too have a considerable share. Out of nearly 13.5 lakh votes, more than 5 lakh are of SC vote bank (Rai Sikh and Bagria community) and Ghubaya himself is a Rai Sikh.

Punjab Minister Rana Sodhi, who is a ticket aspirant, stated,”One cannot win elections banking on just one or two communities. You need to be liked by all.” Asked if he will contest as an Independent candidate if Congress denies him ticket, Ghubaya said,”Let the ticket be announced.

Jagmeet Singh, the leader of Canada's New Democrats Party (NDP), has won his first seat in parliament after a by-election bid in British Columbia.

The party premier secured 38% of votes in a closely-watched race in Burnaby, east of Vancouver.

Mr Singh, 40, is the first ethnic minority to lead a major federal party in the country.

His win comes ahead of general elections in October and is seen as a boost for his leadership.

""Friends, we made history today,"" he told supporters after learning the results. ""Guess what? We just told a lot of kids out there that yes, you can.""

His new seat, Burnaby-South, opened up after fellow NDP member Kennedy Stewart resigned to become mayor of Vancouver.

The town's election race made headlines in January after Liberal candidate Karen Wang stepped down after making remarks about Mr Singh that some said amounted to racism.

Ms Wang wrote a post on the website WeChat in which she said that as the only Chinese candidate in the race she stood a good chance of winning, and pointed out Mr Singh's Indian descent.

Announcing her resignation, she said her ""choice of words wasn't well-considered and didn't reflect my intent"", but she denied that they were racist.

Mr Singh is a practising Sikh and former provincial Ontario legislator, and became leader of the centre-left party in 2017 despite no experience of federal politics. During the NDP's leadership campaign, a video of his reaction to an angry heckler at a campaign rally went viral.

Despite success in Burnaby, the NDP failed to secure seats in Canada's two other by-elections. Liberal contender Rachel Bendayan ousted the party from Montreal's Outremont constituency, which the NDP had held for over a decade.

The Conservatives also held onto seat in the Ontario constituency of York-Simcoe.

By-elections are held in Canada when a seat is vacated by a member of Parliament (MP) between general elections.

What does this mean for the coming election?

Monday's victory was a necessary breakthrough for Mr Singh's leadership, which had been undermined by poor polling, fundraising difficulties, and internal party divisions.

The NDP has never held power and is currently the third place party in Canada's Parliament, holding 40 of 338 seats in the House of Commons. A quarter of its MPs who won seats in the 2015 election have either resigned or announced they are not running again in October.

In an interview with CTV last month, former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair said ""it would be extremely difficult for Mr. Singh to stick around"" if his parliamentary bid failed.

But losing the seat in Outremont to the Liberals on Monday is still a blow for the party.

That seat, which was won by Mr Mulcair in 2007, was a foothold in the vote-rich province of Quebec and helped launch the so-called ""Orange Wave"" of support for the NDP in 2011.

With more than half the polls reporting results in Burnaby South, Singh had just over 38 per cent of the vote, comfortably ahead of Liberal Richard T. Lee’s 26 per cent and Conservative Jay Shin’s 22 per cent.

But while victory tightens Singh’s shaky grip on the reins of the NDP, the challenge ahead was underscored by the simultaneous loss of the Montreal riding that launched the NDP’s orange wave that swept Quebec in 2011.

In Outremont, Liberal contender Rachel Bendayan held more than 42 per cent of the vote with two-thirds of the riding’s polls reporting results, with the NDP’s Julia Sanchez running second with just over 25 per cent.

Outremont was a longtime Liberal stronghold until 2007, when former NDP leader Tom Mulcair scored an upset byelection victory for the NDP, creating a beachhead for the New Democrats that helped them launch their 2011 sweep of Quebec and vault them into official Opposition status for the first time in party history.

The Conservatives, meanwhile, easily hung onto the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe.

Conservative candidate Scot Davidson captured just over 50 per cent of the vote with a majority of polls reporting results, with Liberal Shaun Tanaka taking 31 per cent.

View full coverage …,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh urged his caucus on Wednesday to “double down” on their efforts to unseat the Trudeau Liberals in the eight months left to the next election.

An enthusiastic Singh, who hugged, hive-fived and spoke to members of his caucus for the first time Wednesday morning since winning a seat in the riding of Burnaby South, spun a message that the NDP is a party focused on people while the Liberals side with big companies.

Preliminary results from Elections Canada show Singh was able to win the B.C. riding with 39 per cent of the vote – a success that means he will now be able to challenge Trudeau in the Commons for the first time since becoming leader in October 2017.

ANALYSIS: A bittersweet byelection night for Singh’s NDP and a warning for Scheer’s Conservatives

“I’ll be fighting for the things that matter to people,” he said to a room of MPs and supporters visibly elated by his recent win. “But I need you all to be a part of this. Together, we can put Canada on a new course.”

Singh said Canadians gave Justin Trudeau a chance, but the prime minister is too busy “doing favours for corporate friends,” alluding to the controversy involving Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

“From changing the law to get powerful executives off the hook, to giving billions in subsidies to the oil and gas (sector), to protecting the profits of pharmaceutical industries while keeping drug prices high,” Singh said.

“It’s clear: Justin Trudeau is not on our side, he’s not on your side – he’s on their’s.”

Since taking over the reins of the NDP from Tom Mulcair, Singh has faced external and internal questions about his effectiveness as the NDP’s popular support and fundraising slid.

Members of his caucus, however, were repeatedly on their feet in celebration of Singh during the part of Wednesday’s meeting opened up to media.

Veteran B.C. MP Nathan Cullen said there was a palpable sense of relief and optimism in the room.

“There’s a feeling that, with the kind of message that we have, the opportunity is there for us,” Cullen said in an interview.

“It is beyond just the symbolism of him winning a seat. This is Canada’s first racialized leader of a federal party. The new face of the NDP is diverse and strong and unapologetically progressive.”

439,Empty,2019-02-26T02:50:16Z,​Polls have closed in the Burnaby South byelection that will determine whether NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh will win a seat in the House of Commons.,"For the first time, federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has a seat in the House of Commons, after claiming victory in a high-stakes byelection in Burnaby South.

The Vancouver-area race was largely seen as a test of Singh's leadership, as he faced off against Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee, a former B.C. MLA, and Conservative candidate Jay Shin, a lawyer and newcomer to politics.

In 2017, Singh made history when he became the first non-white leader of a major Canadian federal party. Since then, he's led the NDP without a federal seat.

In his victory speech on Monday night, Singh said it was a ""new day.""

""When I was growing up I could have never imagined someone like me running for prime minister, but guess what we just told a lot of kids out there that yes, you can,"" he said.

""And I know that carries a lot of responsibility and I understand that responsibility and I want you to know that when I take my seat in the House of Commons I will work very hard to make you all very proud.""

Singh touts health care, housing

While Singh highlighted some of the issues critical to Burnaby South, he also touted a national platform — calling for expanded health coverage, building half a million affordable housing units across Canada, transitioning to a green economy, and working towards reconciliation with Indigenous communities.

Watch part of Jagmeet Singh's victory speech here:

Singh criticized the Liberals and Conservatives and called out the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

He also addressed growing distrust of immigration.

""New Canadians and people who are fleeing are not responsible for the problems that we're faced with,"" he said.

""We'll address that uncertainty and fear by giving people something to hope, something to dream.""

With all polls reporting, the NDP claimed 39 per cent of the vote, the Liberals 26 per cent, the Conservatives 22.5 per cent, and the People's Party 10.6 per cent.

Just under 29 per cent of registered voters cast a ballot, not including electors who registered on election day.

Rough Liberal ride

The Liberals usually put up a strong showing in Burnaby. In the 2015 federal election, the Liberals came within 547 votes of the winning NDP candidate, Kennedy Stewart, who resigned the seat in September 2018 for a successful run at Vancouver's mayoralty.

But this time around, they faced challenges in the campaign.

Their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online.

In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin — a scandal Singh alluded to in his speech.

""We have eight more months to let the people know we have a government … that doesn't give handouts to SNC-Lavalin, but stands up for everyday Canadians,"" he said.

But Lee, who replaced Wang as the Liberal candidate in January, said that as he went door-to-door constituents were concerned with local issues like housing and transportation, not the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

He said the Liberals ran a strong campaign and he is considering running again in the fall.

""I look forward to more debate ... in elections, sometimes it's difficult to get the message across so I believe in the fall [it will] be much better.""

Singh addresses Quebec

The NDP also faced a test in the Montreal-area riding of Outremont on Monday, which was vacated by the party's former leader, Thomas Mulcair. Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan was the successful candidate in that riding.

Singh made a special pitch to Quebec, saying he knew Outremont would be a tough riding, but that the NDP supports legislation supported by many Quebecers, primarily surrounding green energy and the environment.

The NDP has struggled since Singh became leader in 2017. The party now sits at 14 per cent nationally, 11 per cent in Quebec and 16 per cent in B.C., according to CBC's Poll Tracker.

Not so fast. In another letter to Housefather sent Tuesday, Wilson-Raybould said the freedom the Liberal government gave her to speak through an Order in Council “falls far short of what is required” if Canadians are to learn all the facts. That’s because the order only covered her time as attorney-general, but still limits her from speaking about events that happened after she was shuffled to veterans affairs or what she told cabinet after she resigned.

Now that the NDP leader will have a seat in Parliament, can he still turn around the party's fortunes before this year's federal election?","With his win in the federal byelection in Burnaby South, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has an opportunity to put to rest some of his doubters both outside the NDP and, more importantly, within. Now that he has a seat in the House of Commons, Singh can reset his leadership and move on from a challenging beginning.

This byelection win also comes at a fortuitous time as the SNC-Lavalin controversy continues to undermine Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s credibility with progressive voters, while Conservative leader Andrew Scheer’s increasingly populist and anti-immigrant rhetoric potentially alienates members of Canada’s diaspora communities.

As any scholar of the Canadian left or long-suffering New Democrat can tell you, whenever the NDP shows weakness, pundits and Liberal commentators come out of the woodwork to herald the NDP’s inevitable demise and Canada’s return to two-party politics.

NDP has faced oblivion before

The federal NDP came closest to political oblivion in 1993, when its caucus was reduced to nine members in the face of Jean Chrétien’s Liberal wave. Even then, the NDP persevered and came back to fight another day. And even if Singh had lost the byelection, the NDP would have survived, but its time in the wilderness would likely have been extended and Singh’s leadership would have been threatened.

When Singh was decisively elected leader of the NDP in October 2017, New Democrats and progressive Canadians were right to be optimistic. Over the course of the leadership campaign, he galvanized supporters around a hopeful message reminiscent of Jack Layton’s leadership. His campaign also held out the promise that he could effect inroads into Canada’s diverse and vote-rich suburban communities.

Almost immediately after his election however, things seemed to turn sour for the new leader. Not only did Singh have to contend with multiple controversies within his caucus, NDP fundraising —already anemic in the aftermath of the disappointing results of the 2015 federal election —continued to decline. This was of particular concern because of the extra costs the party had to bear paying Singh’s salary and travel, costs that would have been covered by the House of Commons had he already held a seat.

A polarized electorate

Singh has also had to deal with the potential polarization of the election question as a choice between Trudeau’s progressive Canada and the increasingly divisive and nativist Canada envisioned by the Conservatives.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang

There is still every possibility that the coming federal election could again see the Liberals wrap themselves in a progressive banner and squeeze the NDP out of a two-party race, but now that Singh has a seat in Parliament, he will be better able to insert himself into that debate.

The importance of this byelection win is that it allows Singh to draw a hard line under the first 17 months of his leadership. Even before the byelection was called, Singh had already started to make changes in personnel and direction that bode well for his future.

In November, the NDP announced that Jennifer Howard would be taking over as Singh’s new chief of staff. Howard has held multiple cabinet appointments in the Manitoba governments of Gary Doer and Greg Selinger, at one point serving as finance minister, but, more importantly, has held staff and leadership positions at all levels of the NDP. She represents the experience and wealth of political knowledge that was seen as lacking.

It is also important to remember that Singh is still relatively new to the job and has time to recover. In this regard, the recent history of the NDP can provide some context.

Layton needed eight years

When he was elected leader of the NDP in January 2003, Jack Layton was a more experienced politician, having served as a Toronto City and Metro councillor for over 20 years. Yet it still took him eight years to create the conditions that allowed the NDP to make its breakthrough in the 2011 federal election.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck

Layton avoided some of Singh’s early mistakes, selecting leadership rival and veteran MP Bill Blaikie (whom I worked for at the time) as his parliamentary leader, for example, but he started with a much smaller caucus without a presence in Québec and with only a minimal presence in Ontario.

There’s no question that Singh’s first year did not go as planned. The momentum and excitement that surrounded his election as leader could have boosted fundraising, mobilized members and helped establish his presence on the national stage. And Singh’s slow start could ultimately end up affecting his ability to succeed in the future.

Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh won the Burnaby South byelection on Monday night with 39 per cent of the vote – but he is getting a great deal of attention for his rap game on Tuesday.

A huge crowd of supporters turned up to support Singh for this critical moment in his political career. Following the win, elated supporters turned the event room into a dance party.

“I will be your champion,” Singh said. “I will take each and every one of you to Ottawa. I will fight for you in the House of Commons.”

Of course, many people were dancing, but one of the night’s highlights was Singh rapping Post Malone’s “Congratulations.” Not only was he rapping some of the lyrics, but he also passionately pumped up the crowd. In fact, Singh got so into the beat that he started motioning to the crowd to jump when the chorus dropped, and he proceeded to jump on the platform.

Singh, the first visible minority leader of a major federal party, said that when he was growing up, he never imagined seeing someone who looked like him running to be the prime minister of Canada.

“We just showed a lot of kids out there that yes we can,” he said, borrowing a slogan from former U.S. President Barack Obama.

Nine months after the body came into being, SJOBA organised its first Scooter Motorcycle SJOBA Rally on March 8, 1981. While the first edition of the rally saw more than 40 riders competing, the second edition also saw the introduction of cars and jeeps in. The rally, which started as a one-day long affair, will see its 32nd edition being held over three days starting March 1 later this year

“The first meeting of SJOBA was held with 19 members on July 19, 1981 and the founding members were keen on organising a sporting event. Unlike other sports, motorsports gives an opportunity to a young rider to compete against an older rider and vice versa; this was the main reason we decided to hold the first SJOBA Rally in March, 1982.,” recalls Sarin, adding how he would accompany his brother Ranjit Lal Sarin to chalk out the route. “We also came out with a souvenir publication, which we used to raise funds for advertisements to conduct the rally,” adds Sarin.

The first rally, which was flagged off from the St John’s High School, Sector 26, was meant only for the scooter/motorbikes. The four-wheelers were introduced in the second edition. The first route of the rally saw riders traversing from Chandigarh to Kasauli-Dagshai-Chail and back to Chandigarh on the same day.

This year, the rally will be conducted for the first time in the plains with the new route covering places like Baddi in Himachal Pradesh and Garshankar in Punjab apart from seeing a night stage.

“We started with the stage format and a couple of women riders too competed in the second edition of the rally. As the number of participants grew in the coming years, we made it a two-day affair in 1996. After getting the affiliation with Federation of Motor Sports Club of India (FMSCI) in 2000, we also introduced the time-speed-distance (TSD) format in 2007 apart from converting the rally to a three-day long drive in 2006, which meant that the city residents could also see the rallyists in action. Nowadays, more and more riders are competing in the TSD format too and that is good for rallying. This year we have also introduced the night stage apart from conducting the rally in plains in Punjab,” said SPS Ghai, one of the founding members of SJOBA.

Champions Speak

With rallyists like five-time SJOBA champion Suresh Rana to celebrities like Gul Panag, the rally has seen some of India’s top ranked rallyists in its 31 editions. Rana, who is a multiple winner of Raid-De-Himalaya, will be making his return to SJOBA this year after missing the rally for some years. “The best thing about SJOBA Rally is that it helps you prepare for the more tougher rallies with the same kind of terrain and competitiveness. It is a short rally in terms of number of days as well as route but that makes it more competitive too. I am making a return to the rally after some years and I will be driving a Gypsy this time instead of Grand Vitara. The fact that the rally is being held in plains will make the rally more open and it will be a exciting thing to compete in the night stage too,” shares Rana, who is based in Manali.

Kalka biker Mohit Verma, a three-time winner in the rally in the motorbikes format with his first title coming in 2011, sees the rally as a big stepping stone in his racing career. 28-year-old Verma, who became the only Indian rider to win the Raid-De-Himalaya, Desert Storm, Dakshin Dare and SJOBA Rally in 2014, is currently away from the circuit due to an injury.

“If you are a beginner, the SJOBA Rally puts you in competition against experienced riders and a rider can take him time to master the format and return back strong in the next edition. When I won the title in 2011, it was one of my first titles and gave me a lot of confidence. In 2014, when I won the titles in all the rallies, it meant a lot for me. I suffered an injury in 2015 but those wins are always special for me,” shared Verma. Two-time winner in TSD format, Jagmeet Gill also believes the same. “Winning the rally twice in the TSD format as a former student means a lot for me. I had competed for the first time in 2009 in the rally. As a rallyist, one enjoys the tough competition in this rally,” shared 34-year-old Gill.

Woman Power

Over the years, SJOBA Rally has seen more than 50 women participants competing as riders as well as navigators. Last year, the rally saw riders like Sarah Kashyap, Anita Krishan and Suzanne Bull competing in the Extreme Moto category apart from some woman riders in the TSD format. Kashyap, who had moved to Dubai last year, is the only Indian female rider to complete Raid-De-Himalaya and Desert Storm.

The 33-year-old competed for the first time in the rally in 2015 while riding a Bullet. Last year, Kashyap finished first in the ladies category and 11th overall in Moto Extreme category. “I first heard about SJOBA rally when I was kid. I never thought I will compete in the rally one day. When I competed in the rally in 2015, it was my first rally ever and I had never raced before that. I kept falling off the motorbike and I even got a heat stroke after which the organsiers asked me if I wanted to continue. I got an appreciation award that year and it motivated me. I have competed in the rally three times so far and it has laid the foundation for many cross-country rallies for me. It was easily the stepping stone for Raid-De-Himalaya and Desert Storm and taught me the required skills. The rally has new routes every year and it poses fresh challenges every year,” shares Kashyap.

Former Miss India and Bollywood actress Gul Panag too competed in the TSD format in the rally in 2010 with her two cousins and an aunt. Panag acted as the navigator for her cousin Simrat and they won the event in the women’s category in TSD format. “It was an experience to remember for all of us. My team consisted of my two cousins and aunt and all four of us competed in the TSD format. Being the navigator, I was responsible for guiding my cousin about the route and also keep a track of others things. It was a different challenge in every stage and we enjoyed a lot competing in such a rally. It is good to see more and more women riders competing in such events,” shares Panag.

Logistics Control

There is a lot of logistics involved in the rally that sees close to 80 riders competing in the 4WD Extreme, Moto Extreme and TSD categories apart from spectators stage SSS.

Vishal Sharma, the present president of SJOBA, says their task begins with charting out the route. “The chalking of route begins 40-50 days prior to the rally and we do the recce of the whole route more than five times. Then there is the task of making rule books and log books for the route. Once I was officiating as a marshal and sitting on a hill top. A group of monkeys came and took my equipment,” he laughs.

Another SJOBA member Vivek Bansal handles the communication part of the rally which means setting up the communication channels and radio for the drivers. “I am Ham Radio operator and the toughest part in SJOBA rally is to provide coverage in the valleys. Most of the times, we sit on hilltops to get full coverage. Once while officiating at Barog, we had a slide shave when lightning struck my radio and other equipment,” shares Bansal.

Kshitij Sharma, secretary, SJOBA, too has seen the action from close. “This year, more than 140 SJOBA members will act as volunteers and we have got close to 80 entries. The event has been successful because of the efforts of all the members as well as riders,” says Sharma.

The Way Ahead

With new sponsors supporting the rally, it will see the night stage happening this year. As Manmohan Lal Sarin proudly shows the first souvenir, he is quick to add, “The rallying gods have been kind to us in all these years. Apart from one incident in the starting years when a car skidded down and the death of a rider in an accident some years later, the rally has been conducted smoothly. When a rallyist died in an accident, we were deeply saddened and thought about discontinuing the rally.

But then Brother Meredith told us to remain calm and see it as a mishap, which can take place in any sport. When the car of a competitor fell into a khud, Jimmy Sehgal, one of the competitors and leader at that point, stopped and helped the rider. Such heartwarming incidents have given strength to the organisers and rallyists.”

‘My first win at SJOBA will always be special’

SPS Garcha, 65, still remembers the first time he competed in the SJOBA rally. It was the first edition of the rally in 1981 and the 1971 batch alumnus of St John’s was also actively involved in organising the rally. Garcha, who started competing in motorsports in 1977, became the first winner of the Scooter/Motorbike Open SJOBA Rally in 1981 and went on to become the national champion for five successive years from 1982 to 1987.

Garcha won the rally on a Jawa motorcyle and was told not to compete in the following editions of the rally to give others a chance.

“I was actively involved in planning the route and doing the recce for the rally. I used to have a 1966 JAWA motorbike at that time. After the first stage in the morning, we had lunch at Solan with me in the lead but on the eay back , my bike’s rear brakes got heated. As the route was uphill, I removed the brakes and continued. Riding uphill does not require much of rear brakes and when I reached Barog, the brakes had cooled down and I completed the last stage. I have very find memories of my first win,” says Garcha.

The motorsports champion also used to run a garage in those days. The following years saw him working closely with the Federation of Motor Sports Club of India (FMSCI) and officiating in many rallies besides working as the federation’s regional director. A senior steward and technical delegate with FMSCI, the former rallyist is still involved in charting the route and officiating at the SJOBA Rally. “In the 1980s, we would read books and magzines to learn about various rules and the various formats of a rally. Since the rally was held only in Stage Rally format, it would mean spending hours chalking out the route and understanding the map. There was less traffic and most of the roads were tracks. Despite tech advancements, the core of the racing has remained intact. That’s why a lot of new riders compete every year,” adds Garcha.

Looking back at his long and adventurous innings, Garcha remembers an incident during the Raid De Himalaya. “I was officiating as one of the stewards of the course when one of the cars did not cross the next point. Knowing that something was wrong, we reversed and sure enough, I saw skid marks. It was close to midnight but we launched a search for the car.

Jagmeet Singh could lead the NDP to victory in the federal election this fall, but only if the party re-engages with its socialist roots, according to a former NDP MPP.

""We're looking at polls that say that socialism, as a word, is now more popular than capitalism for millennials,"" said Cheri DiNovo, who served for 11 years as an Ontario NDP MPP.

She told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti that to capture those votes, the NDP doesn't need ""slippery language,"" but needs to stand ""on firm socialist ground."" The party needs to espouse positions like ""being very adamant about our opposition to pipelines, being very pro about doing something for the environment,"" she added.

""We need to take stands that are in dramatic contrast to liberalism, and neo-liberalism and centrism … no one needs another Liberal party.

""And ... if we do that, yes, I think we'll win.""

Singh won a byelection in Burnaby South, B.C., Monday, with 39 per cent of the vote. He will take a seat in the House of Commons for the first time. His win was balanced against an NDP loss to the Liberals in another byelection in Outremont, Que, the centre of the so-called Orange Wave that boosted the NDP to Official Opposition status in 2011, for the first time in its history.

NDP leader rallies supporters after Burnaby South win, calls for change in Ottawa 1:18

The party now sits at 14 per cent nationally, 11 per cent in Quebec and 16 per cent in B.C., according to CBC's poll tracker.

""The bad news is we've halved our polling in Quebec. The bad news is we're losing MPs who are not running again. That's the bad news,"" said DiNovo.

""The good news is that this … could be a reboot and that Jagmeet's completely capable of being a leader in such a reboot, if and only if, the party starts focusing on policies and starts focusing on principles.""

To discuss the byelection results and what lies ahead for the NDP, Tremonti was joined by:

Ed Broadbent, former leader of the federal NDP, and chair of the Broadbent Institute

Farouk Karim, who served as press secretary for the federal NDP caucus until 2016, and now works for the Canadian Union of Postal Workers

Cheri DiNovo, who served for 11 years as an Ontario NDP MPP, and is now the minister at Trinity-St. Paul's Centre for Faith, Justice and the Arts in Toronto

""I will have been doing it for nearly seven years by the time the next election comes along and I think it's time to pass the torch,"" Rankin said in an interview with CBC News.

""I wasn't prepared to spend the next four years doing this. I thought at this stage, I wanted to do other things with my life aside from politics.""

""Not to say this hasn't been the most exciting and rewarding career that I've ever had, but it's time for a change.""

Rankin is the 12th NDP MP out of the 44 elected in 2015 to resign or announce in recent months that they won't run again in October. Others, like B.C. MP Nathan Cullen, have said they are also weighing their futures in politics.

With eight months to the next election, the New Democrats are in third place with an estimated 14.2 per cent of support, compared with 35.8 per cent for the Conservatives and 33.9 per cent for the Liberals.

'People are saying we've got a strong leader'

Rankin said his decision has nothing to do with the party's popularity or the leadership of Singh, who was elected to the House of Commons on Monday in a byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

""I think people are saying we've got a strong leader as well and as soon as Canadians get to know him better I think there's going to be an enormous uptick in support, and I think we're in a good position for the next election.""

Rankin said those who are leaving have a variety of reasons.

""Transition happens all the time in a party. I don't think the narrative that people are abandoning the NDP team is really warranted. It's certainly not relevant in my case. That's not the reason I have decided to move on.""

Rankin's announcement comes as he is in the spotlight as a key member of the justice committee examining allegations key government officials pressured former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin. (Chris Wattie/Reuters)

While the NDP has held the riding of Victoria since 2006, Rankin's departure could create an opportunity for Elizabeth May's Green Party.

Rankin was first elected in a byelection in November 2012, narrowly beating a Green Party candidate by less than three percentage points. While he increased his margin of victory in 2015 to more than nine percentage points, Green Party candidate Jo-Ann Roberts was a close second, with the Liberals and the Conservatives lagging far behind.

Rankin's riding also borders May's riding of Saanich-Gulf Islands and is represented provincially by B.C. Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver.

While Rankin acknowledges the Green Party posted one of its strongest results across the country in his riding in the last election, he said voters would be better off voting for whoever succeeds him as the NDP candidate — particularly if that candidate is a strong advocate for the environment.

""If you're caring deeply about these issues, where do you think you're going to have the most clout in Ottawa? Being part of a team that may have the balance of power in the next Parliament, the NDP? Or a team that has, so far, one member?""

Unpopular Liberal decisions

Rankin said the riding also has a base of Liberal support but he said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has made decisions that are unpopular in the riding.

""There's a lot of disenchantment with the fact the electoral reform didn't go through. The pipeline issue — I would be lying to you if I didn't say that was an enormous obstacle for the Liberals on Vancouver Island. People are just not prepared to take chances with our coastline.""

Rankin's announcement comes as circumstances have thrust him into the spotlight as a key point person for the NDP in what he describes as a ""constitutional crisis"" — former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's assertion that key government officials pressured her to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with Quebec construction giant SNC-Lavalin which is facing charges of fraud and corruption.

He is also the NDP's deputy house leader and a member of the highly secret National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians.

While he plans to serve out his mandate, Rankin has already been appointed by the B.C. government to help guide and design a new reconciliation process with Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs who have been opposing a natural gas pipeline in Northern B.C. and implement the Supreme Court's Delgamuukw, decision which helped define indigenous title.

""The new government in Victoria, I'm very proud of the fact that they're committed to trying to do things differently. They have, in their speech from the throne, committed to the UN Declaration on the rights of Indigenous people. They talk about implementing the historic Delgamuukw case and to be given an opportunity to do that is something I couldn't say no to.""

A lawyer by profession, he is also thinking of once again teaching law at the University of Victoria and has been approached by law firms to practice environmental and Indigenous law.

But for now he is focused on completing his mandate and getting to the bottom of the SNC-Lavalin case.

""There's a lot of work to do here. We're living through a constitutional crisis right now in the House of Commons. … We're dealing with issues that are absolutely historic and important so that will take a lot of my time.""

Finally. More than 16 months after he cruised to victory in the NDP leadership race, the 40-year-old politician from Ontario clinched his first federal seat in a British Columbia byelection Monday.

Not only will Singh now be able to lead his party from the floor of the House of Commons, he may also have saved his political career, for defeat in Burnaby South on Monday — as many NDP insiders have put it — was simply not an option for the third-place party. Singh’s victory came in one of three byelections held Monday, as voters in key battleground areas cast ballots against the backdrop of the lingering SNC-Lavalin scandal. In York-Simcoe, the Conservatives hold onto a Greater Toronto Area riding that has been a lock for the party since 2004. And here in Outremont, a diverse and multilingual district at the heart of the Island of Montreal, voters returned to their long-established tradition of electing Liberals, 12 years after Thomas Mulcair’s breakthrough here became the symbolic forerunner to the unprecedented success of the “orange wave” election in 2011.

The NDP leader campaigned against a Liberal government he accuses of cosying up to corporate friends, falling short on affordable housing and failing to take climate change seriously. The riding was previously held by Kennedy Stewart, an NDP MP who won by about 500 votes in 2015 and resigned the seat last year to run for Vancouver mayor. David Coletto, chief executive officer of Abacus Data, said a Singh victory is the first bit of good news the NDP has had in a long time. Under Singh’s leadership — which began when he cruised to victory in the October 2017 leadership race — the NDP has stalled in the polls, seen a parade of sitting MPs quit or announce they won’t run again in the general election, and experienced a sharp drop in fundraising from more than $18 million in 2015 to roughly $5 million last year.

Singh’s entry to the House of Commons gives the party a chance to change the narrative, Coletto said. “It gives them a huge opportunity to pivot and to start rebuilding his own reputation,” he said. “Low expectations can be a really powerful tool, because it’s easier to meet them.” Singh’s chances may have been boosted by the SNC-Lavalin scandal, which the NDP has used to portray the Liberals as a band of faux-progressive allies of big business. Combined with a Liberal stumble — candidate Karen Wang was replaced by former MLA Richard Lee partway through the race — and the possibility that People’s Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson snags votes from the Conservatives’ Jay Shin, the riding looked primed for a Singh win, said political scientist David Moscrop. “Burnaby South is sort of cooked for him to win,” he said Monday morning. Meanwhile, the results in York-Simcoe pointed to victory for Conservative candidate Scot Davidson. For 14 years, the riding north of Toronto was home to Peter Van Loan, a Harper-era cabinet minister who resigned from the House of Commons last year. That continued Monday with Davidson on pace to beat Liberal challenger — and second-time candidate — Shaun Tanaka. With such a record of Conservative voting, Coletto said he is looking to see how Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party — and local candidate Robert Geurts — performs in the riding. “The most important signal we get from tonight is how well does Max Bernier’s party do,” he said, adding the party could make an impact in all three byelections. “That will give us an indication of the potential effectiveness of his party,” he said. Meanwhile, Outremont was a Liberal stronghold for decades, until Mulcair won it for the NDP in a 2007 byelection. It is therefore hallowed turf for New Democrats, who see Mulcair’s success as the symbolic toehold for the “orange wave” in 2011, when the party was lifted to its best-ever federal election result by overwhelming success in Quebec. But now that Mulcair has left politics, local lawyer Rachel Bendayan wrested Outremont back for the Liberals Monday night. By late Monday, she had a sizable lead over Julia Sanchez, an economist who worked for decades in international development, who campaigned on an environment-focused platform for the NDP. One factor in the race may have been voter reaction to the SNC-Lavalin affair, which has a strong local component given the company is headquartered nearby in downtown Montreal and is a significant employer in the province. Shachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute not-for-profit polling firm, said while early polling has suggested the Liberals have taken a hit during the controversy, SNC-Lavalin is seen in a different light — as a big employer worth saving — by many in the province. But regardless of its impact Monday, it is too early to conclude whether the controversy surrounding the company and Justin Trudeau’s office will linger into the fall general election, Moscrop said. “I think this is a reminder to the Liberals that, boy, you don’t want this in the news in October,” he said. “The sooner you deal with this completely, the better.” Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

An enthusiastic Singh, who hugged, high-fived and spoke to members of his caucus for the first time Wednesday morning since winning a seat in the riding of Burnaby South, spun a message that the NDP is a party focused on people while the Liberals side with big companies.

Preliminary results from Elections Canada show Singh was able to win the B.C. riding with 39 per cent of the vote — a success that means he will now be able to challenge Trudeau in the Commons for the first time since becoming leader in October 2017.

""I'll be fighting for the things that matter to people,"" he said to a room of MPs and supporters visibly elated by his recent win. ""But I need you all to be a part of this. Together, we can put Canada on a new course.""

Singh said Canadians gave Justin Trudeau a chance, but the prime minister is too busy ""doing favours for corporate friends,"" alluding to the controversy involving Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

""From changing the law to get powerful executives off the hook, to giving billions in subsidies to the oil and gas (sector), to protecting the profits of pharmaceutical industries while keeping drug prices high,"" Singh said.

""It's clear: Justin Trudeau is not on our side, he's not on your side — he's on theirs.""

Under pressure

Since taking over the reins of the NDP from Tom Mulcair, Singh has faced external and internal questions about his effectiveness as the NDP's popular support and fundraising slid.

Members of his caucus, however, were repeatedly on their feet in celebration of Singh during the part of Wednesday's meeting opened up to media.

Veteran B.C. MP Nathan Cullen said there was a palpable sense of relief and optimism in the room.

""There's a feeling that, with the kind of message that we have, the opportunity is there for us,"" Cullen said in an interview.

""It is beyond just the symbolism of him winning a seat. This is Canada's first racialized leader of a federal party. The new face of the NDP is diverse and strong and unapologetically progressive.""

For his part, Singh told his caucus he didn't imagine that someone like him could ever run to be prime minister.

""My friends, we just sent a message to a lot of kids out there that yes, yes, they can,"" he said, prompting the room to burst into a round of applause.",Singh urges team to 'double down' in months leading up to October election,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jagmeet-singh-first-caucus-1.5035942

Big day today on Parliament Hill.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould is set to speak her truth about the SNC-Lavalin controversy this week—specifically, tomorrow,* when she appears before a justice committee that’s looking into whether the PMO tried to pressure her into going easy on SNC-Lavalin.

Will she light it up? If the former AG adds credible colour to the story being told by anonymous sources this past week, it will be a devastating day for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, writes Andrew MacDougall: “If you’re Trudeau, it’s hard to envision an appearance in which Wilson-Raybould doesn’t burn everything—Trudeau included—to the ground. There has been some serious red-on-red action on the nation’s front pages in the past few days, and only one side can survive.” (Maclean’s)

No, no, no: The men who wanted SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal prosecution engaged in “Grand-Master-Jedi-level gaslighting” of former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould by repeatedly refusing to accept her authority on the file and then insisting she was under no pressure, writes Anne Kingston:

Even before her testimony, however, an eerily familiar tale has unfolded, the last chapter in the spell-binding spiel from [Privy Council Clerk] Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, this week before the justice committee. And that’s the spectre of powerful men not used to hearing “No,” not willing to accept “No,” doggedly pushing for a “Yes” from the person who ostensibly determines consent, then gaslighting her when they don’t hear it. Through it all a question emerges: How many times did Jody Wilson Raybould need to say “No” before she was heard? (Maclean’s)

Singh needs this win: Monday is also byelection day. Votes will be counted in three ridings, including Ontario’s York-Simcoe and Outremont in Montreal. But the one everyone will be watching is Burnaby South, where NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh hopes to finally secure a seat in the House. With his leadership in question, and the NDP low on polling and fundraising support, Singh needs victory—and the SNC-Lavalin mess embroiling Liberals can only help “(Singh) may have been handed the gift of some voters as a result of all this,” saysRichard Johnston, a University of British Columbia political science professor. “Although it’s just one thing amongst many, boy, he could use a win right now.” (Canadian Press, CBC News)

Politics show round-up

Didn’t catch the weekend politics shows? Here’s what you missed:

In his testimony to the justice committee Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick attacked the original Globe and Mail story that kicked off the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Bob Fife, one of the journalists who broke the story, made the rounds, and on CTV’s Question Period defended the scoop: “In politics the best defence is often a strong offence, and particularly shooting the messenger, but in his testimony [Wernick] actually confirmed what we reported—we reported Miss Wilson-Raybould was subjected to pressure to cut a deal so SNC-Lavalin would not be prosecuted, would pay a fine. We did not say the Prime Minister directed her to do so. Nobody said that. In fact nobody did do that.” (CTV video tweet)

Speaking on Question Period Conservative Justice Critic Lisa Raitt said Wernick’s committee testimony shows lines were crossed with Wilson-Raybould: “Jody Wilson-Raybould told the prime minister and the clerk of the privy council in no uncertain terms she wasn’t going to overrule her deputy on the matter. That’s where it should end. And yet we see time and time again through phone calls through meetings between her staff and the PMO, the prime minister himself, Gerald Butts, and whoever else that we’ll find along the way, all took it upon themselves to go in and check-in with her and see whether or not she’s taken another decision.” (CTV News)

Following Friday’s recommendation by the National Energy Board that the Trans Mountain pipeline be approved, Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Ottawa is on track to wrap up consultations with 117 Indigenous committees that would be impacted by the pipeline within the next few months: “The work that we have done so far and the work we will continue to do in the coming months, I can tell you that I feel that we are in a very strong position to conclude these consultations within the next 90 days. But we must get it right.” (Global News)

On Trans Mountain, Canada’s fisheries minister Jonathan Wilkinson told CBC’s The House that increased tanker traffic from the pipeline expansion won’t have much additional impact on endangered southern resident killer whales because they’re already being blasted with underwater noise. “It’s important to understand that the plight of the southern resident killer whale has very little to do with the Trans Mountain pipeline, he said. “There are 3,200 large container ships that come into Burrard Inlet every year, there are thousands of ferries….

In the B.C. riding of Burnaby South, the NDP’s Jagmeet Singh celebrated a win that paves his way, after 16 months as leader, to a seat in the House of Commons.

To be fair to him, he won the prize through hope and hard work, and no one can ever take his newly won legitimacy away from him (at least not until October).

But the festivities did rather mask a crushing defeat in Outremont where the NDP lost the Quebec seat held by Tom Mulcair in three successive general elections. It also ignored a poor performance in the York-Simcoe byelection in the commuter belt north of Toronto, where the party recorded just 7.5 per cent of the vote.

The Liberals claimed the win in Outremont, taking an opposition seat for the third time in this Parliament — a feat not matched since 1908. It seems that Quebecers do appreciate the Herculean efforts being made by this Prime Minister to place their interests ahead of the rest of the country, on issues ranging from pipelines to the current SNC-Lavalin saga.

If the 18 point drop in support for the NDP in Outremont is repeated across the province in October, the Liberals could add another 10 to 15 seats to their tally. Yet there was a notable enthusiasm gap between 2015 and now that bodes ill for the party. In York-Simcoe, the Liberal vote share slipped significantly (to 29 per cent from 38 per cent) even though the candidate, Shaun Tanaka, was the same.

The Conservatives earned themselves a victory lap in York-Simcoe with Scot Davidson’s win. They will be delighted that Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party earned just 2 per cent of the vote in that riding and in Outremont.

If the 18 point drop in support for the NDP in Outremont is repeated across the province in October, the Liberals could add another 10 to 15 seats to their tally

But they will be disconcerted by the 11 per cent of the vote won by the PPC’s Laura-Lynn Thompson, a former Christian talk show host, in Burnaby. The average People’s Party vote across the three by-elections was 5.6 per cent — potentially the difference between victory and defeat for Andrew Scheer, if replicated in a general election.

Bernier professed himself “disappointed” with the results in Ontario and Quebec but said overall there were signs of progress for his five-month-old party. “This is the beginning of our journey. We are in it for the long haul,” he said.

That would be a fair prediction were it not for the fundamental contradiction at the core of Bernier’s populist party: it is led by a libertarian free-marketer and supported by anti-globalists. One day soon, his followers may realize they don’t share the same agenda as their leader.

Even the Greens could afford to be triumphant. Their candidate in Outremont, Daniel Green (bien sur), picked up 12.5 per cent of the vote, indicating an openness to trying something new among voters tired of a Liberal Party that has broken too many promises, a Conservative Party that is apathetic about climate change and an NDP that has appeared to be in disarray.

While all parties (except the Bloc) had something to cheer about, the real loser was Canadian democracy.

The York-Simcoe byelection is the first I can find on the Elections Canada website where voter turnout dipped below 20 per cent. Fewer than one in five eligible voters bothered to go to the polls, which is a pretty miserable state of affairs.

Outremont was only marginally better, at 21.4 per cent. Rachel Bendayan is now a member of the Canadian parliament having won just 6,086 votes. Every single councillor but one on Toronto city council received more votes in the 2018 municipal election.

The York-Simcoe byelection is the first I can find on the Elections Canada website where voter turnout dipped below 20 per cent

This reflects a level of disillusionment apparent among voters since the sunny ways of 2015, when turnout in the general election reached 68.5 per cent, 10 points up on the record low of 2008.

There is a debate among academics about the declining support for democracy among millennials.

One disconcerting graph that appeared in the Journal of Democracy in 2016 suggested that young people in Western countries like the U.S. and Great Britain are losing faith in democracy, with only one in four Americans born in the 1980s believing that “it is essential to live in a democracy.” That survey has been criticized for its methodology but even the critics agree that, on average, younger people assign lower value to democracy than the generation who lived, or whose parents lived, through the Second World War.

Canada wasn’t included in that study — and the 57 per cent turnout of 18-24 year olds in the 2015 election (up from 39 per cent in 2011) suggested it might be a beacon of hope.

But there has been decline in voter turnout since then, even judging by the historically low rate seen in byelections. One suspects the Liberals’ failure to deliver on specific promises like electoral reform and the more general pledge to “do politics differently” have not enamoured them to younger voters. Neither has the Conservative Party’s apparent disinterest in climate change inspired millennials to head to the polls.

Elections are determined by the people who show up. Studies done after the 2015 election suggest the Conservatives had — and likely still have — an advantage among voters older than 60.

Those people voted in large numbers in 2015 (78.8 per cent of 65-74 years olds voted) and electoral history suggests they will do so again this year.

That prospect may cheer Conservatives. But nobody should be upbeat about the fact that enthusiasm for government of the people, by the people, for the people is waning, and putting our democracy in peril.

The New Democrats secured a seat for their leader, Jagmeet Singh. The Liberals stole a riding away from the NDP in Quebec and the Conservatives increased their support in a GTA stronghold. The Greens and the People's Party each hit double digits in one of the three contests as well.

That's the good news. But there was bad news, too.

Both the Liberals and Conservatives saw their support slip in two out of three byelections. The NDP lost Outremont, the scene of the party's first breakthrough into Quebec in 2007 that foreshadowed the Orange Wave of 2011. And where the Greens and Maxime Bernier's party didn't hit double digits, they weren't a factor whatsoever.

So what to make of the glass-half-full, glass-half-empty results?

In his victory speech, Singh thanked supporters and promised to fight against poverty and continue his party's campaign for a universal pharmacare plan.

""And when I take my seat in the House of Commons, I will work hard to make you all very proud,"" Singh said.

Singh's win came in one of three federal byelections held Monday in B.C., Ontario and Quebec.

In Ontario's York—Simcoe riding, Conservative candidate Scot Davidson claimed victory, stepping into a seat long held by retired Conservative MP Peter Van Loan.

In the Montreal riding of Outremont, Liberal Rachel Bendayan won her campaign, taking control of a seat last held by former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair.

Results from Burnaby South in B.C., show Singh claimed victory with 39 per cent of the vote. The Liberals followed with 26 per cent, followed by the Conservatives with 22.5 per cent. Former Conservative MP Maxime Bernier's People's Party of Canada trailed with 10.6 per cent.

Singh also pledged to help the NDP ""reconnect"" with Quebec voters who have drifted away, in an effort to realize the political ambitions of the party's late leader, Jack Layton.

""We are the champions for Quebecers. New Democrats are the champions for Canadians, we will continue to do that work.""

Low turnout

The Conservatives secured their seat in the Ontario riding of York—Simcoe with 53.2 per cent of the vote to the Liberals' 29.9 per cent and the NDP's 7.4 per cent with 115 of 136 polls reporting.

Early numbers showed that turnout in all three byelections was low: just over 19 per cent in York—Simcoe and just over 18 per cent in Outremont. Burnaby South drew slightly larger numbers at 29 per cent, but all three fell below the average of the last 20 years which sits at just under 35 per cent for byelections.

Watch as Jagmeet Singh declares victory:

In Outremont — where the NDP was looking to hold on to the seat of the party's former leader — Bendayan claimed victory with 40 per cent of the vote. The NDP trailed with 26.1 per cent, followed by the Greens and then the Bloc Québécois.

""On behalf of Liberals across Canada, I want to congratulate Rachel Bendayan and her team on their hard-earned victory, and I know that she will be a dedicated voice for Outremont in Parliament,"" Suzanne Cowan, president of the Liberal Party of Canada, said in a statement.

Vancouver NDP MP Jenny Kwan acknowledged the loss of Outremont was ""a disappointment.""

""What we're going to do, of course, is learn from this experience and then we're going to redouble our efforts to ensure that the people of Quebec know we are there for them,"" she said at Singh's victory party.

The NDP has struggled since Singh became leader in 2017. The party now sits at 14 per cent nationally, 11 per cent in Quebec and 16 per cent in B.C., according to CBC's poll tracker.

Julia Sanchez, a former international development executive, was the NDP's candidate in Outremont. Bendayan, a lawyer and former party staffer, ran against Mulcair in the last election, finishing second with 33.5 per cent of the vote to Mulcair's 44 per cent.

Conservatives win York—Simcoe

While the Conservatives usually have a tough time winning when the NDP is in a weakened position, the party kept its seat in York—Simcoe, Ont., formerly held by Peter Van Loan.

The former leader of Stephen Harper's government in the Commons, Van Loan stepped down from his seat in September and announced he was retiring from politics.

Van Loan won York—Simcoe in the 2015 federal election with more than 50 per cent of the vote to the Liberals' almost 38 per cent.

Davidson, a businessman, beat out Liberal candidate Shaun Tanaka, a geography professor at Queen's University and the University of Toronto, who also ran for the Liberals in the 2015 electio​n.

In his victory speech, Davidson thanked supporters and told them he is going to Ottawa to be a MP for everyone. He said he is the type of guy who is eager to meet with new constituents face-to-face to hear their concerns.

The breakaway People's Party of Canada, created last summer by Bernier, faced its first electoral test in the byelections. Results suggest it could be a spoiler that deprives the Conservatives of victory in tight contests come the fall.

While the fledgling party won less than two per cent of the vote in Outremont and York—Simcoe, it did surprisingly well in Burnaby South, where Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson won more than 10 per cent of the vote after running on a ""Canadians first"" campaign that was denounced as anti-immigration and racist by some supporters of rival candidates.","Voters cast ballots in Ont., B.C. and Que. byelections tonight",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/byelections-burnaby-south-york-simcoe-outremont-1.5033259

Rankin has been representing Victoria, B.C. since he was first elected in a 2012 byelection. He plans to keep his seat until the end of this Parliament, at which point he says he’s keen to do other things.

""It has been the most rewarding, exciting thing I've ever done, serving as an MP… people writing an 'X' beside your name is something that will live with you forever, "" Rankin told CTVNews.ca ""But I never expected I would do it for the remainder of my career.""

As for what he plans to do next, he was recently appointed by the government of British Columbia to work as the province's representative in treaty renegotiations with the Wet'suwe''en First Nation as the two sides seek to affirm the rights and title of the Wet'suwet'en people.

Rankin worked for the federal government as a treaty negotiator for years, as well as a lawyer for various Indigenous communities and he thinks he is in a good position to understand both sides through this reconciliation process.

""I want to try to make a contribution in my own way,"" Rankin said. This is in addition to his plans to keep up on other legal matters, including the ongoing fight against the Trans Mountain pipeline, which is strongly opposed in his riding.

Rankin shot down any question that his departure has to do with the current state of the NDP, amid low polling numbers and fundraising troubles.

""It's simply not the case,"" Rankin said. ""I think it's time for a fresh look.""

His departure makes it at least a dozen NDP MPs who have announced they will not be running again, some of which have already vacated their seats. He said this wave of departures allows for party ""renewal.""

He said he is optimistic that the party is ""turning around"" now that leader Jagmeet Singh has clinched a seat in the House. Rankin predicted that once Canadians can see him in the Commons the party’s fortunes will ""dramatically improve.""

During his time on Parliament Hill, Rankin has sat on the House Finance Committee, House Health Committee, the special committee tasked with physician-assisted dying, and is a part of the House Justice Committee that is currently probing the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

He's also been the NDP House leader, and is the sole and first NDP MP on the top-secret National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians.

Over the last few months he's been pushing the government to pursue expungements for people with past pot possession charges, and not simply pardons, as Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale is poised to table imminently. He has presented a private member's bill to this effect and condemned the Liberals' plan as a ""half-measure."" He said he'll see what the bill that Goodale ends up introducing contains, but he’s planning on being disappointed.

She stressed that the Liberals would continue to fight climate change and promote a national housing strategy.

Mélanie Joly, the minister of official languages and La Francophonie, said that despite losing to the NDP in 2015, Bendayan was always a strong candidate who continued working in the riding in the years since.

""We hope this is the end of the Orange Wave in Quebec,"" Joly said Monday night.

The NDP, which had held the riding since 2007, trailed in second place with less than 30 per cent of the votes.

Outremont was one of three ridings where federal byelections took place Monday on a crucial day for Canada's major political parties.

Voter turnout was low, as is typical for a byelection. Less than 20 per cent of the 70,400 registered voters in Outremont cast a ballot.

Political insiders had bet that the Liberals would retake the riding — a welcome boost for the governing party's morale in the midst of the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

""Tonight, the people of Outremont and thousands of Canadians voting in these byelections have offered a strong vote of confidence in Justin Trudeau's positive plan to strengthen the middle class,"" said Suzanne Cowan, president of the Liberal Party of Canada.

Analysts said the Outremont race was a crucial test for the NDP.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Thomas Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 byelection: the Liberals had lost the riding only once, to the Progressive Conservatives in 1988, since 1935.

The so-called Orange Wave followed in 2011 and boosted the NDP to Official Opposition status for the first time in its history.

While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

The NDP justice critic, who has played a key role in probing the SNC-Lavalin affair, said there’s never a right time to make such a decision.

“Obviously, I wasn’t taking into account in my calculation the serious constitutional crisis that we have right on us,” he said in a telephone interview. “But I will continue to do that (work) until I’m no longer an MP in October.”

Rankin, who was first elected in 2012, said he decided to announce his intentions now to allow for a successor to get nominated and build a profile in the community.

He noted, too, that he’s leaving behind a strong electoral-district association with money in the bank and a team of volunteers.

“So I think I can honestly look myself in the mirror and say that I’m leaving this ship in good shape,” he said.

Finally, he added that the NDP has a bit of “spring in our step” now with new leader Jagmeet Singh winning his seat and a scandal threatening the Liberal government.

“It seemed like it was a good time for me to get on with the rest of my life,” he said.

Rankin, who last year was nominated by his peers for the title of hardest-working parliamentarian, stressed, however, that he has no plans to take things easy.

“I want to let people in Victoria know that I take very seriously representing them,” he said. “I have in the past and that’s not going to change as I step away from the election.

“In an ironic way, I hope I can work harder on some of the issues now because I won’t be involved in knocking on thousands of doors and doing all-candidates meetings.”

Among other things, Rankin said he’ll keep pushing the federal government for money to expand the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria. “The province stepped up, the private sector stepped up, and I’m trying desperately hard to get the federal government to contribute.”

In the years ahead, Rankin plans to devote his time to reconciliation efforts with First Nations. “Aside from climate change, I think reconciliation is one of the key challenges of our time.”

A lawyer, who specialized in environmental and aboriginal rights law before becoming an MP, Rankin was recently appointed by the B.C. government as its representative in a reconciliation process with the Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs.

“I think it’s an important assignment,” he said. “I’ll be working on behalf of the provincial government. I’m not getting paid for this. I’m simply going to do this because I’m committed to doing it.”

Among the highlights of his career, Rankin cited his role advising government on the legalization of medical assistance in dying and sitting on Parliament’s new intelligence and national security oversight committee. He also pointed to his role opposing the Enbridge pipeline.

At an age when many people retire and hit the golf course, Rankin, 69, said he has no plans to slow down.

“From binners to billionaires, I have met people all across our community, in all walks of life,” he said.

“This job makes you, requires you, to get to know your community like no other position. It’s just a remarkable community. So you know what? I want to keep growing from that, not simply going and retiring to the golf course. That’s not me.”

Rankin joins a growing list of NDP MPs who have announced they are not going to be running again in October’s election.

The list includes Alberta MP Linda Duncan, Ontario MPs Irene Mathyssen and David Christopherson, Quebec’s Helene Laverdiere, Romeo Saganash, Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach and B.C.’s Fin Donnelly.

Former MPs Kennedy Stewart and Sheila Malcolmson also left their jobs. Stewart is now Vancouver’s mayor and Malcolmson is a provincial politician in B.C.

Former Quebec MP and leader Tom Mulcair also quit politics to work as a visiting professor at Université de Montreal.

Liberals, Conservatives and New Democrats might all be asking themselves that question today after seeing the results from last night's three federal byelections.

On one hand, each party scored a win and made some gains in popular support — the NDP in Burnaby South, the Conservatives in York–Simcoe and the Liberals in Outremont.

On the other, each party also suffered a hit in support in electoral battlegrounds key to their hopes for success in October's federal vote.

Turnout was abysmal, even by byelection standards. It hit a new low in this session in York–Simcoe, where preliminary turnout figures stand at just 19.9 per cent.

Bad weather undoubtedly played a role in that, but neither Outremont nor Burnaby South had the same excuse. Turnout was just 21.4 per cent in Outremont and 29.9 per cent in Burnaby South — both below average levels for a byelection.

That makes it difficult to draw wider conclusions from the results but — notwithstanding the low turnout — the voting patterns still fit within the broader historical trends in each riding.

So what are the tea leaves saying?

Liberals can still bank on Quebec to offset losses elsewhere

The path to re-election for Justin Trudeau's Liberals in the fall is to win new seats in Quebec — largely at the expense of the NDP — to compensate for what appear to be inevitable losses in places like the Greater Toronto Area.

That strategy looks intact after Monday, with the Liberals gaining 6.9 percentage points in the Montreal riding of Outremont and taking the seat away from the NDP.

With 40.4 per cent of the vote, Rachel Bendayan put up the best result for the Liberals in Outremont since 2004. If the party can repeat these gains in other parts of Quebec, the New Democrats will be hard-pressed to hold any of the 16 seats they won in the province in 2015.

But the Liberals will struggle to hold or win suburban seats in the rest of Canada if they repeat the kind of losses they suffered in Burnaby South (a drop of 7.9 points from the previous vote) and York–Simcoe (a drop of 8.8 points).

Singh finally gets his win, but ...

The big winner on Monday has to be NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. He staked his political future on the voters of Burnaby South and his gamble paid off. This is the first win Singh can boast of since he became leader in October 2017 and it's only the second byelection of the 17 held in the current Parliament which saw the NDP increase its share of the vote.

Singh beat his nearest rival, Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee, by a margin of 13 points — far better than the 1.2-point margin the NDP managed in this seat in 2015. He gained 3.9 points over the NDP's performance in the riding here last time. The lack of a Green candidate on the ballot in Burnaby South might have helped Singh, but the jump in the NDP's performance there was bigger than the 2.9 per cent of the vote the Greens took in 2015.

New Democrats should worry about the 18-point drop in their support in Outremont, however. The result is in line with losses the party has suffered in other byelections in Quebec, so it isn't all due to the departure of former leader (and Outremont MP) Tom Mulcair.

Polls suggest the NDP has lost a lot of support in Quebec and every last one of its seats is vulnerable. The results in Outremont did nothing to change that perception.

With 26.1 per cent of the vote, however, the NDP's Julia Sanchez did better than the party's candidates did in Outremont in 2004 and 2006 — before Mulcair's breakthrough in 2007. That suggests the New Democrats have planted some roots in the province.

But those roots aren't deep enough to allow the NDP to breathe easily in Quebec, though it might offer hope to some of their higher-profile incumbents — people like Alexandre Boulerice, Ruth Ellen Brosseau and Guy Caron — that they can withstand the headwinds pushing against them.

A win is a win, but Conservative numbers flat

Of the three main parties, the Conservatives may have had the least at stake on Monday. York–Simcoe is a party stronghold where conservative candidates (of all stripes) have won the most votes in every election since 1979. But there's nothing in the results that should fill the Conservatives with enthusiasm — or dread, for that matter.

A win is a win, and Scot Davidson secured that for the party by a comfortable margin. But a gain of only 3.6 points in York–Simcoe is not what the Conservatives should be seeing if they're on track to oust the Liberals from power this year.

At 53.9 per cent, Davidson's share of the vote was well below the scores the party put up in York–Simcoe when it won government in 2008 and 2011. The win also pales in comparison to the 10.4-point gain the Conservatives saw in the Leeds-Grenville–Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes byelection in December.

Mixed results for Bernier, new high for Greens

People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier might be pleased with Laura-Lynn Thompson's 10.6 per cent result in Burnaby South, but Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is likely relieved that the PPC captured just two per cent of the vote in Outremont and York–Simcoe.

A party with national aspirations should expect to take more than two per cent of the vote in any riding; independent candidates combined for 1.8 per cent of the vote in Burnaby-South and the Progressive Canadian Party captured 3.8 per cent in York–Simcoe. Few seats will be decided by a margin of two points or less in the fall.

People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier, left, and candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson, right. (Facebook)

The Conservatives might be able to write off Thompson's performance as the result of her particular appeal for social conservative voters in that one riding. But if even half of that vote had gone to the Conservatives, they would have finished a strong second. If Bernier can find more candidates like Thompson, he might still have a spoiler role to play in the fall.

The Greens managing 12.5 per cent of the vote in Outremont — the party's best result in any federal election in any riding in Quebec — is notable, as the environment has emerged as a more pressing issue for voters in Quebec than in other parts of the country.

It makes for a crowded field in the province — the Bloc Québécois' new leader, Yves-François Blanchet, is a former environment minister and Singh has used the Liberal government's purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline as a wedge issue in Quebec. There might not be room for three parties in Quebec going hard on the environmental file.

But for now, there's something in these byelection results for just about everyone to be happy about.

Sign-up at the bottom of the page to get it delivered straight to your inbox.

Please allow us a Mea culpa about yesterday’s edition. We got ahead of ourselves and said former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould would begin testifying Monday before the justice committee reviewing the SNC-Lavalin case. Her first appearance is (or was—see below) expected for today, instead. Very sorry about that.

Singh gets his win: NDP leader Jagmeet Singh pulled ahead early in the evening in the Burnaby South byelection and held that lead to the end, clinching 38.5 per cent of the vote. The Liberals came second with 25.8 per cent to the Conservatives’ 22.8 per cent, while the People’s Party took 11.1 per cent. (Results as of midnight ET with 89 per cent of polls reporting.) The win will allow Singh to put some of the questions about his performance as leader behind him as he takes a seat in the House. Meanwhile the Conservatives have got to be hoping the People’s Party just had a fluke of a good night that won’t be replicated across the country come October. (Canadian Press)

Win one, lose one: The NDP lost the byelection in Outremont, Que., the riding previously head by former leader Tom Mulcair, to the Liberals. Meanwhile the Conservatives reclaimed York-Simcoe as expected.

Waiting for Wilson-Raybould: It’s apparent now that Wilson-Raybould won’t be speaking today either. On Monday she sent a letter to the committee stating that, while “anxious” to testify, her testimony might need to be delayed until she and the committee have “as much clarity as we can in relation to the possible constraints on the matters about which I may properly testify. … I would prefer not to schedule my appearance before the Committee until we all have whatever clarity we can have about these issues.” (CBC News)

Those issues are solicitor-client privilege, cabinet confidentiality, and “sub judice,” a parliamentary convention that covers speaking about cases before the courts.

Earlier in the day Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did tell Parliament his government would confirm that Wilson-Raybould “will be able to address relevant matters at the committee while ensuring that the two active court cases are not jeopardized.”

And sure enough on Monday night the Liberals issued an order in council authorizing Wilson-Raybould “and any persons who directly participated in discussions with her relating to the exercise of her authority” to speak to the committee and the federal ethics commissioner. The order waved any solicitor-client privilege that existed and freed her from cabinet confidentiality. However, to safeguard the court case against SNC-Lavalin, Wilson-Raybould is not allowed to testify about anything discussed between her and the Director of Public Prosecutions about the file. (CTV News, Orders in Council)

So the question now is, does that sufficiently meet Wilson-Raybould’s request for an “authoritative statement” before she testifies? When she does speak, it promises to be gripping. In her letter to the committee Wilson-Raybould requested a full 30 minutes to make her opening statement.

The Conservatives tried, and failed, to pass a motion that would have compelled Trudeau to also testify at the justice committee. (CBC News)

With more than half the polls reporting results in Burnaby South, Singh had just over 38 per cent of the vote, comfortably ahead of Liberal Richard T. Lee's 26 per cent and Conservative Jay Shin's 22 per cent.

But while victory tightens Singh's shaky grip on the reins of the NDP, the challenge ahead was underscored by the simultaneous loss of the Montreal riding that launched the NDP's orange wave that swept Quebec in 2011.

In Outremont, Liberal contender Rachel Bendayan held more than 42 per cent of the vote with two-thirds of the riding's polls reporting results, with the NDP's Julia Sanchez running second with just over 25 per cent.

Outremont was a longtime Liberal stronghold until 2007, when former NDP leader Tom Mulcair scored an upset byelection victory for the NDP, creating a beachhead for the New Democrats that helped them launch their 2011 sweep of Quebec and vault them into official Opposition status for the first time in party history.

The Conservatives, meanwhile, easily hung onto the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe.

Conservative candidate Scot Davidson captured just over 50 per cent of the vote with a majority of polls reporting results, with Liberal Shaun Tanaka taking 31 per cent.

The question now for the NDP is what it will stand for. Until Monday, it was not clear that Singh would remain at the head of his party. Under his leadership, fundraising stagnated and the NDP’s popularity sagged.

To most Canadians, Singh remained invisible. When he did emerge into the spotlight, he too often appeared defensive and ill-prepared. At times he seemed at odds with the party’s federal caucus. He also managed to engage in a feud with virtually the entire Saskatchewan wing of the NDP over an issue — the social awkwardness shown by Regina MP Erin Weir toward women — that was essentially trivial. If Singh had not won the Burnaby South byelection, he would have found it near-impossible to stay on as leader.

At a time when socialism is no longer a dirty word, it also gives the NDP a chance to define itself as a serious left-wing alternative to the Liberals and Conservatives. The NDP’s roots lie in the prairie populism and Fabian socialism of the old Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. But the party has never been entirely comfortable with its socialist antecedents. Nor has it always been at ease with its ties to organized labour.

Article Continued Below

That has made language important. The party tends to avoid terms like “working class” as too Red. It prefers instead to speak of “working families” or “ordinary Canadians” or “everyday families.” For years, the party warred internally over whether to keep the word “socialism” in its constitution. In the end, it settled on a compromise that talked of the party’s “social democratic and democratic socialist traditions.” Under the leadership of Jack Layton and later Thomas Mulcair, the NDP focused on replacing the Liberals as Canada’s centre-left party — and almost succeeded. But the 2015 election, which saw the Liberals under Justin Trudeau successfully feint to the left, demonstrated the key limitation of this strategy: It’s hard to out-Liberal the Liberals. Oddly enough, as the NDP continues to try and avoid sounding too left-wing, socialism has become fashionable again in the U.S. and Britain. In the U.S., seven contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination — including avowed socialist Bernie Sanders — have signed onto something called the Green New Deal. Among other things, it calls for the federal government to provide a good-paying job to whoever wants one. In Britain, much to the dismay of the right-wing press, young people are attracted to unions, government intervention and old-style democratic socialists like Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. When the LEAP Manifesto, a Canadian precursor of the Green New Deal, came out in 2015, its call for moving immediately to a zero carbon-emission economy was dismissed as utopian. It now seems prescient. Where is Singh in all of this? In his successful 2017 bid for the party leadership, he produced policy papers on standard issues, such as the old age pension. But when speaking, he preferred to focus on broad rhetorical themes like love and courage. During the Burnaby South byelection campaign, he talked of the need for affordable housing, an important issue in Greater Vancouver. Speaking on CBC the day after his victory, he spoke of a policy trifecta: affordable housing, fighting climate change and universal pharmacare. Perhaps this is where the NDP is going in the upcoming election campaign. If so, it will have to square some circles. In particular, it will need to show how it would reinvent Alberta’s entire carbon-based economy in a zero-emission world. It will also, however, have to be bold. The NDP can only get so far by calling Trudeau’s Liberals untrustworthy. It will have to sketch out a compelling but plausible vision of its own. That is the reaffirmed leader’s main task.

In her first substantial public statement on the matter, the former justice minister and attorney general testified that she was inappropriately pressured to prevent the Montreal-based company from being prosecuted in a bribery case.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee’s MPs that over a four-month period in late 2018 she was pressured by finance minister Bill Morneau and his staff, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, senior aides in the Prime Minister’s Office including former principal secretary Gerald Butts and chief of staff Katie Telford, and even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself.

She said partisan concerns were repeatedly raised in connection with the SNC-Lavalin case, including by Trudeau, who she claims pointed out to her in a September conversation that he was himself a Quebec MP and raised the political consequences of prosecuting a large Montreal-based company during the then-ongoing Quebec election.

Following her opening statement, Wilson-Raybould took six rounds of questions from Liberal, Conservative and NDP MPs.

Asked whether Wilson-Raybould should remain in caucus, Trudeau said Wednesday he had not reviewed her testimony in full yet, and would make decisions on that once he had.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, meanwhile, said Trudeau had lost the moral authority to govern and called on him to resign.

In dramat…,"Justin Trudeau is facing the most explosive crisis of his administration after his former attorney general detailed a months-long campaign by the Canadian prime minister's office to quietly end a legal problem for an iconic Quebec construction firm.

In dramatic testimony that lasted nearly four hours, Jody Wilson-Raybould broke her silence with a detailed account of efforts by Trudeau and top aides to persuade her to step in and end prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. She argues it amounted to interference in the judicial system, though concedes it wasn't illegal, while Trudeau says he was trying to prevent job losses in his home province of Quebec.

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere,"" the former attorney general said Wednesday afternoon. Wilson-Raybould, who quit the cabinet this month, also said she faced ""veiled threats"" about what might happen if she refused to order an out-of-court settlement.

Her testimony shook the core of the Trudeau's team, naming him, his finance chief and his most senior aides. The Conservative leader trying to unseat Trudeau in this fall's election called for his resignation, but the prime minister stood his ground and rejected Wilson-Raybould's version of events.

The public airing of grievances will inflame the scandal, which has driven the governing Liberals lower in national polls. The ordeal dredges up ghosts of the party's past, which is marked by hand-in-glove ties with corporate Canada — particularly in Quebec. The political fallout, however, is difficult to predict. Trudeau's path to re-election runs through the largely French-speaking province, where his defense of SNC-Lavalin is being applauded.

""I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,"" Trudeau said Wednesday night in Montreal, where he was celebrating a Liberal Party by-election victory. ""Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy.""

The image of Wilson-Raybould, Canada's first Indigenous attorney general, skewering her ex-boss, a famed liberal who pledged to improve relations with native peoples and self-described feminist, has taken the shine off the PM.

“This is a huge, huge blow to Justin Trudeau’s personal brand and Justin Trudeau’s promise of doing politics differently,” a polling firm executive told the New York Times. “That shine is not dented or scratched. It’s been completely scuffed.”

Wilson-Raybould was the only Indigenous Canadian in Trudeau's cabinet, before she resigned.

SNC-Lavalin had been pushing for what's known as a deferred prosecution agreement to end a criminal case dating back more than a decade, related to corruption charges involving the former Libyan government. SNC is accused of paying about $36 million dollars in bribes to those connected to the late dictator Muammar Gaddafi, as well as defrauding the Libyan government of nearly $100 million.

The charges relate to the world's largest irrigation system — the Great Man-Made River project.

SNC-Lavalin has said that those responsible for alleged wrongdoing left the company a long time ago. Gaddafi was killed in 2011 by militants aided by a coalition Western nations, including Canada, that provided key air support.

The company's stock plunged the most in six years Oct. 10 when it revealed that the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ruled out a negotiated settlement that would have staved off a trial. Settling out of court would also help the company, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada and 50,000 worldwide, avoid a ban on bidding for federal government contracts.

Wilson-Raybould pulled back the curtain on the effort to change that decision and help the company, in testimony that was aired on national television in its entirety. She spoke to lawmakers only after Trudeau waived privilege to allow her to do so, and believes she wasn't even legally able to intervene.

She said the prime minister and his aides wanted to end the case in part to prevent the company's relocation — and also to avoid electoral fallout for both the federal Liberals and the party's provincial wing. Wilson-Raybould said she resisted intervening because she wanted to uphold the principle of judicial independence and the rule of law, but officials ignored her repeated instructions to stop raising the issue.

The former attorney-general identified a series of phone calls and meetings between her or her staff, and Trudeau or several of his top advisers. They include chief of staff Katie Telford; former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who resigned this month; and senior aides Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques. She also cited communications with Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his chief of staff Ben Chin.

One of the meetings was with Trudeau himself, in September. ""The prime minister raised the issue immediately. The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC,"" Wilson-Raybould said. She said she'd told him she had made up her mind.

""The prime minister again cited the potential loss of jobs and SNC moving,"" while also stressing that he represents an electoral district in Quebec. She said Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, the country's top bureaucrat, also warned her the company ""will likely be moving to London"" without her intervention.

Discussions continued. Wilson-Raybould said Bouchard at one point said bluntly: ""We can have the best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected.""

She met Butts in December in Ottawa, and was already frustrated by what she called ""the barrage of people hounding me and my staff."" She pushed back. ""I raised how I needed everybody to stop talking to me about SNC, as I had made up my mind and that the engagements were inappropriate.""

She read a text-message conversation with her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, who was relaying a conversation with Butts and Telford. Wilson-Raybould said Prince was told by Butts ""there is no solution here that does not involve some interference."" She said Prince told her Telford said: ""We don't want to debate legalities anymore.""","Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau faces political crisis, sullied image after former justice minister claims 'veiled threats'",Chicagotribune.com,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trudeau-wilson-raybould-20190302-story.html

On Sunday, Wilson-Raybould told CBC News that she was confirmed as a Liberal Party of Canada candidate in the upcoming federal election.

In her interview with Checkup, Qualtrough discussed Wilson-Raybould's status in the party, the Opposition's reaction, and efforts to provide corporations greater flexibility in contract procurement with McCue. This is part of their conversation:

On Wilson-Raybould remaining in Caucus

Duncan McCue: Jody Wilson-Raybould has told what she says is her truth. The prime minister has denied her characterization of those conversations. Whose side are you on?

Carla Qualtrough: You know, it's a very difficult and very charged situation we're in here because, on the one hand, I campaigned with Jody Wilson-Raybould. We became friends over the past three, four years.

We've travelled back and across the country, back and forth for four years. We've worked on difficult files together. I have a lot of respect and consider her to be thoughtful and direct.

At the same time, I've become, you know, close and have a lot of respect for the prime minister. I sit next to him in the House of Commons. We spend hours kind of sitting together voting and discussing things and committees and everything. And I consider him to be very thoughtful and direct and truthful.

So, you know, we're in this situation where I wasn't part of these conversations, but I have every confidence in the prime minister and I, you know, will definitely believe that he has kind of the moral and legal and political authority to run this country.

She is still a member of the Liberal Party and she says she would like to continue to serve as an MP. Are you supporting her to stay in caucus?

I support anybody to stay in caucus, especially somebody like Jody. For me, I'm in caucus because I have confidence in the leader. I share the Liberal values, and I share the vision for the country.

And if Jody is saying that she has confidence in the leader, shares our values and our vision for the country, I absolutely welcome her.

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the gov't to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion..."" 1:08

On public inquiry and RCMP investigation

Why don't you think that your party needs an independent public inquiry to help clear the name of the prime minister, if that's what you're looking to do? If you want to shed more light on this?

I think that between the Justice Committee and the ethics commissioner, there's sufficient processes underway now that will get to the bottom of this. I'm not sure another layer of another public process is the way to get resolution to this.

So you don't feel there should be a public inquiry?

None at this time, no. I can't see the value added of it personally. But if that changes, a decision will have to be made. But not right now, no.

Now the Conservative Party has called for an RCMP investigation. How worried are you about that?

Oh, I'm not worried about an RCMP investigation at all. The RCMP is completely independent. If they decide to pursue an investigation, they will have reasons to do so and if they decide not to, they won't.

Like we don't really weigh it at all, kind of politically about the RCMP. If something is ongoing or not, that's really not known unless you're implicated and I don't know of anything.

On efforts to change the 'integrity regime' for corporations

SNC-Lavalin, if it's convicted of corruption and fraud charges for using bribery while doing business in Libya, would be disqualified for up to 10 years. Now you're putting up a proposal to loosen up those rules and, in some cases, they would not be ineligible for federal contracts. Is that correct?

Well, this is one tiny little clarification on what you just said. Right now there is a strict 10-year rule. It's not up to 10 years.

So right now if someone is charged criminally for an offence that is listed under our ineligibility and suspension policy, the company would be barred for 10 years.

What the new proposal is proposing, first of all, is an increase in the number of offences that could trigger debarment [when companies are forbidden from federal contracts]. It's an increase of the kind of unethical behavior that could trigger debarment, as well as a flexibility in the term.

So we are introducing — we're proposing, because it hasn't been decided — up to 10 years. So whereas before it was strict 10 years, now it's going to up to 10 years.

Actor Manav Kaul, who has portrayed a character played by Naseeruddin Shah in the original Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Aata Hai, says he knew it was a role he had to handle with care in the film's remake. The remake of the Saeed Akhtar Mirza's 1980 cult classic features Manav and Nandita Das. Written and directed by Soumitra Ranade of Jajantaram Mamantaram fame, the modern take of Albert Pinto... explores the theme of personal and societal struggle in today's times. It will release on April 12.

Manav said in a statement: ""It is a really special and iconic film but we are trying to show that story through a new perspective. We have made this film with a lot of hard work and honesty. It was exciting to work with Soumitra and Nandita.""

On getting into the shoes of Naseeruddin, Manav said: ""It was a daunting task for me. The expectations are going to be high when you are portraying a character which is still so relevant and is played by a much loved actor like Naseer sir. I knew I had to portray Albert Pinto with a lot of respect, dignity and heart.""

The original film starred Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi and Smita Patil.

It talks about the anger felt by the common man in contemporary India - in the face of continued political, social and cultural breakdown.

Nandita said it is a film she took up for emotional reasons.

""I did it for nostalgia and for the director. Soumitra is one of the finest human beings I know and the journey of making Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Aata Hai was made special because of his commitment and passion to the story he so wanted to tell,"" she said.

The film is produced by Soumitra Ranade, Golden Ratio Films, Paperboat Design Studios, Templetree Motion Pictures, Vikram Saxena, Jagmeet Singh, Noopur Raje, Pinke Ankur Patel and No Guts No Glory Films.

Soumitra Ranade said: ""I think India is angrier now than it has ever been before. It is angry against the system that has continually failed its people. With no real hope of change, this anger spills out brutally, either on news channels or through social media.

""Our interpretation of anger in the form of this film is extremely relevant to the times that we are living in. Resistance, rebellion and revolt are basic human rights perhaps as important as food, shelter and education. If we suppress these for too long there will be bottled up anger of an entire nation that will explode sooner rather than later. The film echos the voice of the people and through its release, it is only natural that it reaches back to them,"" the director added.

Singh may well be looking to turn the page on the past year and a half. Since he was elected in October 2017, his leadership has been marked by poor polling, lacklustre fundraising and a steady trickle of caucus members making their way toward the exit.

But with Monday’s victory, analysts say, Singh has a fresh chance to make a new impression on Canadians, albeit a little later in the game than he’d probably like. “The chatter is over,” B.C. MP Nathan Cullen told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday. “Mr. Singh’s ability to lead this caucus into the next election is 100 per cent secured.”

Still, his problems aren’t all behind him: a few of his heavyweight MPs, including Cullen, have yet to say if they’ll run again in the next election, and he faces a major obstacle in Quebec, where the NDP lost Outremont, the riding held by former leader Thomas Mulcair since 2007, to the Liberals in another byelection on Monday.

But the timing for a fresh start isn’t bad, said former NDP strategist Farouk Karim. Singh will take his place in the House of Commons while the Liberals are mired in the SNC-Lavalin controversy, and as they table their last budget before this year’s election.

“It’s not often in life that you would have a second chance to make that impression,” Karim said. “And he has that opportunity.”

In his victory speech, Singh worked hard to paint Liberals and Conservatives as interested only in helping their “well-connected corporate friends,” while leaving ordinary Canadians in the lurch. “People should be angry at that, angry at governments in Ottawa that continue to develop a system that puts more and more wealth into fewer and fewer hands,” he said, pointing to three issues — affordable housing, pharmacare and climate change — that will likely be pillars of the NDP’s election campaign.

Robin MacLachlan, a former NDP strategist, said there’s an opening for Singh while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is “reeling” from the SNC-Lavalin controversy, which he said has damaged Trudeau’s image “as being on the side of ordinary Canadians.”

“He has an opportunity to position himself as the leader who kind of gets what you’re facing,” he said.

With a seat in the House of Commons, Singh will finally have the chance to face off against Trudeau directly, though with little time remaining before the next election. “I would lower expectations. He’s not going to be 100 per cent from the get-go,” said Karim. “But I think if people see an improvement throughout, that will go a long way.”

Cullen said Singh took a risk in deciding to run for a seat in the Burnaby byelection, and it paid off. “I think Canadians are going to look at us in a new way, and I think Mr. Singh’s confidence is going to be boosted,” he said. “I’m looking forward to how he does.”

Arguably the biggest hurdle Singh now faces is Quebec, where the NDP has recently been polling as low as a dismal eight per cent, and nearly all of the party’s seats seem to be under threat. In a separate byelection on Monday, Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan won the Montreal riding of Outremont, which had been a Liberal stronghold until it was taken by Mulcair in 2007 and became a symbol of the party’s gains in that province.

After Bendayan’s victory, Liberals were quick to declare the death of the Orange Wave that swept through Quebec in 2011 and helped propel the NDP to Official Opposition status for the first time. “It’s finished,” Infrastructure Minister François-Philippe Champagne told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday. “Just look at the results.”

But Singh played down the loss on Monday, saying the party “always knew that Outremont was going to be a tough riding.”

Karim said he was actually “pleasantly surprised” by the Outremont results, which saw NDP candidate Julia Sánchez finish second with 26 per cent of the vote — disappointing, but not catastrophic, according to Karim.

“I think it’s a little hope that the party can build on,” he said. “Twenty-six per cent is far from over, that’s what I would say to the Liberals.”

Singh, clearly recognizing the importance of building his profile in Quebec, said on Monday that he plans to travel to the province next week. Currently, more than a third of the NDP caucus is from Quebec, but several Quebec MPs have said they won’t run again, including Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach, who both made their announcements last week.

MacLachlan said the NDP could attract Quebec voters concerned about climate change, and upset about the Trudeau government’s decision to purchase the Trans Mountain pipeline. Karim said the strong third-place showing of the Green Party in Outremont, which finished with 12.5 per cent of the vote, proves that Quebecers “want answers” on the environment.

Outside Quebec, two other high-profile NDP MPs — B.C.’s Cullen and Murray Rankin — have yet to announce whether they’ll run again in this year’s election. So far, 11 of the 44 NDP MPs elected in 2015 have either resigned their seats or have said they won’t seek re-election.

But MacLachlan said Singh’s win should help “consolidate support” for the leader within and outside his caucus. Now, he said, Singh needs to focus on building his profile from inside the House of Commons.

“He needs to reintroduce himself to Canadians,” MacLachlan said. “He’s been absent from the national conversation about policy, and now they’re going to hear from him.”

Just as they were celebrating Jagmeet Singh’s impending entry into the House of Commons after a long 16 months of wandering the land, seatless, Statistics Canada dropped this little gem: It put out new figures showing the Canada Child Benefit introduced by the Trudeau Liberals in mid-2016 is lowering poverty in a significant way. Fully 278,000 fewer children were living below the poverty line in 2017 compared to just two years earlier. That’s big.

What’s the connection? Just this. Once Singh takes his seat in the Commons as NDP leader, following his convincing byelection victory on Monday night, he’ll have to persuade voters on the broad left of the political spectrum to turn away from the Liberals and go with his party. Early signs are that he’ll take the standard NDP approach, arguing the Liberals are in bed with big business and the rich while only the New Democrats are “on your side.” But good luck with that when the facts show the Liberals’ signature social policy is working to lift tens of thousands out of poverty. The national poverty rate dropped more than a full percentage point in a single year, according to StatsCan. New Democrats would be proud to boast such a record, and rightly so.

It comes down to how Singh intends to position his party for this fall’s election, now that he’s secured a seat in Parliament. He has to put the stumbles and misstatements that have undermined his leadership behind him and develop a coherent critique of the Liberals. So far the NDP line is that Trudeau & Co. are tools of their corporate cronies, as demonstrated by the 50 meetings secured by SNC-Lavalin and its lobbyists with government officials to avoid a damaging trial on corruption charges. This, says Singh, amounts to “spending time trying to find a way to help his friends avoid the consequences of breaking the law.” If anything, this line of argument suggests the NDP has written off its chances in Quebec, where the survival of SNC-Lavalin and the thousands of jobs associated with it is seen, to put it mildly, as involving a lot more than propping up the undeserving rich. It’s something to see the self-styled party of working people so cavalierly dismiss the importance of protecting the livelihood of thousands of Quebec families. There are other promising issues for New Democrats. Take affordable housing, a pressing concern in Singh’s riding of Burnaby South and other places where property prices have soared out of reach. There, too, the Liberals will compete fiercely. They took steps to cool the hottest housing markets two years ago, and in his pre-election budget Finance Minister Bill Morneau is expected to address the difficulties first-time buyers have in getting into the market.

Voters will be looking for forward-looking solutions. But on Wednesday Singh had this to say to CBC News: “Let’s build houses the way we did in the 1970s or the late ’40s.” It’s clear what he meant: government should invest more in social housing of various kinds. But could there be a more backward-sounding statement, harking back to the approach of four or even seven decades ago? The bottom line is that winning a seat in the Commons is just prologue for Singh and his party. The lights will be all the brighter once he takes his place in Parliament and is expected to put forward a smart, persuasive critique of the government every day. Most important, the NDP has to figure out where its own heart lies and express that in a way that will give voters a distinct choice in October. With the Liberals occupying the centre-left, it’s not obvious how to do that. And the election countdown clock is already ticking loudly.

""If the NDP want to turn their fortunes around by October, their best (and maybe only) hope is to bring the bold vision of a Green New Deal to Canada.""

It’s a good result for Singh, and a breath of fresh air for a New Democratic Party that’s been struggling to raise money, floundering in the polls, and has seemed to be teetering on the edge of a very public internal civil war for the past few months. But, as Singh himself mentioned in his victory remarks, now the real campaign begins. If the NDP want to turn their fortunes around by October, their best (and maybe only) hope is to bring the bold vision of a Green New Deal to Canada.

If you haven’t heard of it yet, the Green New Deal is a political idea to tackle climate change with WWII-scale economic and social mobilization. Named for Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal agenda that pulled the United States out of the Great Depression, the Green New Deal has been rapidly picking up steam south of the border. Championed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and now supported by dozens of congressional representatives and senators (along with every major Democratic presidential hopeful), the Green New Deal has become a clarion call for action at the scale and pace of the climate crisis.

But the Green New Deal isn’t just a good idea. With the campaign and organizing savvy of the Sunrise Movement behind it, polling numbers show wide geographic and cross-partisan support (especially among youth). It’s become a winning platform for Democrats and, if they imported it in the right way, it could do the same for Jagmeet Singh and the NDP.

It’s no secret that, in 2015, Justin Trudeau’s success was due, in large measure, to his ability to outflank the NDP on critical progressive issues — including climate change. It’s also true that his majority victory was driven by a dramatic uptick in youth voter turnout — 57.1 percent of eligible 18-24 year olds voted in 2015 compared to 38.8 per cent in 2011 — that largely showed up for the Liberals.

It’s also clear that Canadians, especially young people, want to see more from our federal government when it comes to climate change.

A Mainstreet Research poll released last November found that 76.1 per cent of Canadians accept that climate change is real and caused by human activity, and that nearly 60 per cent of Canadians agree that the government has to solve the issue of climate change even if doing so impacts economic growth.

The good thing about a Green New Deal is that it would create jobs and support working families through a federal jobs guarantee program. Although we don’t have direct polling on such a proposal in Canada, a 2016 Iron & Earth poll found that nearly 70 per cent of energy workers support a time-bound transition to 100 per cent renewable energy in Canada. That same poll found that 80-95 per cent would support government programs to support workers through the transition. Among the general public, these numbers are even higher.

It’s also clear that Canadians are looking for more climate ambition from our government. A recent poll from Abacus Data found just over 50 per cent national support for the carbon tax, despite the fact that almost 60 per cent didn’t think it would lead to significant emissions reductions.

That same poll found that nearly 25 per cent of Canadians think that no federal party leader has the best plan to deal with climate change, and that only five per cent think that Jagmeet Singh’s plan measures up.

Compare this to polling around the Leap Manifesto, arguably the best Canadian blueprint for a Green New Deal. According to a 2016 Ekos poll, nearly 50 per cent of Canadians backed the Leap vision of tackling climate, social and economic justice. And those numbers are even higher among NDP and Liberal party faithful.

All of this adds up to a clear challenge to the NDP to put out a climate plan that acknowledges, as Vox writer David Roberts put it last week, “this is a fucking emergency.” A plan that actually prescribes the kind of massive economic and social mobilization necessary to rise to the challenge.

The good news is that some people within the party already seem to be getting the message. Citing last fall’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report — the one that warns us all that we have just over a decade to get our act together when it comes to climate change — Svend Robinson returned to politics to run against notable Trudeau pipeline apologist Terry Beech in the riding of Burnaby-North Seymour. The second tweet from his campaign account was about a Green New Deal for Canada.

Grassroots activists within the NDP are trying to make sure that Robinson is not alone. Across the country, nomination races are being challenged by young women with bold, ambitious, Green New Deal-esque platforms. In Alberta, Paige Gorsak came within a handful of votes of winning the nomination for Linda Duncan’s former seat. In Ottawa-Center, Graciela Hernandez-Cruz did the same. They may have lost their races, but not by much, and they’ve helped to inspire other candidates like Leah Gazan in Winnipeg-Center and Emma Norton in Dartmouth-Cole Harbour — to put their names forward to bring a bolder, climate and social justice vision to the NDP.

With only eight months until the next federal election, it’s going to take a small miracle for the NDP to right their ship. But, if they want a shot at clawing their way back to federal relevance, they need to call a big shot, and a Green New Deal for Canada is their best chance to do that.",The NDP's only hope is a Green New Deal for Canada,Nationalobserver.com,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/02/26/opinion/ndps-only-hope-green-new-deal-canada
470,Empty,2019-03-04T19:01:24Z,Damning testimony on a corporate scandal leaves Trudeau's future shaky.,"Canada’s Golden Boy Loses His Shine

It was Feb. 28, 1984, and Canada’s capital was being pummeled by a blizzard. Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau stepped out of his official Ottawa residence and took a long walk in the snow to contemplate his political future. His government had survived an independence referendum in Quebec but came out bloodier for it. His poll numbers were abysmal. After 15 years at the top, it was time to go.

And so, the next day, he announced he would be retiring from political life .

Thirty-five years later, almost to the day, Trudeau’s son faced the most tumultuous moment of his political career.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has had a relatively smooth four years in office. Most of his scandals and controversies were insignificant, forgettable, or easily spun—like when he accepted a helicopter ride from the Aga Khan, the spiritual leader of the world’s Ismaili Muslims, which violated parliamentary ethics rules. But this affair won’t be so easily smoothed over.

Where once his re-election seemed a safe bet , Trudeau is now playing defense. He’s taking friendly fire from his former justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, whom he once lauded as a key part of his team.

The scandal is complex and turns on a technical legal mechanism and a 60-year-old principle of Westminster democracy. But it is also one that threatens Trudeau’s core brand as a feminist and champion for indigenous peoples, one he has meticulously built and maintained for himself.

***

The roots of the scandal begin in early 2015, when the Royal Canadian Mounted Police laid charges against SNC-Lavalin, a Canadian engineering giant with offices worldwide. The federal police detailed a kickback scheme worth nearly 50 million Canadian dollars, about $40 million, which they allege was used to secure contracts from the government of Muammar al-Qaddafi in Libya in the 2000s. The bribes, police allege, resulted in some CA$130 million, about $100 million, in Libyan contracts for the Montreal-based company.

Many of those bribes allegedly went to Saadi Qaddafi, a son of the eccentric dictator, and helped finance luxury yachts. The collusion campaign continued for a decade, investigators say, until Qaddafi’s government fell in 2011.

The charges carried substantial fines and possible jail time for company executives. But as the company was charged under the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, it also carried a potentially more damaging penalty: a ban on bidding for government contracts.

SNC-Lavalin is a huge company. It boasts a CA$6 billion market cap and 50,000 employees around the globe. Nearly 9,000 of its employees, however, are in Canada, and its work domestically largely depends on government jobs. In 2018, the company, along with other firms, won a huge contract to help build a new public transport system in Montreal.

The firm made no secret of the fact that, should it lose at trial, it wouldn’t be sticking around. Either it would relocate its corporate headquarters to London, or the company itself would be toast. The company dispatched its lobbyists—as well as its executives, well connected in Trudeau’s Liberal Party—to Parliament Hill to convey that message.

And the government took heed. In its 2018 budget, it crafted a new legal mechanism—the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The tool allows prosecutors to strike, in essence, a plea deal with corporations charged with corruption. The company would have to pay a fine, accept responsibility, and address issues of corporate governance, but such a deal would avoid a conviction and allow them to continue bidding on contracts into the future. It’s a common tool in Europe and the United States, designed to punish and deter companies that behave badly while also preventing collateral economic damage.

But there’s a catch. The law prescribes that the Public Prosecution Service, an independent body that runs federal prosecutions, cannot consider the “national economic interest” in deciding whether to offer such a deal to companies accused of bribing foreign officials.

And that seems to be why, in September of last year, the director of public prosecutions opted to proceed with the prosecution, job losses be damned.

***

That’s where the current scandal begins.

Jody Wilson-Raybould, who served (as is usual in Canada) both as attorney general and its justice minister, had the option of overruling the decision. She could issue a public notice indicating she would be asking the director to begin negotiations with SNC-Lavalin about this legal offramp. She opted not to, determining that the independent body had concluded correctly that SNC-Lavalin was not eligible for such a deal.

As she deliberated, and even after she made up her mind, her own government began to apply the pressure. Over the course of 10 in-person meetings, 10 phone calls, and a flurry of emails and text messages, staff within the Prime Minister’s Office, the office of the finance minister, and the Privy Council Office all pressured her to order the director of public prosecutions to invite SNC-Lavalin to negotiate a deal. They suggested she reach out to the director of public prosecutions in an informal way. They suggested hiring outside counsel for advice on how to get the deal done.

And she kept meticulous notes of it all.

There was a meeting with the prime minister himself, where Trudeau underscored the political ramifications at play, should his government sit idly by while one of Quebec’s larger employers packed up and left town. The prime minister reminded Wilson-Raybould that his own seat was in Quebec—a province that has become the Liberals’ electoral fortress and its best chance at re-election in the fall.

“Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the [attorney general]?” Wilson-Raybould retorted, according to her own notes. “I would strongly advise against it,” she warned him.

“No, no, no—we just need to find a solution,” Trudeau replied, according to her notes.

Wilson-Raybould wasn’t swayed. She concluded that the director had decided correctly and that there would be no deal for SNC-Lavalin. The law was clear: Economic ramifications and job losses could not be part of the equation, never mind the political fortunes of her party. And yet that is exactly what her boss wanted her to consider.

In early January, the prime minister called Wilson-Raybould to inform her that she was out of her job. She would be transferred to being minister of veterans affairs—a job with significantly less clout and weight, overseeing a significantly smaller department with a fraction of the budget.

Even before her desk was cleared out, the government began planning to have the new justice minister issue the directive to begin negotiations with SNC-Lavalin. It all left the impression with Wilson-Raybould that she had been fired over her unwillingness to offer a deal to SNC-Lavalin that, she believed, was not legally kosher.

This issue remained out of the public eye until early February, when the Globe and Mail published some details of the internal struggle. The media and opposition parties began to fixate on the issue. Wilson-Raybould, abruptly, quit as veterans minister. Gerald Butts, the prime minister’s right-hand man, resigned—insisting, in a statement, he did nothing wrong.

Wilson-Raybould, initially, stayed quiet, insisting that solicitor-client privilege barred her from discussing the issue. Last week, the prime minister officially waived that privilege, opening the door for the former minister to testify. And, over a three-hour marathon hearing before the House of Commons Justice Committee on Feb. 27, she told the whole saga in meticulous detail.

***

But the significance of Wilson-Raybould’s testimony goes beyond just this one scandal. It rests on her own political and cultural intelligence, and on the role she served in an administration that prided itself on the strength of its diverse team. Prior to entering federal politics in 2015, Wilson-Raybould had been, herself, a prosecutor and a regional chief for the British Columbia Assembly of First Nations. It was Trudeau and Butts—a senior advisor to the prime minister who arguably carried as much power in the country as Trudeau himself—who recruited her to run. As they swept into government, she was appointed justice minister and attorney general, the first indigenous person to hold those posts.

The consensus in Ottawa is that Wilson-Raybould is a serious woman, principled to the point of stubborn, and willing to put her beliefs above partisanship. In Kwak’wala, her Indigenous language, she was given the name Puglaas—“woman born of noble people.”

Wilson-Raybould’s father had been a first nations chief as well, and he had once remarked, as shown in a clip that circulated widely on social media in the last few weeks, to Pierre Trudeau that his daughter wanted, one day, to be prime minister.

Even from within cabinet, Wilson-Raybould publicly delivered barbed criticism of her government’s record on addressing systemic inequalities facing indigenous peoples—a file the prime minister consistently touted as his top priority .

Her time in government hasn’t been without controversy. She found herself frequently at odds with Canada’s legal community, and some of her planned legal reforms were admonished as ham-fisted and unconstitutional .

But Wilson-Raybould’s presence in cabinet was still powerfully symbolic. Trudeau made sure of it.

When the prime minister put together his cabinet upon winning government in 2015, he promised it was one which “looked like Canada”—it was gender-balanced and had representation from indigenous peoples, immigrants, the LGBT community, and people living with disabilities. Trudeau pledged it was not an exercise in box-checking but that he would lean on his team for their varied perspectives and experiences.

Wilson-Raybould and her impressive resume underscored as much.

Yet, here she is, alleging she had been steamrolled by her boss. When she held the line, she was demoted out of the way. Her replacement as justice minister? David Lametti, a white man from Montreal who has already signaled his openness to play ball and offer a deal to SNC-Lavalin.

***

The whole affair has seen Canadians—voters and members of parliament alike—furiously Googling an arcane element of British-style democracy: the Shawcross Doctrine.

Named for Sir Hartley Shawcross, a former attorney general of England and Wales, the doctrine maintains that there must be a divide between political considerations and the decision to prosecute, or not prosecute, a crime. An attorney general’s decision on whether to proceed with a prosecution can be informed by their cabinet colleagues, Shawcross said, but those conversations “must not consist in telling him what that decision ought to be.” The decision, in effect, is the attorney general’s and the attorney general’s alone.

It seems Trudeau rode roughshod over that principle. That’s prompted a wider conversation about splitting the role of justice minister and attorney general.

The Shawcross Doctrine may be on few voters’ minds when they trudge to the ballot box in October. But the scandal has inflamed political tensions in an array of other ways.

Trudeau has already been struggling to mitigate growing resentment for his government in oil-rich Alberta, which has felt the pinch of slumping oil prices, exacerbated by a price discount against American crude. It doesn’t help that Alberta, and much of Western Canada, has distrusted the Liberal Party since Trudeau’s father was at its helm, angry at an energy policy believed to benefit Central Canada at the West’s expense. Add in the fact that Wilson-Raybould hails from British Columbia, and the potential political impact from this East-West divide only grows.

***

Trudeau’s efforts to parry the accusations from his former justice minister have been limp. He maintained that any pressure applied to Wilson-Raybould was not inappropriate, she was not ejected from her job over the file, and that he—above all else—was only looking out for Canadians’ jobs.

But that will do little to quell the storm. The committee investigating the matter will hear from Butts, Trudeau’s senior advisor and confidant, in the coming week . The conflict of interest and ethics commissioner, an independent officer of Parliament, is also investigating . Trudeau’s main competitor, the Conservative Andrew Scheer, is calling for his resignation and is raising the possibility of a criminal investigation—though that prospect seems relatively remote, as even Wilson-Raybould maintained there was likely no illegality, just impropriety. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the third-place New Democratic Party, wants a public inquiry.

Indeed, the Prime Minister’s defensive tactics weren’t enough to satisfy one of his most capable ministers, Jane Philpott, a close friend of Wilson-Raybould. The erstwhile President of the Treasury Board quit cabinet on Monday afternoon, writing on a statement: “Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised.”

Philpott has been touted as one of the best performers in Trudeau’s government — if not the outright best. As Minister of Health, she heralded in legislation on physician-assisted dying and marijuana legalization with relatively little controversy, and as Minister of Indigenous Services she began the painstaking work of upgrading drinking water infrastructure on First Nations reserves across the country . She had only just been appointed to her new role, as the minister responsible for the civil service and government modernization, when she quit.

Philpott’s exit is about as dramatic a twist as can be expected. Which leaves Trudeau to manage an increasingly radioactive fallout, even as he tests the waters on still offering a way out for SNC-Lavalin. Alienating Western Canada over his aggressive efforts to get a deal for the Quebec company will all be for naught if SNC-Lavalin loses its cases and cuts its 9,000 Canadian staff anyway.

471,Empty,2019-02-26T04:55:16Z,"With most polls reporting, Singh took Burnaby South with more than 38% of the vote. Had he lost, he would almost certainly have faced demands to resign as leader","OTTAWA — Jagmeet Singh tightened his shaky grip on the reins of the NDP Monday by winning a do-or-die federal byelection in British Columbia.

But the challenge he now faces in reviving the party’s flagging fortunes in time for this fall’s national election was underscored by the NDP’s simultaneous loss to the Liberals in Outremont, the Montreal riding that served as a launching pad for the orange wave that swept Quebec in 2011.

With most polls reporting, Singh captured Burnaby South with more than 38 per cent of the vote, ahead of the Liberal contender with 26 per cent and the Conservative with 22 per cent.

Had he lost, Singh would almost certainly have faced demands to resign as leader. Going into Monday’s byelection, many New Democrats — including Singh’s predecessor, Tom Mulcair — had questioned how Singh could lead the party in the October federal election if he couldn’t win a seat for himself.

However, the loss of Outremont cast a pall over Singh’s victory celebration.

Lawyer Rachel Bendayan reclaimed the riding for the Liberals with 42 per cent of the vote, even as the governing party struggles with the fallout from allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to halt criminal proceedings against Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The NDP’s Julia Sanchez captured 27 per cent.

Outremont was a longtime Liberal stronghold until 2007, when Mulcair scored a byelection upset for the NDP, creating a beachhead for the party in Quebec, from which it eventually went on to sweep the province in 2011 and vault into official Opposition status for the first time in party history.

Since those heady days, the party has fallen back to its traditional third-party status. It won just 44 seats in the 2015 election, 16 of them in Quebec. Monday’s loss of Outremont gives credence to polls that suggest the party risks being wiped out altogether in Quebec this fall.

Vancouver NDP MP Jenny Kwan acknowledged the loss of Outremont was “a disappointment.”

“What we’re going to do, of course, is learn from this experience and then we’re going to redouble our efforts to ensure that the people of Quebec know we are there for them,” she said at Singh’s victory party.

In a third byelection Monday, the Conservatives handily hung on to the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe, which had been held since 2004 by former Conservative cabinet minister Peter Van Loan. Scot Davidson took 53 per cent of the vote for the Tories, well ahead of Liberal Shaun Tanaka with 30 per cent.

There were, however, a couple of potentially bad omens for the Conservatives in Monday’s results.

The breakaway People’s Party of Canada, created last summer by one-time Tory leadership contender Maxime Bernier, faced its first electoral test in the byelections and results suggest it could be a spoiler that deprives the Conservatives of victory in tight contests come the fall.

While the fledgling party won less than two per cent of the vote in Outremont and York-Simcoe, it did surprisingly well in Burnaby South, where Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson won more than 11 per cent of the vote after running on a “Canadians first” campaign that was denounced as anti-immigration and racist by some supporters of rival candidates.

And in Outremont, the Conservative candidate ran a distant fifth with just over six per cent of the vote, behind the Liberals, NDP, Greens, and Bloc Quebecois.

The Greens, who’ve watched their vote share increase in a number of other recent byelection contests, came third in Outremont with some 13 per cent of the vote — up 10 points from the 2015 election. However, the party’s vote share was down slightly in York-Simcoe, at less than three per cent. The Greens did not run a candidate in Burnaby South, as a courtesy to Singh.

Singh’s win was all the sweeter for the fact that Burnaby South was not a natural home or a safe seat for a former Ontario provincial politician. New Democrat Kennedy Stewart, now mayor of Vancouver, won the riding by just over 500 votes ahead of the Liberals in 2015.

His victory will give Singh some much-needed visibility in the House of Commons in the run-up to the general election and will help put to rest grumbling within NDP ranks about his underwhelming performance since being chosen leader almost 18 months ago.

What we’re going to do, of course, is learn from this experience

But his problems go well beyond his low profile on the main stage of federal politics.

Singh has faced criticism about his seeming unfamiliarity with federal issues and his handling of internal caucus discipline.

Under his leadership, the NDP has plunged to its lowest standings in public opinion polls since 2000, when it won just 13 seats. The party is mired in debt and its fundraising results have been dismal. As well, at least 11 of the 44 MPs who won seats for the party in 2015 have announced they won’t seek re-election this fall.

While the Liberals could celebrate victory in Outremont, the party’s vote share dropped by about seven percentage points in each of the other two byelections — at least in part likely due to the fallout from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In Burnaby South, the ruling party was likely also hurt by the fact that it dumped its original candidate after she identified Singh as being of “Indian descent” and contrasted herself as the “only” Chinese candidate in a riding with a large Chinese-Canadian population.

He’s announcing he won’t seek re-election this fall.

That makes 13 of the 44 New Democrats elected in 2015 who won’t be running again.

Cullen’s departure is a blow to NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who just won his own seat in the House of Commons in a British Columbia byelection earlier this week.

It was but one facet of the post-vote spin battle in Canadian politics after each of the major parties scored a victory in federal byelections Monday.

Mélanie Joly, the Liberal minister of tourism, official languages and La Francophonie, told reporters in Montreal on Monday night that the NDP byelection loss in Outremont marked the end of the huge surge of NDP support in Quebec that lifted the party to its best-ever election result in 2011. Finance Minister Bill Morneau picked up the theme Tuesday on Parliament Hill, when he told reporters: “It looks fairly like there’s no wave to me. It seems like a fairly flat sea.” The NDP’s Alexandre Boulerice bristled at that analysis.

“It’s over. Jagmeet Singh is our leader. He is our leader in the next federal election, and he will be great in Parliament,” said Boulerice. “It’s a huge victory for the NDP. He’s the first federal leader who is racialized who will sit in the House of Commons. We’re very proud of that.”

The potential for disappointment in Quebec has cast a shadow on Singh since the 2017 leadership campaign, when questions were raised about how voters would react to a political leader who openly wears the symbols of his faith in a province where a debate over state secularism continues. Singh spoke briefly in French during his 19-minute victory speech in Burnaby on Monday night, pledging to travel to Quebec next week to deliver a “plan” that will unite left-leaning voters across French and English Canada—a goal he described as “the dream of Jack Layton.” Boulerice said Tuesday that Singh will unveil at least part of the party’s platform for voters in Quebec. But the Outremont defeat on Monday is being scrutinized closely because the province’s importance to the NDP began in that riding in 2007, when Thomas Mulcair won the longtime Liberal fortress for the first time. That win is seen as the precursor to Layton’s “orange wave” in 2011, which saw the party surge to 59 seats in the province. Fifteen of the party’s 40 current MPs now hail from Quebec. Farouk Karim, a former NDP press secretary who is from Montreal, contended Tuesday that the “bittersweet” mixture of Singh’s victory in Burnaby South and NDP candidate Julia Sanchez’s loss in Outremont is “not that bitter.” Sanchez took 26 per cent of the vote, Karim noted, arguing that shows solid support in the face of polls that have put voting intentions for the NDP in single digits across the province. That, combined with his view that the Green candidate’s third-place finish shows a strong desire for environmental action, gives the NDP something a solid foundation in Quebec, Karim said. “It’s not orange-wave level, but it’s not catastrophic either. It’s something to build on,” he said. Christian Bourque, executive vice-president of polling firm Léger, isn’t ready to count the New Democrats out in Quebec either. “The NDP is not dead,” Bourque said. “That was something people were watching out for because their national numbers are quite dismal. But, then again, the issue is the popularity of their leader across the country. As of this morning, he still remains the leader of the NDP.” Indeed, speaking to the Star in B.C., Singh was casting ahead to his arrival on Parliament Hill just before the Liberal government tables an election-year budget on March 19. He said the budget will be an opportunity for him to contrast the NDP’s call for Ottawa to directly build hundreds of thousands of affordable housing units, create universal pharmacare and invest heavily in clean technology with the Liberals’ housing plan and ongoing support—including the $4.4-billion purchase of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline—for fossil-fuel industries. “I want to see some commitments in this budget to make people’s lives better, to make the lives of people in Burnaby South better,” Singh said. “So that’s what we’re going to focus on when I get back into the House, to push this government to deliver something meaningful that will help people out right now.” Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

474,Empty,2019-02-27T20:10:01Z,Tom Parkin: Andrew Scheer is pinned down with a Max Bernier problem. And Jagmeet Singh is finally freed to take on the struggling Liberals. The post The election battle lines being drawn appeared first on Macleans.ca.,"Two new confrontations were laid bare by Monday’s byelections. And how, in the months upcoming, political parties play out these pre-election challenges will frame the final showdown, which ends when Canadians head to the polls in October.

In Burnaby South, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh improved the NDP vote considerably and won his seat comfortably—revealing that the endless winability doubts were more partisan concern trolling than political science. In York-Simcoe, his NDP result was status quo. In Outremount, his NDP exceeded expectations scoring 26 per cent support, but lost the seat. Quebec challenges lie ahead.

Trudeau’s Liberals should certainly take comfort in re-taking Outremont—but dropping eight points in Burnaby South and nine points in York-Simcoe should concern them. The average result across the three byelections would yield a minority—Liberals 32 per cent, Conservatives 29 per cent, NDP 27 per cent. And those results echo the Liberals’ poll support, which droops as Canadians muddle through the detail and arrive at the central fact that Trudeau and his staff repeatedly intervened with the attorney general in an effort to stop the corruption prosecution of a major Liberal donor.

READ MORE: The real bad news in Burnaby South might be for Andrew Scheer

The real loser on Monday night was Andrew Scheer. He has Bernier problems. Conservative support in Burnaby South dropped deeper into third place, bleeding to Bernier’s hard-right People’s Party. In Outremont, the Conservatives ran fifth. While they held York-Simcoe, a four-point boost is not the tide required to sweep Scheer to government. And unlike in Burnaby South, in York-Simcoe the Conservatives faced no threat from the People’s Party candidate, who simply failed to launch, earning just two per cent support.

Laid bare by the Burnaby South results, Scheer’s strategic problem is that the People’s Party has him pinned. He needs to fight the far-right People’s Party by appealing to its far-right supporters. That’s tough to do without alienating mainstream conservatives.

Scheer’s role at the recent “convoy” rally in Ottawa is a snap-shot of the problem. Though watching Scheer compete with Maxime Bernier and Faith Goldy—a politician on the white nationalist fringe—for the support of a rally infiltrated with yellow-vests must be stomach-turning for mainstream conservatives, there he was. And Scheer couldn’t not be there, fearing Bernier would claim unrivaled leadership of the rally.

Thanks to Bernier, Scheer is unable to turn against the far-right, unable to turn to them, with no clear way forward. This is one of the two critical pre-election fights.

The stage for the other key fight was set on Monday as Singh’s win finally unpinned the NDP from its Burnaby South focus. Trudeau’s months of byelection delay kept Singh on the west coast, unable to continue his introduction in Quebec, a crucial battleground where he is not well known. But with his byelection test now won, Singh can make his critical pivot to Quebec to confront the Liberals.

Singh walks into the Quebec confrontation armed with a 15-member Quebec caucus and a durable, if eroded, political base—certainly he leads a Quebec political force many-fold better than what former NDP Leader Jack Layton had in the 2011 election run-up.

And the terrain of this coming confrontation has many features—most obviously, the Prime Minister’s repeated, lobbyist-fueled interventions with the attorney general in an apparent attempt to stop the corruption prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The Trudeau Liberals are betting on the position that Quebecers, and Montrealers in particular, will excuse the PM’s effort to block a criminal prosecution because Trudeau says he was doing it to benefit Quebec. Singh and the NDP will try to pierce Trudeau’s veil of Quebec identity politics. Certainly, Liberals doing political favours for political friends remains an open sore in Montreal. So this skirmish will be fascinating to watch.

Another legal action, the trial of former vice-admiral Mark Norman, could add insight into the Liberal friends and favours political approach. Norman is charged with breach of trust by leaking confidential information while the Trudeau cabinet was considering switching a $670 million ship-building contract from Quebec City’s Davie Shipyard to the Halifax shipyard of the billionaire Irving family. Norman’s defense team will explore the relationship between former minister Scott Brison and the Irving family. Brison quit cabinet shortly after court documents listed him as a trial witness.

And in Quebec there are hilltops to be gained by attacking Trudeau’s failure to meet carbon targets and buying a bitumen pipeline. There is concern about failing to protect culture from massive corporations like Netflix. There is anger at tax haven inaction. Trudeau may be the government, he may be ahead – it doesn’t mean Quebecers wouldn’t choose a better option, if it came along.

A critical strategic objective of the NDP has always been to create a bond between progressive voters in Quebec and across Canada. Antipathy to Liberals whose idea of federalism is doing favours for insider friends in both official languages—at the expense of the people of Canada, including Quebecers—may be just the bond the NDP needs. With Singh now unpinned, and Scheer trapped in a side-battle with Bernier, the NDP has a few pre-election months to strengthen that bond.

Rankin said in an interview on Thursday his decision was very difficult, and serving as an MP has been the “most rewarding experience” of his life.

“I’ve got to know so many people in our community,” he said. “I’ve got to know so many great colleagues here in Ottawa in the caucus. One of the great benefits of being an MP is in order to do your job and represent people, you have to know people from all walks of life and I’ve really enjoyed that.”

The 69-year-old also said his choice is about moving to a new chapter in his life and has nothing to do with the NDP’s prospects or Jagmeet Singh’s leadership.

The party has been lagging in popular support and fundraising.

He suggested the New Democrats’ fortunes are “definitely going up,” adding that Singh won his Burnaby South byelection by “significant margins” over both the Liberal and Conservative candidates.

“It looks to me to be a turning point,” he said. “We will have a leader in the House … I think people will be able to see a distinct contrast between us and the Conservatives and Liberals.”

Rankin joins a growing list of NDP MPs who have announced they are not going to be running again in October’s election.

The list includes Alberta MP Linda Duncan, Ontario MPs Irene Mathyssen and David Christopherson, Quebec’s Helene Laverdiere, Romeo Saganash, Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach and B.C.’s Fin Donnelly.

Former MPs Kennedy Stewart and Sheila Malcolmson also left their jobs. Stewart is now Vancouver’s mayor and Malcolmson is a provincial politician in B.C.

Former Quebec MP and leader Tom Mulcair also quit politics to work as a visiting professor at Universite de Montreal.

Rankin said Thursday he takes pride in work he’s done on issues including fighting for tax fairness and medical assistance in dying and working to ensure Canadians serving jury duty can access psychological supports.

“I hope I’ve made a difference,” Rankin said.

He said his work with the House of Commons justice committee has also been important, suggesting the “constitutional crisis” involving former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould will be an issue discussed for many months.

Rankin stressed he will not be working any less until the end of his mandate as MP.

The Canadian prime minister plowed ahead Thursday after his former attorney general alleged, in explosive testimony aired on national television, that he interfered in the justice system by pressing to end a criminal case against an iconic Quebec construction firm. Speaking to reporters in Montreal, Trudeau insisted again his government had every right to consider the job losses that could result from a guilty verdict for SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.

The scandal has suddenly made Trudeau vulnerable, consuming his Liberals in the run-up to an election in which he’d have otherwise have been the frontrunner. He’s lost his polling lead for the first time since June, and the controversy has undermined his personal brand as a progressive leader who singlehandedly returned his moribund party to power in 2015 on a pledge of change. “It’s very damaging and it’s very serious,” said Penny Collenette, a University of Ottawa professor who served as director of appointments under a former Liberal prime minister. Every politician wants to protect jobs, she said. “But I think the question that needs to be asked here is: at what cost?” Trudeau’s fate depends on several factors — including whether cabinet stands by him and the Liberals stay united. Only a handful of lawmakers have voiced any measure of support for Jody Wilson-Raybould, who quit cabinet last month but remains a Liberal member of parliament. The prime minister hasn’t decided yet whether to force her out of the party’s caucus.

Divided They Fall Any divisions within his government on the matter could be fatal for efforts to convince voters the Liberals have done nothing wrong, said Nik Nanos, a pollster with Nanos Research Group. Trudeau, at the centre of the crisis and with his own popularity waning, will also need a more team-oriented campaign in the next election to win voters who may blame him for the current crisis.

For Justin Trudeau, the days of ‘sunny ways’ are over “If a narrative emerges that the caucus is divided on this, that will be lethal for Justin Trudeau,” Nanos said in a telephone interview. “I can’t remember any party leader winning an election with his caucus divided. If the caucus can’t even agree, how is it that they can govern?”

The latest polls already show the Liberals have lost their lead in voting intentions. An aggregate of public opinion surveys maintained by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. shows Trudeau’s team with 33.9 per cent of the vote, below the Conservatives with 35.8 per cent. What’s hurting the prime minister is the extraordinary spectacle of a former high-ranking member of his government now emerging as its most powerful critic — and his rivals smell blood. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called for Trudeau’s resignation and wrote the Royal Canadian Mounted Police seeking an investigation. The police force hasn’t said whether or not it will look into the matter. New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh is demanding a public inquiry. Among those Wilson-Raybould accused of improper pressure is Bill Morneau, who she said she spoke to in the House of Commons. The finance minister said Thursday it was Wilson-Raybould who approached him, and defended the actions of his chief of staff, Ben Chin, in stressing the magnitude of potential job losses at the company. “My role is, and continues to be, to think about how protect Canadian jobs,” Morneau told reporters in Toronto. “I will continue do that. I think that’s critically important for us to understand in every decision we take as a government.” Wilson-Raybould also took aim at Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former principal secretary, who on Thursday asked to be allowed to speak to a committee of lawmakers to tell his version of events. The former attorney general — whose absence from cabinet was filled Friday by shuffling portfolios among existing ministers — may also end up testifying again. United So Far But no current minister has broken ranks. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told the CBC she couldn’t imagine Trudeau applying inappropriate pressure, and signalled frustration that Wilson-Raybould was now taking aim at cabinet. “At the end of the day, when you leave the room, you have to play as a united team,” Freeland said. Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he believes Trudeau was within the “box of what’s legal” with his actions, and that no one should jump to conclusions. “We should take the time to listen to the other witnesses.” Champagne and another minister, border security chief Bill Blair, each brushed aside a question on whether Trudeau should replace key staff. “I remain very confident in the work of this government,” Blair said. Parliament adjourns on Friday for a two-week break, due to return in time for Morneau’s March 19 budget. The path of the scandal could also depend on what Liberal lawmakers hear while away from Ottawa, in their home districts scattered across Canada. “They’re going to get earfuls,” Collenette said. “If the truth is really two perceptions, then voters will make up their minds. But they need facts.”

It is more than worrisome that … the bigshots in Trudeau's inner circle do not hold the foundational democratic principle of the rule of law to be especially sacrosanct after all

Blame the mainstream media generally, or even specifically The Globe and Mail, which broke the story a month ago, all you like. Recite as accurately and loudly as you please from the Liberal party handbook’s provisions on “jobs for the middle class and people working hard to join it.” The slightest hint that this thematic talking point is being deployed as a justification for monkeying around with judicial independence will be seen by reasonable people as fatally self-incriminating. But go right ahead.

These prevarications were not what the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights heard on Wednesday morning from Gerald Butts, the principal secretary to Justin Trudeau, and Trudeau’s dear friend for three decades, who resigned three weeks ago after having found himself a central character in the whole drama. In his long-awaited testimony, Butts insisted there was no improper pressure applied to attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, at least not intentionally, and that all that was being asked of her was that a “second opinion” might be sought on the propriety of a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin, instead of a criminal prosecution. An eminent jurist might be consulted. Or perhaps a panel of jurists.

When Butts talked about the 9,000 SNC-Lavalin jobs that may or may not be at stake in the case, he spoke as a Cape Bretoner, from a family of miners. He spoke with his heart and his guts. As for his account of his interactions with Wilson-Raybould, and his take on the various communications and encounters the Prime Minister’s Office had with Wilson-Raybould on the SNC-Lavalin file, the most generous reading would be that it’s all been one big horrible misunderstanding.

Whether this repairs any of the damage done to Team Trudeau cannot yet be known, but that Ipsos-Reid poll was concluded even before Treasury Board president Jane Philpott resigned from cabinet on Monday. Her explanation: “Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised.” Set your hair on fire if you must, but Philpott’s view is in complete agreement with the opinion Ipsos-Reid attributes to the overwhelming majority of Canadians.

Carleton University’s Philippe Lagassé, an expert on the Westminster system of government, goes so far as to say that there’s a silver lining to the SNC-Lavalin scandal, or affair, or crisis, and it’s that “we’re witnessing a healthy democratic immune system at work.” This is quite correct. But the flags would also still be flying and Canada Post would still be delivering the mail even if the crisis reached such a pitch as to cause Trudeau to resign in despair and ignominy. All the better for the Liberal party too, perhaps. To lead them into an election in October, or sooner, they might choose, say, Jody Wilson-Raybould, or perhaps even Jane Philpott, or someone with credibility on both sides of these internecine Liberal rumbles. Somebody untainted by all this. Anybody with more gravitas than Trudeau.

It would be amusing to see how Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives would handle that. They’ve invested so heavily and deeply in building up Trudeau as the bane of Canadian prosperity and low-tax liberty they might well be lost without him. They’d already constructed Gerald Butts as a sinister, Rasputin-type character. As Trudeau’s bloodless consigliere. And he’s not there anymore. As for the New Democratic Party’s Jagmeet Singh, the gravest threat he poses to the Liberals is that he can outperform, outdance and outdo Trudeau in any quarter of the fashionably intersectional politics that take up so much space these days across the liberal-left. How would things go for Singh, without Trudeau to kick around?

To lead them into an election in October, or sooner, they might choose, say, Jody Wilson-Raybould

But for all his charm and his wavy hair and his wokeness, Trudeau is only the Liberal party’s public face, its primary celebrity endorsement. It’s all well and good to evaluate Trudeau’s treatment of Wilson-Raybould as a measure of his feminist credentials, which Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland has so ably, if floridly, affirmed. Reasonable people can differ about that. But the only reason we’re preoccupied with these sideshows in the first place is that the Liberal majority that took over the House of Commons four years ago began as Trudeau’s personal vanity project. And in the pushing and shoving of a crisis like the SNC-Lavalin imbroglio, Liberal party rhetoric is increasingly and predictably taking on exactly the tenor and tone you’d expect of a personality cult.

This is why it’s been so exceedingly difficult to make sense of whether there’s any merit in Team Trudeau’s sketchy and inarticulate answers to the more important questions at hand. Was the persistent hounding of Wilson-Raybould really within the bounds of collegial cabinet issue-probing? Was the point of all those texts and emails and meetings really just, you know, to kick some ideas around? Is it possible that it was all just a big misunderstanding? Is there really some genuine excuse available in the constitutional ambiguities that arise from a minister wearing an attorney general’s hat as well as a justice minister’s hat?

Let’s grant Team Trudeau the benefit of the doubt at least to the point that its case, such as it is, may have its merits. They haven’t exactly helped themselves by allowing all those ugly stories to be circulated about Wilson-Raybould, or by allowing Finance Minister Bill Morneau to try to undermine Philpott, for instance, by ascribing an ulterior motive to her resignation — a bond of loyalty and personal friendship that binds her to Wilson-Raybould. Morneau’s rudeness followed Trudeau’s insistence that the 30-plus members of his cabinet must publicly declare their confidence in him. To swear a loyalty oath, in other words.

Are we supposed to believe that Morneau’s insinuations about Philpott’s motives do not themselves arise from his own loyalty to Trudeau? After all, if Trudeau hangs because of this, the same rope will tighten around Morneau’s throat, because as Wilson-Raybould’s testimony showed, Morneau was up to his neck in it all.

They haven’t exactly helped themselves by allowing all those ugly stories to be circulated about Wilson-Raybould

For now, we’re all still stuck with a perfectly plausible scenario that involves Trudeau and his most senior officials involved in a sordid effort to make a Quebec engineering giant’s criminal charges go away, hounding and badgering attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould until she was shuffled out of her post and rendered powerless. Butts’ evidence may well take some wind out of that.

And in the pushing and shoving of a crisis like the SNC-Lavalin imbroglio, Liberal party rhetoric is increasingly and predictably taking on exactly the tenor and tone you’d expect of a personality cult.

This is why it’s been so exceedingly difficult to make sense of whether there’s any merit in Team Trudeau’s sketchy and inarticulate answers to the more important questions at hand. Was the persistent hounding of Wilson-Raybould really within the bounds of collegial cabinet issue-probing? Was the point of all those texts and emails and meetings really just, you know, to kick some ideas around? Is it possible that it was all just a big misunderstanding? Is there really some genuine excuse available in the constitutional ambiguities that arise from a minister wearing an attorney general’s hat as well as a justice minister’s hat?

Let’s grant Team Trudeau the benefit of the doubt at least to the point that its case, such as it is, may have its merits. They haven’t exactly helped themselves by allowing all those ugly stories to be circulated about Wilson-Raybould, or by allowing Finance Minister Bill Morneau to try to undermine Philpott, for instance, by ascribing an ulterior motive to her resignation — a bond of loyalty and personal friendship that binds her to Wilson-Raybould. Morneau’s rudeness followed Trudeau’s insistence that the 30-plus members of his cabinet must publicly declare their confidence in him. To swear a loyalty oath, in other words.

Are we supposed to believe that Morneau’s insinuations about Philpott’s motives do not themselves arise from his own loyalty to Trudeau? After all, if Trudeau hangs because of this, the same rope will tighten around Morneau’s throat, because as Wilson-Raybould’s testimony showed, Morneau was up to his neck in it all.

They haven’t exactly helped themselves by allowing all those ugly stories to be circulated about Wilson-Raybould

For now, we’re all still stuck with a perfectly plausible scenario that involves Trudeau and his most senior officials involved in a sordid effort to make a Quebec engineering giant’s criminal charges go away, hounding and badgering attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould until she was shuffled out of her post and rendered powerless. Butts’ evidence may well take some wind out of that.

In the meantime, the flag is still flying on government buildings. So at least there’s that.","Terry Glavin: Gerald Butts’ testimony couldn’t save Trudeau’s skin, but the rest of us will be fine",Nationalpost.com,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/terry-glavin-his-friends-testimony-hasnt-helped-trudeau

Wilson-Raybould described what she considered an inappropriate attempt by political staffers, and even the most senior bureaucrat in the country, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, to pressure her to overrule the director of public prosecutions and negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin so it could avoid a trial over allegations it used bribery to secure government contracts in Libya.

The former justice minister told the committee that she believes the sustained pressure was inappropriate and amounted to ""political interference"" but that it wasn't illegal.

Here are some key moments from the former attorney general's committee appearance:

1. 'Sustained pressure' and 'veiled threats'

After Kathleen Roussel, the director of public prosecutions, decided in September 2018 that she would not make a deal and would proceed with a trial against SNC Lavalin, Wilson-Raybould said she reached a similar decision on the matter — and made it clear to all in government that she would not intervene in the PPSC process.

The former minister said despite that position, she still fielded 10 phone calls and sat for 10 in-person meetings with members of the PMO, including Mathieu Bouchard, Trudeau's adviser on Quebec issues, and special adviser Elder Marques, among others.

Despite attempts to convince her to reconsider her stance given the possible economic consequences, Wilson-Raybould said she was undaunted in her position and that she should take no further action.

She also said she faced pressure from Ben Chin, Finance Minister Bill Morneau's chief of staff, and Gerry Butts, the prime minister's former principal secretary, to consider the consequences. Butts resigned last week while saying he acted ethically.

Wilson-Raybould said she was reminded by these staffers of the political consequences for both the provincial and federal Liberal parties if SNC-Lavalin folded or laid off workers.

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada,"" she said.

""Within these conversations, there were express statements regarding the necessity for interference in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential for consequences, and veiled threats if a DPA was not made available to SNC,"" she said.

2. 'I am an MP in Quebec'

When Wilson-Raybould raised her discomfort with the pressure she said she faced with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a September meeting, she said Trudeau told her he, too, was worried about SNC-Lavalin layoffs and the company's continued viability if it were convicted of the criminal charges.

A conviction could bar the firm from bidding on federal contracts for up to 10 years, a key source of revenue for the company.

""At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that 'I am an MP in Quebec — the member for Papineau.'""

""I was quite taken aback,"" Wilson-Raybould said.

""My response — and I remember this vividly — was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye — I asked: 'Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.' The prime minister said, 'No, No, No – we just need to find a solution,'"" Wilson-Raybould said Wednesday.

Speaking to reporters after her testimony, Trudeau denied any wrongdoing and said his government was principally concerned about job losses, namely for the 9,400 Canadians who work for SNC-Lavalin, when there were discussions about the DPA.

3. 'Partisan political considerations'

Wilson-Raybould said after she told the prime minister in September that she had made a decision on the matter, all lobbying efforts by his staff and others should have immediately stopped.

""Various officials urged me to take partisan political considerations into account — which it was clearly improper for me to do,"" she said, citing talk from PMO staffers about the upcoming Quebec provincial election where the Quebec Liberal Party was facing a strong challenge from the Coalition Avenir Quebec, the right-of-centre party that ultimately prevailed.

""We either have a system that is based on the rule of law, the independence of the prosecutorial functions, and respect for those charged to use their discretion and powers in particular ways – or we do not,"" she said.

PMO staffers Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques were ""kicking the tires, I said no, my mind had been made up and they needed to stop, this was enough,"" Wilson-Raybould said. 0:41

Wilson-Raybould said she then met with Butts on Dec. 5, 2018, to discuss the ""barrage of people hounding me and my staff.""

4. 'Need to find a solution'

Wilson-Raybould said that Butts told her that, despite her misgivings, there needed to be some sort of ""solution on the SNC stuff.""

Butts is then said to have told her that he didn't like how the former Conservative government had created the Public Prosecution Service of Canada in the first place — a prosecutorial arm separate from other lawyers in the justice department.

After the meeting and amid her clear reluctance to ""find a solution,"" on Dec. 18, 2018, her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, was ""urgently summoned"" to meet with both Butts and the prime minister's chief of staff, Katie Telford, to discuss a DPA.

In a text message exchange said to have been sent immediately after that meeting, Prince told Wilson-Raybould about the conversation.

""Gerry said 'Jess, there is no solution here that doesn't involve some interference,' Wilson-Raybould said, reading the text message from Prince to the committee Wednesday.

""At least they are finally being honest about what they are asking you to do! Don't care about the PPSC's independence. Katie was like 'we don't want to debate legalities anymore.' … They kept being like 'we aren't lawyers, but there has to be some solution here,'"" Prince said in a text to Wilson-Raybould.

5. 'Saturday Night Massacre'

Then, on a phone call with Wernick on Dec. 19, Wilson-Raybould said the clerk made it clear to her that the prime minister was ""quite determined, quite firm"" on the matter and that he wanted to know why the DPA route ""isn't being used.""

Wernick told her that Trudeau was ""a bit worried.""

Wilson-Raybould said Wernick told her that Trudeau is ""gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.""

The clerk said the prime minister was not asking her to do anything ""outside of the box of what is legal or proper.""

Wilson-Raybould said she was quite sure she was making the right decision and that Wernick's messages on the matter were ""treading on dangerous ground here.""

""And I issued a stern warning because as the AG ... I cannot act in a partisan way and I cannot be politically motivated. And all of this screams of that,"" she said.

When Wernick told her that Trudeau understood it was Wilson-Raybould's decision alone to make and she should be aware of what the prime minister wanted on this matter, the former minister said she had thought of the ""Saturday Night Massacre.""

WATCH | 'I was having thoughts of the Saturday night massacre.'

""I was confident that I had given the prime minister my best advice to protect him."" 1:15

Wilson-Raybould was referencing a series of events in 1973 when former U.S. president Richard Nixon, during the Watergate scandal, ordered justice department officials to fire the special prosecutor probing the matter.

The attorney general, and then the deputy attorney general, resigned when asked to take this action by the president.

Wilson-Raybould said she thought she, too, would have to resign instead of following through with a direct order from the prime minister to sign a DPA or else.

6. 'I did not consider resigning'

Asked why she didn't resign from her position as attorney general and justice minister during the time she said improper pressure was being applied, Wilson-Raybould said:

""I was, in my opinion, doing my job as the attorney general. I was protecting a fundamental constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence and the independence of our judiciary. That's my job. That was my job, rather, as the attorney general.

She argues it amounted to interference in the judicial system, though concedes it wasn’t illegal, while Trudeau says he was trying to prevent job losses in his home province of Quebec.

Justin Trudeau is facing the most explosive crisis of his administration after his former attorney general detailed a months-long campaign by the Canadian prime minister’s office to quietly end a legal problem for an iconic Quebec construction firm.

The public airing of grievances will inflame the scandal, which has driven the governing Liberals lower in national polls. The ordeal dredges up ghosts of the party’s past, which is marked by hand-in-glove ties with corporate Canada — particularly in Quebec. The political fallout, however, is difficult to predict. Trudeau’s path to re-election runs through the largely French-speaking province, where his defence of SNC-Lavalin is being applauded.

Her testimony shook the core of the Trudeau’s team, naming him, his finance chief and his most senior aides. The Conservative leader trying to unseat Trudeau in this fall’s election called for his resignation, but the prime minister stood his ground and rejected Wilson-Raybould’s version of events.

“I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere,” the former attorney general said Wednesday afternoon. Wilson-Raybould, who quit cabinet this month, also said she faced “veiled threats” about what might happen if she refused to order an out-of-court settlement.

“I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau said Wednesday night in Montreal, where he was celebrating a Liberal Party byelection victory. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy.”

SNC-Lavalin had been pushing for what’s known as a deferred prosecution agreement to end a criminal case dating back more than a decade, related to corruption charges. The company’s stock plunged the most in six years Oct. 10 when it revealed that the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ruled out a negotiated settlement that would have staved off a trial. Settling out of court would also help the company, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada, avoid a ban on bidding for federal government contracts.

Wilson-Raybould pulled back the curtain on the effort to change that decision and help the company, in testimony that was aired on national television in its entirety. She spoke to lawmakers only after Trudeau waived privilege to allow her to do so, and believes she wasn’t even legally able to intervene.

Inner circle

She said the prime minister and his aides wanted to end the case in part to prevent the company’s relocation — and also to avoid electoral fallout for both the federal Liberals and the party’s provincial wing. Wilson-Raybould said she resisted intervening because she wanted to uphold the principle of judicial independence and the rule of law, but officials ignored her repeated instructions to stop raising the issue.

The former attorney-general identified a series of phone calls and meetings between her or her staff, and Trudeau or several of his top advisers. They include chief of staff Katie Telford; former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who resigned this month; and senior aides Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques. She also cited communications with Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his chief of staff Ben Chin.

One of the meetings was with Trudeau himself, in September. “The prime minister raised the issue immediately. The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC,” Wilson-Raybould said. She said she’d told him she had made up her mind.

London calling

“The prime minister again cited the potential loss of jobs and SNC moving,” while also stressing that he represents an electoral district in Quebec. She said Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, the country’s top bureaucrat, also warned her the company “will likely be moving to London” without her intervention.

Discussions continued. Wilson-Raybould said Bouchard at one point said bluntly: “We can have the best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected.”

She met Butts in December in Ottawa, and was already frustrated by what she called “the barrage of people hounding me and my staff.” She pushed back. “I raised how I needed everybody to stop talking to me about SNC, as I had made up my mind and that the engagements were inappropriate.”

She read a text-message conversation with her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, who was relaying a conversation with Butts and Telford. Wilson-Raybould said Prince was told by Butts “there is no solution here that does not involve some interference.” She said Prince told her Telford said: “We don’t want to debate legalities anymore.”

Opposition reaction

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, who is Trudeau’s top rival, demanded the prime minister step down over the revelations. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the third-place New Democratic Party, called for a full public inquiry.

Wilson-Raybould was ultimately moved in a cabinet shuffle last month, before the scandal broke. Trudeau at first sought to downplay it by saying Wilson-Raybould’s presence in cabinet should speak for itself. She resigned the next day.

To be sure, she said she didn’t believe Trudeau or his aides broke the law, but that their interventions were inappropriate. Wilson-Raybould also said no one ever flatly directed her to intervene. Trudeau has echoed that. The former attorney general said she didn’t think it was inappropriate to discuss the potential of job losses early on, but became inappropriate to continually do it, and to raise the political ramifications of the situation.

SNC-Lavalin has said it’s no longer focused on getting a remediation agreement, but instead on fighting the case. It’s also facing legal proceedings that allege it delayed disclosing that it would not get an offer of a deferred prosecution agreement, from Sept. 4 to Oct. 10. SNC-Lavalin said Wednesday the prosecutor’s “final decision” was only made Oct. 9.",Trudeau stares into abyss after former AG’s explosive testimony,Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/02/28/trudeau-stares-into-abyss-after-former-ags-explosive-testimony.html

Less clear are the Prime Minister’s motives— and what to do about the Montreal-based company while protecting the principle that no one is above the law, too big to jail or more powerful than politicians, courts and prosecutors.

The brazen, swaggering attitude of SNC-Lavalin executives was clear from the start. On Sept. 4, the director of public prosecutions told executives she would not defer prosecution on charges of corrupting public officials. It seems the executives’ response was to call up some public officials.

According to Wilson-Raybould, on Sept. 6, Ben Chin, chief of staff to Finance Minister Bill Morneau, was explaining “what the terms were that SNC was prepared to agree to” with Jessica Prince, Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff.

While some people perhaps thought the law was negotiable, the director of public prosecutions clearly did not. There are pre-conditions, set in law, that must be satisfied before a company can be offered a DPA—evidently she believed SNC-Lavalin had not met them.

READ MORE: The two women seizing control of Ottawa

So rather than fix the company, a parade of Liberal ministers and staff worked to fix the prosecution.

Wilson-Raybould testified that the Prime Minister pushed her to override the prosecution for political motivations. “It would be unlawful for me to do that,” she told the justice committee.

It seems others were less concerned. “There is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference,” Gerry Butts, the Prime Minister’s then-principal secretary, allegedly told Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff. And Katie Telfold, Trudeau’s chief of staff, could “line up all kinds of people to write op-eds” saying a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin “is proper.”

That SNC-Lavalin executives were attempting to dictate “what the terms were” suggests they weren’t willing to make the scope of admissions the prosecutors required. Not only must executives admit the company’s criminal guilt. They must agree on the factual basis of the firm’s liabilities—including which public officials it corrupted, both elsewhere and in Canada. Naming names greatly expands the pool of people motivated to keep terms narrow.

Certainly in other situations—like General Motors or Sears—the Prime Minister has shown little motivation to help workers, which he claims drove his actions in the SNC-Lavalin case. And at any rate, SNC-Lavalin largely lives on the public dime, building public assets and managing P3 public services. Unlike General Motors in Oshawa, jobs at the SNC-run North Battleford hospital, the Toronto-area highway 407 or the Montreal LRT expansion don’t disappear.

But regardless of motivations, the question of what to do with SNC-Lavalin is still real. And it has political resonance, especially in Montreal, where the company has its head office.

Before Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Trudeau’s ends-justify-means approach seemed to have sway among Quebec political commentators. But that appears to be shifting, creating a vulnerability for Trudeau and opportunity for NDP leader Jagmeet Singh and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer.

At La Presse, columnist Patrick Lagace wrote that Wilson-Raybould’s testimony suggested Trudeau’s commitment to the rule of law and attorney general independence were “negotiable” and declared that “between the rule of law and SNC-Lavalin, I will choose the rule of law.” Paul Journet questioned the “judgement and probity” of Justin Trudeau. Francis Vailles concluded that given the political costs, Wilson-Raybould must have had “serious legal grounds for saying no.”

Quebec Justice Minister Sonia LeBel called Wilson-Raybould’s testimony “troubling,” saying politicians must “make sure there is no undue pressure” on legal institutions.

Andrew Scheer has little electoral reason to offer solutions to the SNC-Lavalin problem, and risks giving People’s Party leader Maxime Bernier an opening if he does.

As shown by the fifth-place finish in last week’s Outremont by-election, Scheer shouldn’t have high hopes for wins in Montreal. All of Scheer’s 10 Quebec MPs represent seats near Quebec City. Part of that geographic cluster of conservative sentiment is the riding of Beauce, Bernier’s seat.

Bernier has condemned SNC-Lavalin as crony capitalism—and would no doubt be pleased to move against Quebec Conservatives on any evidence that Scheer would aid the company. Expect Scheer, who needs to be concerned about Bernier’s party after its showing in the Burnaby South by-election, to continue to focus on allegations of political interference but avoid solutions to what he points out is a Montreal-based company.

Jagmeet Singh’s 15-member Quebec caucus represents various regions of Quebec, including Montreal—and Singh’s competitor is Trudeau, not Bernier.

If Trudeau’s strategy has been to fix the prosecution rather than the company, Singh’s offer could be the complete opposite—to protect jobs by getting the company to come clean. That current executives seem to believe public prosecutors should bend to their terms doesn’t inspire confidence.

The Caisse de depot, Quebec’s $300-billion pension fund, has increased its ownership stake to 20 per cent of SNC-Lavalin stock. The Quebec premier has indicated his readiness to take an ownership stake. Why wouldn’t a social democratic party pledge to also invest in the company if executives will commit to meet the prosecutor’s requirements, come clear on the full scope of wrong-doing—including naming names? It’s a tantalizing option for many reasons.

Every political party is looking for their key to unlock Quebec’s 78 seats—40 of which were won by the Liberals last election. The mysteries of the SNC-Lavalin scandal have created a dramatic stage on which to look for it.

Prominent NDP MP Nathan Cullen will not be seeking re-election, becoming the 13th member of his party to make such an announcement.

“Before every election -- I’ve been in five of them -- before we go in my family and I always sit down and talk about whether we want to do this,” Cullen told CTV News Channel Friday evening from his home in Smithers, B.C. “I felt that representing this place and also trying to do my work in Parliament as well as having a young family, it was kind of unsustainable, actually. And it felt like this was the right time to go.”

Cullen, who represents the federal riding of Skeena-Bulkley Valley in northwestern B.C., made the surprise announcement Friday afternoon along the snowy banks of the Bulkley River in Smithers.

“From the advancement of Indigenous rights and title to the protection of our rivers and coasts, from fighting for better jobs to demanding more accountability in our government, these past 15 years have been a great adventure and challenge,” Cullen said in a statement. “I have experienced this work as a powerful vocation and calling, and I have given it my full heart and mind.”

Cullen was first elected to the House of Commons in 2004 and currently serves as the NDP’s critic for democratic reform. In 2012, he placed third in his party’s race to replace its late leader, Jack Layton.

“It’s real mixed feelings today,” Cullen added in his CTV interview. “I love this work, I love being able to represent this place, and yet I also know for me and where I’m at right now that this is the right decision.”

Cullen joins a growing list of NDP MPs not seeking re-election this year, including fellow B.C.

Despite not seeking re-election, Cullen has vowed to help the NDP and leader Jagmeet Singh in their upcoming campaign.

“We need transformational change in health care in Ontario,” Health Minister Christine Elliott said.

Elliott pointed to the thousands of people waiting for long-term care every day or the 1,200 people who receive care in hospital hallways.

“What we are doing is centring care around the patient, that is the most important consideration,” Elliott told reporters after question period at Queen’s Park.

“We have to do better and we will do better.”

The plan will apparently scrap the Local Health Integration Networks that increased bureaucracy across the system but did not deliver the health-care coordination promised.

It’s time for an election. Clear the air and get these people back to real work before they turn the legislature into a Harry Potter summer camp.

United Conservative Party staffers recorded Jeremy Nolais, Premier Rachel Notley’s issues manager, coming out a door in Edmonton’s Federal Building, which is actually a provincial building where MLAs have offices.

A bit later, Independent MLA Prab Gill emerges from the same door. He gives the camera a cheery thumbs-up.

Shot in black-and-white from sitting level, the video is mildly weird. It’s clearly meant to look like footage from a security camera, as if Nolais and Gill are about to rob a convenience store.

Twitter exploded with charge and counter-charge — not fair, politicians should be able to meet, Nolais and Gill are cooking up something, etc. etc. Pick your partisan conspiracy theory.

The UCP is not contrite about shooting the video.

“I think it’s legitimate to ask why a senior official in Premier Notley’s office was meeting with a known ballot-stuffer,” said UCP caucus press aide Christine Myatt.

You can understand their curiosity. Gill, who quit the UCP caucus, denies the improper balloting charge but accuses the UCP of running a crooked leadership contest.

UCP Leader Jason Kenney called the meeting “dirty politics at its worst” and accused the premier’s office of co-ordinating attacks with Gill.

Gill says they were just talking about fixing a school in his riding. Of course!

Nolais said on Twitter: “Right, I’m supposed to check for the creepy guy with the video camera when I walk into the foyer of a public building.”

MLAs and ministers talk cross-party all the time — although it is unusual for a guy of Nolais’s stature to go across the way to visit a lowly Independent MLA.

The NDP is no more apologetic than the UCP.

“The video is kind of creepy, but if that’s how they want to spend their time I guess they can go ahead,” says Cheryl Oates, Notley’s spokeswoman.

“We’re certainly not embarrassed by this. We don’t have any problem with Albertans knowing people from the premier’s office meet regularly with MLAs from all parties.”

There are darker suspicions. Luke LeBrun, editor at Press Progress, tweeted:

“The Office of Jason Kenney set up a surveillance camera to monitor a whistleblower to the RCMP who is also a witness in an active investigation by the Election Commissioner.”

If so, it was very sloppy surveillance, since Gill spotted the camera and gave it a cheery salute.

But Derek Fildebrandt, leader of the Freedom Conservative Party, says spying on MLAs in their private offices is a serious privacy offence and possibly breaches parliamentary privilege. The legislative assembly office may investigate.

The UCP says the NDP often shoots video of Kenney.

Nathan Rotman, Notley’s chief of staff, did that last April in a committee meeting. His tweet, since deleted, said Kenney was cheering for the Trans Mountain pipeline to fail.

NDP and UCP media people regularly record each other’s scrums and leader interviews. That’s been going on for years.

What is unusual in this case is the UCP people seem to be staking out Gill’s legislature office.

But it’s hard for a journalist to moralize about that, too. We stake out politicians regularly, occasionally at their homes.

The video itself provides virtually no useful context.

Nolais comes out a door that could be anywhere. He walks to an elevator with a pen in his mouth (don’t fall, Jeremy!)

Ten minutes later, according to text on the video, Gill comes out through the same door and walks to the same elevator. He pushes the down button.

We know only that both men were behind the same door for a while, and took the elevator instead of getting some heart-healthy exercise on the stairs.

And yet, upon the very blank ambiguity of the scene, both sides build whole conspiracy theories.

By Tuesday afternoon, one of the most boring videos in existence had been viewed about 60,000 times on the original Unite Alberta Twitter feed.

After the election, one cluster of these people will be running the province. Such a thought.

Deputy minister Nancy Naylor sent boards a memo Thursday noting that the government implemented a hiring freeze in June and that school boards may wish to institute similar measures.

When that public service hiring freeze was instituted, the government said it didn’t apply to front-line staff such as police and fire services, and Premier Doug Ford said it also didn’t apply to nurses or teachers.

Naylor advised the boards this week to defer filling vacancies for retirements and other leaves for teachers and other staff until the minister gives them an update by March 15.

“I am writing to you today to recommend that school boards exercise prudence in making hiring decisions in light of the upcoming Ontario budget and the recent consultation on class size and hiring practices,” she wrote in the memo.

The consultations launched in January contemplate the possibility of removing class size caps for kindergarten and primary grades.

NDP education critic Marit Stiles suggested the promise of an “update” by March 15 is ominous.

“The Conservatives, I believe, have just put families on notice that deep cuts are coming to their children’s education,” she said.

Education Minister Lisa Thompson’s office did not make her available for an interview, but she said in a statement that her priority is ensuring all students have access to a meaningful education.

The NDP government is determined to begin construction on the 11-kilometre project linking the Trans-Canada Highway and Highway 8 this spring, said Transportation Minister Brian Mason.

“It won’t be long before the ring road is part of Calgarians’ daily lives with the completion of a plan 50 years in the making,” said Mason, who also took a shot at the previous Conservative government and UCP Opposition that’s vowed to cut spending.

“We know Alberta has faced an enormous infrastructure deficit and we’ve done our best to correct that . . . We’re going to continue to build the infrastructure necessary to set the stage for the sustained growth of our economy.”

He said any suggestions the announcement was being made to shore up NDP fortunes in Calgary before an impending election are misleading.

“My preference is to announce it before an election but none of the projects are designed to serve election purposes,” said Mason.

“We’ve been working with the City of Calgary on this for years.”

EllisDon has been awarded a $463-million contract to build the project’s north phase between Highway 1 and Old Banff Coach Road, while the AECON Group and Flatiron Construction will work to twin the Stoney Trail bridge over the Bow River in a deal worth $89 million.

A contract for the leg’s southernmost portion is expected to be signed this spring, said Mason.

The west portion will link up with Highway 8 at the west edge of the Discovery Ridge subdivision and hook into the southwest leg, which should be finished in the fall of 2021, said Mason.

“The southwest ring road portion is ahead of schedule,” he said.

The entire west leg, to be completed in the fall of 2022, will likely cost more than $1 billion to build, say government officials.

The west and final phase of the 101-kilometre ring road around the city will include six interchanges and 24 bridges along a six- and eight-lane divided roadway.

The twinning of the existing Stoney Trail bridge could cause some traffic disruptions but because it involves building an entirely new bridge, those should be minimal, said Alberta Transportation officials.

Mason acknowledged construction of the adjacent southwest Calgary ring road has provoked complaints from nearby residents, including those in the West Springs area where a gravel crushing operation feeding that leg is located only metres from homes.

A gravel operation to accommodate the west leg has been sited far from residential neighbourhoods, he said.

“We’ve learned a great deal from building the southwest portion in dealing with communities,” said Mason.

Some construction inconveniences are inevitable, said Coun. Ward Sutherland, whose Ward 1 will contain the northernmost reaches of the west ring road.

“During construction there’s initially some pain, but it’s beneficial for absolutely everybody,” said Sutherland.

The last phase, he noted, will finally close the circle on a city ring road decades in the making.

“We’ve been waiting for this for many years,” said Sutherland.

The two contracts are expected to create about 2,700 jobs, said the province.

Brad Blair has asked the courts to force the provincial ombudsman to investigate the appointment of Toronto police Supt. Ron Taverner to the Ontario Provincial Police top job.

The government has denied any political interference in Blair's firing as deputy commissioner, and said the decision to fire him Monday came from the public service because Blair released confidential OPP information through his court filings.

This is reprisal and an attempt to muzzle me. Brad Blair

Blair was fired by Mario Di Tommaso, deputy minister of community safety, and Blair alleges that was a conflict of interest because Di Tommaso was part of the hiring panel that selected Taverner and is therefore part of the case before the court.

""It is patently clear to me that this is reprisal and an attempt to muzzle me, and that this reprisal is directly connected to my good faith efforts to seek redress before the Divisional Court and the provincial ombudsman,"" Blair writes in an affidavit filed Tuesday in court.

If there were concerns about the material Blair was filing in court being in the public realm, the attorney general could have asked the court to seal the documents, Blair writes.

In a statement Tuesday, Blair said raising concerns about real or perceived political interference was the right thing to do, even though it ended his nearly 33-year OPP career.

""The cost of a compromised OPP is too great a price to pay,"" he said. ""The OPP can be called in to investigate provincial politicians, and the citizens of Ontario need to have faith that the OPP is truly independent, above political interference, and free from abuses of power.""

Di Tommaso's hand-delivered termination letter to Blair says that he recently filed internal OPP emails in court, after Blair had been warned not to do so in a Dec. 28 letter.

""Your failure to comply with my clear directions in furtherance of legal proceedings brought in your personal capacity has ruptured the trust on which the employment relationship is built,"" the termination letter says.

The Dec. 28 letter said that it shouldn't be construed as disciplinary action, but Di Tommaso wrote that he expected Blair to comply with proper procedures in the future.

Frank Gunn/CANADIAN PRESS Ontario Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services Sylvia Jones chats with Finance Minister Vic Fedeli in the Ontario legislature in Toronto on Dec. 17, 2018.

Community Safety and Correctional Services Minister Sylvia Jones denied that Di Tommaso — who is also Taverner's former boss — was in a conflict of interest.

""The deputy minister of public safety is going to have a very critical and important role in ... what is happening in our police services,"" she said. ""I think that we have to keep in mind that the recommendation was from one individual, but it was a nine-member committee (of the Public Service Commission) that ultimately made the decision.""

Blair also says in his latest court filings that one of the members of the Public Service Commission that approved his firing also participated in Taverner's hiring process.

Ford has previously described the job of OPP commissioner as a ""political appointment,"" telling a television anchor the premier could even appoint him commissioner.

Opposition calls for public inquiry

The NDP is calling for a public inquiry into the whole situation.

""We need to have this thing blown wide open so that people can get a real sense of who's pulling the strings and manipulating the process,"" said NDP Leader Andrea Horwath.

Taverner, 72, initially did not meet the requirements listed for the commissioner position. The Ford government has admitted it lowered the requirements for the position to attract a wider range of candidates.

Taverner's appointment has been delayed until the integrity commissioner completes an investigation into his hiring.

Bernard Weil/Toronto Star via Getty Images Supt. Ron Taverner speaks to reporters in Toronto in a 2013 file photo.

A Dec. 14 letter from the premier to the integrity commissioner was included in Blair's new court filings, and in it Ford said the rank requirements were removed following discussions between the recruitment firm, the secretary of cabinet and Di Tommaso. Ford said he is not aware of any consultation with his office on the change.

""I reject any assertion that this change was made to specifically permit Mr. Taverner's application for the position,"" Ford wrote. ""I would agree that some of the allegations that have arisen could have been avoided had the ranking requirements been removed from the job ad before its original posting.""

Ford told the integrity commissioner that his office was part of the initial recruitment planning process, and retained an external executive search firm to assist.

I would agree that some of the allegations that have arisen could have been avoided... Premier Doug Ford

""I believe this fact alone refutes any allegation that there was an orchestrated plan to appoint Mr. Taverner,"" he wrote.

Blair was also in the running for the commissioner's job, and was acting OPP commissioner at the time he started his legal case, but soon after was removed from that position.

Blair initially requested an ombudsman investigation into Taverner's appointment in December, amid what he called ""growing concerns of political interference"" in the hiring process. He said it had deeply affected the morale of rank-and-file officers.

Blair has also threatened to sue Ford, alleging the premier damaged his reputation when he said Blair violated the Police Services Act by speaking out against Taverner's hiring.

The push is coming from public-health advocates and from at least one Liberal MP, Toronto's Nathaniel Erksine-Smith.

article continues below

""One of my constituents lost her nephew to the opioid crisis because of fentanyl and the lack of a safe supply,"" he said. ""If we want to save lives, we know that thousands of Canadians are dying because of an unsafe supply. If we want to save lives, we need to make that supply safe.""

Public-health experts are also advocating for removing of criminal sanctions for possession of small quantities of opioids to help to reduce stigma in seeking treatment, Erksine-Smith added.

British Columbia's provincial health officer has called for Ottawa to look at ways of supplying safer opioid drugs, saying B.C. and other parts of the country are grappling with a poisonous street-drug supply that is killing people because they can't tell what's in the drugs they use.

Richard Elliott, the executive director of the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, said it is necessary to address the toxicity of the drug supply to ultimately reduce the number of deaths.

His organization was part of a Canadian coalition that called on the government last fall to address the issue of supply, pointing to toxicology results from across Canada that reveal opioids purchased in the illegal market are often contaminated with fentanyl and its analogues. Those can be much more potent than the opioids users believe they are consuming, and the difference between an ordinary dose and a lethal one is tiny.

""When you are in an emergency and the stuff you can get illegally is largely contaminated and may kill you even if you are seeking to be safe, as most people are, then we need to figure out, 'OK, how do we substitute something safer for you to use instead of what you're currently purchasing on the street and that is killing too many people,' "" Elliott said in an interview this week.

The opioid crisis is affecting every community in every province and territory, said NDP health critic Don Davies, adding that Canadians understand that people are losing their lives as a result of ""poison street supply.""

""Nobody is advocating drug use,"" he said. ""But as a public-policy response, they recognize that at least if we can control the supply, we can keep people alive and that's a better public-policy approach than letting them die in the streets or alone in their homes.""

Davies said he shares the concern of advocates who recently expressed concern that the federal Liberals won't want to address the issue in an election year.

Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor said she asked her department to explore options to address the toxic supply in the fall, adding she looks forward to seeing advice from Canada's top public-health doctor Theresa Tam on how to move forward.

""When we've consulted with many stakeholders, professionals and also individuals that use drugs, they've indicated the issue of safe supply is something we should really be looking at,"" Petitpas Taylor said. ""That's exactly what we are doing.""

In a December interview, Tam told The Canadian Press that said clamping down on the market-driven supply of illicit drugs is not easy.

""I think my plea is an escalated, compassionate response,"" she said. ""To implement a lot of these measures, you need society to be on side.""

Tam's comments came after the Public Health Agency show that 94 per cent of opioid-related deaths in 2019 were classified as ""accidental poisonings.""

Nearly 72 per cent were unintentional deaths involving highly toxic fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances.

The Progressive Conservative government paused implementation last year of a law from the previous Liberal government that would require all publicly advertised job postings to include a salary rate or range, bar employers from asking about past compensation, prohibit reprisal against employees who discuss compensation and require large employers to track and report compensation gaps.

Based on the most recent data from Statistics Canada, the gender wage gap accounting for the annual earnings of all workers is 29.3 per cent, meaning that women earn about 71 cents for every dollar that men earn. The gap for annual earnings of full-year, full-time workers is 22.6 per cent, as more women than men are in part-time work. And when using hourly wage rates, the gap is 11.3 per cent.

Labour Minister Laurie Scott said the Liberals passed the legislation right before the election without any consultations, and she said people affected by the law wanted an opportunity to be heard.

“We’re committed to closing the gender wage gap,” she said in an interview. “I think taking the time and listening to the many stakeholders about how to do it properly – and how to have, in some cases, interesting ideas that we haven’t heard of on how to address the gender wage gap – is valuable.”

Under the law, employers with 100 or more employees would have to calculate their wage gaps and report that information.

The consultation questions ask the best way to calculate the wage gap, including if bonuses, overtime pay and commissions should be involved, what the reporting periods should be, and how much time and money it would take to meet reporting requirements.

“If you are an employer with 100 or more employees, how much do you estimate the cost of pay transparency reporting will be,” such as IT, software and personnel costs, the consultation paper asks.

“How many hours do you anticipate pay transparency reporting will take in total?”

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said she is insulted by the questions, and all women should be, too.

“What the message is with that kind of a survey and that kind of a question is that I guess this government believes that pay equity for women is red tape and there’s no need to ensure that women have pay equity,” she said.

“If we’re ever going to get to a place where we have pay equity we need to know what the numbers are.”

Scott defended the questions, saying she wants companies to be able to report their wage gap numbers.

“I don’t want it to be onerous, but we want as much participation as we can get,” she said.

Ashley Challinor, the vice-president of policy at the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, said the organization recognizes the gender wage gap as a challenge and is looking forward to giving feedback.

“Our concern is that this legislation does not interact with the Pay Equity Act, the existing legislation that seeks to address the pay gap,” she said in a statement. “This is, unfortunately, an example of layering on of regulation instead of modernizing and streamlining it – which negatively impacts compliance and the effectiveness of the regulation.”

Elizabeth May says the NDP government’s “Keep Canada Working” campaign centered around the controversial pipeline project is misleading.

“Canadians deserve to know the facts about the cost of the Kinder Morgan pipeline,” May said.

“The Notley government’s ‘Keep Canada Working’ ads exaggerate the economic benefits and hide the many risks. This pipeline is a liability any way you look at it.”

May said the Trans Mountain pipeline will create 90 permanent jobs, not thousands of jobs as indicated by the Alberta government.

“The delay to the Kinder Morgan pipeline costs the country of Canada about $40 million a day and there are tens of thousands of jobs at stake,” Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said last April.

Alberta’s NDP government said the expansion will help sustain good paying jobs for thousands of Canadians.

“The Conference Board of Canada has estimated that the project would result in 37,000 jobs across Canada,” a government statement to Global News read.

“Fifteen-thousand new jobs will be created during project construction. Thirteen-hundred annual full-time marine sector jobs will be created during operation.”

READ MORE: Workers left in limbo as construction on Trans Mountain pipeline stops

Trans Mountain said there were 2,000 people working on the pipeline before the Federal Court of Appeal struck down the project’s original approval last summer, citing issues over the impact on marine life and Indigenous consultation.

The company said it expected the project would employ 5,000 workers by the middle of the year had it not been postponed.

The Green Party leader also suggested the safest way to transport bitumen is as a solid by rail rather than by pipeline.

“The only way to transport bitumen, which is a solid, through a pipeline is mixing it with a toxic diluent,” the party’s statement read. “When that mixture spills it’s impossible to clean up.”

“I am often asked: ‘Doesn’t Canada have truth in advertising laws?’ We do, but the Canadian Code of Advertising Standards doesn’t apply to government paid advertising for political issues,” May said. “The Alberta ad campaign demonstrates that it should.”

On Feb. 19, Notley announced the province was spending $3.7 billion to move landlocked oil to market by rail.

The province said transporting oil by rail cars is more expensive, less efficient and less environmentally-friendly than by pipeline.

“We could be getting so much more out of our products then we do, but instead, we are forced to curtail production and lease rail cars to move our product,” a government statement read.

READ MORE: Notley cautiously calls NEB Trans Mountain decision a step in the right direction

Last week, the National Energy Board conditionally approved the Trans Mountain expansion and made 16 new recommendations to the Governor in Council.

The NEB said the project could cause environmental harm but that the benefits of the pipeline outweigh the effects.

“We’re pleased that we got a recommendation to the federal cabinet and that we can hopefully see them move forward in a timely way,” Notley said.

Notley said she is not expecting the federal cabinet to approve the pipeline before the next provincial election, which by law has to happen before the end of May.

The Trans Mountain expansion would triple the amount of oil flowing from Alberta to the B.C. coast for export to overseas markets.

READ MORE: ‘This is B.C. vs. Canada’: Alberta has spent $23M on Keep Canada Working campaign

According to documents obtained by Global News, Keep Canada Working is a national advertising campaign with multiple messaging arms for different parts of the country.

In January, the province told Global News $23.4 million had been spent on the Keep Canada Working campaign out the total budget of $31 campaign committed to the campaign.

The money is going towards television, radio, print, online and billboard ads that tout the Trans Mountain Pipeline as a project that would boost Canada’s economy and create jobs.

The Alberta government said the campaign is having an impact.

“Before the campaign started roughly four in 10 Canadians agreed that we need new pipelines. Now that number is almost seven in 10,” the province’s statement read.

“We continue to see more news confirming increased awareness of the topic and that the vast majority of Canadians agree our lack of pipelines is a crisis and we need to get pipelines built.

A pardon, or “record suspension” sets the offence aside, but doesn’t erase it. The pardon can be reversed if the person is convicted of new crimes or is “found to no longer be of good conduct.”

“I think it’s a step in the right direction, but unfortunately does not go far enough.,” says University of Toronto professor Akwasi Owusu-Bempah.

“The practical consequence is that they still could be accessed by some levels of government or law enforcement agencies. They may appear in court. And most importantly, they could be reversed. The most practical thing is that it’s still there.”

Last October, NDP MP Murray Rankin introduced a private member’s bill that would “expunge,” or completely erase, old possession convictions.

That process would be similar to the one the government followed with historic same-sex offences, where people can apply to have a record permanently erased if the acts were consensual. Owusu-Bempah favours this approach.

“Expungement is the government acknowledging that a behaviour never should have been criminalized in the first place. Whereas a pardon or record suspension is forgiving someone for having done something wrong.”

Most importantly, Owusu-Bempah says, expungement protects people against a future government that might want to reverse the amnesty.

“If another government were to come in and decide that the record suspension never should have been implemented in the first place, and that cannabis legalization should not have come about, that could also be reversed.”

Destroying the records makes that impossible, much as the destruction of the long gun registry in 2012 made it difficult for a new government to reconstruct it.

In a comment sent Friday evening, a spokes​person in Goodale’s office called the concern “alarmist and uninformed.”

“Attempts to revoke (the record suspensions) would be met by vigorous court challenges that would almost certainly succeed,” Scott Bardsley wrote in an e-mail.

READ MORE: 6,000 Canadians would be covered by gay pardon decision

Goodale explained last October that the government saw same-sex convictions as a “fundamental injustice” in a way that marijuana possession convictions weren’t.

“The laws with respect to cannabis that have existed historically we believe are out of step with current mores and views in Canada but are not of the same nature as the historic social injustice that was imposed in relation to the LGBTQ2 community,” he said.

“The difference here is the nature of the offence.”

Conservative public safety critic Pierre Paul-Hus’s office said they would comment after the text of the bill had been published.

It’s not clear how many Canadians have a record for possession of marijuana, since some were convicted under a generic drug charge that doesn’t specify the drug involved. However, advocates claim about half a million people are affected.

However, if officials have to individually investigate each case to see if it involved marijuana or some other drug, it would greatly complicate the process. San Francisco recently deleted over 8,000 marijuana convictions going back to 1975.

TORONTO -- Ontario is consolidating its local and provincial health networks to create a central agency as part of a system overhaul, the health minister announced Tuesday, though she wouldn't say if the move will save money or lead to job losses.

Legislation introduced Tuesday would create a new agency, called Ontario Health, to consolidate the 14 local health integration networks, Cancer Care Ontario, eHealth Ontario and several other agencies. The system transformation, including establishing local health teams to co-ordinate care, will take years, Health Minister Christine Elliott said.

""Too much time and attention is spent on maintaining a siloed and fragmented system, and far too many people believe it is the patient's or the family's job to navigate this complicated system during what is already one of the most traumatic and stress-filled periods in their lives,"" Elliott said. ""That is just wrong.""

Background materials from the government say that each of the agencies being rolled into Ontario Health has a full senior management team and administrative support, ""and over time some of this work has become duplicative.""

The ""duplicative"" work refers to some of the administrative functions, Elliott stressed, but she said those services will be required in the new local health teams, too.

""I think we have to look at this as a rearrangement, but rearranged around the patient,"" she said. ""This is not a financial exercise.""

When asked how many staff would lose their jobs as a result of the reorganization, the minister said that is something she can't answer right now.

""We promised that we would put more people on the front line in health-care services, and that's what we intend to do so that there are people who are working in the LHINs, for example, right now who provide wonderful home care,"" Elliott said. ""We will still need them. Nothing's going to change that way. People will still need home care. We want to make sure that we can amplify those home care numbers. So, in the end, it will work out.""

Elliott didn't say if the government expects to save money through the agency consolidation, but noted Ontario spends 42 cents of every dollar on health care, and studies show the province isn't getting good value for it.

The other agencies being rolled into Ontario Health are Health Quality Ontario, Trillium Gift of Life Network, Health Shared Services Ontario, and HealthForce Ontario Marketing and Recruitment Agency.

As well, Ontario Health Teams will be established to provide what Elliott called seamless access to health services, including primary care, hospitals, home and community care, palliative care, residential long-term care, and mental health and addictions services.

The teams would be responsible for delivering all of the care for their patients and connecting them to services. Elliott said the goal is to have 30 to 50 health teams set up, each responsible for up to 300,000 people. It won't change how patients go to the doctor, Elliott said.

A group of providers will come together -- for example a hospital, a local nurse practitioner clinic and a mental health team -- and will be responsible fiscally and for the delivery of care to everyone within the geographic area, Elliott said. The health teams will be given a lot of flexibility in how they operate to allow for local variation, officials said.

People will still be able to choose who provides their care, and more choices will be available through technology, Elliot said, such as giving patients an option to securely access their electronic health records and virtual care options.

""Imagine, we can book appointments online,"" Elliott said. ""We have access to our own health-care record.""

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said she fears the changes will open the door to greater privatization of services.

""This morning's press conference did not allay our concerns about opening up our public health care system to private, for profit, motivated corporations,"" she said.

The Ontario Health Coalition said it would fight any attempt to privatize the public non-profit health services, while the Canadian Union of Public Employees said it will begin escalating actions across the province to push the government to reconsider the changes.

""This dangerous Ford government reboot of our public health system must be stopped before patient care and safety fall victim to the gaps, holes and pitfalls this massive overhaul will create,"" said CUPE Ontario President Fred Hahn.

But the changes had some supporters in the health care sector, including the associations representing the province's doctors, registered nurses and hospitals.

Dr. Nadia Alam, president of the Ontario Medical Association, welcomed the proposed changes, saying patients are currently struggling to get the care that they need.

""If we can do anything to make that easier it's a good day,"" she said.

Anthony Dale, the CEO of the Ontario Hospital Association, said a broader view of the health-care system will help address overcrowding and help break down barriers that exist between care providers in the health-care system.

""One in six hospital beds are occupied by someone who needs to be in long-term care or at home or assisted living,"" he said. ""It's a system wildly out of balance.""

The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario said they're optimistic that the government plan will divert money from middle management in the health bureaucracy to front line care.

""I think some of those organizations, quite frankly, have ballooned in terms of staffing,"" said CEO Doris Grinspun. ""I think what they need is a very clear mandate.""","Province unveils new 'Ontario Health' super agency, co-ordinated health teams - CTV News",Ctvnews.ca,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/province-unveils-new-ontario-health-super-agency-co-ordinated-health-teams-1.4312887

Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press

Shortly after becoming Premier, Doug Ford demanded changes to his Ontario Provincial Police security detail because he didn’t trust the rotating cast of officers, according to newly disclosed court records.

Internal police e-mails filed in Ontario Divisional Court also show that the Premier’s office was interested in retrofitting a van for his travels, relaying a $50,000 cost estimate to the OPP.

Ontario Provincial Police Deputy Commissioner Brad Blair submitted the internal e-mails to bolster his claim that Mr. Ford and his office have interfered in police operations. The senior officer is asking the courts to order the province’s Ombudsman to review the hiring of Mr. Ford’s friend, Toronto Police Superintendent Ron Taverner, as the next OPP Commissioner.

Story continues below advertisement

Deputy Commissioner Blair, who was also a front-runner for the position, went public with his concerns in December, alleging that “inappropriate political interference or cronyism” could impact OPP operations. In his filings and correspondence, he alleged the Premier’s office directed a sole-sourced “off-the-books” request for the OPP to refit an executive van for the Premier’s use. He further alleged the Premier relayed to police that he wanted a meeting with then-OPP Commissioner Vince Hawkes to ask him to replace a rotating security detail for Mr. Ford with permanent bodyguards, and if not, ""perhaps a new Commissioner would.”

Deputy Commissioner’s Blair’s most recent court filings, made on Feb. 15, include internal e-mails about Mr. Ford’s concerns and an estimate for the van overhaul. The Premier’s office says, however, he should not be accessing those records and making them public.

“It is extremely troubling that Mr. Blair is apparently using his office to obtain confidential information and documentation and then filing such documents in a public court record to further his own personal agenda in the court process he himself initiated,” said Simon Jefferies, a spokesman for the Premier.

In an e-mail to The Globe, the spokesman added that the allegations about off-the-books purchase requests by the Premier’s office “are a complete fabrication by Mr. Blair and are categorically false.”

NDP MPP Taras Natyshak released a statement saying the van proposal is “wildly inappropriate"" when the government is implementing budget cuts elsewhere. ""It’s the gravy train for Ford, and cuts for everyone else.”

The OPP e-mails filed in court show that in mid-July, just a few weeks after the Progressive Conservative government had taken power, Mr. Ford expressed concern about his shifting cast of police-assigned bodyguards. In an e-mail to his supervisor, an officer assigned to Mr. Ford relayed the Premier’s displeasure as he prepared to travel to a first ministers meeting.

“[W]hat ... is going on? I’m going to Moncton with 3 officers I don’t know. This is too much. ... I keep getting new people in the truck. I just want my own protection team,” Sergeant Terrance Murphy wrote what Mr. Ford told him after he picked him up to go to the airport. He reported the Premier saying he had no faith in newly assigned bodyguards.

“I have not formed the trust with them. I have asked for my own detail of officers who I trust already. It feels like I’m not being heard, like I’m getting f***ed around by the OPP, and I’m getting more pissed off,” the e-mail reads.

“I’m going to call the Commissioner and sort this out,” the Premier then said, according to the e-mail.

In the July e-mail exchange, the police officer quotes Mr. Ford as saying he wanted to meet the then-OPP Commissioner “so he can see how serious I am about this. If he can’t sort this out, then maybe a new Commissioner can make it happen.”

The Premier’s office defended Mr. Ford’s request and again took issue with the release of internal e-mails related to security.

“These types of requests are made by politicians of all stripes, at both the federal and provincial levels of government,” said Mr. Jefferies. “Internal police reports are by definition, in our opinion, highly confidential documents.”

The Globe and Mail reported this week a senior government official warned Deputy Commissioner Blair in December about publicly disclosing any more sensitive OPP materials as part of his court bid.

The OPP e-mail exchanges filed in court further reveal that on Nov. 21, when the hunt for a new commissioner was concluding, the OPP received an e-mailed cost estimate of $50,696 for the interior redesign of an executive van for the Premier’s potential use.

A Mississauga company called A1 Mobility had provided this estimate – which involved installing WiFi, leather seats, a mini-fridge, a couch and a TV – to an executive assistant in the Premier’s office, who in turn relayed it to the police force.

Deputy Commissioner Blair has alleged in court documents that this cost estimate was relayed in a potential contravention of police procurement policies. The Premier’s office says these assertions are “categorically false.”

“As has been repeatedly stated by the Premier, he requested the OPP look into the possibility of obtaining a cost-effective used van for purposes of working and travelling the province,” said Mr. Jefferies. “The e-mails sent to the OPP from a member of the Premier’s Office staff are not an official procurement of a van, instead they are a cost estimate and reveal an effort to minimize expense.”

Mr. Jefferies said the retrofit has not happened. OPP Staff Sergeant Carolle Dionne said the police force would not comment about matters that are being litigated, including what happened to van-retrofit request that was received by the OPP.","Doug Ford demanded changes to his OPP security detail, according to court filings - The Globe and Mail",The Globe And Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-doug-ford-demanded-changes-to-his-opp-security-detail-according-to/

Ford banned the media after the Star revealed lobbyists had been enlisted to sell tickets to Wednesday’s event, which attracted 3,200 people who paid $1,250 each to attend the posh dinner.

Government House Leader Todd Smith dismissed opposition criticism of a decision by the Progressive Conservatives to ban media from a fundraising dinner Wednesday night. “It was open to everyone who wanted to buy a ticket, and then it was open to everyone via livestream,” he said. ( Chris Young / THE CANADIAN PRESS FILE PHOTO )

Journalists are typically allowed to cover premiers’ major fundraisers, but leave immediately after the speech and before the meal is served. Stung by the fallout after it emerged government lobbyists had been conscripted to hawk tickets, Ford closed the Toronto Congress Centre event to reporters, who were only able to cover his remarks using a Tory-supplied livestream. Opposition parties say the premier was clearly trying to conceal who was there.

“When you’re banning the media, it’s obvious that you have something to hide,” NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said Thursday. Interim Liberal Leader John Fraser told reporters that Ford “didn’t want you to see who was there last night.” “That was what this was about. I can remember our big fundraising dinners, (the media were) always invited for the speech,” said Fraser. “It’s an event with 3,200 people — it’s a big speech ... so why would you not be there? He probably didn’t want you to talk to who was there,” he said. Green Leader Mike Schreiner said by preventing the media from covering the event in person, Ford, whose campaign slogan is “for the people,” was doing the public a disservice.

“I just want to know what the premier is trying to hide. Did he not want the media to know which corporate lobbyist sold the most tickets? Which deep-pocketed insiders have the most access to the premier?” said Schreiner. While Ford was not in the legislature on Thursday, he sent a thank-you email to supporters.

“Last night was incredible. Nobody has ever raised as much money as we did last night. Nobody has ever hit the number of donors we did,” the premier wrote. “There can be no doubt we’re going to get this job done. From the bottom of my heart ... thank you,” he concluded, signing his missive “Doug.” Under fire from the New Democrats in the legislature, government house leader Todd Smith defended Ford’s move to close the dinner to the media. “It was an excellent night last night. It was open to everyone who wanted to buy a ticket, and then it was open to everyone via livestream last night,” said Smith, suggesting NDP MPP Taras Natyshak was jealous of the Tories. “When it comes to fundraising, our party is doing exceptionally well. I can understand why he’s turning red in the face or green with envy. It’s because they’re not raising anything. You know why? People aren’t buying what they’re selling. They’re buying what we’re selling,” he said. Natyshak (Essex) said Ontarians should be alarmed by the “disturbing edicts” from Ford. “Media reports in the Toronto Star today indicate that some unusual edicts have been coming out of the premier’s office. Desperate to sell tickets, the premier’s office allegedly ordered lobbyists to sell tickets to clients under threat of losing access to this government,” he said. “Late yesterday, the order banning journalists from the evening’s festivities also came out of the premier’s office.” Robert Benzie is the Star's Queen's Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale tweeted Wednesday that he intends to give notice to introduce ""a bill to provide no-cost, expedited pardons for simple possession of cannabis,"" following up on promise made in October.

According to parliamentary procedure, a member must give 48 hours written notice before introducing legislation in the House of Commons.

A spokesperson for the minister said that means that bill could be tabled as early as Friday.

Later today, I will give notice to introduce a bill to provide no-cost, expedited pardons for simple possession of cannabis. —@RalphGoodale

The Liberal government first signalled its plans to waive the fee and waiting period for Canadians seeking a pardon for a past conviction for simple pot possession the day recreational marijuana was legalized last year.

As it stands, the fee for normal record suspensions is $631. The waiting period to apply is usually five years for a summary offence and 10 years for an indictable offence.

According to a 2014 study, more than 500,000 Canadians have a criminal record for having pot on their person.

Goodale has previously said the bill would ""shed the burden and stigma"" and break down barriers to jobs, education, housing or volunteer work.

However, the bill has already received criticism from the NDP.

A record suspension does not erase the fact that a person was convicted of a crime, but keeps the record separate from other criminal records.

“I prefer to drive around and talk to the people about things that matter — about creating jobs, lowering taxes, making sure we’re lowering the heating costs, lowering gas prices,” he added, claiming “we don’t have enough people for all the jobs we’ve created.” The two King Airs are used to fly premiers, the lieutenant governor and cabinet ministers is an eight-seat, twin-engine turboprop with barely five feet of room for passengers to stand. They are operated by the natural resources ministry, which also uses them to shuttle forestry workers. Natyshak accused Ford of “a lack of respect for taxpayers” in seeking $50,000 in customization on a passenger van, as revealed in court documents this week from a court case fighting the controversial appointment of Ford friend Ron Taverner as commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police. It is on hold pending an ethics investigation into any political influence in the hiring.

“I requested a used van that is about one-third the cost of the regular Suburban,” Ford replied, referring to the model of Chevrolet SUV typically used by the police force to transport premiers. Government House Leader Todd Smith later told reporters Ford was “simply inquiring” about getting a customized van and noted “there is no van.”

“He obviously didn’t like what it was going to cost or he decided not to do it now.” Natyshak also pressed Ford on his complaints about his rotating OPP security detail, in which the premier reportedly stated just weeks after being elected: “I’ve asked for my own detail of officers that I trust already” and expressing concerns that “I’m getting f-ed around by the OPP and I’m getting more p--ed off.” The premier brushed aside the New Democrat’s accusations he “demanded special treatment” from the police force whose officers drive Ford to and from home and events and provide security for him. “I’m speaking for my detail. They’re disgusted right now…if they could run in here right now, each and every one of them would be standing shoulder to shoulder with me. I think they’re incredible.” Ford’s office has said the premier simply asked for bodyguards with whom he was comfortable and that such a request is “hardly unusual.” The details about the van request and the security detail complaints were in court filings from Deputy OPP Commissioner Brad Blair, who was passed over for the top job given to Taverner, 72, a veteran Toronto police superintendent. Blair lawyer Julian Falconer has launched a civil case to force Ontario’s ombudsman to probe the Taverner appointment, which is already the subject of an investigation by provincial integrity commissioner J. David Wake. He has recently interviewed Ford’s chief of staff Dean French for more than two hours about his role in the hiring, Progressive Conservative sources have told the Star. An email filed in Blair’s court case suggests French was involved in the search for a new OPP commissioner — in particular, on a hiring panel conducting a second interview with Blair.

501,Empty,2019-02-28T23:43:55Z,Ottawa lawmakers requested an emergency debate Thursday to discuss allegations Prime Minister Justin Trudeau inappropriately sought to influence decision to charge SNC Lavalin.,"In the wake of Wilson-Raybould’s stunning testimony to the Commons’ justice committee Wednesday, MPs spent Thursday evening debating the allegations that have prompted calls for a police investigation and demands for the prime minister to resign.

OTTAWA—Jody Wilson-Raybould’s charge that top officials sought to “politically interfere” in an ongoing criminal case has plunged the government into “crisis” and shaken the confidence of Canadians in the judicial process, opposition MPs said during an emergency debate Thursday.

“The sustained interference and undermining by the key members of the prime minister’s office at the direct direction of the prime minister is a line that is crossed,” said Angus (Timmins-James Bay).

NDP MP Charlie Angus said the issue “cuts to the very heart of the question of the independence of the judicial system.

Conservative and New Democrats heaped criticism on the Liberals for “putting political considerations ahead of the rule of law” amid revelations that officials leaned on Wilson-Raybould to mediate a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin .

In testimony to the justice committee Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould gave a detailed account of meetings and phone calls between her and her office and Trudeau, his top aides, the top bureaucrat and officials in Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office.

Over four months last fall, “there was a sustained effort, an attempt to politically interfere with my discretion as the Attorney General of Canada. It was inappropriate,” Wilson-Raybould told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould had the power to intervene in the case and direct a remediated agreement for SNC-Lavalin, ensuring the company avoided criminal prosecution, which could have resulted in a 10-year ban on federal contracts.

Candice Bergen, the Conservative house leader, denounced Trudeau’s repeated denials that anything improper was done, accusing the prime minister of being evasive and refusing to “own up” to the allegations.

“This leaves us at a crisis,” Bergen said. “If we don’t have a prime minister who can be truthful, we can’t trust him to get to the bottom of this.”

Bergen (Portage-Lisgar) said that, from the start, the Liberals have stonewalled opposition efforts to get answers, refusing at first to call witnesses to the justice committee and had to be forced “kicking and screaming” to hold hearings on the matter.

Toronto Liberal MP Arif Virani, the parliamentary secretary to the minister of justice, tried to defend the government. He was said it was “refreshing” to hear Wilson-Raybould’s “important” testimony.

He picked out elements from Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, noting the former justice minister had affirmed it was always her decision whether to intervene, that it was okay to discuss job impacts and that she considered the interventions inappropriate, but not unlawful.

“She indicated that the state of our institutions, the independence of our processes was, indeed, strong,’ said Virani (Parkdale-High Park).

But Bergen mocked his depiction of her testimony, adding, “that sure wasn’t the testimony I heard.

“Her testimony was not refreshing; it was disturbing. It was sad. It was appalling,” Bergen said.

“We have a government that is being deceptive, that is not owning up to what they have done.”

Fellow Conservative MP Michael Cooper said that attempts by Trudeau’s aides and others to persuade Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the criminal proceeding, “smells of obstruction of justice.

“They knew what they were doing was wrong. They knew they what they were doing crossed the line. You know what? They didn’t care,” said Cooper (St.Albert-Edmonton).

Bloc Québécois MP Monique Pauzé (Repentigny) put a spotlight on the potential economic consequences if SNC-Lavalin is convicted of its charges and is slapped with a 10-year ban on federal contracts, putting some 9,000 jobs at risk.

“The only way we can save these is through a remediation agreement,” Pauzé said.

She branded Wilson-Raybould’s testimony as a “settling of scores” with the prime minister and questioned why the former attorney general refused to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

“She didn’t answer the most fundamental question: Why did she decide not to use a remediation agreement, thus avoiding the loss of thousands of jobs,” Pauzé said.

“She had the power to do so and she choose not to use it.”",LIVE: Parliament holds emergency debate on Jody Wilson-Raybould’s allegations on SNC Lavalin,Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2019/02/28/members-of-parlia.html

“We have one shot. After 15 years of Liberal waste, we need to fix this province,” wrote Miele. “On Wednesday, we’re holding the biggest fundraiser Ontario has ever seen. When Doug Ford hits the stage there can be no doubt: Doug Ford is the premier of the people,” he continued. “The opposition is crying foul. The media is crying foul. They can’t stand what they don’t understand. And they don’t understand how Doug Ford can be so popular.”

“It’s time to show the province, the country, and the world that Doug Ford has the support of the people. Because Doug Ford is for the people.” In an unusual move for such large events, the fundraiser has been closed to the media, although Ford’s speech will be available on a live stream.

Journalists are usually permitted to cover a premier’s speech, then leave before dinner is served. But the Conservatives have been scrambling to do damage control since it emerged last Thursday that they appealed to lobbyists for help, due to restrictions around fundraising introduced in 2016 by the Liberals. A ban on corporate and union donations — sparked by a Star probe of Liberal fundraising excesses — has made it more challenging to sell tickets. In the past, companies and unions could purchase entire tables for dinners and then distribute the tickets to employees, associates, clients or members. Under the current law, each ticket must be paid for by an individual. In an email appeal to clients obtained by the Star, Chris Benedetti, a principal at Sussex Strategy Group, a firm run by Conservatives and Liberals, said the company “has been asked to help with the event.” “The event is $12,500 for a table of 10 ($1,250/person). To reserve a table, please let us know, and we can assist you in assembling individual registrations to then be sent in as a package,” he wrote. Benedetti, who is registered to lobby for 60 different companies at Queen’s Park, said he was contacted last month by the party — not Ford’s office. “I have not spoken to anyone in the premier’s office about this event, and no one in the office or any other government office has been in touch with me to encourage sales or otherwise,” he said. NDP MPP Taras Natyshak (Essex) said “it’s becoming more and more clear how things work under this Ford government.” “If you’re a lobbyist who can help fill the empty seats at the premier’s fundraising dinner, you get access, and you get results. If you’re a family struggling to pay for treatment with autism — not so much,” said Natyshak. But government house leader Todd Smith said “no lobbyist is going to influence our premier.” “He’s been having $25 spaghetti dinners in communities right across Ontario, meeting with grassroots people in our communities. Listen, I’m not going to talk about the success that this party has had with fundraisers, because we’ve had a lot of success,” said Smith. “The NDP should think about having a fundraiser, because they’re not doing so well.” Robert Benzie is the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

504,Empty,2019-02-26T02:24:19Z,"In a reference case starting March 18, the NDP government is asking the B.C. Court of Appeal whether the province has jurisdiction to regulate the shipment of heavy oil through B.C. by pipeline or rail.","VICTORIA — The B.C. New Democrats have lost an embarrassing legal round in the fight with their Alberta counterparts over petroleum and pipelines.

B.C. filed a constitutional challenge to an Alberta law allowing that province to restrict fuel supplies to this province in retaliation for opposition to twinning the Trans Mountain pipeline.

But the challenge was tossed out in a Calgary courtroom because the legislation, though passed by the Alberta legislature, had never been proclaimed into force by their provincial cabinet.

“I am of the view that a claim seeking a declaration as to the constitutionality of an act that has not yet been proclaimed is premature,” wrote Justice R. J. Hall in a decision released Friday. “The claim of the Attorney-General of B.C. is premature, because the act is not in force in Alberta. The statement of claim is hereby struck.”

His five-page written judgment cited ample precedents for the courts not involving themselves in hypotheticals, like ruling on the constitutionality of legislation not in force.

One might have expected B.C. Attorney-General David Eby to have familiarized himself with those precedents before mounting an expensive court challenge. A simple check of Alberta cabinet orders would have established whether the offending legislation was actually in force.

But when pressed during Question Period in the legislature Monday an unapologetic Eby insisted that the reversal was no big deal.

“The entire claim was not struck out,” he insisted, taking refuge in the court having said that it was merely premature.

“We thought we had a principled argument to make when Alberta brought forward legislation that they were going to turn off oil-and-gas supplies to British Columbia,” he told Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson.

LISTEN: This week on the In The House podcast, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the 2019 provincial budget. Did the B.C. NDP present a prudent plan or did government miss a key opportunity to fulfill its agenda?

In an affidavit filed in court, the New Democrats conceded B.C. is dependent on Alberta refineries for 55 per cent of its gasoline and 71 per cent of its diesel, most of it shipped via the Trans Mountain pipeline.

“The affidavit goes on to say that British Columbia cannot replace that supply from viable sources,” as Hall noted in passing. “It says that reductions in supply from Alberta will cause shortages in British Columbia and that the result could be increased prices, lack of supply and civil unrest in British Columbia.

“The affidavit makes interesting reading as to B.C.’s supply of gasoline and diesel fuel, and its dependence upon Alberta,” continued the judge, confirming B.C. fears were anything but groundless.

Back to Eby: “We thought we had good reason to go to the court as early as we could to raise this issue and say that that would have devastating consequences, certainly, for British Columbia and we believed the action was illegal.”

Outside the house, Eby was more pithy. “Why do we have to wait to get punched in the face, before we complain about being punched in the face?”

Otherwise Eby said the government is studying the Alberta court decision and will decide whether to file an appeal.

The judge suggested a more sensible course of action: “Should the Alberta government proclaim the act in force, the Attorney-General of B.C. may recommence a claim.”

But such advice misses the point of the legal grandstanding by governments opposed to the pipeline expansion. Burnaby spent untold thousands of dollars on court challenges, never mind that there was no precedent for a municipality to overturn a federal government approved project.

The B.C. New Democrats famously vowed to use “every tool in the tool box” in their fight against the pipeline expansion.

Eby initially suggested that B.C. would only be going to court over the threatened fuel restrictions if the Alberta government actually made use of the legislation.

“Clearly the legislation is a bluff,” Eby told the legislature in April 2018 when the Rachel Notley government tabled the bill. “We think they are very unlikely to use this and we think they know it, and it is a bill for political purposes only.”

In the unlikely event that the Notley government did try to use it, Eby continued, “we would be in court immediately seeking an injunction to stop them from using it. But we would probably have to get in line behind oil companies that would be concerned about contracts that they have with companies in B.C. to deliver product.”

But after the Alberta government passed its legislation in May, Eby decided that bluff or no bluff, B.C. was going to court.

“We believe it would be reckless in the extreme and therefore highly unlikely that Alberta will actually attempt to use the powers they granted themselves,” he told reporters, repeating his earlier take on the bill.

Nevertheless he proceeded to hire legal heavyweight Joe Arvay to file the constitutional challenge that has now been rebuffed.

However Eby decides to proceed in that case, the government will be back in court next month on a different aspect of the pipeline fight.

In a reference case starting March 18, the NDP government is asking the B.C. Court of Appeal whether the province has jurisdiction to regulate the shipment of heavy oil through B.C. by pipeline or rail.

Though interprovincial pipelines and railways are federal jurisdiction, B.C. believes it has a legal opening because of provincial responsibility over the environment.

But even if that line of argument fails, the case will have served the NDP’s larger purpose of sparing no legal expense in fighting the pipeline.

505,Empty,2019-03-04T11:20:58Z,[East African] Sierra Leone's President Julius Maada Bio is appealing to the international community to support his $8 billion five-year development plan.,"Sierra Leone's President Julius Maada Bio is appealing to the international community to support his $8 billion five-year development plan.

The National Development Plan (NDP), launched on Friday, represents the administration's Medium Term priorities for 2019 to 2023.

The document focuses on eight areas, with emphasis on human capital and infrastructural development, promotion of good governance and protection of the vulnerable.

The NDP is anchored on the ruling Sierra Leone People's Party New Direction manifesto.

Officials say for the first time in the country's history, a comprehensive results and indicator framework accompanies a national development plan.

Many critics

The NDP is the fifth national development plan since Sierra Leone emerged from 11 years civil war (1991-2002), which destroyed its infrastructure. All of those plans have been rooted on the global Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs).

Late former President Ahmad Tejan Kabba, who governed from 1996 to 2007, presided over PRSP 1 and 2. His successor Ernest Bai Koroma, presided over PRSP 3 and 4, which were famously renamed 'Agenda for Change' and 'Agenda for Prosperity.'

For many critics, there was little to show in terms of development for the last 15 years, in spite of millions of dollars in aid that flowed into Sierra Leone.

The country remains at the bottom of the UN Human Development Index, raking 180 out of 187 in 2018. There was widespread poverty, with more than 60 percent of the population living on less than $ 1.25 a day, according to UNDP.

Unemployment among youths, the largest segment of the population, is 70 percent.

Aid and loans

Sierra Leone also notoriously has the world's highest rate of maternal mortality, at 1,165 deaths per 100,000 live births, an illustration of the poor state of its health sector.

According to analysts, an estimated $10 billion in aid and loans was poured into the country between 2002 and 2007. Most of that money is believed to have come in within the last 10 years of the Koroma administration.

The new government blamed the apparent failure of the previous plans on lack of consistency in implementation and absence of political will.

President Bio has been particularly critical of his predecessor's administration, which he said handed him a ""bankrupt and battered"" economy.

Some two million people, out of the country's seven million population, were consulted in the process of preparing the NDP, according to the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development.

The plan was drafted with the support of development partners, notably the UN and the British government.

The new plan also incorporates the UN Agenda 2030, as well as the African Union's 2063 Agenda.",Sierra Leone: Call to Support $8 Billion Development Plan,Allafrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201903040546.html
506,Empty,2019-03-02T02:22:48Z,"As for taxpayer funding, the Liberals will surely continue to need it until the election. If they win, they could then phase out the subsidy as did the Stephen Harper Conservatives when they were in power at the national level.","VICTORIA — Premier John Horgan was at the two-month mark of his term when he broke a major pre-election promise on political party financing.

As NDP leader before the election, Horgan said repeatedly that in getting rid of big money in politics, he did not intend to replace it with direct subsidies from taxpayers.

Indeed, he mocked the whole notion as fake news from the leading recipient of big money herself, Premier Christy Clark.

“It’s always alternative facts with the premier,” said Horgan. “She said my preference was taxpayers pay for political parties. That’s just not the case.”

Plus there was his answer to this question in a pre-election radio interview: “When you table your legislation, just to be clear, there is going to be nothing in there about, sort of, taxpayers having to fund political parties?”

Horgan: “Yeah, that is correct. That’s what we said in the past and that’s what we’re going to do after the May election, when we form government.”

Far from directly sticking taxpayers with a bill, the NDP election platform said party financing would be left to an independent commission, headed by the chief electoral officer.

But all that was relegated to the trash heap when the New Democrats introduced their bill to get big money out of politics in September 2017.

Gone was the independent commission. Gone the outside review of the options for party financing. In its place a direct serving of taxpayer funding, totalling $30 million over five years.

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s victory in the federal Burnaby-South byelection, the NDP government’s response to threatened school closures in Vancouver, the latest in the legislature spending scandal and the province’s response to a measles outbreak.

When reporters pressed Horgan on breaking his promise, he replied: “It is not what you are making it out to be. This is a transition fund and will be gone at the end of this mandate.”

Not so. A third of the $30 million was permanent and the rest could be extended by a future vote among the elected MLAs who stood to benefit most from the subsidy.

Not surprisingly, the Opposition exploded in outrage. “A travesty” and “a complete betrayal” and “disgusting,” said Andrew Wilkinson, soon to become the new leader of the B.C. Liberals.

But only one candidate for the Liberal leadership vowed to reject the promised taxpayer funding. That was Todd Stone, and he finished fourth.

Wilkinson, on winning the leadership in early 2018, swallowed his disgust and took the money — starting at about $2 million a year, under the per vote formula in the NDP legislation.

Nor have subsequent developments made it any easier for the Liberals to turn up their nose at the tax dollars flowing their way.

The most recent filing from Elections B.C. shows the Opposition having a harder time than the governing party adapting to the new fundraising regime.

The NDP raised just over $2 million between July 1 and Dec. 31, 2018. Over the same six-month span, the Liberals raised $1.69 million.

There was a similar gap over the full year, with the Liberals taking in $4.4 million to the NDP’s $5.5 million. Deducting the roughly $2 million subsidy that the two big parties each received, the gap appears even greater.

The Liberals raised just $2.4 million on their own, or about two-thirds of the $3.5 million tally for the NDP.

Trying to make the best of it was Emile Scheffel, executive director of a Liberal party still working to pay off its loans from the 2017 campaign.

“We actually beat the NDP on the category of contributions greater than $250, but they smoked us again on donations smaller than $250,” Scheffel told Rob Shaw of The Vancouver Sun.

“What that says is we have work to do overall. Where we’re going to focus that work is on smaller donations.”

Smaller donations from many individuals have long been a mainstay of NDP fundraising. Whereas the Liberals specialized in maximizing big-ticket donations from rich donors and corporations. Not surprising they are finding it harder to adapt.

The uphill struggle continues, judging from Scheffel’s recent followup to party supporters on the Nanaimo byelection.

With second-place finisher Tony Harris, the Liberals managed to better their performance from the 2017 general election in both total votes and share of the popular vote.

But they had to do so “with a fraction of past local campaign budgets,” while competing against the NDP political machine.

“A formidable beast,” writes Scheffel, “staffed by highly capable organizers, and it extends well beyond their core party organization. A plethora of NDP-friendly unions held well-timed conferences and meetings in Nanaimo, sending their members out to knock on doors.”

He also claims the NDP was assisted by “dark-money groups” of environmental and political activists: “These organizations are not required to disclose the majority of their funding, much of which comes from U.S. foundations whose economic interests are directly counter to B.C.’s and Canada’s.”

Consequently, says Scheffel, “we’re at risk of being outgunned in the key ridings that will decide the next election.”

As for the taxpayer funding, the Liberals will surely continue to need it until the election. If they win, they could then phase out the subsidy as did the Stephen Harper Conservatives when they were in power at the national level.

But for now the era of big public money replacing big private money continues.

And for irony watchers, there remains the spectacle of the party that squawked the most about John Horgan’s broken promise on taxpayer subsidies needing the money more than does the NDP.

Ron Taverner.,"Premier Doug Ford’s chief of staff has been interviewed by the ethics watchdog probing allegations of political interference in the appointment of Toronto police Supt. Ron Taverner as OPP commissioner. Progressive Conservative sources told the Star that integrity commissioner J. David Wake recently questioned Dean French for more than two hours about his role in the Ontario Provincial Police hiring.

French has been interviewed by the province’s integrity commissioner over the appointment of Toronto police Supt. Ron Taverner as OPP commissioner. ( Chris Young / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

The meeting is significant because documents filed with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice suggest French was actively involved in the search for a new commissioner. The government has insisted that Taverner, a 72-year-old Ford friend, was selected by an “independent” hiring committee that had nothing to do with the premier. Asked about the questioning of French, the premier’s office said Tuesday they are co-operating with Wake’s investigation.

While Ford has not yet met with the integrity commissioner, Community Safety Minister Sylvia Jones has. Documents filed by a lawyer for OPP Deputy Commissioner Brad Blair, who was passed over for the force’s top job, show French and then secretary of cabinet Steve Orsini, the head of the public service, and deputy minister Mario Di Tommaso, Taverner’s former boss at Toronto police, did the job interviews.

A Nov. 15 email to Blair from Odgers Berndtson, the executive search firm, confirmed that Ford’s chief of staff was on the interview panel. “This time around you’ll be meeting with Steve Orsini, Dean French and Mario Di Tommaso,” Odgers Berndtson project manager Sue Mahon wrote to the OPP deputy commissioner. That missive is part of a trove of documents filed by lawyer Julian Falconer in his push to have Ontario ombudsman Paul Dubé probe the Taverner appointment. Dubé has said it is beyond his jurisdiction. Wake’s separate inquiry was triggered by a complaint from the opposition New Democrats that the Members’ Integrity Act had been violated. Blair’s lawsuit has also brought to light that Ford’s office sought an OPP van for the premier with more than $50,000 in customized features, including a 32-inch TV, a Blu-ray DVD player, a mini-fridge, mobile Wi-Fi, leather captain’s swivel chairs and a “power reclining sofa bench.” New Democrat MPP Taras Natyshak (Essex) blasted the premier for demanding an “over-$100,000, off-the-books, taxpayer-funded super-van.” “The vehicle the premier asked for sounds like the Taj Mahal on wheels,” Natyshak said of the Ford Transit passenger van, which has a base price of about $42,000. Customization and taxes would have pushed the price to more than $100,000. The community safety minister said Ford merely requested “a used van” to be retrofitted so “he could continue to do his work while he is travelling from community to community.” Jones said it is “a perfectly reasonable use of resources.” Government house leader Todd Smith said Ford “is not a premier who likes to travel by plane across the province.” “His office asked for the option of a used van so he can travel the province in comfort. At the end of the day, nothing has happened on this file yet,” Smith said. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath accused Ford of “jumping on his own gravy train while parents of autistic children beg for financial help with high treatment costs. “The premier has access to a number of OPP vehicles, SUVs, that are quite comfortable,” she said. “These are public dollars and no premier needs to have that kind of a pimped-out ride. Why he thinks the public should be paying for it, that’s something he’s going to have to answer to.” Robert Benzie is the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

In question period at the B.C. Legislature on Tuesday, Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson claimed the NDP's Rick Glumac said Belcarra's relationship with the government would become more ""difficult"" if the community continued to protest the tax.

Glumac denied he put any pressure on the community, saying he and Belenkie had a ""cordial conversation"" and that he arranged a meeting between Belenkie and Finance Minister Carole James.

The speculation tax was introduced by the province to cool B.C.'s hot housing market. It targets vacant secondary homes in certain regions to discourage land speculation and drive up the number of rentals.

But in Belcarra, which is part of Metro Vancouver, residents say the levy unfairly targets legacy households and cottages.

The sleepy village, with a population of about 600, is burrowed between regional parks and the ocean, marked by dead-end streets and few traffic lights.

Many community members say that because half of the municipality is water-access only, it's next to impossible to rent out their properties. Many of them are seniors, and say they'd be expected to pay thousands more under the new tax.

On Tuesday they took their case to the legislature, along with Belenkie.

""These are not the target of the speculation tax, these cottages, none of them are … In fact, they've been referred to me by the NDP team as 'collateral damage,'"" said Belenkie.

$6K tax bill for basic cabin

Retired music teacher Charline Robson said she lives in a basement suite in Burnaby but faces a $6,000 speculation tax bill this year because the cabin she inherited is empty much of the year and not up for rent.

Robson, who said she already pays annual property taxes for the cabin of about $12,000, says the property is not insulated and does not have running water, sewer or street service.

""You can't rent this,"" she said. ""You have to go through private property to get there. There's no parking. There's no proper water and certainly not any sewers.""

She said the land value is assessed at about $1.3 million, but the cabin is valued at $15,000.

""This was passed on to me by my auntie about three years ago,"" said Robson. ""She bought it in the early 1950s. During the last couple years, she said to me, 'I'm not sure I can hold onto it. I don't have the money.' ""

Robson, who has children and grandchildren, said the family uses the cabin as a summer vacation getaway.

""We can't afford to go away,"" she said.

Other areas exempt

In March 2018 the B.C. government made a number of changes to the speculation tax.

The tax no longer apply to properties in the Gulf Islands, Parksville, Qualicum Beach or rural Fraser Valley.

But because Belcarra is a part of Metro Vancouver, residents are still required to pay.

509,Empty,2019-03-05T20:34:11Z,Belcarra mayor Neil Belenkie says he hopes the NPD will 'do the right thing' and grant an exemption.,"Calling the speculation tax “a punishment” for residents, Belcarra’s mayor is pleading with the B.C. government for an exemption.

Neil Belenkie joined B.C. Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson in holding a news conference Tuesday to drum up support for the NDP to “do the right thing” and grant Belcarra the exemption it has requested.

Belenkie wants his municipality of 700 people exempted from the tax, like Lions Bay and Bowen Island, but he says the government refuses to listen to the concerns of his constituents.

“It’s a rural cabin land,” said Belenkie at a news conference in Victoria. “We don’t have a rental problem or a real estate flipping problem.”

The tax will unfairly apply to the many summer cabins in Belcarra that have been family retreats for generations and can’t be rented out for many reasons, including no potable water or land access, said Belenkie.

“My constituents aren’t rich, and these cabins have no rental value. But they refused to listen and threatened to punish my community if I continued to raise concerns.”

He said he met with Finance Minister Carole James on March 1 and he was informed that the cottage owners in Belcarra will have to pay the speculation tax.

When asked Tuesday if James had in fact told Belenkie that Belcarra would be denied an exemption, the ministry of finance declined to answer.

A ministry spokesperson instead responded with a statement that James was “ensuring an open dialogue with B.C. Mayors by meeting with them annually to review housing affordability in their regions.”

Wilkinson is accusing the NDP of intimidating the mayors who are seeking an exemption to the “misguided” speculation tax.

“Mayors have the right to speak out on behalf of their citizens without fear of reprisals from the NDP government. British Columbians who are currently exempt should be very worried — one wrong word and they could get hit with an enormous tax bill in 2020,” he said in a statement.

About 15 per cent of Belcarra’s 300 homes, or 45 houses, are affected by the tax. Most are cottages or cabins used seasonally or on weekends.

The CBAs require workers on designated projects to join one of 19 NDP-favoured unions within 30 days. They also include pay, benefits and other conditions that can add as much as seven per cent to the cost of construction, by the government’s own admission.

Three recent announcements from the ministry of transportation and infrastructure should give a sense of the size and scope of the NDP’s intentions on the file.

Feb. 11: The transportation ministry issues a tender call for four-laning a two-kilometre stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway 1 east of Revelstoke.

It is budgeted at $63 million, with the province on the hook for three-quarters and Ottawa picking up the balance.

“This is the first of several upgrade projects on the Trans-Canada Highway between Kamloops and Alberta to be built using a community benefits agreement,” says the news release.

“Community benefits will include job and training opportunities for people in the local area and will increase the participation of apprentices and workers traditionally under-represented in the construction trades, such as Indigenous peoples, women and people with disabilities,” it continues, not mentioning either the union-favouring provisions or the added cost.

LISTEN: This week on the In The House podcast, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the 2019 provincial budget. Did the B.C. NDP present a prudent plan or did government miss a key opportunity to fulfill its agenda?

The project is part of a $464-million commitment by the NDP to four-laning the Trans-Canada through that part of the province over the next three years.

The next specific installment is probably a five-lane replacement for the almost 60-year-old R.W. Bruhn bridge at Sicamous.

The project was in the three-year capital plan in the provincial budget last week, priced at $225 million, with the province scheduled to pay 60 per cent and Ottawa the rest.

The ministry confirms it, too, will entail a community benefit agreement.

Feb. 14: The province announces the three pre-qualified bidding teams for the competition to design and construct a toll-free replacement for the 80-year-old Pattullo Bridge.

The project’s budget of $1.377 billion will be funded entirely by the provincial government, after the New Democrats agreed to take over the Pattullo from TransLink, the regional transportation authority.

“Construction of the new Pattullo bridge will be facilitated by the province’s community benefits agreement,” says the news release, echoing an announcement last July.

One head-turner among the three bidding teams is SNC-Lavalin, the Quebec-based firm embroiled in controversy over efforts to obtain a deferred prosecution on allegations of corruption. If convicted, the company would face a 10-year ban on bidding on contracts in Canada.

SNC-Lavalin will be competing against Kiewit Canada, which built the new Port Mann bridge, and a consortium led by Flatiron Constructors Canada, which is also a partner in building the generating station and spillways at Site C.

Feb. 15: The province issues a request for qualified contractors to design, build and finance the Broadway Subway project, a 5.7-km-long extension of SkyTrain from VCC-Clark to Arbutus St.

The call is on a tight timeframe, closing in April. “The ministry will then select up to three respondent teams to participate in the subsequent phase of the competitive selection process.”

Given that SNC-Lavalin built the earlier phases of SkyTrain, it would hardly be surprising to see it make that list as well, controversy notwithstanding.

The twin-tunneled subway and six stations are together budgeted at $2.83 billion, with B.C. putting up $1.83 billion, Ottawa $900 million, and Vancouver $100 million.

And once again, “the project will be delivered under a community benefits agreement announced by the provincial government.”

So that’s $464 million for widening the Trans-Canada, $1.377 billion for the Pattullo, and $2.830 billion for the SkyTrain expansion — $4.640 billion in total for projects with community benefit agreements.

In announcing the deal to build the Pattullo last summer, the New Democrats acknowledged that the benefit agreements could add as much as seven per cent to the cost of a given project.

On that estimation, news stories had the NDP’s union preference counting for almost $100 million in the budget for replacing the Pattullo.

But the New Democrats have since tried to fudge the numbers, saying the “up to seven per cent” calculation applies only to the cost of construction and not other matters in the budget for a given project.

“Estimated CBA costs are factored only into construction costs and can vary depending on the type of project,” according to a statement this week from the transportation ministry.

“With some projects a significant proportion of the total costs are non-construction costs, related to property acquisition, project management (including engineering, legal, environmental), and interest during construction.”

For instance, although the Broadway subway will be underground, there are major land acquisition costs for the entry points for the six stations.

Nor are the New Democrats prepared to specify what part of a given project budget is represented by construction costs.

“We can’t say right now” was the reply from a government representative this week. “That’s part of what the procurement process is all about.”

Forget about ever getting a precise dollar figure for how much the NDP’s union preference is adding to the cost of taxpayer-financed construction in the province.

But on the strength of what the New Democrats have admitted so far, the tab must run to the tens of millions of dollars.

What is this government doing, taxing these seniors on these cabins, which cannot be rented under any circumstances?”","VICTORIA — Meet the speculators, four unsuspecting British Columbians targeted by the half-baked mess that is the NDP’s speculation and vacancy tax.

Walter Belcher, 93, is a retired civil engineer who owns a modest family cabin, designed and built by himself on land he purchased near Belcarra almost 50 years ago.

He doesn’t use it much any more but his children, grand children and great grand children do.

Though the place is neither vacant, nor rentable, nor being held for speculative purposes, he’s facing a speculation tax bill of $4,000.

Charline Robson is a retired music teacher and the niece of Barbara Howard, the first black female athlete to compete for Canada on the world stage and an inductee into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame.

When the aunt died two years ago, she left her niece a cabin in Belcarra as a family legacy. Though the place is small, bereft of services and with no easy access to the outside world, the land is premium priced. Robson is facing a spec tax bill on the order of $6,000.

Nancy Strain, 71, is a retired legal secretary and owner of a cabin in Belcarra that was built by her father almost 60 years ago. It is small, not insulated and in no plausible condition for rental. Nevertheless her place is being speculation taxed to the tune of $6,000, a tab senior citizen Strain cannot afford on a $22,000 a year pension.

Sy Rodgers, 67, is a retired salesman. He and his wife own a lot in Belcarra that is deemed water-access only and without potable water and or sewer connection.

They face a $2,700 bill under the speculation tax and he reports that about two dozen of his neighbours, in similar situations, are being taxed as well.

The four of them, Rodgers, Strain, Robson and Melcher, were presented to the legislature during question period Tuesday as case studies in the arbitrary, grossly unfair application of the spec tax.

Opposition leader Andrew Wilkinson set the tone by quoting something Finance Minister Carole James said last year: “People in smaller communities, those with cottages, will not pay this tax.”

But there, sitting in the public gallery and looking down on the government benches, were exhibits A, B, C and D in the NDP’s failure to exempt cottages in smaller communities such as Belcarra.

“These are not speculators, these are seniors,” said Wilkinson who was having a good day after several bad ones over his ill-advised comments on the wacky fun of rental living.

“These are people on fixed incomes. These are people who are looking for answers from this minister. What is this government doing, taxing these seniors on these cabins, which cannot be rented under any circumstances?”

In reply, James took refuge in her inability, as finance minister, to address the specific tax cases.

Generalizing, she noted that the government had established a $400,000 exemption for people with cabins and summer places.

But with the second part of her answer, she put her finger on the reason why that threshold doesn’t offer much relief for the folks from Belcarra: “The property values in Belcarra jumped in 2016 to 2017, just in one year alone, by a 47 per cent increase.”

Case in point, the Robson property. The cabin is worth $15,000, if that. The land is assessed at more than $1 million.

The NDP’s fallback position on the speculation tax is that owners of secondary properties can avoid paying by renting out their places for part of the year.

But that option is impractical, according to Belcarra Mayor Neil Belenkie, who accompanied his constituents to the capital.

Their properties have little or no services and some can only be reached by water. In which case, as the mayor noted, renters would need a boat plus moorage whenever they travel to the community where they work.

The Liberals also aired another common complaint about the tax, namely the difficulty of getting straight answers from the much-advertised government help line.

“We’re hearing regular stories of people spending two hours on the speculation tax help line and getting no answers because the staff simply don’t know the rules,” complained Wilkinson. “So they leave people in a void.”

James defended her “hard working staff who are on the lines taking in the calls … they have been doing an incredible job.”

But on that score she should check with Green party leader Andrew Weaver.

The NDP’s partner in power sharing has been a persistent critic of the speculation tax and he isn’t letting up. Nor are his Oak Bay constituents, judging from the latest posting on his blog.

“Many have expressed frustration about the tax, particularly the difficulty in making contact with government to speak to a live person about the specifics of the tax and its potential exemptions,” he wrote.

“We have received countless reports that the phone number provided to the public leaves people on hold for hours. In fact, my own staff attempted to phone this number to get clarification about the tax and gave up after being on hold for 90 minutes. This is unacceptable.”

To him yes, but not to the New Democrats. For them, the speculation tax is a cash cow they are counting on to raise $450 million over three years.

Judging from Tuesday’s performance, they don’t much care who gets branded a speculator, so long as they pay up.

513,Empty,2019-03-07T19:54:27Z,B.C. politicians have set detailed terms for a retired chief justice selected to investigate allegations of misspending at the legislature.,"VICTORIA – B.C. politicians have set detailed terms for a retired chief justice selected to investigate allegations of misspending at the legislature.

The all-party legislature management committee released Thursday five specific allegations it has asked Beverley McLachlin to probe into suspended clerk Craig James and sergeant-at-arms Craig James.

The entire legislature also voted unanimously Thursday to approve the management committee’s recommendation to hire McLachlin in a vote of the entire house.

Premier John Horgan said McLachlin is the best choice for the job and it gives him confidence in the investigation that she has accepted the role.

“I think this is great that she’s got the time to put into this,” he said Thursday.

“This gives me confidence that the special prosecutors and any criminal investigation that’s underway will not be compromised by the work of the Speaker’s office.

“I mean that I’m more comfortable knowing that Beverley McLachlin is overseeing this than if it was just the members fo the legislature, LAMC members to do it. It think this is great news for British Columbians, it gives me confidence, and it should give them confidence that we have someone of very high calibre that understands the law and will not run afoul of the criminal investigation underway and that’s good news for those under a cloud as well.”

NDP house leader Mike Farnworth said McLachlin will conduct a “confidential, impartial and independent investigation into allegations concerning the clerk Craig James and the sergeant-at-arms Gary Lenz that were raised by the Speaker.”

That includes “a confidential fact-finding to determine whether, either or both Mr. James and Mr. Lenz… engaged in misconduct in the course of their employment.”

McLaughlin is asked to investigate whether any of the following allegations are true and if so whether they constitute misconduct by James and Lenz:

• Whether they improperly (and knowingly) received improper payouts of vacation pay by reason of their failure to record vacation leave.

• Whether they improperly made purchases of a personal nature and expensed them to the legislature.

• Whether they improperly claimed and received retirement allowances.

• Whether they improperly removed legislature assets and property.

• Whether they improperly used legislature property beyond an incidental or reasonable work-related purpose.

The specific allegations build upon a motion passed by the legislature management committee Wednesday to hire McLachlin and have her present a final report to the legislature by May 3.

“We sat down with our employment lawyer, we looked at the things in the report that most concerned all of us on the committee,” Farnworth said. “She’s going to be looking at all those issues in the report.”

LISTEN: In this week’s podcast, Province columnist Mike Smyth and Vancouver Sun columnist Vaughn Palmer discuss the SNC-Lavalin scandal rocking the Justin Trudeau government in Ottawa. Closer to home, Smyth and Palmer talk about Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson’s “wacky renters” gaffe and the continuing fight over the B.C. speculation tax.

McLachlin, the retired chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, is expected to review the reports made by Speaker Darryl Plecas, the replies by James and Lenz, as well as Plecas’s subsequent reply to their reply.

Plecas has alleged misspending by James and Lenz, including on personal items like suits, headphones, alcohol, retirement benefits, vacation pay and lavish international trips he said were de-facto vacations.

James and Lenz have denied any wrongdoing and said their expenses were approved by Plecas. Neither men has been charged with any crime. They were suspended with pay by MLAs in November, after it was revealed two special prosecutors were overseeing an RCMP investigation into their conduct.

The terms of reference for McLachlin call for a fair, impartial and independent investigation, with the power to obtain any legislature documents and interview anyone she deems appropriate.

McLachlin’s investigation is only one of many underway at the legislature.

Auditor General Carol Bellringer has begun a forensic audit of the building’s finances.

MLAs also approved a plan to hire an independent consultant to conduct a workplace review of the legislature’s human resources concerns. Plecas has alleged staff were inappropriately fired under the clerk and sergeant-at-arms. A detailed work plan on how to conduct the review is set to come before MLAs by May 1, with consultation from the Ombudsperson, government public service agency and Ministry of Health on best practices within organizations.

Also released this week were suggested reforms for the building by the governing NDP caucus and house leader Farnworth.

The NDP recommended making it clear that MLAs, not the Speaker, are the employer and supervisor of permanent officers and staff at the legislature.

In a letter, the NDP proposes amendments “which will place the responsibility for appointment, supervision and management of permanent officers of the legislature with the committee unless specifically delegated to the Speaker or another officer.”

The NDP recommendations also call for more regular bi-monthly meetings of the all-party legislative committee, to “ensure that all expenses incurred by permanent officers and seniors staff of the legislative assembly and the Speaker be disclosed online within 30 days” and to seek legal advice to recover any improper expense claims.

If enacted, the suggestions would also ban foreign travel by anyone without pre-approval by the committee, set out clearly that “personal gifts are not considered as legitimate expenses,” ban out-of-province travel expenses for spouses, partners or friends and ensure any trips extended by anyone for personal reasons do not incur extra costs to taxpayers.

The NDP propose aligning legislature staff with government rules on annual vacation usage, retirement benefits and severances. Any changes to salaries of legislature executives would need to be approved by MLAs.

And Farnworth suggested two legal changes to the Constitution Act, “to ensure that the appointment of future clerks and sergeant-at-arms require either the unanimous consent of members or be subject to an open competition” and “to ensure that future permanent officers and senior staff be appointed to terms ending at the age of 75.”

Clerk James was not unanimously appointed in 2011, because New Democrat MLAs opposed the unilateral selected and called for an open job competition.

514,Empty,2019-03-05T16:33:03Z,A high-ranking provincial police officer who was fired Monday alleges it is reprisal for waging a legal battle over the appointment of a friend of the premier's as commissioner.,"A former high-ranking provincial police officer alleges his firing this week was in reprisal for waging a legal battle over the controversial hiring of a long-time friend of Premier Doug Ford as commissioner of the force.

Brad Blair has asked the courts to force the provincial ombudsman to investigate the appointment of Toronto police Supt. Ron Taverner to the Ontario Provincial Police top job.

The government has denied any political interference in Blair's firing as deputy commissioner, and said the decision to fire him Monday came from the public service because Blair released confidential OPP information through his court filings.

Blair was fired by Mario Di Tommaso, deputy minister of community safety, and Blair alleges that was a conflict of interest because Di Tommaso was part of the hiring panel that selected Taverner and is therefore part of the case before the court.

BREAKING: Fired OPP deputy commissioner Brad Blair files new documents in court case, including his termination letter. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/onpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#onpoli</a> <a href=""https://t.co/O38WM9J0Um"">pic.twitter.com/O38WM9J0Um</a> —@CBCQueensPark

""It is patently clear to me that this is reprisal and an attempt to muzzle me, and that this reprisal is directly connected to my good faith efforts to seek redress before the divisional court and the provincial ombudsman,"" Blair writes in an affidavit filed Tuesday in court.

If there were concerns about the material Blair was filing in court being in the public realm, the attorney general could have asked the court to seal the documents, Blair writes.

'The citizens of Ontario need to have faith'

In a statement Tuesday, Blair said raising concerns about real or perceived political interference was the right thing to do, even though it ended his nearly 33-year OPP career.

""The cost of a compromised OPP is too great a price to pay,"" he said. ""The OPP can be called in to investigate provincial politicians, and the citizens of Ontario need to have faith that the OPP is truly independent, above political interference, and free from abuses of power.""

Di Tommaso's hand-delivered termination letter to Blair says that he recently filed internal OPP emails in court, after Blair had been warned not to do so in a Dec. 28 letter.

""Your failure to comply with my clear directions in furtherance of legal proceedings brought in your personal capacity has ruptured the trust on which the employment relationship is built,"" the termination letter says.

The Dec. 28 letter said that it shouldn't be construed as disciplinary action, but Di Tommaso wrote that he expected Blair to comply with proper procedures in the future.

NDP calls for public inquiry

Community Safety Minister Sylvia Jones denied that Di Tommaso — who is also Taverner's former boss — was in a conflict of interest.

""The deputy minister of public safety is going to have a very critical and important role in … what is happening in our police services,"" she said. ""I think that we have to keep in mind that the recommendation was from one individual, but it was a nine-member committee (of the Public Service Commission) that ultimately made the decision.""

Blair also says in his latest court filings that one of the members of the Public Service Commission who approved his firing also participated in Taverner's hiring process.

Ford has previously described the job of OPP commissioner as a ""political appointment,"" telling a television anchor the premier could even appoint him commissioner.

The NDP is calling for a public inquiry into the whole situation.

""We need to have this thing blown wide open so that people can get a real sense of who's pulling the strings and manipulating the process,"" said NDP Leader Andrea Horwath.

Taverner didn't initially meet requirements

Taverner, 72, initially did not meet the requirements listed for the commissioner position.

The Ford government has admitted it lowered the requirements for the position to attract a wider range of candidates.

Taverner's appointment has been delayed until the integrity commissioner completes an investigation into his hiring.

A Dec. 14 letter from the premier to the integrity commissioner was included in Blair's new court filings, and in it Ford said the rank requirements were removed following discussions between the recruitment firm, the secretary of cabinet and Di Tommaso. Ford said he is not aware of any consultation with his office on the change.

""I reject any assertion that this change was made to specifically permit Mr. Taverner's application for the position,"" Ford wrote. ""I would agree that some of the allegations that have arisen could have been avoided had the ranking requirements been removed from the job ad before its original posting.""

Ford told the integrity commissioner that his office was part of the initial recruitment planning process and retained an external executive search firm to assist.

""I believe this fact alone refutes any allegation that there was an orchestrated plan to appoint Mr. Taverner,"" he wrote.

Blair was also in the running for the commissioner's job, and was acting OPP commissioner at the time he started his legal case, but soon after was removed from that position.

Blair initially requested an ombudsman investigation into Taverner's appointment in December, amid what he called ""growing concerns of political interference"" in the hiring process.

He said it had deeply affected the morale of rank-and-file officers.

Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson is forced to apologize after saying renting in B.C. is a wacky, fun, rite of passage.","VICTORIA — Andrew Wilkinson has spent his first year as B.C. Liberal leader trying to overhaul a tired party that’s drowning under the weight of scandals that piled up over 16 years in power.

But all it takes is one misstep to wash out months of progress. Or, in the case of Wilkinson, 22 seconds during a recent budget speech in the legislature to seriously undermine the work he’s done presenting a fresh face for the party.

“This is a government that seems to think that if you’re employing more than a dozen people, you’re some kind of fat-cat capitalist who should be penalized for it to benefit the workers,” Wilkinson began Wednesday in his response to the government budget.

“Nothing could be further from the truth because what happens is that those employees, their numbers are capped or they’re laid off because the jobs are going elsewhere.”

So far, so good. But then, without warning, Wilkinson veered off script.

“We’ve seen the same attitude with this government’s approach to rentals — ‘Let’s protect the renters,’” Wilkinson continued.

“I was a renter for 15 years. I lived in a dozen different rentals. It was challenging at times, but it was fun. It was part of growing up and getting better. We’ve all done it. It’s kind of a wacky time of life, but it can be really enjoyable. Being a renter is a fact of life that’s a rite of passage.”

A wacky and fun rite of passage? For Wilkinson, perhaps, who is trained as a doctor and a lawyer, and whose lofty income ensures his rental days were but a nostalgic flirtation with the working class.

But dangerous ground for an MLA who represents one of the wealthiest ridings in the province, Vancouver-Quilchena, and who has been trying to combat the public perception that he’s an elitist. Dangerous for a party that has sought to woo back middle-class voters whose affordability concerns the Liberals utterly failed to address in the dying days of the Christy Clark government.

There's nothing we can say that would do justice to just how out of touch the BC Liberals are.



So here he is in his own words: life as a renter according to Andrew Wilkinson. #wackytime #bcpoli pic.twitter.com/XPPmyoeEx8 — New Democrat Caucus (@BCNDPCaucus) March 5, 2019

It’d be hard for most British Columbians to identify the “fun” in being a renter these days. The vacancy rate is abysmal in the urban centres of Greater Victoria and Greater Vancouver. The median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Vancouver is $2,080, rising to $3,280 for a family that needs a two-bedroom, according to rental tracking website PodMapper.

There are more than 1.5 million renters in B.C. — nearly one in three British Columbians rent. Almost 20 per cent of them spend more than 50 per cent of their income on rent, well above affordability guidelines and pushing them into the realm of the working poor. Roughly 10 per cent of renters are seniors.

Wilkinson tried in his speech to advance the argument that NDP restrictions on landlords are in fact the problem.

“They’ve put all kinds of restricted caps on the behaviour of landlords around changing rents, long-term leases and renovation of apartments. The net effect is that people are getting out of the landlord market. Why would you go and take that on?

“So what do we get? Shrinkage of the rental market. Congratulations to the NDP — static rental situations where you can’t find a place to move to, because most renters move up the scales, slowly but surely.”

There is, perhaps, some truth to the argument that NDP tax policies, and complications around the speculation tax, may discourage landlords, curtail supply and hike rents.

But it’s a point to be argued very carefully. Especially for a party that as government failed to close fixed-term tenancy loopholes, tackle renoviction abuses and curtail the higher-than-inflationary rent hike formulas that contributed to the affordability concerns the Liberals now claim to sympathize with.

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s victory in the Burnaby-South byelection, the NDP government’s response to threatened school closures in Vancouver, the latest in the legislature spending scandal and the province’s response to a measles outbreak.

Wilkinson tried to add “context” in a Postmedia interview on Thursday, but he didn’t disavow his previous comments.

“The idea I’m somehow dismissive of renters is ridiculous,” said Wilkinson. “I was a renter myself for almost two decades and realize it can be challenging at times and it can be hard but it can also be rewarding as you find a better place to rent as time goes by. And that means you have to have an ample supply of rental housing. And the NDP are shrinking their supply.”

I was a renter for 15 years. I had a low paying job and student loans. I know what it feels like to worry about making ends meet each month. I know what it feels like to dream of a better situation, more choice and freedom in life. 1/4 #bcpoli — Andrew Wilkinson (@Wilkinson4BC) February 28, 2019

Wilkinson’s gaffe was a gift to his political enemies.

“It shows how completely out of touch they are with what people are going through,” said Green Leader Andrew Weaver. “To make those comments is just outrageous. There’s no excuse for it. There is no way I could justify making those, unless this sense of entitlement, this kind of elitist atmosphere, was ingrained into who he is.”

Premier John Horgan piled on. “How out of touch can one be to think renting a home is a rite of passage or a phase one goes through?” he asked. Housing Minister Selina Robinson said Wilkinson “showed his true colours.”

Renters are key to some ridings the Liberals lost in 2017, such as North Vancouver-Lonsdale.

Worse, Wilkinson’s misstep undermines his party’s legitimate questions about whether the NDP government is waging a kind of class warfare with tax policies that focus on businesses, high-income earners, owners of homes worth more than $3 million and people who own more than one property.

His budget speech was filled with other points about the cost of the employer health tax, accusations the hike to the carbon tax is a “cash grab,” claims the NDP housing policies “have accomplished absolutely nothing in terms of affordability of housing in the middle and lower ranks, for people who are having regular working lives,” and the story of a widow with an income of $22,000 being declared a speculator under the government’s new speculation tax.

But nobody will remember those arguments.

Instead, the NDP and Greens will ensure the public is bombarded by clips of Wilkinson’s renter speech as proof that, for all their talk, the Liberals still don’t get it.

After being roasted for almost two days, Wilkinson apologized Friday morning during an appearance on radio station CKNW.

“Understandably, some renters perhaps were miffed with my remarks, and I apologize for that,” he said. “So yeah, would I phrase it differently this time? Sure. Why not? Let’s say, to correct the record, renting can be very difficult and very stressful and some people are forced to do it their entire lives, even if they don’t want to.”

Host Jon McComb savaged Wilkinson in the interview, meaning the mea culpa extended over many cringe-inducing minutes for Liberal supporters.

From gaffe to defence to apology all within 48 hours. A rite of passage — not for renters, but for a party leader suffering a self-inflicted wound in B.C.’s political arena.

At his second appearance before the committee on Wednesday, Wernick brought samples of the Facebook messages to the committee, which is investigating allegations of improper pressure on former attorney general Jody Wilson Raybould from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and members of his staff.

Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick told the House of Commons justice committee Wednesday that he had received abusive messages via social media following his first appearance before the committee two weeks earlier. ( Justin Tang / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

“You are a … liar,” read one. “You’ll amount to an absolute nobody in Canadian history … Can’t wait for my children and grandchildren to read about you,” read another. “Get a real job you … deadbeat!” someone wrote to the country’s top bureaucrat, whose salary range is between $277,600 and $326,500 according to government records.

“I was really stunned by his accusation that getting poked a couple times on Twitter was a breach of the privilege of the committee and involved the intimidation of a witness,” Angus said. “It really raises serious questions about his judgment.” As clerk of the Privy Council, Wernick is supposed to be above the political fray. While he serves the government of the day, he is also the non-partisan head of the public service. But after two combative appearances before the committee, the opposition parties have called for his resignation, accusing him of partisan behaviour while questioning his actions in the SNC-Lavalin affair.

518,Empty,2019-03-06T18:47:51Z,"Julian Falconer said it’s “bizarre” Brad Blair was dismissed without any official warnings or proceedings under the Police Services Act: ""This stinks to high heaven.”","Taverner’s surprise decision to bow out Wednesday night comes amid a growing furor over accusations of political interference and fears that the hiring jeopardized the independence of the country’s second largest police force.

Premier Doug Ford’s controversial push to install his friend, Toronto police Supt. Ron Taverner, as Ontario Provincial Police commissioner has been scrapped.

“It is very unfortunate that the opposition has chosen to politicize this process rather than focusing on how we can support our front-line officers,” Ford said in a statement.

Community Safety Minister Sylvia Jones — who, along with Ford, repeatedly defended Taverner as the best person for the job and denied any hand in his Nov. 29 appointment — confirmed the 72-year-old dropped his name from consideration.

“Both Ron Taverner and Premier Ford shared the same concerns that the appointment was being overly politicized and it’s in the best interests of front-line officers for Taverner to withdraw,” a senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations, told the Star.

The premier, who remained unrepentant about the Taverner hiring , added he is “concerned about the countless negative stories I have heard directly from front-line officers.”

“I believe the OPP requires new leadership and a change in culture at its most senior levels,” the Toronto superintendent said.

Taverner, who did not return messages from the Star, said in a statement released by the premier’s office “this decision is not an easy one for me to make.”

In her brief statement, Jones said “we will have more to say about the role of the commissioner in the near future.”

The imbroglio has taken its toll on Ford’s Progressive Conservatives, with the premier ducking the legislature all week and avoiding questions from the opposition and calls for a public inquiry.

Indeed, the retreat is a personal setback for the premier, who had championed his friend as “a cop’s cop,” and a victory for rivals, with Green party Leader Mike Schreiner saying the Taverner bid made Ontario look like a banana republic.

“The separation of political interference from the police is a fundamental tenet of our democracy,” said Schreiner. “It separates us from countries where corrupt leaders use the police to do their dirty work.”

NDP Deputy Leader Sara Singh praised Taverner for making the “right decision” but said she hopes Ford has learned his lesson on the dangers of hiring a friend to head the OPP, given that he did not acknowledge those concerns in his statement.

“The premier really needs to answer questions with respect to why he would even think that’s the right thing to be doing,” Singh added in an interview.

“This mess could have been avoided. It took so long because Mr. Ford thought he was going to be able to get away with this.”

In December, Ford insisted “there has never been a more popular police officer in this province than Ron Taverner.”

“We look forward to having Ron Taverner as the commissioner of the OPP. You look at his credentials, speaks for itself, 50 years of policing around the province,” the premier added at the time, saying it’s “too bad we couldn’t have a straight-up vote because Ron Taverner would win with 95 per cent of the front-line OPP officers that I’ve heard from crossing the province.”

That month, Taverner rescinded his resignation as superintendent of three Toronto police divisions in Etobicoke, and returned to his role as unit commander.

Taverner’s exit — on a day when media attention was fixated on the SNC-Lavalin scandal on Parliament Hill — follows the Ford government’s firing on Monday of deputy OPP commissioner Brad Blair, who was passed over for the top job and took legal action.

Blair’s lawsuit to force the Ontario ombudsman to investigate Taverner’s appointment exposed the premier’s efforts to get a customized van with a powered reclining leather sofa, 32-inch TV with Blu-ray DVD player and a minifridge — dubbed a “souped-up man cave on wheels” by the NDP.

Earlier Wednesday, Blair’s lawyer called the dismissal “outrageous” and said it’s “bizarre” he was ousted without any official warnings or proceedings under the Police Services Act despite protestations from Ford that he violated the law by releasing information about the hiring and the $50,000 van conversion.

“God help you if you cross the premier. That’s the message,” Julian Falconer added in a 42-minute conference call with reporters.

“While they throw around references to the Police Act, they’re not using it. This is exactly what abuse of power looks like.”

The collateral damage of the flawed decision to appoint Taverner is “an absolute shame,” said Singh.

Taverner is a veteran Toronto police superintendent who applied for the OPP job last fall when qualifications were lowered two days after the initial posting, allowing someone of his mid-level rank into the running.

Ford has always denied any political interference in the appointment, which has been under investigation by provincial integrity commissioner J. David Wake following a complaint from the NDP.

Wake interviewed the premier late last week and previously questioned his chief of staff, Dean French, for more than two hours as part of the probe.

Taverner has been in limbo since requesting in December that his appointment be put on hold until the ethics investigation is completed. Jones said interim OPP commissioner Gary Couture will remain at the helm for now. The last full-time commissioner, Vince Hawkes, retired in the fall.

Policing experts, including former RCMP commissioner Bob Paulson, had repeatedly warned concerns about potential conflicts of interest would always linger if Taverner were to head the force, which can be called in to investigate any wrongdoing by government — as occurred under a previous Liberal government.

In that case, the OPP’s anti-rackets squad laid charges over deleted documents in the wake of the scandal over gas plants cancelled before the 2011 election. Former premier Dalton McGuinty’s chief of staff, David Livingston, was criminally charged, convicted at trial and served five weeks in jail.

View f…","OTTAWA — Fewer Canadians are living under the official poverty line than at any time in the last decade, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday

The agency laid the credit for the drop on a combination of a buoyant economy and the Liberals signature child benefit.

The national statistics office says that in 2017, the most recent year available, 3.4 million Canadians, or 9.5 per cent of the population, lived below the poverty line the government officially adopted late last year — including 622,000 children — which is the lowest the agency reported going back to 2006.

The drops since the Liberals took office in 2015 were also noted in the agency’s release: 278,000 fewer children living below the poverty line in 2017 — the first full year of the benefit — compared to 2015 when the Liberals took office.

Statistics Canada said an increase in the value of child benefits, coupled with gains in market income, put more money into the pockets of families in 2017 — which Liberals touted Tuesday as a political and policy victory.

“It certainly shows a program that is simple for the government to manage, simple for families to receive, and fair for everyone … is a good thing when it comes to making more Canadians able to make ends meet,” Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said in an interview.

The Liberals introduced the income-tested Canada Child Benefit midway through 2016, replacing a previous system of tax credits and the Conservatives’ universal child care benefit. The agency calculates that between 2016 and 2017, a couple with children saw their median benefit rise by $1,200, while lone parents received an extra $1,300.

Duclos suggested numbers will drop further, particularly once the Canada Workers Benefit launches next month and expands a wage subsidy introduced under former prime minister Stephen Harper to boost the incomes of the country’s working poor.

Duclos was less clear about whether the Liberals would boost the base value of the child benefit or ensure immigration status doesn’t affect eligibility as some anti-poverty activists have requested.

The Liberals promised in the 2015 election that the child benefit would lift 300,000 children out of poverty compared to 2013 figures, but based on a different measure of poverty than was previously used.

Parsing out the numbers, the Liberals met their projections: a drop of 315,000 in children in poverty in 2017 compared to 2013.

Last year, the Liberals pegged the value of the benefit to inflation — two years before they planned to do so — and promised by 2020 to cut poverty rates by 20 per cent of 2015 figures.

What Statistics Canada reported Tuesday is that there were 826,000 fewer people living in poverty in 2017 compared to 2015 — or just shy of the 20 per cent target.

An expert panel the Liberals turned to for help crafting the poverty plan originally recommended a 25 per cent target for 2020. The Liberals chose 20 per cent, leading some experts to suggest the goal was likely a given based on the measures the government had introduced.

The next part of the plan proposes a drop to 50 per cent of 2015 levels by 2030, which will require thought about how to “make more of a dent in those who are living in and with extreme poverty,” Lindsay Tedds, scientific director of fiscal and economic policy at the University of Calgary’s school of public policy, said on Twitter.

A bill to set the poverty plan into law has yet to pass the House of Commons, but it doesn’t propose any additional spending than what is already promised.

“We picked the indicator, we picked where we want the indicator to be, but there’s no plan if we miss that target and there should be,” said David Macdonald, a senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

“That’s the point of a poverty reduction plan as opposed to having just a tracking plan, which is presently what it is.”

521,Empty,2019-03-06T20:14:57Z,Gerald Butts says he did not pressure the then-justice minister to allow SNC-Lavalin to avoid a corruption trial.,"A former key aide to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is at the centre of a major political crisis, on Wednesday denied he had pressured the then-justice minister to allow a major firm to avoid a corruption trial last year.

Gerald Butts, addressing an incident that has cost Trudeau two senior cabinet ministers so far, said he had one short conversation with the minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, about helping construction company SNC-Lavalin.

""I did not and I do not see how our brief discussion on that file constituted pressure of any kind,"" Butts told the House of Commons justice committee. ""I am firmly convinced that nothing happened here beyond the normal operations of government.""

Butts quit as Trudeau's principal private secretary on February 18. The incident could threaten the ruling Liberal Party's chances of retaining power in an October election.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee last week that Butts and other senior officials had subjected her to persistent and inappropriate pressure to help SNC-Lavalin evade a trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

190305004901305

""What happened last fall is in fact very different from the version of events you heard last week,"" Butts said.

Wilson-Raybould said 11 officials and ministers had contacted her and her office a total of 20 times over four months regarding the SNC-Lavalin affair.

""That is two meetings and two phone calls per month for the minister and her office on an issue that could cost a minimum of 9,000 Canadians their jobs,"" said Butts.

190228113038516

SNC-Lavalin, its international arm and another subsidiary are accused of having offered $36m in bribes to Libyan officials and of defrauding the Libyan government of $96m.

The charges relate to the world's largest irrigation scheme: the Great Man-Made River Project, which provides fresh water to the Libyan cities of Tripoli, Benghazi and Sirte.

SNC-Lavalin, which employs 9,000 people in Canada, is based in the province of Quebec, where Trudeau's Liberals need to pick up seats to win a federal election set for October.

A second member of Trudeau's cabinet resigned on Monday, saying she had lost confidence in how the government had dealt with the matter. Treasury Board President Jane Philpott was one of the most respected members of the government, and political observers described her departure as a major blow.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee last week that Butts had told her chief of staff there was no solution to the matter without some interference.

""That is not what I said,"" Butts responded when asked about the allegation.

Trudeau denies the accusations, saying he made clear to Wilson-Raybould that any decision on the case was hers alone.

'Nothing to do with cabinet shuffle'

Wilson-Raybould was demoted from her role as attorney general and named veterans affairs minister in January as part of a cabinet shuffle. She resigned weeks later.

Wilson-Raybould testified she believes she lost the justice job because she didn't give in to ""sustained"" and ""inappropriate pressure"" to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin. That solution would have avoided a potential criminal conviction that would bar the company from receiving any federal government business for a decade.

Butts said on Wednesday the SNC-Lavalin issue had nothing to do with the cabinet shuffle, which he said was prompted by the political retirement of Treasury Board minister Scott Brison. He said Trudeau wanted to move Jane Philpott from her indigenous-services post to one in the treasury and shift Wilson-Raybould, who is indigenous, to indigenous services, but Wilson-Raybould refused.

170526103137890

Wilson-Raybould said that being attorney general and justice minister was her ""dream job"", Butts testified, adding that Wilson-Raybould wanted to remain in that post.

""If you allow a minister to veto a cabinet shuffle by refusing to move, you soon will not be able to manage the cabinet,"" Butts said. ""My advice was that the prime minister should not set the precedent that a cabinet minister could refuse a new position and effectively remain in one position for the life of the government.""

Trudeau ultimately moved Wilson-Raybould to Veterans Affairs, and Butts said that days later, Wilson-Raybould accused Trudeau and Butts of punishing her for refusing to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

""Trust had broken down between our office and the minister,"" Butts said. ""I was deeply concerned by what the minister was saying. It was all a great and sad surprise to me that she could draw those sorts of conclusions about her colleagues, including myself.""

That estimate, in a new analysis, is 22 per cent higher than figures presented by the Department of National Defence and will likely mean renewed criticism of the Liberal government's plan.

Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux looked at the cost of buying 18 old F-18s, modifying them to Canadian standards, operating them until at least 2032 and disposing of them.

The warplanes, which are of the same vintage as the air force's existing CF-18s, are expected to arrive in batches between now and 2022. The first two aircraft arrived recently.

DND planners estimated the cost would be up to $895.5 million.

The budget office figures it will be higher, running between $1.09 billion and $1.15 billion.

Giroux says the biggest difference between the two estimates relates to upgrading the fighters to Canadian standards.

Even still, he is puzzled by the disagreement. In preparing its estimate, the budget office used figures from the Department of National Defence and publicly available information.

""Why have they underestimated the cost? I wonder myself."" Giroux told reporters after the report was presented.

""Given that they provided us with the basic information we used, I don't see why they would have missed the mark by 22 per cent.""

'The magical trigger of $1 billion'

The answer, he suggested, may involve optics, because programs that slide in just under the $1 billion mark tend to generate less public controversy.

""The estimate we provided crosses the magical trigger of $1 billion life-cycle cost. They may have had an incentive to lower the cost estimate,"" Giroux said.

In a statement, National Defence said its cost was ""extremely close to that of the PBO on the majority of line items,"" but they differed on figures for the upgrade, as well as the notion of whether extra funds — known as a contingency — should be set aside.

The department insisted the cost of improving the Australian jets is still up in the air. ""We are still producing options for these upgrades,"" said the statement.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan told the House of Commons defence committee that his department has provided the necessary information to the budget office and the public.

He said his department does ""thorough costing.""

Auditor general also challenged figures

Even still, the budget office is not the only one estimating that the program crack the billion-dollar mark.

Last fall, the auditor general also challenged DND's figures.

Michael Ferguson's last report estimated the purchase and operations cost would be roughly $1.02 billion.

Giroux, in his report Thursday, said the cost could go higher.

""The sensitivity analysis conducted within this report shows that prices could further change according to both project timelines and future flying-hour behaviour within the fleet,"" the report said.

The Liberals have long insisted the air force needs extra fighters because it cannot at the moment meet both its NATO and full-alert North American Aerospace Defence Command commitments at the same time.

The used F-18s are considered a stopgap until the federal government purchases 88 new fighters through a competition that has yet to get going.

The Conservative opposition have repeatedly said used fighter jets are a waste of time and money.

""We shouldn't be surprised here, the Liberals have a tradition of buying old used equipment for the Canadian Armed Forces, all for political gain,"" said Conservative critic James Bezan, referring to the 1990s-era purchase of used submarines from the British.

The latest report is not the first time the budget office has challenged National Defence over its fighter jet arithmetic.

Almost eight years ago, the budget office questioned whether the estimated cost of acquiring the F-35 fighter, under the former Conservative government, was low-balled by defence planners.

The report led to the eventual unravelling of the federal government's plan to buy the stealth warplane.",Used Australian fighter jets could cost taxpayers $1.1B: PBO,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/pbo-fighter-jets-1.5036942

MacAulay, who was secretary of state for veterans under prime minister Jean Chrétien, was effusive Friday, telling reporters he was delighted to return to an issue he was first involved with two decades ago. “It’s an honour to be a minister at the table in any portfolio but the chance to be at veterans affairs really for the second time is indeed a great honour,” MacAulay said outside Rideau Hall following the swearing-in ceremony. The veterans affairs department is close to home in another way too — MacAulay is MP for the riding of Cardigan in Prince Edward Island, and the headquarters for veterans affairs is in Charlottetown.

He pledged to do “everything I can” to make sure the personnel who “preserve democracy for us worldwide” are well looked after. That enthusiasm might help ease the discomfort of veterans groups worried that their priorities are getting lost in the political upheaval. MacAulay fills the vacancy caused by the sudden departure of Jody Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from the position in February just a month into the job. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan had taken on responsibilities for the file in the interim. Friday’s shuffle means there have been 10 ministers to hold the veterans affairs position since 2009 and five since the Liberals took office in 2015. Scott Maxwell, executive director of Wounded Warriors Canada, said the changes in ministers with just months to go before the fall election make it difficult to make progress on issues such as the transition to civilian life and improving benefits and payments for wounded veterans.

“It just doesn’t seem realistic for anybody to step into this role at this time and hope to accomplish very much,” Maxwell said. Brad White, national executive director of the Royal Canadian Legion, said that during MacAulay’s first ministerial stint with the department in the 1990s, he enacted some “transformational” change to address pension issues.

“I’m hoping he takes that attitude to this new portfolio,” White said in an interview. He said there are numerous issues that need attention, notably smoothing the transition for personnel between the Canadian Armed Forces and the veterans affairs department. “We have some very complex issues out there right now. We have injuries we have never seen before, both physical and psychological that we have to deal with … and they are younger people than they were before,” he said. “I’m just concerned that we don’t lose the focus… we need to look after our veterans,” he said. Conservative MP Phil McColeman, the critic for veterans issues, said he’s happy to see veterans affairs restored to a full-time minister. He said urgent action is needed to address issues highlighted by the parliamentary budget officer in its recent examination of the various benefits programs provided by the department since 2006. In a February report, the budget officer concluded that most, but not all, veterans receiving disability benefits will be financially better off under the new regime that takes effect April 1. But its analysis found that about 3 per cent of new claimants would be “greatly disadvantaged” under the new program, by about $300,000. “That’s is a glaring thing that I think he should address,” McColeman (Brant) told the Star Friday. McColeman also wants the new minister to address the health concerns of veterans who took the anti-malaria drug mefloquine, which carries the risk of psychological side effects. The federal government may face a lawsuit from veterans who say their health has suffered as a result of the drug. McColeman is hoping the Liberal government can resolve the issue without a courtroom showdown. “I would ask the new minister to look at every possible avenue to make sure that we don’t end up in the courtroom again with our veterans,” he said.

Speaking to 3,200 well-heeled supporters at an event from which the media were banned after the Star revealed the Tories enlisted lobbyists to sell tickets, Ford touted his government’s accomplishments.

“We promised we would make Ontario open for business and open for jobs. Promise made, promise kept,” he said, pointing to the 41,000 full-time jobs created in the province last month, extending an era of near-record low unemployment that dates back to former premier Kathleen Wynne’s Liberals in 2017. But the premier emphasized Wednesday night at the Toronto Congress Centre that difficult decisions loom as the Tories tackle a $13.5-billion budget deficit. “We continue to fight hard for Ontario workers and Ontario jobs, for the hard working people in private-sector unions. Everything the government of Ontario does is put at risk when you do what the Liberals did and let deficits spiral out of control,” he said in a speech that was live-streamed on the Progressive Conservative Party’s website.

Ford noted the event was sold out, suggesting the party could have taken in as much as $4 million before expenses. “This is the largest fundraiser in Canadian history,” the premier boasted. Because of the large crowd, the snowstorm and some protesters outside, attendees were slow entering the sprawling Etobicoke venue, which delayed Ford’s speech by about an hour. At Queen’s Park earlier in the day, he defended the closed-door dinner and emphasized he also does events that ordinary Ontarians can afford to attend. “I’m going up to Muskoka on Friday for a $25 spaghetti dinner to talk to the real people. I encourage everyone to come out Friday to listen to the great things that this government has done for the common folk,” Ford said in the legislature.

But Green Leader Mike Schreiner said those folksy fundraisers aren’t the problem. “We haven’t heard any reports that the premier is pressing corporate lobbyists to sell $25 tickets to his spaghetti dinners,” said Schreiner.

Last Thursday, the Star disclosed that the Tories asked lobbyists to help sell tickets because campaign finance reforms that banned corporate and union contributions have made it a challenge to fill tables. “It’s potentially doing an end run around the ban on corporate donations,” Schreiner said. While premiers’ major fundraisers have traditionally been open to the media, the party announced Tuesday that the event would be closed. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said that is becoming a theme for Ford’s administration. “It says that the government is elected for only special interests,” said Horwath. “We know that this government, particularly, does a lot of their business behind closed doors in secret where nobody knows what they’re doing and what they’re cooking up.” Government house leader Todd Smith said prohibiting reporters was “a decision made by the party.” But Tory sources, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal PC matters, insisted the edict came from Ford’s office.

Trudeau must be very calm right now, because Liberals are nervous in the wake of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s remarkable revelations about her dealings with Trudeau and top members of his government. “It’s probably cost us the election,” one usually upbeat MP said offhandedly when asked what damage had been done by the testimony. Another MP, doing his own soundings of colleagues since Wednesday, said about one-third of the caucus is “grumbling” about Wilson-Raybould, another one-third is keeping an open mind about both sides and the last third is hoping that this episode is a corrective slap in the face for business as it has been practised in this government for the past three years. “Heads should roll,” said an MP who would put himself in that last category. Which heads? “Maybe all of them.”

The immediate Liberal communications strategy seems to revolve around having heavy-hitter cabinet ministers, such as Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, talk to the media about how they continue to stand behind the PM. But there does not seem to be a plan to assure MPs or Liberals at large about their election prospects, apart from having Trudeau in business-as-usual mode. Trudeau himself has indeed radiated icy, almost surreal calm in media encounters after Wilson-Raybould’s testimony — even when technical glitches erupted in the midst of attempts to connect the PM with Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques, currently orbiting above the Earth in the International Space Station.

Article Continued Below

Yes, that really was on the prime minister’s agenda on a significant, day-after-disaster itinerary — a golden opportunity for would-be political comedians, who got to tell all kinds of jokes about who else should be hurtled into the stratosphere right now as Trudeau’s PMO is still reeling here on Earth with Wilson-Raybould’s detailed condemnations. (Insert your favourite Trudeau adviser here.) Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould may have a lot in common in times of stress. The former attorney-general sat stone-faced and calm in her front-row seat on the government benches in the Commons on Thursday as the opposition howled outrage on her behalf. It was an odd spectacle in a week filled with things we haven’t seen much around Parliament Hill.

Wilson-Raybould now has superhero powers in the eyes of the Conservatives and New Democrats, even as she continues to be a leading Liberal. She can leap tall government buildings and make herself invisible when she chooses, as she did on Thursday. Her most staunch defenders in the chamber were not the people surrounding her, but the Conservatives and New Democrats across the floor, voicing fury on her behalf at reports of how one of her own Liberal colleagues called her grievances “sour grapes.” The colleague in question is Jati Sidhu, from the B.C. riding of Mission-Matsqui-Fraser Canyon. In an interview with the Abbotsford News, Sidhu also said: “The way she’s acting, I think she couldn’t handle the stress…. I think there’s somebody else behind — maybe her father — pulling the strings.” Sidhu has since apologized, but it’s safe to say that the exasperation under his remarks is not isolated to just one MP or loyal Liberal soldier. Caucus management has never been a strong suit within Trudeau’s government; some backbenchers complain that members of the media have more regular access to the top folks in the PMO than they do.

Wilson-Raybould’s extraordinary intervention has emboldened some Liberals to declare their own dissatisfaction with PMO-MP relations — and make no mistake, Conservatives and New Democrats have picked up on those threads of dissent too, which means they’ll keep using disclosures this week to drive wedges in Liberal unity. But any clamping down on that dissent by the current PMO could backfire. What Canadians witnessed on Wednesday at a Commons committee could be seen as the direct result of keeping resentment and frustration simmering too long on the back burner.

The council’s full report is due in spring 2019.

Hoskins, who is also recommending investing in IT infrastructure and data on prescription drugs, said an interim report was always planned. “The past few weeks have been difficult,” said Petipas, adding the Liberals must “continue to govern as a party.” Morneau called pharmacare the “unfinished business of the Canadian health care system.” But he wouldn’t comment on how much there might be for a plan in the Liberals’ upcoming budget.

“We will take a look at this informed by the interim report,” he said. Drugs are the fastest-growing segment of health spending, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information.

SNC-Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce wrote to Public Services Minister Carla Qualtrough on Oct. 13, 2017 and sent copies to seven other senior cabinet ministers.

Bruce attached his company's official submission for the consultations, which were examining possible changes to the ""integrity regime"" and the potential creation of a plea-bargain-type tool known as a deferred-prosecution agreement or remediation agreement.

Bruce's Montreal-based firm was charged in 2015 with corruption and fraud over allegations it resorted to bribery while pursuing business in Libya. If convicted, it could be barred from public contracts for 10 years under the federal integrity regime.

Bruce's letter went to then public services minister Carla Qualtrough and seven other senior ministers. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)

The letter, obtained by The Canadian Press under access-to-information law, shows a high-level push for policy changes to help the engineering and construction giant avoid prosecution.

SNC-Lavalin lobbied federal officials, including in the Prime Minister's Office, to put remediation agreements into the law.

A few months after the public consultations in fall 2017, the Trudeau government included the Criminal Code amendment creating the agreements in last spring's 582-page omnibus budget bill.

In his letter, Bruce asked Qualtrough and her staff to a meeting so he could answer questions about the company's submission, explain its governance improvements and share its plans to expand from its Canadian base.

He argued that Canada needed a deferred-prosecution agreement option as well as ""enhancements"" to its integrity regime for government contractors to align with policies in countries like the United States, United Kingdom and France.

Those are related but separate issues. Deferred-prosecution agreements, or DPAs, are plea-bargain-type arrangements for companies that can show they have straightened up after behaving corruptly. The government's own integrity regime covers which suppliers Ottawa will do business with; it aims to keep public dollars away from bad actors.

""The time is right"" to address the DPA and the integrity regime, Bruce wrote to Qualtrough. ""But time is also of the essence.""

He warned that Canadian engineering and consulting firms didn't have a level playing field with their foreign competitors, operating in countries that had deferred-prosecution agreements in their laws.

From there, Bruce's letter underscored the urgency several times.

""SNC-Lavalin fully supports the need to take the time to conduct a credible, fair, open and transparent consultation process,"" he wrote. ""However, Canada is clearly behind in terms of using all possible tools to deal as effectively as possible with corporate economic crime ... Accordingly, we urge the government of Canada to move forward as expeditiously as possible.""

An internal briefing note to Qualtrough about Bruce's letter recommended she decline his invitation to meet and discuss SNC-Lavalin's submission. Since the public consultations were being led by federal officials, the memo suggested that Barbara Glover, Public Services and Procurement's assistant deputy minister for integrity, meet with Bruce instead.

Qualtrough agreed and signed a response letter to Bruce saying he should meet Glover. In that Oct. 31, 2017 letter, she thanked Bruce for his submissions and his participation in the consultation process.

Last week, Qualtrough was asked during an appearance before a parliamentary committee whether SNC-Lavalin had been among the stakeholders that provided input during the public consultations.

""I don't know the list of the 300 organizations offhand that participated in the consultation,"" she said in response to a Conservative MP's question. ""Sorry, I don't mean to be difficult, but I can't recall offhand.""

Later in the hearing, one of her officials confirmed the company was indeed among the participants.

The company and the remediation tool are now at the centre of a political storm that has walloped the Liberals. Even since remediation agreements were created last year, the director of public prosecutions decided not to invite SNC-Lavalin to negotiate one.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet amid allegations that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his staffers and other senior officials improperly pressured her to stop a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Trudeau had denied that he or his officials inappropriately leaned on Wilson-Raybould.

Trudeau named Qualtrough as acting president of the Treasury Board, adding oversight of government spending and human resources to her duties.

The federal government is still moving forward with changes to the integrity regime that could help beleaguered SNC-Lavalin.

Last week at committee, Qualtrough said the updated integrity regime, if adopted, will still carry a potential ban from federal contracts of up to a decade, depending on factors such as the severity of the transgression — but a draft of the new scheme released last fall shows there is no minimum ineligibility period.

Another important issue has been largely overlooked.

How could Justin Trudeau and his underlings so brazenly try to interfere for indisputably partisan reasons in what by law must be an independent prosecution while criticizing China for doing the same thing in the case of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou?

It’s a question a Chinese government spokesman jumped on Friday, although one that Canadians should ask and the Trudeau government should answer.

“Of course I think that this is a question that should be asked of the Canadian government,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, according to a Reuters report. “In fact, not only Chinese and Canadian citizens, but the whole world are extremely interested to hear how the Canadian government answers this question.”

Lu is raising an important point about Trudeau government hypocrisy. This isn’t to suggest that anyone extend their agreement to the view of China’s totalitarians that political interference in criminal prosecutions is acceptable. It isn’t, and that’s what makes the behaviour of the PM and his team so serious.

In extensive, detailed and believable testimony, Wilson-Raybould accused Trudeau and his operatives of a “sustained effort” over four months “to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion,” as well as “veiled threats” if the prime minister didn’t get what he wanted — a remediation agreement to end the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on fraud and corruption charges. Such a deal had been ruled out by prosecutors.

What makes the Liberals’ conduct even more hypocritical is that while officials were hammering Wilson-Raybould to politically interfere in the case, Canada’s Foreign Minister, Chrystia Freeland, was expressing concerns after learning that U.S. President Donald Trump had mused that he would intervene in the Meng prosecution if it would help the U.S. strike a trade deal with China.

Freeland cautioned, “our extradition partners should not seek to politicize the extradition process or use it for ends other than the pursuit of justice and following the rule-of-law.”

Reacting to the same comments by Trump, Trudeau said, “Regardless of what goes on in other countries, Canada is and will always remain a country of the rule-of-law.”

On Friday, in announcing Canada would proceed with the extradition of Meng, who has been on house arrest in Vancouver since December on U.S. fraud charges, the Justice Department declared in the first line of its media release that “Canada is a country governed by the rule-of-law.”

While it’s clear that the Trudeau government is good at stating the importance of that rule, if it wants to be taken seriously, especially on the world stage, it needs to back up those words with action. Given what we now know about the SNC-Lavalin case, it’s fair for Canadians to have doubts and be angry about Trudeau and his people for trying to inject politics into a prosecution — as they do in places like China.

With two Canadians — Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor — detained there on bogus, tit-for-tat charges related to the Meng case, the Liberals really need to walk their talk.

Some are already famous for their loopiness: budgets balance themselves, the government shouldn't call honour killings barbaric, we need to rethink the definitions of space and time, we should say ""peoplekind"" instead of ""mankind"" (he may actually have been making fun of himself with that one).

Most, though, are just syrupy, unmemorable banalities about values and optimism and respect and caring for one another.

Like this masterpiece of tautology the day he was sworn in as prime minister: ""The diversity that makes this country so strong is a diversity of views that will carry us forward.""

Trudeau's happy blather was digestible enough at first, particularly after nearly a decade of Stephen Harper. Like tapioca after heartburn. But as it kept coming, picked up and amplified by his cabinet ministers, it began grating on the nerves, the way retail Christmas-carol Muzak does by late November.

Eventually, it became clear that our prime minister didn't really have much else to say. He relies more heavily on talking points than any Canadian leader in my memory (40-plus years), his answers swollen with extraneous words and catchphrases crafted by his messaging experts.

Meaningless talking points

He and his ministers are capable of answering nearly any question with some vow of support for ""the middle class and those who are working so hard to join it,"" an annoyingly meaningless phrase that's become a banner for his government.

In any case, this verbal porridge, delivered with a serene smile, has carried him along. Until now.

With his government sinking into a self-inflicted crisis, it's beginning to appear that Justin Trudeau simply doesn't have the intellectual acuity to cope.

Look at his response to the testimony of Jody Wilson-Raybould last week. She had just finished delivering a measured, unambiguous indictment, accusing him and his staff of attempting to pervert justice for political gain.

Trudeau gave no substantive reply last week to Wilson-Raybould's remarkably serious accusations. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)

He could have answered his former justice minister fact for fact. Instead, Trudeau appeared a few hours later in Montreal, two rows of nervously smiling party volunteers arranged behind him, a newly elected MP standing haplessly to the side. His statements were as stilted and contrived as the optics.

""We will stand up and defend and create jobs, and we will always defend our institutions and rule of law.""

The government has ""consistently defended Canadian jobs while defending our institutions and the independence of our judiciary.""

Stephen Harper was mean, said Trudeau, herding his predecessor into questioning about Wilson-Raybould's charges, and he did favours for the wealthy, while Liberals ""invest in Canadians"" (a favourite line, whatever it means). His central job as prime minister is to stand up for jobs and defend our institutions.

And so on. Not a spontaneous syllable, not a second of candour or actual reflection. Certainly no substantive reply to Wilson-Raybould's remarkably serious accusations.

CBC EXPLAINS What you need to know about the SNC-Lavalin affair

Trudeau could have talked about the difficulty of having one member of cabinet coexisting as both a political minister and attorney general, a problem Wilson-Raybould herself addressed, but no. He could have given his own version of discussions with her. But no.

This is a man who either doesn't think the public deserves a straight answer, or just isn't capable of delivering one.

And there was the flicker of condescension he's shown before; it was important, he said, that Wilson-Raybould be able to speak, and he was glad he'd allowed her to.

Uh-huh. He was glad.

It was much the same performance this week, after Jane Philpott followed Wilson-Raybould out the cabinet door, declaring she could not square her constitutional obligations as a minister of the Crown with the evidence she'd seen of political interference.

Philpott resigned as Treasury Board president Monday. (Patrick Doyle/Reuters)

A few hours later, at a rally in Toronto to gin up support for a carbon tax, Trudeau made a manic entrance, grinning and high-fiving and flesh-pressing and trying to look happy, before grabbing Environment Minister Catherine McKenna in an awkward hug, and, puzzlingly, yelling, at a Liberal rally, ""Are there any Liberals in the house?""

Then, more empty message track.

""In a democracy like ours and in a space where we value our diversity so strongly, we're allowed to have disagreements and debate, we even encourage it. This matter has generated an important discussion.""

Oh, and also, he's taking it all seriously. So there's that.

Happily, the Commons justice committee actually is taking it seriously. Even as, at exactly the same time, Republican members of a congressional panel spent the afternoon childishly heckling former Donald Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's efforts to testify – one of them erected a giant placard reading ""Liar, Liar, Pants On Fire!"" – the multipartisan panel in Ottawa behaved like adults.

Unlike her own party leader, who is as devoted to message track and empty rhetoric as the prime minister, Conservative MP Lisa Raitt's questioning of Wilson-Raybould was serious and probative. It was in fact a public service.

As was the scoop by Globe and Mail journalist Bob Fife (along with Steven Chase and Sean Fine), who detonated this crisis.

The question now is whether Canadians are going to hear any real answers from their prime minister, if indeed he's capable of offering any.

Actually, there are more honest moments in the pantheon of Trudeau's quotations than in any of his performances in the past few weeks.

Back in 2013, former Global anchorman Tom Clark asked Trudeau about his intellectual substance.

His answer: ""You know, I'm not going to go around reciting Pi to the 19th decibel or you know wave my grades, or test scores to people. I'm going to simply do what it is that I have to do."" Most people can't recite Pi to any decibel, let alone decimal.

In another encounter with Clark a year later, this time jammed into the cabin of Clark's little airplane, he talked about the necessity of educating people (read: all of us).

""I am a teacher. It's how I define myself. A good teacher isn't someone who gives the answers out to their kids but is understanding of needs and challenges and gives tools to help other people succeed.""

To the National Post's John Ivison, he declared: ""Who cares about winning? We should focus on serving."" (Actually, according to Wilson-Raybould, Trudeau cares a great deal about winning, to the point where he's ready to overturn a prosecutor's decision, if that's what it takes).

But it was to CTV that he was probably most candid.

""At one point,"" he told the program W5, ""people are going to have to realize that maybe I know what I'm doing.""

Or not. On the evidence of the past few weeks, I'm thinking not.

Confidence among consumers remains sluggish -- well below the 12-month average on widespread expectations the economy will stagnate or weaken, telephone polling shows. Canadians are more confident in their job security than they have been in years, but that hasn’t extended into better personal finances or optimism about the housing market.

Trudeau is in an election year and Canada’s economy is stumbling, as data released Friday showed that gross domestic product essentially stalled last quarter. That could give Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz more reason to pause interest rate increases, with his next decision on Wednesday.

The Canadian prime minister is already dealing with a controversy over whether he tried to end a court case against SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. to prevent job losses -- a saga that has already cost him a cabinet minister and his principal secretary. The economy, stuck in neutral, presents another risk that would be exacerbated if there was any further slowdown.

“Under normal circumstances, it would feed grumpiness. In the current environment, any kind of downturn would be even more of a problem for the Liberals,” pollster Nik Nanos said.

The Bloomberg Nanos Canadian Confidence Index rose slightly to 55 to begin the month, from 54.2 a month earlier. It remains below the 12-month average of 55.9, and hasn’t topped that level since November. Just 13.9 percent of Canadians expect the economy to strengthen in the next six months, versus 32.9 percent who expect it to weaken.

The data is sluggish despite strong employment indicators -- mirroring a trend nationally where Canadian jobs figures have been regularly more robust than other data. The polling shows the share of Canadians who say their job is at least somewhat secure was 72.8 percent, the highest recorded level since 2011, up from 64.3 percent a month earlier.

Still, just 18.3 percent of Canadians say their personal finances are better off than a year earlier, down from 18.9 percent who said so last month, the polling found.

Housing optimism has also deteriorated -- the share of respondents who expect local real estate values to decrease in the next six months rose to 19.6 percent, from 16.3 percent a month earlier, though that cohort remains outnumbered by those expecting price increases -- 37.1 percent of respondents, little changed from a month earlier.

The weekly index is based on a four-week rolling average of a total of 1,000 respondents contacted by phone. It’s considered accurate within 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The latest polling concluded on March 1.

Trudeau's apologies

Justin Trudeau is well-practiced at saying sorry.

Since coming to power in 2015, he and his government have offered formal apologies to Indigenous peoples for the unjust 1864 executions of six Tsilhqot'in chiefs. To LGBT civil servants who were targeted for their sexuality. And to the world at large for Canada's decision to turn away Sikh, Muslim and Hindu immigrants aboard the Komagata Maru in 1914, and Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany travelling on the MS St. Louis in 1939.

Today, the prime minister is en route to Iqaluit to seek forgiveness for the way the country mistreated Inuit suffering from tuberculosis until the 1960s, forcibly sending them south for treatment where many died, their fates unknown to the families they left behind. (It appears, however, that bad weather might interfere with the plan.)

Make, then, what you will of Trudeau's regrets-I've-had-a-few news conference on the SNC-Lavalin affair early this morning in Ottawa.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau holds a news conference Thursday morning in Ottawa about the SNC-Lavalin affair. With regard to the rift between Jody Wilson-Raybould and Gerald Butts, he said, 'I was not aware of that erosion of trust, and as prime minister and leader of the federal ministry, I should have been.'

With all the major players now having had their moment on the stage, and a he-said, she-said narrative in place, the Liberals are clearly hoping that both media and public are ready to move on.

The House of Commons isn't sitting this week or next. And when MPs return to the chamber March 18, most if not all of the focus will be on the federal budget.

But even if the Trudeau government gets its wish, Jody Wilson-Raybould's allegations of political interference have had a big effect.

It's evident in the opinion polls.

And it's written all over the internet, newspapers and magazines.

Type Trudeau and SNC-Lavalin into Google News, and you get 4.3 million hits for material posted over the past month — and more than a million over the past 24 hours.

A more refined search of major Canadian media outlets doesn't return such impressive numbers — 3,149 hits in the Infomart database, and 5,366 in Factiva — but that's still plenty of bad news.

For example, as of this morning:

The Canadian Press had tied the PM to the Quebec construction giant 673 times.

Canadian Press had tied the PM to the Quebec construction giant 673 times. The Toronto Star had mentioned the affair on 529 occasions.

Toronto Star had mentioned the affair on 529 occasions. The Globe and Mail, which broke the story on Feb. 7, had since referenced it 406 more times.

Globe and Mail, which broke the story on Feb. 7, had since referenced it 406 more times. The CBC has made 235 mentions, versus 197 on the CTV network.

Those numbers don't capture all Canadian media references to the scandal on TV, radio, online or in print, but they do give a sense of how damaging the allegations have been to the Liberal brand.

Infomart, which takes the temperature of the stories it catalogues, reports only 60 ""positive"" Trudeau and SNC-Lavalin mentions, compared to 2,836 ""negative"" ones.

And the fallout really comes into focus when you compare the SNC-Lavalin coverage to other big stories involving the federal government. Search for Trudeau and carbon tax over the past month and Factiva returns 672 results, while Infomart records 482 hits. Do the same for the prime minister and TransMountain, and the two databases find 395 and 258 hits respectively.

What's more, the SNC-Lavalin story has now gone global, receiving prominent play on the websites of the U.K.'s Guardian, in the New York Times and Washington Post, and on Al Jazeera and the BBC.

The biggest political crisis of Justin Trudeau's career isn't quite up there with Alex Trebek's cancer diagnosis — 1.3 million hits over the past 24 hours, according to Google — let alone Kylie Jenner becoming a billionaire, with 3.82 million results.

But even if the prime minister won't apologize, he's surely sorry.

At Issue

The prime minister's statement in connection with the SNC-Lavalin affair this morning was no act of contrition, writes The National's co-host Rosemary Barton.

It is one month to the day since the first allegations of undue influence in the SNC-Lavalin affair were reported in the Globe and Mail. And today, for the very first time, the prime minister devoted a press conference to this topic alone.

It happened the day after hearing from Justin Trudeau's former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, who pushed back on what had been the only public narrative in the affair until that point — that of Jody Wilson-Raybould.

While my colleague David Cochrane reported that the Prime Minister's Office was considering a statement of ""contrition,"" it didn't quite go that far.

Instead, Trudeau talked about the breakdown of trust between his office and the former Ministers. And how, ""I was not aware of that erosion of trust, and as prime minister and leader of the federal ministry, I should have been.""

Trudeau said he would work on his leadership when it came to ensuring an open dialogue with caucus and cabinet members.

And he said he would seek external legal advice about whether the roles of Justice Minister and Attorney General should be separate.

What he did not do, though, was apologize to anyone or for anything.

Doing so would be an admission that there had been undue pressure, and neither he nor those in his office say they believe that to be the case.

So today's press conference came across as more of a ""lessons learned"" than much else.

It remains to be seen whether it was enough to quell the controversy.

The third At Issue of the week airs tonight with Chantal Hébert, Andrew Coyne and Shachi Kurl.

See you then.

'It takes a village'

Changes to how Ontario funds therapy for children with autism are sparking worry among many families, reporter Ioanna Roumeliotis writes.

It's all about the promise of what could be. And that's the tragedy of this story.

At the core of the controversy surrounding Ontario's new proposed autism plan is the loss of every parent's hope: that their child has a fighting chance to reach their potential.

What struck me in every conversation with every parent we spoke to was the despair and devastation of not being able to provide what could be life-altering therapy for their children. Therapy that is based on hours and hours of repetitive exercises that lay the groundwork for learning and social skills.

It could mean the difference between their kids going to school, having friends, and ultimately living independently — or having none of these things that most people take for granted.

The old system, many parents freely acknowledge, was far from perfect. There were long wait lists to receive therapy.

But once they did, it was funded based on the needs of the individual child.

The new plan allots money to autistic children based on age and family income. The most any child will receive is $140,000 in their lifetime, regardless of their needs.

For five-year-old Lauren Yakeley, who has severe autism, the 35 hours of therapy she receives a week now costs $100,000 a year. It has helped her learn things like how to put a fork to her mouth — basic life skills her mother Lisa is terrified she will lose because they will never be able to afford the level of therapy she needs.

""They say it takes a village,"" Yakeley says, her voice shaking. ""Well, the government, our village, is basically saying we don't care about your kids.""

534,Empty,2019-03-01T19:17:33Z,Economists see cash infusions for Canadian households coming,"Canada’s recent economic rough patch has prompted chatter about the fiscal plans of the federal government, not just the monetary policy of the country’s central bank.

Statistics Canada reported Friday that the economy grew just 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018. Growth was 1.8 per cent for the year, a decrease from the 3 per cent seen in 2017.

The news had some economists saying that the Bank of Canada may have been handed a reason to lay off on discussion of further interest-rate increases, if it so chooses.

“On the basis of this latest set of woeful GDP figures, the Bank of Canada must surely be considering following the Fed and abandoning any talk of further interest rate hikes at next week’s policy meeting,” said a note from Capital Economics.

However, the weak economic growth also caused some economists to eye the federal government’s fiscal plans ahead of the March 19 budget, which will arrive just months away from the next Canada-wide election in October.

I wouldn’t be surprised to see the emphasis upon quick shots that get stimulus immediately out the door, like more cash infusions for households Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank

“Barring pre-election handouts from Ottawa, expect a further moderation of consumption this year more so considering the still-low savings rate and an expected moderation in employment creation,” wrote National Bank of Canada senior economist Krishen Rangasamy.

Recent figures from the Department of Finance Canada have suggested that Ottawa could have some room to manoeuvre with its budget. There was an approximately $2.5-billion surplus for December and a $324-million surplus from April to December, the figures showed.

The latest GDP figures could “provide cover” to the federal government to add some stimulus to its coming fiscal plan, according to Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank.

“I wouldn’t be surprised to see the emphasis upon quick shots that get stimulus immediately out the door, like more cash infusions for households as one option,” wrote Holt.

“It might also raise pressure on Finance and the provinces to ease restrictions on housing demand which Finance Minister (Bill) Morneau has already hinted will be a focus in the upcoming budget.”

But there are employment figures for February still to come next week. And jobs numbers will be “the judge and jury for policymakers,” wrote Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

“For the Finance Minister Morneau, there were already temptations to use the fiscal room created by a lower than expected deficit for 2018 to announce more generous child tax credits or other spending initiatives in what is an election year,” Shenfeld said Friday.

“Only if the jobs data weaken could he add the need for further stimulus to that list.”

There has already been some buzz around what sort of measures, if any, the federal Liberal government could have up its sleeve on March 19.

“While we’re not in the game of predicting budget measures, the recent chatter has centred on areas such as expanded universal pharmacare, skills training and measures to help housing affordability,” wrote Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, on Feb. 22.

“On the latter, there has been some hints that Ottawa could bring back 30-year amortizations for first-time buyers, but the details at this point are minimal.”

The Liberal government has been on the defensive since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail said senior officials pressured Wilson-Raybould last year to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials and to pay a fine instead.

Wilson-Raybould - who was demoted in January and resigned from her new post this month - has not said a word so far about the affair. She will testify to the House of Commons justice committee at 3:15 p.m. ET (2015 GMT), her office said.

It is still not clear how much she will actually be able to say. Trudeau announced on Tuesday that she would be allowed to address most aspects of the case, but not all of them.

Opinion polls suggest the matter is starting to hurt the Liberals months before an October election. Trudeau and other officials insist there was no wrongdoing.

The crisis has prompted the resignations of former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, the Treasury Board president, Jane Philpott, and Trudeau's closest political aide, Gerald Butts. It also raised questions about Trudeau's handling of the affair and polls show his Liberals could lose an election this October.

WHAT ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST TRUDEAU

Trudeau has been dogged by allegations that he and his officials improperly leaned on Wilson-Raybould to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a criminal trial. Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee last week that officials imposed ""consistent and sustained pressure"" on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

WHAT IS SNC-LAVALIN'S INVOLVEMENT?

Montreal-based construction and engineering firm SNC-Lavalin was charged in 2015 by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada with bribing Libyan officials to influence the awarding of contracts between 2001 and 2011.

The company had tried unsuccessfully to avoid trial, arguing instead for a negotiated settlement since it had cleaned shop by changing executives and overhauling its ethics and compliance systems in recent years. The preliminary hearings in the case are ongoing.

The company has historically had close ties to the Liberals. In 2016, SNC-Lavalin admitted that some former executives had illegally arranged donations of more than C$80,000 to the Liberals from 2004 to 2011.

WHY IS SNC-LAVALIN CRITICAL TO TRUDEAU AND LIBERALS?

SNC-Lavalin has about 9,000 employees in Canada, including about 3,400 in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec, which also includes Trudeau's parliamentary constituency. The Liberals say they need to pick up enough seats in Quebec in the October election to stand a chance of retaining a majority government.

Officials say they feared that SNC-Lavalin would cut jobs or move its headquarters out of Quebec if found guilty. The company faces being barred from bidding on Canadian federal procurement contracts for 10 years, if found guilty.

WHY DOES CRISIS THREATEN TRUDEAU'S POLITICAL FUTURE?

Critics accuse Trudeau of double standards and breaking the promises he made to do politics differently. Trudeau, 47, came to power in November 2015 promising more accountability and a greater number of women in the Cabinet. He now finds himself accused of trying to help arrange an old-style backroom deal with a major company as his officials leaned on a high-profile woman Cabinet minister. The departure of Philpott, another well-regarded minister and a close friend of Wilson-Raybould, has dented Trudeau's credibility.

No one inside the ruling Liberals has mounted an open challenge to Trudeau, since to do so would take time and open up splits inside the party. The heads of political parties in Canada are elected by party members at formal conventions and cannot be ousted after a snap vote by parliamentarians, as is the case in the UK and Australia. Opinion polls show the controversy is costing the Liberals.

A weekly tracking poll released by Nanos Research on Tuesday put the Conservatives at 35 percent public support, with the Liberals at 34 percent. A Jan. 8 poll by the same firm had the Liberals at 39 percent and the Conservatives at 33 percent. Each poll was based on a random phone survey of 1,000 Canadians.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

Political analysts say Trudeau is safe for now, since he has made clear he wants to stay on and there are no challengers inside the party. The federal Parliament is not sitting next week, depriving the opposition of the chance to grill Trudeau, and the week after will see the release of the federal budget.

The two main opposition parties - the right-of-center Conservatives and the left-leaning New Democrats are demanding a public inquiry into the affair. But the Liberals oppose the idea, since probes take months to complete and are likely to trigger negative headlines.

Wilson-Raybould said she did not consider officials had broken any laws, so a probe by police is unlikely. Canada's independent ethics commissioner is looking into the allegations, but past experience shows such investigations can take months to wrap up and there is no guarantee the results would be released before the vote in October.

538,Empty,2019-02-28T18:01:56Z,"""...there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference."" The post Canadian PM Justin Trudeau facing calls to resign because of a political influence scandal appeared first on Hot Air.","While everyone in the U.S. was watching the Cohen testimony Wednesday, some even more dramatic testimony was happening in Canada. Former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould testified that she had faced a sustained, political pressure campaign from the Prime Minister and others acting on his behalf to intervene in the prosecution of a Quebec-based engineering company called SNC-Lavalin.

Wilson-Raybould, her Deputy AG, and her Chief of Staff were contacted approximately 20 times (half in person, half by phone) over a period of four months to demand that she intervene in the case and allow for a deferred prosecution agreement which would essentially allow SNC to pay its way out of legal trouble. During many of those discussions, it became very clear the motive for the demands was nakedly political. The company had threatened to pack up its Montreal headquarters and move to London, potentially creating a job-losing spectacle just weeks before an election. The Prime Minister was worried his party would suffer unless the company was given a pass.

On Feb. 7, the Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould had been subject to a pressure campaign by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has been slowly admitting to more and more contact with AG Wilson-Raybould on the matter but she was not able to say anything because the conversations were covered by “solicitor-client privilege.” But under public pressure, PM Trudeau waived that privilege and so yesterday Wilson-Raybould gave a lengthy statement detailing the pressure campaign followed by three hours of questioning.

Wilson-Raybould’s recounting of every contact made with her about the SNC-Lavalin case is too long to excerpt in full, but here is her own summary from the start of her testimony:

For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin. These events involved 11 people (excluding myself and my political staff) – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance. This included in-person conversations, telephone calls, emails, and text messages. There were approximately 10 phone calls and 10 meetings specifically about SNC-Lavalin that I and/or my staff was a part of. Within these conversations, there were express statements regarding the necessity for interference in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential for consequences, and veiled threats if a DPA was not made available to SNC. These conversations culminated on December 19, 2018, with a phone conversation I had with the Clerk of the Privy Council – a conversation for which I will provide some significant detail. A few weeks later, on January 7, 2019, I was informed by the Prime Minister that I was being shuffled out of the role of Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of Canada.

On Sep. 4, 2018 Wilson-Raybould was informed by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, that there would be no deferred prosecution agreement in the SNC-Lavalin case. Two days later, the AG’s office began getting calls from other elements within the government asking that Wilson-Raybould intercede. On Sep. 17th Wilson-Raybould was scheduled to have a meeting with PM Trudeau on an unrelated issue. However, as soon as she entered his office he began talking about SNC-Lavalin:

The Prime Minister asks me to help out – to find a solution here for SNC – citing that if there was no DPA there would be many jobs lost and that SNC will move from Montreal. In response, I explained to him the law and what I have the ability to do and not do under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act around issuing Directives or Assuming Conduct of Prosecutions. I told him that I had done my due diligence and made up my mind on SNC and that I was not going to interfere with the decision of the DPP. In response the PM further reiterated his concerns. I then explained how this came about and that I had received the section 13 note from the DPP earlier in September and that I had considered the matter very closely. I further stated that I was very clear on my role as the AG – and I am not prepared to issue a directive in this case – that it was not appropriate. The PM again cited potential loss of jobs and SNC moving. Then to my surprise – the Clerk started to make the case for the need to have a DPA – he said “there is a board meeting on Thursday (Sept 20) with stock holders” … “they will likely be moving to London if this happens”… “and there is an election in Quebec soon”… At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that “and I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau”. I was quite taken aback. My response – and I remember this vividly – was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye – I asked: “Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.” The Prime Minister said “No, No, No – we just need to find a solution.”

That’s really a good summary of how the entire campaign went. People kept calling and claiming there had to be some “solution” while simultaneously pretending they were not involved in a pressure campaign to arrange politically motivated justice. On December 18th, Wilson-Raybould’s Chief of Staff was summoned for a meeting with Trudeau’s principal secretary, i.e. his top political adviser, Gerald Butts. After the meeting, the Chief of Staff texted a summary of what happened to Wilson-Raybould:

Basically, they want a solution. Nothing new. They want external counsel retained to give you an opinion on whether you can review the DPP’s decision here and whether you should in this case. … I told them that would be interference. Gerry said “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.” At least they are finally being honest about what they are asking you to do!

Last Monday, as the scandal was spreading, Gerald Butts resigned. From the NY Times:

In a statement announcing his departure, Gerald Butts, who has been a close friend of Mr. Trudeau’s since their university days, linked his leaving to the allegations that he, the prime minister and others improperly pressured Jody Wilson-Raybould, when she was the justice minister and attorney general, to quash the criminal prosecution of a major Canadian engineering and construction company. Mr. Butts repeatedly denied in his resignation letter that any such action took place. “Any accusation that I or the staff put pressure on the attorney general is simply not true,” Mr. Butts wrote. “But the fact is that this accusation exists. It cannot and should not take one moment away from the vital work the prime minister and his office is doing for all Canadians.”

Those denials ring pretty hollow in light of the text messages and other contemporaneous accounts which Wilson-Raybould made of the interference campaign. The final act of this disgrace came on January 7, 2019 when, having not succumbed to the pressure, Wilson-Raybould was abruptly removed from her job by the PM:

On January 7, I received a call from the PM and was informed I was being shuffled out of my role as MOJAG. I will not go into details of this call, or subsequent communications about the shuffle, but I will say that I stated I believed the reason was because of the SNC matter. They denied this to be the case. On January 11, 2019 – the Friday before the shuffle. My former Deputy Minister is called by the Clerk and told that the shuffle is happening, and that she will be getting a new Minister. As part of this conversation, the Clerk tells the Deputy that one of the first conversations that the new Minister will be expected to have with the PM will be on SNC Lavalin. In other words, that the new Minister will need to be prepared to speak to the PM on this file.

Could it be any more blatant? Yesterday, Paul Wells wrote a scathing opinion piece for Macleans about the scandal:

What the former attorney general described tonight is a sickeningly smug protection racket whose participants must have been astonished when she refused to play along. If a company can rewrite the Criminal Code to get out of a trial whose start date was set before the legislation was drafted, all because a doomed Quebec government has its appointment with the voter, then which excesses are not permitted, under the same justification? If a Clerk of the Privy Council can claim with a straight face that ten calls and meetings with the attorney general, during which massive job loss, an angry PM and a lost election are threatened, don’t constitute interference, then what on earth would interference look like?

In the wake of Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, opposition leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau to resign from office: “Like many of you I listened carefully to the testimony of the former attorney general and like many of you I was sickened and appalled by her story of inappropriate and, frankly, bordering on illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest officials of Justin Trudeau’s government, all to let a Liberal-connected corporation off the hook on serious corruption charges.”

But just this morning Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland went on CBC and said: “I have 100 percent faith in the prime minister.” So it looks like the liberals are not going to call for Trudeau’s ouster and are instead going to stick with the claim that this political pressure campaign was not a political pressure campaign.

""I have never raised partisan considerations"" with former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, Trudeau told a press conference.

His government has been rocked over the past month by the snowballing scandal, which precipitated the resignations of Wilson-Raybould, another minister and Trudeau's right-hand man, and badly tarnished the premier's golden boy image.

Earlier this week, a new poll showed support for the beleaguered prime minister and his Liberals falling for the first time behind the opposition Tories, amid calls for Trudeau's resignation.

Following days of testimony by Wilson-Raybould and others before the House of Commons justice committee, Trudeau said he now understands how badly relations between his office and Wilson-Raybould had soured over the affair, and took some responsibility.

""I was not aware of that erosion of trust. As prime minister, I should have been,"" he said, vowing to ""do better next time.""

But he added, Wilson-Raybould also should have been more forthcoming with her concerns. ""She did not come to me and I wish she had,"" he said.

The scandal centres on allegations that Trudeau's inner circle intervened to shield Canadian engineering giant SNC-Lavalin from a bribery trial.

The Montreal-based firm faces corruption charges for allegedly paying tens of millions of dollars in bribes between 2001 and 2011 to secure Libyan government contracts under the rule of Muammar Gaddafi.

SNC-Lavalin openly lobbied the Canadian government for an out-of-court settlement that would mean paying a fine and agreeing to compliance measures.

A conviction, the company argued, risked crippling its business and putting thousands out of work.

Wilson-Raybould refused to ask prosecutors to settle, and the trial is set to proceed.

Trudeau himself discussed the case with Wilson-Raybould once last September 17, but denied any undue pressure was applied on her.

""There was no inappropriate pressure,"" he said, adding ""that the decision was hers alone.""",Trudeau denies 'partisan' meddling in prosecution,Channelnewsasia.com,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/trudeau-denies--partisan--meddling-in-prosecution-11322306

It is hard to imagine a more damaging defection than that of Jane Philpott, until Monday president of the Treasury Board. Since Trudeau’s election, Philpott had become one of the few breakout stars in an otherwise dim cabinet.

“The evidence of efforts by politicians and/or officials to pressure the former attorney general to intervene in the criminal case involving SNC-Lavalin, and the evidence as to the content of those efforts have raised serious concerns for me,” she wrote while scattering cherry bombs in the cabinet room behind her. “Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised.”

The unanswered question now before us is how the rest of the caucus feels about the matter. If Philpott’s position is a minority one, the rest of Trudeau’s party may yet fall in line.

Confidence, however, is a spinning top, and Philpott’s abandonment may be what was required to it set it wobbling.

There can be no real dispute that Philpott’s objections are perfectly valid.

Only a month ago, the Globe and Mail broke the story claiming that former attorney general and justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould was pressured by the Prime Minister’s staff to override her independent public prosecutor’s decision not to seek a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) for the scandal-prone Quebec firm SNC-Lavalin.

Even as more information began to emerge suggesting those allegations were well-founded, Trudeau’s response has been an unmitigated moral and strategic gong show.

The affair culminated in a detailed testimony by Wilson-Raybould in front of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights last week. She offered accounts detailing how she was pressured by the Prime Minister, his staff and even the non-partisan clerk of the PCO.

Trudeau had one brief window to turn the scandal around; if he had proof that Wilson-Raybould was lying, or misrepresenting, he should have come out with it days ago.

Instead, he travelled to a friendlier press corps in Montreal to deliver a brief statement stating that he disagreed with her “characterization” of events.

The entire show was was incredibly, untenably weak.

Trudeau could have taken an alternative route. If his government is, indeed, as transparent and honest as it wanted to be when it came into office in 2015, Trudeau could have simply owned up to making a mistake; to going too far in pursuit of protecting important Canadian jobs. He could have apologized.

But that’s not what Liberals do.

At every turn in this scandal, the government has chosen to double down on dodgy behaviour.

Consider, for a moment, comments made by the Montreal-based Attorney General David Lametti, who replaced Wilson-Raybould after she wouldn’t play nice on SNC.

In an interview on Sunday, Lametti said that the matter of securing a DPA—which would allow the company to avoid a criminal trial in connection with allegations that it bribed Muammar Gadaffi’s son for projects in Libya—”no decision is ever final.”

Trudeau himself echoed Lametti’s hand-waving in Prince Edward Island on Monday.

“We are always going to stand up for good jobs, create good jobs and defend Canadians’ interests,” Trudeau said, according to the Chronicle Herald.

“This matter is to be determined by the attorney general. That is what I said to the former attorney general, and that’s something the current attorney general knows full well.”

A cliché term for this is “trial ballooning.” It’s as if the Liberals are still considering granting the DPA to SNC-Lavalin, despite the growing sinkhole forming underneath whatever was left of this government’s credibility.

There’s a perverse logic to granting the DPA, even now.

First, if the Liberals were planning to stick to their insistence that they did nothing untoward, well, then, there’s no reason not to grant a DPA. Everything on the up-and-up, folks!

Second, the Liberals already burned so much of their political capital on the scandal, that there’s not much left to lose among those who still place any pride in principles. If you’re going to do the time anyway, might as well do the crime.

Saving SNC shows fealty to Quebec, which would secure a few seats come the writ drop. The whole scandal just shows how committed the Liberals are to middle-class, jobs, right? And who doesn’t want a leader who will strongly defend jobs?

Some Liberals will be upset, sure, but eventually most would write off the move as a little bit of underhanded realpolitik—nothing a lifelong partisan hasn’t defended from time to time. The most important point is to convince the general electorate that the Conservatives are just as corrupt or worse—actual Harperites, or probable Nazis.

And there are so many other important issues the Liberals—and the Liberals alone—have to tackle; climate change, Indigenous reconciliation. The very country is at stake, if one imagines that the Liberals’ interests are indivisible from Canada’s.

In the immortal words of Mathieu Bouchard, senior advisor in the Prime Minister’s Office, who allegedly said to Wilson-Raybould: “We can have the best policy in the world, but we need to be re-elected.”

If anyone could have put an end to this tack—and I’m not convinced that anyone did—it was Jane Philpott.

That is not a strategy that a genuinely principled person would defend with her own reputation, in public.

“The solemn principles at stake are the independence and integrity of our justice system,” Philpott wrote in her resignation letter. “It is a fundamental doctrine of the rule of law that our attorney general should not be subjected to political pressure or interference regarding the exercise of her prosecutorial discretion in criminal cases.”

That is the eternal problem with attracting people who have principles into politics.

The …","OTTAWA (Reuters) - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday denied interfering in Canada's judicial system as he sought to defuse a month-long crisis threatening his political future, but offered no apology, asserting only that lessons had been learned.

The crisis has prompted the resignations of former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, the Treasury Board president, Jane Philpott, and Trudeau's closest political aide, Gerald Butts. It also raised questions about Trudeau's handling of the affair and polls show his Liberals could lose an election this October.

WHAT ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST TRUDEAU

Trudeau has been dogged by allegations that he and his officials improperly leaned on Wilson-Raybould to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a criminal trial. Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee last week that officials imposed ""consistent and sustained pressure"" on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

WHAT IS SNC-LAVALIN'S INVOLVEMENT?

Montreal-based construction and engineering firm SNC-Lavalin was charged in 2015 by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada with bribing Libyan officials to influence the awarding of contracts between 2001 and 2011.

The company had tried unsuccessfully to avoid trial, arguing instead for a negotiated settlement since it had cleaned shop by changing executives and overhauling its ethics and compliance systems in recent years. The preliminary hearings in the case are ongoing.

The company has historically had close ties to the Liberals. In 2016, SNC-Lavalin admitted that some former executives had illegally arranged donations of more than C$80,000 to the Liberals from 2004 to 2011.

WHY IS SNC-LAVALIN CRITICAL TO TRUDEAU AND LIBERALS?

SNC-Lavalin has about 9,000 employees in Canada, including about 3,400 in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec, which also includes Trudeau's parliamentary constituency. The Liberals say they need to pick up enough seats in Quebec in the October election to stand a chance of retaining a majority government.

Officials, citing conversations they said they had with the company, say they feared SNC-Lavalin would cut jobs or move its headquarters out of Quebec if found guilty. The company faces being barred from bidding on Canadian federal procurement contracts for 10 years, if found guilty.

""We will not comment on this matter,"" SNC-Lavalin spokesman Nicolas Ryan said on Thursday when asked if the company had warned Trudeau of possible job losses in case of a guilty verdict.

WHY DOES CRISIS THREATEN TRUDEAU'S POLITICAL FUTURE?

Critics accuse Trudeau of double standards and breaking the promises he made to do politics differently. Trudeau, 47, came to power in November 2015 promising more accountability and a greater number of women in the Cabinet. He now finds himself accused of trying to help arrange an old-style backroom deal with a major company as his officials leaned on a high-profile woman Cabinet minister. The departure of Philpott, another well-regarded minister and a close friend of Wilson-Raybould, has dented Trudeau's credibility.

No one inside the ruling Liberals has mounted an open challenge to Trudeau, since to do so would take time and open up splits inside the party. The heads of political parties in Canada are elected by party members at formal conventions and cannot be ousted after a snap vote by parliamentarians, as is the case in the UK and Australia. Opinion polls show the controversy is costing the Liberals.

A weekly tracking poll released by Nanos Research on Tuesday put the Conservatives at 35 percent public support, with the Liberals at 34 percent. A Jan. 8 poll by the same firm had the Liberals at 39 percent and the Conservatives at 33 percent. Each poll was based on a random phone survey of 1,000 Canadians.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

Political analysts say Trudeau is safe for now, since he has made clear he wants to stay on and there are no challengers inside the party. The federal Parliament is not sitting next week, depriving the opposition of the chance to grill Trudeau, and the week after will see the release of the federal budget.

The two main opposition parties - the right-of-center Conservatives and the left-leaning New Democrats are demanding a public inquiry into the affair. But the Liberals oppose the idea, since probes take months to complete and are likely to trigger negative headlines.

Wilson-Raybould said she did not consider officials had broken any laws, so a probe by police is unlikely. Canada's independent ethics commissioner is looking into the allegations, but past experience shows such investigations can take months to wrap up and there is no guarantee the results would be released before the vote in October.

In a serious blow to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a second member of his Cabinet resigned on Monday, saying she had lost confidence in how the government had dealt with an escalating political scandal.

The departure of Treasury Board Minister Jane Philpott, who was in overall charge of government spending, deprives Trudeau of another powerful female member of cabinet just months ahead of an election that polls show he could lose.

Philpott said she was unhappy about the government's response to allegations that officials inappropriately pressured former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help major construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid being tried for corruption.

""Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised,"" Philpott said in a statement. ""I have concluded that I must resign as a member of cabinet.""

Philpott is a close friend of Wilson-Raybould, who herself resigned on Feb. 12 after she was unexpectedly demoted in January. Wilson-Raybould said last week she was convinced her refusal to help SNC-Lavalin was behind the demotion.

Trudeau has accepted Philpott's resignation and will address the matter later on Monday, said a spokesman for the prime minister.

The resignation is another setback for a prime minister who came to power in November 2015 promising ""sunny ways,"" more accountability in politics and a greater number of women ministers.

""What should be worrisome for the Trudeau Liberals is that the two cabinet resignations have been on issues of principle and ethics,"" said Nanos Research pollster Nik Nanos.

""The second resignation begs the question – what did happen and could there be more resignations,"" he said by email.

There was little immediate sign that other key cabinet members would leave. Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne would not be resigning, their offices said.

Philpott said evidence of efforts by politicians and officials to pressure Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case had raised serious concerns.

Wilson-Raybould tweeted to Philpott that ""you are a leader of vision and strength and I look forward to continuing to work alongside you.""

Philpott, 58, was widely regarded as one of the best of Trudeau's cabinet ministers. She had previously served as minister of health and minister of indigenous services.

Carolyn Bennett, the minister in charge of relations with the aboriginal population, said in a statement that ""I have absolute confidence in our government, and our Prime Minister.""

Most Liberal parliamentarians have so far backed Trudeau but there are signs of strain.

Celina Caesar-Chavannes, a Liberal legislator who is not seeking re-election, tweeted that ""when you add women, please do not expect the status quo. Expect us to make correct decisions, stand for what is right and exit when values are compromised.""

Gerald Butts, who quit as Trudeau's principal secretary last month over the SNC-Lavalin affair, will testify to the House of Commons justice committee from 10 a.m. to noon on Wednesday.

In her testimony to the committee last week, Wilson-Raybould singled out Butts as one official who tried particularly hard to change her mind. Under questioning she said she did not consider officials had broken any laws.

Two ministers who were highly regarded by political observers are now no longer involved in the government headed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Any attempts to look into what this means for the election scheduled to take place this October are futile. Canada has seen its share of political disgraces, and not every one of them has led to a change in government or a stronger opposition.

Let us go back in time for a moment. In 1985, large quantities of tuna that had been declared unfit for human consumption made their way to Canada’s store shelves. This led to the resignation of then-minister of Fisheries and Oceans John Fraser. Columnists and pundits spent ample time – in a pre-online world – gauging the effect that this “scandal” would have on the federal administration headed by Brian Mulroney.

Three years later, Mulroney secured another majority government in an election that was not a referendum on safety guidelines for the sale of edible fish products, but on an issue that dominated the agenda in the weeks and months leading up to the actual vote: free trade with the United States.

There are plenty of examples of issues that fleetingly command the attention of Canadians, only to end up having little or no effect in the future of governments. Jean Chrétien did not face an election after Canadians learned of the so-called “Shawinigate” related to the Grand-Mère Golf Club.

Years later, the “sponsorship scandal” lingered for months as a possibly detrimental issue for the Liberals, then headed by Paul Martin. It was only after the RCMP announced a criminal probe in the middle of an election campaign that the Conservatives gained momentum and ultimately defeated the Liberals to form a minority government in early 2006.

In March 2011, a motion declared the Stephen Harper government “in contempt of Parliament” – a dubious distinction that had never before been applied to any federal administration. In the election that ensued, the Liberals were decimated, the New Democratic Party (NDP) became the Official Opposition and the Conservatives earned their first – and only, in the new period of the unified party – majority mandate.

The so-called Tunagate was no longer in the minds of Canadian voters before the 1988 election. Constant calls for Chrétien’s resignation over the golf course went unheeded. Being found in contempt of Parliament did not make the Harper Conservatives fold into political oblivion. From these examples, the only one that stuck and caused severe damage to a party brand was the RCMP probe into the “sponsorship scandal”. And why? Because it happened as the campaign progressed.

We are in a new era when it comes to the way in which people connect with “scandals” and government problems. Politicians everywhere can thank the current dweller of the White House for that. There were ample instances throughout 2016 where political observers in the United States said to themselves: “There is no way Donald Trump will survive this.” But he did.

If the base is solid, the only thing that grows is the level of bewilderment and nausea coming out of those who are against a particular candidate. Nothing sums this better than the 2004 election in the U.S., where John Kerry emerged from the Democratic National Convention with the support of 48% of voters and ended with the same proportion of the vote after all the ballots were tallied in November.

The dismay over George W. Bush’s decisions, qualifications and statements did not make more Americans look at Kerry as suitable material to become the 43rd president – it just made those who were already on his column angrier and angrier.

In spite of all of this, if there is one area where the Liberals will have a more difficult time – SNC-Lavalin or not – it is British Columbia. Former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould holds a seat in Vancouver. The current prime minister campaigned in the westernmost province on promises related to electoral reform and environmental stewardship that some voters feel were not adequately met.

It must also be acknowledged that the federal Liberal Party has never had a true base in British Columbia, aside from pockets of extreme popularity in the city of Vancouver. The Liberals went from garnering the votes of 13% of British Columbians under Michael Ignatieff in 2011 to 35% under Justin Trudeau in 2015. These are “borrowed” votes that can easily find a way to other political parties, as they did in previous contests.

The question, which can be answered only once the electoral campaign starts, is whether voters think there is a better alternative to what Trudeau and the Liberals currently offer. Tunagate did not make then-Liberal leader John Turner more appealing. The Conservatives being found in contempt of Parliament did not help Michael Ignatieff. It is simply too soon to gauge how Canadian voters will react to what has transpired over the last month. If the story had broken in September or October, the consequences would be clearer.",Too soon to tell whether SNC-Lavalin affair is the Liberals’ Watergate – or Tunagate,Vancouverisawesome.com,https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/03/05/snc-lavalin-liberals-watergate-tunagate/

A former Canadian justice minister says she faced attempts at interference and ""veiled threats"" from top government officials seeking a legal favour for a firm facing a corruption trial.

Jody Wilson-Raybould said she was pressed repeatedly to ""find a solution"" for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

PM Justin Trudeau said he disagreed with the minister's testimony and he and his staff acted appropriately.

Opposition leader Andrew Scheer has called on him to resign.

""He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,"" the Conservative leader told reporters, adding that he was calling for a full police investigation.

What did the former minister say?

Speaking to the House of Commons justice committee, the former justice minister and attorney general said she and her staff faced four months of a ""sustained"" and ""inappropriate effort"" to push for a possible deferred prosecution agreement for the Quebec-based engineering and construction company.

That agreement would have allowed the firm to avoid a criminal trial and instead agree to alternative terms or conditions, like penalties or enhanced compliance measures.

It was an option rejected in September by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada - an independent authority whose main objective is to prosecute federal offences - and one she supported.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said she and her aides were pulled into multiple conversations and meetings - ""a barrage of people hounding me and my staff"" - with Mr Trudeau, senior aides from his office and the finance department, and a top bureaucrat.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Wilson-Raybould says she felt political pressure and ""veiled threats"" from government officials

In those various meetings, they repeatedly raised concerns about the possibility of job losses and potential political ramifications of a trial long after that decision had been made.

""Within these conversations, there were expressed statements regarding the necessity of interference in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential of consequences and veiled threats if a deferred prosecution agreement was not made available to SNC,"" she said.

Mr Trudeau's Liberals have struggled to contain the controversy over the past three weeks.

Though she has been a key figure at the centre of the affair, Ms Wilson-Raybould had not yet not spoken publicly, citing solicitor-client privilege.

That privilege was waived by the government on Monday, paving the way for her appearance before the committee on Wednesday.

What has happened so far?

This began in early February, when the Globe and Mail newspaper reported on allegations of political interference in the case against SNC-Lavalin.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has faced repeated questions about the matter from opposition parties

The newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources, that Mr Trudeau's office pressured Ms Wilson-Raybould to push the public prosecution service to consider a deferred prosecution agreement.

Ms Wilson-Raybould was attorney general and justice minister until January, when she was shuffled into the veterans affairs portfolio, a move widely seen as a demotion.

An attorney general is supposed to act independently with respect of his or her prosecutorial function.

On 12 February, Ms Wilson-Raybould resigned suddenly from Cabinet, though she remains a Liberal member of Parliament.

Finally on 18 February, Mr Trudeau's top aide Gerald Butts announced he was resigning, denying in a statement that he or anyone on his staff did anything wrong but saying he had to leave so as not to be a distraction from the ""vital work"" being done by the team.

Mr Trudeau and his officials have denied anything improper took place but have struggled to contain the crisis.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday evening, he said he was worried about jobs at SNC Lavalin and how pensioners would be affected.

Opinion polls indicate the matter is beginning to hurt the Liberals with months to go until the coming general election.

What is happening with SNC Lavalin?

The Quebec-based firm is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies.

The company and two of its subsidiaries face fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

The agreement - similar to regimes in the US and the UK - essentially suspends prosecution while allowing a firm to agree instead to alternative terms or conditions.

SNC-Lavalin and its supporters say it would be unfair to penalise the company as a whole and its thousands of employees for the wrongdoings of former executives.

Preliminary hearings for the charges are currently before the courts. The company says it will ""vigorously defend itself"" against the allegations.

In two hours of testimony before the parliamentary justice committee, Trudeau’s former principal secretary laid out a strikingly different story about the PMO’s efforts – one that directly contradicted Wilson-Raybould’s account just a week earlier. Butts said any meetings and conversations with Wilson-Raybould were intended not to pressure her but only to ask her to get external legal advice on how a new law — on deferred prosecutions for companies facing criminal liability — should be applied, especially with 9,000 Canadian jobs at stake if SNC-Lavalin were barred from federal contracts as a result of a conviction. “When you boil it all down, all we ever asked the attorney general to consider was a second opinion,” Butts said.

However Butts’ testimony, which he delivered in a calm, measured manner, combined with that of a more combative Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, may have created an even bigger problem for Trudeau. Neither has any legal training, and yet they asserted the attorney general’s decision on a prosecution under the new law is never final.

“In dealing with the public interest, the attorney general’s decision is never final. The public interest can evolve and change, and the impact of a decision to prosecute or not prosecute was evolving in this case,” said Wernick, who serves as deputy minister to the prime minister. Butts said the Trudeau government believed Wilson-Raybould had an obligation to take advice on the public interest considerations at play and whether it would be appropriate to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement. He said he and chief of staff Katie Telford had suggested seeking an opinion from someone such as retired chief justice Beverley McLachlin. “I think it was incumbent upon the people who were trying to put advice and evidence in front of the Attorney General to do so, and I think it was incumbent upon her to hear it,” he said. “I still don’t get why getting transparent advice from a former Supreme Court of Canada justice is controversial at all.” He said thousands of SNC-Lavalin jobs could be lost if the company was convicted and banned from federal contracts, “a real and significant public policy challenge” in the view of the prime minister — a view that was challenged by the Conservatives. Lawyer Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a former judge and law professor who appeared two weeks ago before the same committee, said Butts’ testimony revealed the prime minister and his senior staff did not accept the view of the government’s chief legal officer and lead prosecutor. “Mr. Butts was an avuncular jovial witness….but on the hard issue in this matter which is what about the rule of law, his evidence was deeply problematic because today we found out not only did they not respect the finality of her decision but they actually tried to press her to engage a former Supreme Court judge to make the decision for her.” Turpel-Lafond said Butts’ testimony, the apparently scripted questions of Liberal MPs, and the government’s continued limitation on Wilson-Raybould in what she can say publicly, shows a public inquiry is needed. Under opposition pressure, the Liberal-majority Commons’ committee is conducting a limited probe into the allegations of political interference in the attorney general’s office. But Wednesday’s meeting ended with the Liberals defeating Conservative and New Democrat efforts to recall Wilson-Raybould as well as hear from her former chief of staff and three Trudeau aides, and to require Butts to produce all his written notes and communications about the affair. After the day’s hearings ended, Wilson-Raybould said she is willing to testify again but she is still not at liberty to discuss certain events at the heart of the testimony — such as why she eventually resigned on Feb. 11 — due to the limited waiver the Liberal government granted her. She says it only permitted her to speak to the committee, and only about her time as attorney-general, not after she was shuffled out of that job. During her initial committee appearance Wilson-Raybould said she believed she was the target of “veiled threats” and a “barrage” of lobbying by Trudeau and his senior officials get her to intervene to drop criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin. Wernick denied her statement that he had ever made threats, veiled or otherwise, against her. And he rejected her suggestion that politics — notably last fall’s Quebec election — was the motivation for the interventions. Instead, Butts insisted that jobs were overriding concern. All along, Trudeau “gave and maintained clear direction to the PMO and PCO on this file… to make sure the thousands of people whose jobs were, and it bears repeating, are at risk were at the forefront of our minds at all times.” But Trudeau also equally made clear that the decision would be Wilson-Raybould’s, not theirs, he said.

Gerald Butts, former top aide to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, gives his version of events surrounding the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin to counter what former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould told the committee. He says the potential job losses at the company was a public policy problem that needed to be addressed.

“So it was and is the attorney-general’s decision to make. It would, however, be Canadians’ decision to live with,” Butts said. He flatly denied Wilson-Raybould was shuffled out of her job over SNC-Lavalin, and called the whole SNC-Lavalin affair “a very unfortunate series of events.” He admitted however that “trust had broken down” between the prime minister and Wilson-Raybould around the time of the cabinet shuffle and Butts took personal responsibility for that. He said the January cabinet shuffle was a consequence of the decision by former Nova Scotia MP Scott Brison to quit politics, leaving a cabinet vacancy that needed to be filled — an explanation Trudeau has repeatedly offered. He said it was Jane Philpott who foresaw Wilson-Raybould’s concern on SNC-Lavalin and flagged it to them before Trudeau called and offered Wilson-Raybould the Indigenous Services job — a position Wilson-Raybould refused. Butts said Trudeau was taken aback, and told her he needed her to work with his team. Turpel-Lafond called Butts’ explanation “patently absurd” and said shifting Wilson-Raybould from the position of chief law officer into Indigenous Services was like “taking someone who’s Nelson Mandela and saying you’re going to administer apartheid.” When she turned it down, Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to veterans affairs, a position she resigned just weeks later for as-yet unspecified reasons other than she no longer had confidence to sit at the cabinet table. Butts said he communicated with Wilson-Raybould several times after the first shuffle and “I knew from the course of those conversations and exchanges that trust had broken down between our office and the minister.” “I was deeply concerned by what the minister was saying. It was all a great and sad surprise to me that she could draw those sorts of conclusions about her colleagues, including myself. I tried to counter her misapprehensions with repeated, honest efforts. In the end, I was unable to do so. And here we are today.” “I want to say that I deeply regret that the former minister’s trust and faith in the many colleagues she served alongside for three and a half years has eroded so much. I take my fair share of responsibility for that tragic state of affairs.” He said Wilson-Raybould should have told the prime minister her concerns about political interference directly, in writing, or communicated it to Butts or directly to those aides she felt had crossed a line, and never did. Had she done so, Trudeau would have put an immediate stop to it, Butts said. Wilson-Raybould testified she looked the prime minister “in the eye” on Sept. 17, asked whether he was directing her to interfere, and told him squarely that it was inappropriate to do so. The New Democrat and Conservatives on the committee now want to call Wilson-Raybould as well as Katie Telford, Trudeau’s chief of staff, and his aides Elder Marques and Mathieu Bouchard. But Liberals voted to delay consideration of that request until they meet again March 19. That’s the same day the Trudeau government will table its 2019 budget. Conservative MP Lisa Raitt said she was bewildered by the Liberals’ decision to delay the consideration of additional witnesses, including Wilson-Raybould.

Suffragist Mary Ellen Smith, the first female cabinet minister in the British Empire, resigned from the British Columbia cabinet almost a century ago. Ninety-eight years later, Indigenous MP Jody Wilson-Raybould quit the federal cabinet, followed by activist doctor Jane Philpott.

Even though the events played out almost 100 years apart, they’ve revealed the unrequited hopes of disadvantaged communities for a fair dealing.

In January 1921, B.C.’s Liberal Premier “Honest John” Oliver, sought new women voters to ensure his government retained power. To that end, he appointed as minister without portfolio the prominent suffragist who had become the province’s first female MLA.

Mary Ellen Smith was elected as an Independent in a 1918 by-election and then as a Liberal in 1920. Committing herself to “the people and the rights of the people,” she affirmed her allegiance to the Liberal Party’s progressive wing. Not to be forgotten, however, is that her supposedly progressive politics included anti-Asian and pro-eugenics arguments, not entirely uncommon 100 years ago.

Despite topping polls, rescuing Liberal seats and speaking for a broad community of feminist activists, Smith was denied departmental responsibility. Oversight of the mothers’ pensions and women’s minimum wage legislation, causes she had long championed, were assigned to less sympathetic politicians.

Her lack of budget, salary and staff did not stop Canadians from congratulating themselves on making history with her appointment.

Appointment made headlines

Almost a century later, in November 2015, Jody Wilson-Raybould of the We Wai Kai Nation became the first Indigenous justice minister and attorney-general in Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cabinet. That appointment, with its signalling of reconciliation and equality, once again made headlines given Wilson-Raybould was the onetime treaty commissioner and regional chief of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations.

Equally significant for contemporary federal Liberals, the presence of Wilson-Raybould in cabinet might have held the promise of potential votes from a rising Indigenous demographic — just as politicians had harboured similar hopes about Smith and women voters in the 1920s.

Wilson-Raybould, whose traditional name translates as “woman born to noble people,” quickly proved independent. As she wrote in her resignation letter, she espoused “a positive and progressive vision of change” and “a different way of doing politics.” Like Smith, she stood on her party’s left.

Philpott, meantime, is a physician noted for her dedication to international development and to reconciliation with Indigenous peoples as minister for Indigenous services. She’s been a champion of progressive liberalism.

City of Vancouver archives

Smith’s honeymoon with liberalism ended a century ago when she discovered she was neither to criticize nor advise her colleagues in government. In November 1921, scandals over liquor sales, railways and patronage and few benefits for women or workers drove her to resign.

Public reaction was mixed, but Smith’s hope that a chastened government would turn to the left did not happen. As women voters grew disenchanted in the 1920s, Liberal power-brokers sidelined Canada’s first female cabinet minister to largely ceremonial posts.

In January 2019, despite being widely applauded as an effective minister, Wilson-Raybould was demoted from Justice to Veterans’ Affairs. Less than a month later, she resigned from cabinet.

Philpott, on Ontario MP who had been promoted in the same cabinet shuffle that saw Wilson-Raybould’s demoted, joined her less than a month later, citing “core values, my ethical responsibilities and constitutional obligations.”

Alleged pressure from PMO

In her testimony to the House of Commons judicial committee, Wilson-Raybould alleged the Prime Minister’s Office pressured her to rescue a leading Canadian corporation, SNC-Lavalin, from criminal prosecution. Indigenous and feminist allies, long suspicious of what they consider a Liberal tendency to campaign on the left and govern on the right, quickly mobilized.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld

In the immediate aftermath of Wilson-Raybould’s resignation, progressive allies within the Liberal party had a lot to consider. In stark contrast to the situation in 1921, the stakes rose massively when Wilson-Raybould was joined by Philpott, a rising Liberal cabinet star.

What do resignations of these three prominent women politicians tell us?

Above all, Smith, Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were all well-known for seeking long-overdue political inclusion and reconciliation for chronically disadvantaged communities.

Their hopes rested with left-wing liberalism even as they tested its limits.

But 2019 is not 1921.

The outcome for Wilson-Raybould, and now Philpott, remains to be written. Almost 100 years ago, Mary Ellen Smith could be largely ignored following her resignation. Her two modern successors, on the other hand, appear far better equipped to battle for liberalism’s future — or to choose another political party.",Saying no to power: The resignations of women cabinet members,Theconversation.com,http://theconversation.com/saying-no-to-power-the-resignations-of-women-cabinet-members-112693

Jude Woodward, the author of the new book ""The US vs China: Asia's new Cold War?"" told Radio Sputnik's Loud & Clear Wednesday that Huawei's reported plans to sue the US government over its ban on Huawei products is valid, given the lack of evidence provided by the US government over its claims that the Chinese company spies on US technology.

​According to unidentified sources who recently spoke to the New York Times and the Financial Times, Huawei will claim that the US' John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act, passed in August 2018, which bans government agencies from using technologies from Huawei and ZTE, Huawei's smaller Chinese rival, violates the US Constitution by singling out the technology firms without trial.

The US government has repeatedly asserted that Huawei's products are being used by Chinese intelligence services for spying and stealing American intellectual property.

""I think the lawsuit makes a very valid point, which is that these [US] executive orders on security were imposed without Huawei being given any evidence on which this is based. So, essentially it was trial without evidence,"" Woodward told host Walter Smolarek.

And Woodward doesn't give much credence to the argument that Huawei devices are actually Trojan Horses to allow the Chinese government to spy on rivals.

""Huawei… doesn't do a lot of publicity work, it just puts its products out there. It has made very clear, public, unusual statements saying it does not not give information to the Chinese government, so that rather lends credence, I would say, to the argument that [spying claims are] not true, because I don't think they would make such clear and unambiguous statements if they thought that evidence was about to be turned up,"" she said.

Last year, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the United States banned the Chinese telecommunications giant from participating in government contracts. In December 2018, Meng was arrested in the Canadian city of Vancouver for reportedly failing to comply with US sanctions against Iran.

Her arrest was criticised by Beijing, which has urged Canadian authorities to release the Chinese national.

Huawei might have found itself in American crosshairs over simple technological and economic rivalry, the journalist said.

""If it's [the US accusations against Huawei] not true, and let's for the moment assume that it's not true, then it's clear that the reason that has been widely speculated in the media, which is that the US administration does not want a Chinese company to become a leading company on the 5G technology. So, rather than the whole world being dependent on the most advanced US technology, in some areas at least, the world will become dependent on Chinese technologies,"" Woodward explained.

""The US accuses China of stealing technology but also of unfairly using important state investment to develop R&D and to aid particular companies. This is, I find, ironic, because if we believe what the [US] neoliberals say, then actually it should be to the detriment of China that it interferes with the market this way.""

""China relies on the hidden and open hands of the market. It's not that it's against markets; it would be mad to be against markets, but as long as they are regulated. And that's what China insists upon: state-led investment to develop new technologies, control over its banks and its currency in order to be able to most efficiently involve itself in the market, and this, according to neo-liberals, shouldn't work at all,"" Woodward added.

This week, Meng filed a lawsuit against Canadian officials, claiming her constitutional rights were violated during her arrest.

The lawsuit, filed in Canada's Supreme Court against federal government branches the Canadian Border Services Agency and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, asserts that officials, ""under the guise of a routine border check, unlawfully subjected [Meng] to detention, search and interrogation to extract evidence from her before she was arrested and provided with her rights under the Charter.""

The lawsuit seeks damages for ""misfeasance in public office and false imprisonment based on alleged multiple failures of those Canadian government officials to comply with the rule of law,"" the statement by her lawyers said, Sputnik previously reported.

""She's [Meng] accused of having misled the US over the involvement of Huawei in activities which amounted to sanctions [busting] in Iran. [Some of the evidence the US is relying on is] incredibly old, and they have known it for years. [This] casts doubt on why, at this point, they [the US] moved against her, even if the evidence is true, which we don't know. She's taking this civil action in Canada claiming unfair arrest. Again, I think this is less about winning such a case,"" Woodward told Sputnik.

""On an extradition procedure, there's very little that can be done in terms of calling on evidence, whereas if there is a case on these grounds, she hopes that, she and her lawyers hope that, they get more of the evidence for the US' case [against Huawei] into the open,"" Woodward continued.",Huawei’s Plan to File Lawsuit Against US Government ‘Very Valid’,Sputniknews.com,https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201903061072986304-huawei-plan-file-lawsuit-us-government-valid/

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insisted Thursday that there was nothing sinister about his role in a scandal swamping his government and threatening his reelection prospects.

At a formal press conference, he spoke in detail for the first time about the episode. He admitted to urging his former attorney general to reach an out-of-court settlement with a company from his home turf facing corruption charges.

But he repeatedly said it was all in the name of protecting jobs and pensioners.

""I continue to say there was no inappropriate pressure,"" he said. ""There was no breakdown of our system, of the rule of law, of the integrity of our institutions.""

The damage from his former attorney general's accusations has been swift and significant. The fallout has divided Trudeau's party, cost him two cabinet members, prompted two parliamentary probes, forced the resignation of a top aide and friend, and sent his personal poll numbers plummeting with an election months away.

""There are many things we would have liked to have done differently"" — Justin Trudeau.

""This has been a tough few weeks,"" Trudeau said.

Trudeau's version of events is that he simply stated to his former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould the fact that the Quebec-based construction company, SNC-Lavalin, is a major employer. He also noted at the press conference that a leading public pension fund owns part of the company that is in legal jeopardy.

“I wish she had come forward to me in the fall subsequent to that meeting to highlight that"" she felt it was inappropriate that we continued to discuss the matter throughout the fall, Trudeau said. ""She did not.”

While Trudeau largely stuck to the points he wanted to make, he appeared less stiff than in recent public appearances where he was repeatedly peppered with questions about his handling of the affair.

Trudeau repeatedly evaded stating whether he or his staff brought up both his and Quebec Liberals' electoral prospects during conversations with Wilson-Raybould, saying “there were detailed conversations on a broad range of things that were discussed” and “laid bare” in the testimonies of the last few days.

Wilson-Raybould said she was demoted in January after resisting pressure, for months last year, to deliver the settlement agreement to the company — headquartered near the prime minister's home district in Montreal.

And she went public with those concerns.

Wilson-Raybould said Trudeau himself briefly participated in a sustained campaign to twist her arm. She added the caveat that, in her opinion, the prime minister did not break any laws.

Trudeau said at Thursday's news conference that he had no idea that she felt she was under such pressure from various people in government.

He said she never mentioned it to him.

But he added that the episode does raise some questions about the structure of the cabinet.

""There are many things we would have liked to have done differently,"" Trudeau said.

One of those things: He said he will seek external advice about splitting up the roles of AG and the more political job of justice minister, now held by a single member of the Cabinet.

Wilson-Raybould was being pulled in two directions — by the pressures of the Liberal government on the one hand, and on the other by her department's decision to keep seeking criminal charges against Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin.

Also this week, longtime Trudeau aide Gerald Butts defended the government's behavior and challenged Wilson-Raybould's characterization of events.

A civil servant also testified to Parliament that she tried informing senior officials that a settlement with the company was legal — but Wilson-Raybould wouldn't let her.

“Nice!” one group member captioned the article last week.

“Amazing,” “interesting,” wrote two people who shared the article in the 150,000-member group on the same late January day.

The article wasn’t from a medical news source, though, or even another anti-vaccine group. It came from a white supremacist website, Red Ice.

The anti-vaxxer movement, comprised of people who falsely believe vaccines are dangerous, is ascendant. In 2019, the World Health Organization named “vaccine hesitancy” one of the top 10 threats to global health, the first time it made the list. The movement is credited with contributing to ongoing measles outbreaks worldwide, including an outbreak of approximately 70 people in Washington state. But that’s not all it’s spreading. Like other conspiracy movements, the anti-vaxxer movement has rubbed shoulders with the far right.

New studies reveal vaccine skepticism to be a strong predictor for populist politics in Europe, where many populist candidates run on a hard-right line. And fringe media outlets are seizing on the sympathy from the anti-vax movement, pushing even more extreme conspiracy theories under the guise of vaccine skepticism.

White supremacist website Red Ice has churned out at least 100 articles and radio clips bashing vaccines in recent years. Links to those articles appear regularly in closed anti-vaxxer Facebook groups, a number of which boast more than 150,000 members. Unlike Facebook pages, which any user can read, these closed groups can be hotbeds of political activity and harassment, in which members coordinate attacks on pro-vaccine doctors and activists, as the Guardian reported.

Racist Rabbit Hole

Far-right news sites can find a serious audience in these highly active conspiracy communities. One 2017 Red Ice article has repeatedly made the rounds in large anti-vax groups, sometimes racking up more than 1,000 likes. Although the article skews right wing (it lauds a clip from the Tucker Carlson’s show) and alarmist (vaccines “can seriously injure your child”), it isn’t overtly white supremacist. But should anti-vaxxers chose to explore the rest of the site, they would find a white supremacist swamp, full of anti-immigrant and Islamophobic fear-mongering.

Most anti-vaxxers are not white supremacists, far from it. But the overlap can send some well-meaning parents down the rabbit hole. Far-right groups frequently engage in “entryism,” a tactic that involves seeding a sympathetic mainstream group with extremist ideology, then slowly radicalizing its members. The tactic works well in groups like the anti-vax community.

At their surface level, anti-vax claims tap into populist grievances with bipartisan support; in the U.S., where health care can be prohibitively expensive, vaccines are sometimes seen as an extension of well-moneyed pharmaceutical companies. But the world of conservative-leaning conspiracy sites take the claims further. Red Ice, Infowars, and their ilk build on the mistrust of pharmaceutical companies to claim vaccines are part of a world-domination scheme by a shadowy global elite. As these claims typically go, the conspiracy theory gets anti-Semitic, with white supremacists interpreting “elite” to mean Jewish people.

As anti-vax spreads into the internet’s fringes, it mingles with other far-right conspiracy theories.

Natural News, a right-wing conspiracy site with 2.9 million likes on Facebook, is one of the primary sources of anti-vaxxer content, according to The Atlantic. A recent anti-abortion article on Natural News accuses “the political Left in America” of advocating for child murder, and warns that government “vaccine enforcer” teams are about to start vaccinating children at gunpoint. In a 10,000-member Facebook group for those who believe certain people (usually blonde or red-headed) are a superior race unrelated to the rest of humanity, members offered a series of arguments against vaccination, including the claim that vaccinations constitute race-mixing.

Anti-Elite, Anti-Vaccine

But entryist techniques aren’t entirely to blame for the anti-vax movement’s right-wing streak. A pair of recent studies suggests anti-vaxxers tend to hold worldviews compatible with right-wing populism.

A March study by Australian researchers used a theory that tests for five character traits, including a person’s respect for “purity,” and their deference to authority. Anti-vax parents tested high for belief in purity (defined by researchers as “an abhorrence for impurity of body”) and low on respect for authority.

Conservatives typically score high on respect for purity and authority, while liberals score lower. But populist movements, including Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, borrow some of the left’s anti-authority language, casting themselves as anti-elite. On Facebook, anti-vaxxers might rage against the authority of pharmaceutical companies or school vaccination policies, but Trump is a less common target. (Trump has promoted anti-vax conspiracies, too, falsely claiming in 2014 that vaccines cause autism.)

“ The idea that we force someone to give up their liberty for the sake of the collective is not based on American values but rather, Communist. ” — Kelly Townsend, Republican anti-vaxxer in Arizona

Other conservatives have painted their anti-vax stances as anti-authoritarian by claiming vaccinations are communist. “The idea that we force someone to give up their liberty for the sake of the collective is not based on American values but rather, Communist,” Kelly Townsend, a Republican anti-vaxxer in Arizona’s state House, wrote in a Thursday Facebook post.

The trend is even clearer in Europe, where a study published in February in the European Journal of Public Health suggests “a connection between the rise of political populism and vaccine hesitancy.”

The study found an overlap between measles outbreaks in France, Greece, and Italy, and the rise of populist parties in those regions. In all three, more than 15 percent of respondents said they did not believe vaccines are effective. (Vaccination programs are most effective when at least 95 percent of the population is vaccinated.)

“It seems likely that scientific populism is driven by similar feelings to political populism – ie profound distrust of elites and experts by disenfranchised and marginalised parts of the population,” the study’s author wrote, according to the Guardian. A December 2018 investigation by the Guardian found similar overlap between populist votes and anti-vaxxers in the U.S. and Poland.

In Ireland, the merger of anti-vaxxer conspiracy and right-wing populism marches in the streets. Participants in Dublin “Yellow Vest” protests in January shouted anti-immigrant slogans while simultaneously protesting vaccines, Ireland’s Journal reported. The Yellow Vests, initially a French protest movement with support from the populist left and right, has taken on a more conspiratorial right-wing tone abroad, with Canadian and British Yellow Vests using the movement to push anti-immigrant rhetoric and the QAnon conspiracy theory. Members of right-wing extremist groups have marched in the Canadian and British demonstrations.

Some Facebook groups for Ireland’s Yellow Vest movement were “dominated by fringe conspiracy theory views and share debunked articles from untrustworthy news sources,” including false health claims about fluoride, the Journal reported.

Some of those health claims linked back to Awareness Act, a conspiracy site currently pushing the bogus claim about blondes and redheads belonging to a master race unrelated to the rest of humanity.

Eventually, all of it—the conspiracy theories, the skepticism of some unseen authority, the right-wing populism—coalesces. On Natural News, the American anti-vaxxer site with nearly 3 million likes, an article claims the government will start forcefully vaccinating children against their parents’ will.

The article, which argues against gun laws, has spent the past two days at the top of the Natural News site with a provocative title:

When you're planning a trip to Western Canada and the Canadian Rockies, scenic mountain ranges are probably the first things that come to mind and for good reason—they’re stunningly beautiful and impossible to ignore. But with so much nature and wildlife tucked within them, there’s much more to see if you travel through British Columbia and Alberta. Here are seven must-see wonders you won’t want to miss—plus a way to see them all. And don’t worry: Mountains will be on full display while you enjoy the other spectacular scenery.

1. Technicolor glacial lakes

Seeing lakes on a trip to the Rockies isn’t surprising, but the glacial-fed lakes found there are awe-inspiring because of their shockingly milky turquoise, iridescent blue and emerald hues. “Rock flour” (super-fine crushed sediment) is produced when rocks slide under the weight of glaciers, then it’s transported to rivers and lake as the glaciers melt, producing otherworldly water colors. For excellent examples of this natural phenomenon, explore Lake Louise and nearby Moraine Lake, Emerald, Peyto and Bow Lakes along the Icefields Parkway and Maligne Lake near Jasper. For a more intimate lake experience, stay at The Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge, which is located right on Lac Beauvert (which means “beautiful green” in French). When the light hits it just right, the lake has a gorgeous emerald hue. ​

2. Stargazing in Jasper

Dazzling night skies abound in the wilds of Canada, but stargazers are practically guaranteed a memorable experience in Alberta’s Jasper National Park. It’s the second-largest and most accessible designated dark sky preserve in the world, which means there’s little artificial light pollution to obscure the stellar night views. While glowing planets, the Milky Way and shooting stars are visible year-round, the best time to witness the mesmerizing purples, yellows, greens and reds of the aurora borealis (or Northern Lights) is from September through mid-May, especially on colder nights. To experience local astronomy events, visit during the Jasper Dark Sky Festival, held in October. No matter when you wander, brace yourself for awe-inspiring views.

3. 360-degree aerial views in Banff

Jaw-dropping scenery is a signature of Alberta, thanks to the majesty of the Canadian Rockies, but seeing them from above is a next-level experience on its own. Hop aboard the Banff Gondola and you’ll be treated to 360-degree skyline and forest views on the eight-minute ride up the side of Sulphur Mountain. The enclosed glass gondolas only hold four people, so you and three of your closest friends can enjoy views of the town, the Spray and Bow Valleys and yes, six spectacular Canadian Rocky Mountain ranges, as you climb to 7,486 feet above sea level. At the top of the peak, stretch your legs along the mountaintop boardwalk and trails, and explore the Above Banff interpretive center, which provides interactive educational exhibits.

4. Remarkable Western Canadian wildlife

Wildlife viewing might not be the first thing that springs to mind when you’re planning a trip to Western Canada, but the biodiversity here is enough to wow any animal lover. Keep your eyes open and you’ll likely spy soaring bald eagles, massive bighorn sheep, ospreys (sometimes called “sea hawks” or “fish eagles” with as much as a six-foot wingspan), nimble blacktail deer, elk, and even the occasional black and grizzly bears. Though less common, lucky wildlife watchers may spot moose (the largest member of the deer family), wolves and coyotes. Who knows? You could even be the first to snap a verified photo of the elusive Sasquatch, the mythic creature of North American folklore.

5. Mighty Pyramid Falls

British Columbia is home to some of the world’s most exciting waterfalls, thanks to forceful glacial melt. One such example, Pyramid Creek Falls, cascades in two dramatic drops totaling 300 feet, the lower of which fans out in the shape of a pyramid, hence the name. The falls (within the small Pyramid Creek Falls Provincial Park) aren’t accessible by car, and a hike should only be attempted by proficient and adventurous hikers. However, thanks to railroad tracks that exist near the base, rail passengers get an up-close view of the drama of the falls flowing under the tracks before joining the rushing North Thompson River.

6. Walk on the Athabasca Glacier

You can walk on ancient history, literally, with a visit to the Athabasca Glacier, part of the Columbia Icefield, the largest body of ice in the Canadian Rockies. Along the Icefields Parkway in the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks UNESCO World Heritage Site, stop at the ancient Athabasca Glacier, North America’s most accessible and most visited glacier. From there, hop aboard the Ice Explorer, an all-terrain vehicle designed to drive on the 10,000-year-old glacier. And if you’re brave enough, venture out on the Glacier Skywalk, where a glass-floored walkway more than a half-mile long reveals views of waterfalls, fossils and a bird’s eye view from 918 feet above the magnificent Sunwapta Valley. Plan your trip for the warmer months, since the Icefield Interpretive Centre is closed in the winter.

7. Experience the mystery of the Hoodoos

It’s probably no mistake that “hoodoo” rhymes with “voodoo” and serves to conjure up all sorts of mysterious tales about the unique rock and clay deposits formed after the end of the last ice age. Science tells us that these unusual geological wonders are formed by erosion caused by water, wind and frost, so all that remains of ancient rocks and sediment are the spire-like hoodoos. However, the Cree and Blackfoot traditionally believe that the spooky formations are fossilized giants who awaken at night to protect the land from invaders, while another piece of folklore holds that the “fairy chimneys” were naughty humans until a witch turned them to stone. Regardless, these beautiful, unusual natural formations that can range from several feet to several meters high (and in some cases much higher) are a sight to behold. They are visible from an accessible trail just a few minutes from downtown Banff, also near Kamloops, B.C., and within Alberta’s Drumheller Valley.

Getting there: A way to see them all

Seeing some of these breathtaking natural wonders can come with serious effort—to the tune of vigorous hikes, expert gear and meticulous planning. Fortunately, those who appreciate nature but prefer traveling in comfort and style can have the best of both worlds with the iconic Rocky Mountaineer passenger train. Three of the routes, including Journey through the Clouds, Rainforest to Gold Rush and First Passage to the West, wind through the Canadian Rockies by day and overnight at hotels, so you can see sights up close from the comfort of single-level SilverLeaf Service coaches that have oversized windows, or bi-level, glass-dome-enclosed GoldLeaf Service coaches. These coaches include an outdoor viewing platform and a separate dining room on the lower level where you’ll feast on gourmet meals. Onboard, hosts share local history throughout the journey and ensure guests don’t miss any key highlights.

All of the sights listed here are easy to experience when traveling with Rocky Mountaineer. For instance, on the Journey through the Clouds route, the train decelerates from its average 30-mile-per-hour speed so guests can get terrific photos of Pyramid Falls. Trains also pass by small hoodoos near Kamloops in British Columbia, and it’s typical to spot some of the West’s best wildlife from the comfort of your seat. The Banff Gondola can be accessed easily from town, while Banff’s impressive hoodoos are just a short drive away (if you add a rental car to your trip). Similarly, for an up-close view of the Athabasca Glacier, book a comfortable motorcoach and Ice Explorer tour of the Icefields Parkway. If you’re eager to witness the stars in Jasper, simply look up.

Are you ready to see it all? Start planning your Rocky Mountaineer adventure today, and get ready to experience all of Western Canada’s wonders with the ease and leisure of train travel.

Science writer Leigh Phillips's 2016 book Austerity Ecology and the Collapse-Porn Addicts was one of the most important, angry and inspiring books I read that year, a passionate argument for a high-tech just and sustainable world that celebrated materialism and comfort, rather than calling for a return to a world of three billion people scratching potatoes in the dirt; so when Phillips sent me a manuscript for his new book, The People's Republic of Walmart: How the World's Biggest Corporations are Laying the Foundation for Socialism last year, I dropped everything and read it, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since.

Phillips and his co-author, Canadian labour organiser Michal Rozworski, have outdone themselves with this volume.

The two are addressing themselves to the socialist calculation debate, which raged through Austrian economic circles a century ago, with market-focused economists like Ludwig von Mises arguing that it was technically impossible to calculate an efficient allocation of goods in a large, industrial society, and that markets alone -- as a kind of distributed calculation engine -- could solve the problem of getting goods to the people who could make best use of them.

Von Mises won the argument in the 1920s, but a funny thing happened on the way to the 2020s: we are now surrounded by companies and organisations that within the same order of magnitude as the Soviet economy at its apex, which undertake breathtakingly efficient allocations of goods and resources, and all without markets, running as command economies.

You've heard of these comparable-to-the-Soviet-Union command economies: Amazon. Walmart. The Pentagon. There are many more. Each one is an existence-proof of the idea that markets are not needed for mass-scale allocation. What's more, the counterexamples, like Sears -- which implemented internal markets at the insistence of an ideology-blinded libertarian CEO -- show that markets are much worse at allocating resources than the computational command economies used in other enterprises.

The upshot of this is that to the extent that the Soviet Union was crippled by inefficient allocation, that is no longer the problem it once was. It's that we can imagine something as efficient and convenient as Walmart or Amazon without CEOs, shareholders or exploited workers, bringing all the bounties of late-stage capitalism without its pathologies.

The upshot is that fully automated luxury communism isn't just science fiction: it's a going concern with real evidence on the ground.

Market purists argue that we must tolerate all the evils of markets -- exploitation, inequality, the endangering of our biosphere -- because markets are the only conceivable force that can accomplish efficient allocation in our highly technical world. Deep greens take them at their word and say, fine, let's get rid of technology and return to a kind of agrarian feudalism.

Both of them are buying into Thatcher's maxim that ""there is no alternative."" But Phillips and Rozworksi are proposing an alternative: bright green, high-tech societies where markets are useful tools for solving the odd problem, but where allocation is primarily accomplished by the preferred means of Jeff Bezos and Sam Walton, but to the benefit of the many, not the few.

It's an audacious and exciting vision, an excellent companion to other Jacobin books like Four Futures, the kind of thing with the power to start a new movement.

Highly recommended.

With milky bluish eyes and luxurious dark gray fur, this kitty looks like a plush toy. Merlin rose to internet fame thanks to his human parents Nathanial Green and Elliot Green, two visual artists that curated a visually stunning Instagram page dedicated to their beautiful pet, which has amassed 28k followers.

More Info: Instagram | Twitter | Website

The Greens first laid eyes on Merlin in 2017 at the Lynchburg Humane Society on their “Free Cat Friday.” And while it was love at first sight, Elliot admitted to Bored Panda Merlin hadn’t been his first choice. “It actually was my coworker that convinced me to go in–she had just adopted a beautiful kitten from there. Browsing through the site, Nathanial and I had our hearts set on a Siamese kitten, but by the time I got off work, they were all either on hold or already adopted.”

Not to be discouraged the couple continued their search. “The lady who had shown us around eventually noticed us indecisively meandering; she stopped to tell us that she had a favorite, but that he had some issues and was sick. She took us to the medical wing to show us this little kitten who was recovering from a head cold. When I was first told that he was blind, I was a bit worried. As a full-time student also working two jobs, I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to provide Merlin with the attention he needed. As soon as I got to hold him, I think it was pretty obvious that he was perfect.”

The Greens couldn’t be happier that they found Merlin, “He’s an affectionate cat that loves being acknowledged and held. He’s never destructive or petty, either,” said Elliot, “Because he was born blind, he really has no concept of fear and so he’ll attempt to jump off of pretty high places. He doesn’t hide or avoid people–he’ll run up to the door to meet us and climb all over guests sitting on the couch. His preferred place is on someone’s lap.”

That’s right this loving ball of fur can’t get enough of his human dads. “Anytime we sit on the couch or the bed, he jumps up and is ready to be cuddled. He loves having his face and ears scratched; we aren’t quite sure why, but he loves having the areas around his eyes massaged. If someone puts their hands up to his eyes or nose, he’ll usually awkwardly press into it as if he’s trying to push them away, but it’s his way of feeling loved,” said his other dad Nathanial

Looking at Merlin you can’t help but notice his unique features, that’s because he is a rare mixed breed of a Munchkin and a Persian cat, called a Napoleon. “It’s a pretty new breed–by new I mean 20 to 22 years,” explained his owner, “Napoleons are pretty small, but they’re able to move around as easily as normal sized cats. For the most part, they inherit the Persian’s physical characteristics.”

Merlin’s milky white-walker style eyes, however, are not a characteristic of his breed but due to his blindness. But even with his poor vision, his dad said this handsome guy still lives a full life. “Honestly, we forget that he has trouble seeing. When we first moved to our apartment, he definitely had trouble navigating, but he learns quickly and really knows how to own the space. His greatest recurring struggle is from our coffee table’s glass edges: Every now and then, he’ll jump or walk into it, but we think he’s learned. All he really cares about is where the food is and how far away it is from his dads.”

While his blindness hasn’t been an issue, Merlin did suffer from some other health issues, “For a while, he was having seizures, and we really couldn’t figure out why,” recalled Elliot, “Through some research and trying out alternatives, we learned that his food was causing it. We removed wheat from his diet, and he’s been perfectly content since then.”

Meet the Greens: “@nathanialtgreen (left) was born in Michigan and is an insanely talented keyboardist, designer, and communications specialist. He loves chicken and waffles and syrup on almost everything. Often times can be found reading about politics. @elliotgreen.co (right) is an art director, branding specialist, and photographer from Istanbul, Turkey. Lover of olive oil and Daniela Andrade. Often can be found admiring typefaces at target. Both met at Liberty University and eventually made their way to Nashville, TN. they got married last September and spend most of their time hanging out at Baja Burrito or 51st Deli!”

As a snuggly, social kitty, Merlin loves all living things, but sadly the feeling is not always mutual, “We’ve also learned–the hard way–that he’s easily dominated by other animals. Cats, in particular, tend to bully him. He never fights back, but we have seen him hiss a time or two. We have to keep a close eye on him around other animals. Other than that, he really is perfect!”

“Merlin loves watermelon, and since it’s Elliot’s favorite food, he gets it often”

Image credits: merlin.griffith

It’s easy to see why Merlin has become an internet sensation, but the Greens say it was never their intention. “We just started accumulating a lot of pictures on our phones and decided to share them with the world. It wasn’t an account we were regularly posting on, but when we did we made sure that it looked good. Honestly, Elliot was proud of the way his apartment looked at the time and thought Merlin was a good subject to help show it off,” said Nathanial.

Still, the response has been surprising, “Yea! Friends keep telling us that they see Merlin’s pictures all over–it’s just mind-blowing.”

This family couldn’t be more grateful for finding this little ball of joy and say they owe it all to shelters like the Lynchburg Humane Society, “We’re grateful for animal shelters and the selfless, essential work they continue to do.”

554,Empty,2019-02-28T23:42:43Z,Jhonattan Vegas shot a bogey-free 6-under 64 to take a two-stroke lead after the first round of The Honda Classic,"PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — A year ago at The Honda Classic, Jhonattan Vegas made seven birdies all week.

He’s off to a much better start this time.

Vegas made six birdies and no bogeys Thursday, shooting a 6-under 64 to open a two-stroke lead after the first round. Lucas Glover bogeyed his finishing hole for a 66, leaving him tied with Zach Johnson, Ernie Els and Ben Silverman — who went to college at nearby Florida Atlantic.

“Hit my irons the best I’ve hit them all year and I’ve always liked this golf course,” Vegas said. “It’s kind of one of those courses that I think suits me. You have to hit the ball well and you have to get around really well. And then I made a few putts.”

Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler and Sergio Garcia were in a large group at 67, and defending champion Justin Thomas shot 68 after an eventful day that saw him play the last eight holes without a 9-iron after it bent when he hit it against a tree.

“To feel like I gave quite a few back today and shoot 2-under par on this golf course, it’s great,” Thomas said.

Also at 68 was Sam Saunders, the grandson of golf legend Arnold Palmer. Saunders birdied all three holes in the famed “Bear Trap” stretch at PGA National, the run of holes 15 through 17 where a par 4 is sandwiched by a pair of par 3s that can be treacherous even without much wind.

Vegas made 12 bogeys last year at the Honda, along with three doubles and a triple, wound up beating only one of the 74 finishers and wrapped up the week with a final-round 78. He sprayed irons everywhere, missed half of the fairways, more than half of the greens.

But Thursday, he was dialed in — missing only three of 14 fairways and three of the 18 greens, needing only 29 putts to get through the day.

“I felt like I was in control pretty much all day long,” Vegas said.

The 34-year-old Venezuelan has three PGA Tour victories, winning the 2011 Bob Hope Classic and the RBC Canadian Open in 2016 and 2017.

Vegas took advantage on a day to make noise at PGA National, where the wind was down. And that’s not typical.

Forecasters correctly said breezes would be relatively light all day and should stay that way until perhaps the weekend, though Johnson — whose weather apps said breezes were going to be no more than 3 or 4 mph — was among those who felt the wind was still a factor and fluctuated more than expected.

“We had a stretch there on the front nine where it was a lot more than that,” Johnson said. “The ball curving with the wind, depending on the direction, easily 10 to 15 to 20 yards. And then we made the turn and it started to be more consistent, not as gusty. … It was not Honda wind. I don’t think we’re going to get Honda wind until Sunday.”

Els had no complaints.

Els has won more than 70 tournaments worldwide, 19 of them on the PGA Tour — the last of those coming in 2012 at the British Open. Getting a 20th on tour, he said, has been a goal for some time.

“Secretly on tour among the players, you know when you win No. 20 you get some benefits,” Els said. “It’s late in my career, but I’ll take any win now.”

Thomas sizzled at the start with three birdies in his first four holes, and made the turn at 4-under.

That’s when his day got eventful.

His drive ended up behind a tree on the 10th, and he figured that his 9-iron would snap on the follow-through of his approach shot. It merely bent instead, and the jolt of the impact meant Thomas was going to be spending some time Thursday night with an icepack on his wrist. He doesn’t believe it’ll impact him Friday.

“Just more of a shock than anything,” Thomas said.

Thomas then found his way into and out of trouble on the Bear Trap — making double-bogey, then having a par putt slide past the hole on 16, and making birdie on 17. He then birdied the last as well.

Garcia also finished strong, with three birdies in his last four holes.

“It’s a great round, at the end of the day,” Garcia said.

DIVOTS: Fowler went into the water twice and wound up making a triple-bogey on the par-4 sixth, his nemesis hole at PGA National.

The club is asking the city to extend its lease by an additional 18 years, from 2051 to 2069, at a cost of $870,000.

Craig Trendel, volunteer president of the Mayfair, said that the longer-term lease would allow the club to secure investment so it can move forward with renovations.

Monday, city council's executive committee heard from both interests: golf club shareholders and members of the public pushing to turn the land into public use.

Coun. Ben Henderson put forward a motion that the Mayfair match the lease the city now has with Highlands Golf Club, which opens the greens to public tee-off seven per cent of the total rounds of golf a year.

The city's last lease with Highlands dates back to 2006 and also runs until 2051.

""This isn't an ideal situation,"" Henderson noted. ""I think people are imagining that somehow, somehow or other the ability is there to turn back time, and we can't.""

""If we say 'no' outright, then there's a real chance that the asset can't be maintained.""

Scott Neufeld/CBC More

The Mayfair proposal includes a clause that would see the club offer ""public use of groomed ski trails located on the leased lands for the sole purpose of cross country skiing from December 1 to March 31.""

Trendel attended the committee meeting to show the club is transparent and willing to work with the city.

""It's about finding that right balance,"" he said. ""So I think we're close and I'm sure we'll get something that everybody can live with.""

He said that providing groomed cross-country skiing trails was ""not insignificant"" to the club's operations.

""There will be some investment — potentially some liability — we have to sort all those things out,"" Trendel said.

Henderson's motion also calls for the club to consider added amenities, like public washrooms for cross-country skiers.

The club boasts banquet rooms for rent and hosts some charity events throughout the year.

It hosted the CN Canadian Women's Open in 2013.

Mayor Don Iveson called the relationship with the club a mutually beneficial deal.

""Royal Mayfair Club has been a good partner and a good steward of the land,"" he said. ""It has worked with the city in good faith, for decades.""

Eric Gormley advocates for the land to be turned over to public control by the end of the current lease at 2051.

""Our main issue is it's not public, it's part of the river valley. The river valley is supposed to be for the public use for everybody.""

Like nearby Hawrelak Park, Gormley thinks the land could be used for festivals and recreation.

557,Empty,2019-03-01T02:40:20Z,He had six birdies and no bogeys for a 6-under 64 in the first round.,"Jhonattan Vegas said he hit his iron the best he has hit them all year as he took a two-shot lead at the Honda Classic.

A year ago at The Honda Classic, Jhonattan Vegas made seven birdies all week.

He’s off to a much better start this time.

Vegas made six birdies and no bogeys Thursday, shooting a 6-under-par 64 to open a two-stroke lead after the first round. Lucas Glover bogeyed his finishing hole for a 66, leaving him tied with Zach Johnson, Ernie Els, and Ben Silverman — who went to college at nearby Florida Atlantic.

‘‘Hit my irons the best I've hit them all year and I've always liked this golf course,’’ Vegas said. ‘‘It’s kind of one of those courses that I think suits me. You have to hit the ball well and you have to get around really well. And then I made a few putts.’’

Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler, and Sergio Garcia were in a large group at 67, and defending champion Justin Thomas shot 68 after an eventful day that saw him play the last eight holes without a 9-iron after it bent when he hit it against a tree.

‘‘To feel like I gave quite a few back today and shoot 2-under par on this golf course, it’s great,’’ Thomas said.

Also at 68 was Sam Saunders, the grandson of golf legend Arnold Palmer. Saunders birdied all three holes in the famed ‘‘Bear Trap’’ stretch at PGA National, the run of holes 15 through 17 where a par 4 is sandwiched by a pair of par 3s that can be treacherous even without much wind.

Vegas made 12 bogeys last year at the Honda, along with three doubles and a triple. But Thursday, he was dialed in — missing only three of 14 fairways and three of the 18 greens, needing only 29 putts to get through the day.

‘‘I felt like I was in control pretty much all day long,’’ Vegas said.

The 34-year-old Venezuelan has three PGA Tour victories, winning the 2011 Bob Hope Classic and the RBC Canadian Open in 2016 and 2017.

LPGA — No. 1-ranked Ariya Jutanugarn’s 10-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole gave her a 4-under 68 and a five-way share of the first-round lead at the HSBC Women’s World Championship in Singapore.

Tied with Jutanugarn were No. 3 Minjee Lee, Amy Olson, Yu Liu, and Celine Boutier, who won her first LPGA tournament three weeks ago at the Vic Open in Australia.

No. 2 Sun Hyun Park bogeyed 18 after hitting her approach into a bunker for a 69 to drop into a seven-way tie for sixth, one stroke behind the leaders.

After an eagle on the eighth, her second-last hole, Olson just missed a 30-foot birdie putt on the ninth hole.

‘‘I made a nice shot in, just perfect,’’ the American said of her second shot into the eighth.

Scoring conditions on Sentosa Golf Club’s Tanjong layout were difficult most of the day Thursday due to gusty winds and slick greens.

Former No. 1 Lydia Ko shot 72, as did Lexi Thompson and Cristie Kerr. Nelly Korda, who won the Women’s Australian Open two weeks ago, had 74. Brooke Henderson dropped four shots in two holes on the eighth and ninth and had a 75.

Defending champion Michelle Wie was forced to withdraw with a recurrence of a right hand injury.

Wie, making her second start of the season after surgery on her right hand earlier this month, was 10-over after 14 holes when she withdrew while playing the 15th. She was holding her right wrist and hand as she walked up the fairway.

Wie fractured her hand and sustained extensive neck injuries in a car accident two years ago.

The 29-year-old Wie played in last week’s LPGA Thailand tournament, where she finished tied for 23rd.

European — Kurt Kitayama kept up his impressive first season on the European Tour by shooting a 6-under 66 at the Oman Open in Muscat to take a one-stroke lead after the first round. After coming through all three stages of Q-School in November to earn a place on tour, Kitayama won the Mauritius Open on just his third start of the season.

He holed a 15-foot putt for eagle at the par-5 12th hole and rolled in four birdies in a bogey-free round at Al Mouj Golf Club.

‘‘I have a few more opportunities to play after my win,’’ Kitayama said. ‘‘It makes it easier to plan my schedule but it’s my first year and I want to see most of the courses to plan for next year.’’",Jhonattan Vegas takes two-shot lead at Honda,Bostonglobe.com,https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2019/02/28/jhonattan-vegas-takes-two-shot-lead-honda/jYpaiOJSwHjuXDmC47OSnK/story.html

Yet the big talking point in the lead-up to the first round was the absence of most of the game's biggest names from the tournament.

Only three among the top 20 in the world rankings are present - Justin Thomas, Brooks Koepka and Rickie Fowler - making it the weakest field in more than a decade.

Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are among those sitting out the event, even though they all live locally.

Honda began sponsoring the south Florida tournament in 1982 but this year, it comes coming directly after the WGC-Mexico Championship and only two weeks ahead of the Players Championship.

The Players, the most prestigious event outside the four majors, has switched from May to March, while the PGA Championship has moved from August to May.

The tour season will finish in late August, instead of late September.

The scheduling, however, appeared of little concern to Vegas who notched six birdies in benign morning conditions on Thursday.

""I was able to drive... really well today, hit my irons incredibly well,"" said the 34-year-old from Venezuela.

""I only missed three greens and of those I left two within 15 feet of the hole.

""Hitting those irons well to some of these tough pins makes the day a little bit easier. Wind wasn't that hard so you could be a little more aggressive than usual.""

Vegas, ranked 131st in the world, is a three-times PGA Tour winner.

He led by two strokes from South African Ernie Els, American Zach Johnson and Canadian Ben Silverman with half the field back in the clubhouse.

Honda, which began sponsoring the tournament in 1982, comes directly after the WGC-Mexico Championship and only two weeks ahead of the Players Championship, a run that is too much golf for many on the tour.

The Players, the most prestigious event outside the four majors, has switched from May to March, while the PGA Championship has moved from August to May.

The tour season will finish in late August instead of late September.

The scheduling was of little concern to Vegas who notched six birdies in benign morning conditions on Thursday.

“I was able to drive … really well today, hit my irons incredibly well,” said 34-year-old Vegas, who is ranked 131st in the world.

“I only missed three greens and of those, I left two within 15 feet of the hole.”

Veteran Els compiled six birdies for a share of second place with a round marred only by a double-bogey at the par-three 15th, where his eight-iron came up short and found the water.

The four-times major champion, now ranked 398th in the twilight of his career at age 49, said he enjoyed playing on a course with firm greens.

“They are not very receptive, even this morning, so going to get even firmer but I like that,” he said.

“It means you’ve got to hit it on the fairways. (The ball is) not going to stop out of the rough so I’m trying to hit fairways and then you’ve got to hit it properly to stay on the greens.”

Koepka and Fowler also started well, carding three-under 67, while defending champion Thomas shot 68.

German Alex Cejka was disqualified during his round for using greens reading material that did not fit the new scale.

560,Empty,2019-03-04T16:00:12Z,"""In the following essays, writers interrogate the complicated pasts of place through food, express nostalgia for long-gone homes, and find belonging by sharing meals.""","From second grade to eighth grade, cereal was my portal to the United States. Whenever my dad flew from where we lived in Indonesia to the U.S. on business, he’d bring a near-empty suitcase so he could fill it with Lucky Charms, Froot Loops, Captain Crunch, and whatever other colorful boxes caught his eye. When he came home, my brother and I would deliberate over which to open first, rationing ourselves. I treasured each bowl enough that once, when a gecko flung out of the box along with a kaleidoscopic pour of fruity pebbles, I simply brought the creature outside before dipping my spoon into the bowl.

The longer I lived in Indonesia, the less I remembered about life in the United States, even though others reminded me that the U.S. was “home.” Whenever I ate cereal, I imagined an alternate version of myself. The girl I envisioned lived at the end of a cul-de-sac in a brick house like that of my cousins. She wore outfits from Limited Too, a store I’d visited once during summer vacation. She somehow didn’t have braces or wear glasses. In imagining what I might be like if I lived in the U.S., I began to construct my own version of the country based on summer visits and foggy memories of early childhood. As a result, the U.S. became more artifice than reality, a place I imagined might absolve me of my complicated feelings about identity.

But my illusions about the U.S. were as sugary and insubstantial as the cereal I associated with the country; they dissolved as soon as I moved to Texas during my freshman year of high school. Once there, I realized that even though I spoke the language and looked the part, I felt different from my peers. As much as I wanted to feel at ease in the U.S., I found myself torn between the reality of the place where I lived – all cookie-cutter homes and gleaming aisles of grocery stores – and where I’d grown up. I felt homesick for Indonesia, a place I could never truly call home, privilege making thorny my presence there.

For years, I buried the feelings of loss that came along with leaving Indonesia and instead tried to forge different lives in the states I’ve lived since then. But, like the bowls of cereal of my past that once brought me back to a country I’d left behind, I was given a piece of Kopiko after a meal a couple years ago, and the even the sight of the wrapper was enough to transport me to my old house, one shaded by a rainbow eucalyptus trees and robust flower blooms. Food can be nostalgia embodied, a means of traveling to a place you wish you could return to, a way of bringing to life a memory. Candy in hand, I remembered wandering aisles of the outdoor market, where sounds became a kind of song: vendors chattering, pans clanging, someone calling nasi goreng! nasi goreng!, live birds chirruping from a small cage, knives whisking over metal sharpeners, chickens scuttling around table legs looking for scraps, and motorcycles chortling to life before whining down the road. For sale were tables of produce – spiky round rambutan, bundles of greens, starfruit stacked in precarious piles, shrink-wrapped mango, mounds of durian – slick bodies of fish gutted and chickens plucked clean of their feathers. Nothing went to waste. Blood was boiled down until it congealed, and intestines were arranged on plates like long tendrils of spaghetti.

Perhaps food isn’t a permanent means of returning to anywhere, but a taste can be enough to bring you home. In the following essays, writers interrogate the complicated pasts of place through food, express nostalgia for long-gone homes, and find belonging by sharing meals. As for me, when I put the Kopiko on my tongue, thousands of miles away, the blend of coffee and sugar resonated bittersweet, as it always had, before melting away.

I moved away from Maryland over 25 years ago, but if I don’t make it back to the state at least once a year for steamed crabs, I’m like a bird whose migration pattern has been disrupted. I’m unsettled in the world.

Back in Maryland after time away, Bill Addison digs into a pile of local crab while ruminating on the history, preparation techniques, best places to eat, and future of crab in Baltimore.

Sure, astronauts can gaze down at Earth and see its most beautiful spots—literally all of them—every 90 minutes. But those places are always out of reach, reminders of how far away sea level is. Having something nearby that photosynthesizes might cheer the crew.

A complex set of factors such as humidity, mold, and a host of other ecosystem variants makes growing plants in space a challenge. But far away from the comforts of home, astronauts have begun cultivating zinnias and lettuce on board, thanks to the work of scientist Gioia Massa and her team, who are part of an experiment called Veggie.

In search of a better future, Melissa Chadburn’s mother brings her family to northern California, where they “lived on saltines with peanut butter and beans from a can.” At fifteen, Chadburn is taken to a group home where her hunger is satiated, but she is treated as a case number rather than a child.

Only, for us, the explosions had already happened. The places we’d called home had been lit up and burned to the ground, with nothing left save for the blackened foundations of our past. We kids were screaming for love, for touch, for home.

7. Chop Suey Nation (Ann Hui, June 21, 2016, The Globe and Mail)

After a blogger wrote a post called “I can’t believe there’s a Chinese restaurant in Fogo,” Ann Hui, influenced by her family, for whom “food was an obsession,” sets out to drive across Canada to figure out how the restaurant owners decided to open shop in such an isolated location and why there’s a Chinese restaurant in nearly every Canadian town. Hui wrote a book, Chop Suey Nation, based on her article.

The name “chop suey” translates more or less into “assorted mix,” and refers to a repertoire of dishes mostly developed in North America in the mid-20th century. A mix of ideas both East and West and, to my eyes, frozen in time.

8. Farm to Table (Laura Reiley, April 13, 2016, Tampa Bay Times)

This is a story we are all being fed. A story about overalls, rich soil and John Deere tractors scattering broods of busy chickens. A story about healthy animals living happy lives, heirloom tomatoes hanging heavy and earnest artisans rolling wheels of cheese into aging caves nearby. Skeptical of the chalkboard menus touting local, organic ingredients in front of nearly every restaurant in Tampa, Laura Reiley stops at farms, contacts vendors, and “for fish claims that seemed suspicious, I kept zip-top baggies in my purse and tucked away samples” in order to determine the extent to which restaurant owners lie about obtaining ingredients from sources close to home.

He's off to a much better start this time.

Vegas made six birdies and no bogeys Thursday, shooting a 6-under 64 to open a 2-stroke lead after the first round. Lucas Glover bogeyed his finishing hole for a 66, leaving him tied with Zach Johnson, Ernie Els and Ben Silverman -- who went to college at nearby Florida Atlantic.

Editor's Picks Cejka DQ'd after greens book deemed too big Alex Cejka was disqualified at the 14th hole of the Honda Classic on Thursday when it was determined the book he was using to read the greens was too large.

""Hit my irons the best I've hit them all year and I've always liked this golf course,"" Vegas said. ""It's kind of one of those courses that I think suits me. You have to hit the ball well and you have to get around really well. And then I made a few putts.""

Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler and Sergio Garcia were in a large group at 67, and defending champion Justin Thomas shot 68 after an eventful day that saw him play the last eight holes without a 9-iron after it bent when he hit it against a tree.

""To feel like I gave quite a few back today and shoot 2 under par on this golf course, it's great,"" Thomas said.

Also at 68 was Sam Saunders, the grandson of golf legend Arnold Palmer. Saunders birdied all three holes in the famed ""Bear Trap"" stretch at PGA National, the run of holes 15 through 17 where a par-4 is sandwiched by a pair of par-3s that can be treacherous even without much wind.

Vegas made 12 bogeys last year at the Honda, along with three doubles and a triple, wound up beating only one of the 74 finishers and wrapped up the week with a final-round 78. He sprayed irons everywhere, missing half of the fairways and more than half of the greens.

But Thursday, he was dialed in -- missing only three of 14 fairways and three of the 18 greens, and needing only 29 putts to get through the day.

""I felt like I was in control pretty much all day long,"" Vegas said.

Vegas took advantage on a day to make noise at PGA National, where the wind was down. And that's not typical.

Forecasters correctly said breezes would be relatively light all day and should stay that way until perhaps the weekend, though Johnson -- whose weather apps said breezes were going to be no more than 3 or 4 mph -- was among those who felt the wind was still a factor and fluctuated more than expected.

""We had a stretch there on the front nine where it was a lot more than that,"" Johnson said. ""The ball curving with the wind, depending on the direction, easily 10 to 15 to 20 yards. And then we made the turn and it started to be more consistent, not as gusty. ... It was not Honda wind. I don't think we're going to get Honda wind until Sunday.""

Els had no complaints.

Els has won more than 70 tournaments worldwide, 19 of them on the PGA Tour -- the last of those coming in 2012 at the British Open. Getting a 20th on tour, he said, has been a goal for some time.

""Secretly on tour among the players, you know when you win No. 20 you get some benefits,"" Els said. ""It's late in my career, but I'll take any win now.""

Thomas sizzled at the start with three birdies in his first four holes, and made the turn at 4 under.

That's when his day got eventful.

His drive ended up behind a tree on the 10th, and he figured that his 9-iron would snap on the follow-through of his approach shot. It merely bent instead, and the jolt of the impact meant Thomas was going to be spending some time Thursday night with an icepack on his wrist. He doesn't believe it'll impact him Friday.

""Just more of a shock than anything,"" Thomas said.

Thomas then found his way into and out of trouble on the Bear Trap -- making double-bogey, then having a par putt slide past the hole on 16, and making birdie on 17. He then birdied the last as well.

Garcia also finished strong, with three birdies in his last four holes.

""It's a great round, at the end of the day,"" Garcia said.

Fowler went into the water twice and wound up making a triple-bogey on the par-4 sixth, his nemesis hole at PGA National. In his past four rounds at the Honda, he's 7 over on that hole.

Alex Cejka was disqualified for using an improper greens-reading device, officials said. He withdrew from last year's tournament and missed the cut in 2017.

Cody Gribble had an interesting day -- making quadruple-bogey on No. 6, triple-bogey on the par-4 11th, and then eagle on the par-5 18th. He shot a 77.",Vegas shoots 64 to take lead at Honda Classic,Espn.com,http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/26106833/vegas-shoots-64-take-lead-honda-classic

To better understand the current situation in our province, we’ve compiled a list of CBC Vancouver’s key coverage of the most important provincial news stories from the past few years. From historic handshakes to the housing crisis, these are the stories that shook B.C. and continue to send residual waves throughout the province to this day.



Historic Handshake: NDP-Green pact a first in Canadian history

On May 30, 2017, B.C. NDP Leader John Horgan and B.C. Green party Leader Andrew Weaver signed an agreement in Victoria aimed at creating a stable minority government, which ousted the B.C. Liberals after 16 years in power. This pact marks the first time in Canadian history the Greens and NDP have made such an alliance, enshrining it with a formal four-year co-operation agreement. Within this agreement, both parties pledged to work to stop the federally approved $7.4-billion Kinder Morgan pipeline project, which the Canadian federal government later announced its intent to acquire for $4.5 billion. To study up on the twists and turns that led to this major political shift go HERE.



BC Wildfires: how can we help before the fires begin to burn?

Last August, there were nearly 600 fires burning across British Columbia, blanketing the air with smoke. A provincial state of emergency was declared, affecting more than 20,000 people throughout the province. Unfortunately, summer in B.C. is starting to become defined by hazy skies and emergency air quality advisories. To cope with this new normal, scientists from across North America gathered in Vancouver to share what they’ve learned about how wildfire smoke is affecting our health and what they still need to figure out.

The arrest of Meng Wanzhou: Canada’s role in a violation of international sanctions

The arrest of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou ignited a firestorm of interest that saw media from around the world descend on Vancouver. As Meng awaits possible extradition to the United States to face charges of fraud and violating international sanctions against Iran, CBC has compiled a detailed report on Meng and the complicated path leading to her trial.

Housing affordability: rentals costs rise as housing market slows

Housing affordability remains, without question, one of the contentious topics of the provincial news cycle. While the housing market is slowing down, rental costs continue to skyrocket as availability dips below 1% and homelessness counts rise. There is a lot of blame to be passed around, including links to widespread tax evasion and money laundering.

In the book Poking a Dead Frog, Adam McKay talks about the types of characters he and Will Ferrell have been most often drawn to over the last 20 years: “They have no skills whatsoever, yet they’re completely entitled. Will and I are endlessly fascinated by this cockiness; it’s all just completely unearned. It’s not connected to any reality whatsoever. It’s free-floating. They’re not getting anywhere. They’re stuck and impotent. I find this to be one of the most fascinating things about America right now.”

It makes sense then why the comedy duo was immediately drawn to Fred Simmons, the overconfident Tae Kwon Do instructor played by Danny McBride in 2006’s Foot Fist Way, a self-made movie by college friends and film majors McBride, Jody Hill, and Ben Best.

McKay and Ferrell wanted to help the trio get their next project into production, and three years later the world met Kenny Powers, the brash relief pitcher turned gym teacher who was the central focus of Eastbound & Down.

February marked the ten-year anniversary of Eastbound’s debut, and while Powers was certainly a version of that unearned, Ferrell-esque American bravado, they found an unexpected better half to Powers. Many actors auditioned for the role of Stevie Janowski, a fellow teacher who becomes enamored with Powers in the pilot episode, but they also weren’t sure what to make of the character quite yet, and nobody who came in had inspired them enough to move forward. Then Steve Little, a former main company member at the Groundlings whose most extensive television work at that point had been as a voice on the Cartoon Network’s Camp Lazlo, came in and defined the character in a big way. Little’s presence was so key that Stevie would turn into much more than the small, two-scene role the pilot afforded him. He grew into something that would become as vital to the success of Eastbound as Powers would be.

“It was just those two scenes,” says Little, who figured that if they knew Stevie was going to be this important to the show, he would have had to audition a third time. “Then when we shot the pilot and Danny said, ‘You’re our secret weapon.’” In fact, Little says that Hill told him that they actually forgot to put a wedding ring on him in the pilot and that Stevie was supposed to have been married. “If they had made that choice, then everything would have changed. They had some story lines, like I was going to be in a Christian rock band, but it turned out differently.”

McBride once referred to Stevie as “a filthy, disgusting Don Knotts.” Seeing the pair play off of each other for four seasons — with the benefit of being on HBO, where Stevie can say things like “My dick’s all pruney from being up in that sweet punnany,” and give us moments like him shooting off his prosthetic chin or having Ferrell play a car-dealership owner-slash-racist plantation owner who sexually assaults Stevie while he’s dressed as a geisha — made Eastbound a unique addition to TV history. It’s been five years since the series finale, and Eastbound still projects an air of confidence in the bold choices it made; it feels as dangerous a comedy today as it was from 2009–2013. To mark the anniversary, we asked Little to walk us through his five favorite episodes of Eastbound & Down and the memories that came with doing pretty much any insane thing that was asked of him.

“Chapter 6” (Season 1, Episode 6)

In its simplest terms, the premise for Eastbound and its pilot episode would seem clear: An overly abrasive and vulgar former World Series hero washes out of Major League Baseball and must go back to his hometown to take a job as a P.E. teacher. But over the course of its first season, and culminating in the finale with a cliffhanger of an ending, it became clear that Eastbound was anything but predictable. “This show is a show about a guy who is teaching high school, but then it just becomes not that at all,” says Little. By the end of season one, Little’s character Stevie, a fellow teacher at the school, is revealed to be a guy who would do anything to be Kenny’s friend, including quitting his job to join him on his journey back to the big leagues — which Kenny reneges on, leaving Stevie jobless. Still, this does not deter Stevie from showing his allegiance by running through the school hallways tripping fire alarms to draw everyone into the parking lot.

“I remember reading the script and it said, ‘Stevie runs down the hallway setting off the fire alarms, reminiscent of Jules and Jim running through the Louvre,’” says Little, referring to the 1962 Truffaut film. “I’d never seen Jules and Jim, but I do remember feeling when I was reading it that they want something iconic. That was inspiring to read. I love that scene of running through the hallways.”

“Chapter 8” (Season 2, Episode 2)

Photo: HBO

If you didn’t realize how critical to the series Stevie was by the end of season one, it was immediately apparent in season two: Powers has moved to Mexico, but Stevie has tracked him down and become further obsessed with him. That includes having sex with a prostitute who Kenny also had sex with just to know what it was like, a moment that gave Little considerable anxiety while shooting because it was his first-ever sex scene. “It was nerve-racking to see how that would go,” says Little. “I don’t know what the acting approach is when you’re pretending to have doggy-style sex with a prostitute.”

After Kenny shoots Stevie in the leg because he mistakes him for a burglar — somehow maybe not the worst thing that Kenny has ever done to him — they spend most of the episode together. Stevie one-liners like “I didn’t know you hoes took credit cards until recently” and “You can see straight into the butthole and right into the pussy” stand out. Little notes that he’s often asked by people about how much is improvised. “It’s a mix,” he confirms. “I think that first one, ‘I didn’t know you hoes took credit cards,’ I think that Jody told me to say that. Then I think it might have been Jody or me who suggested the ‘butthole’ line.” He adds that the show would still be great with just the scripts themselves, but improv helped elevate it even more — especially considering the fact that he was improvising with the person who made the show. “I think that’s a key of improv maybe, to have the creator be in the scene.”

“Chapter 15” (Season 3, Episode 2)

McBride, Hill, and Best could not have known this when they were making the series because they had never planned on having a season four, but “Chapter 15” ends up serving as a wonderful midpoint to the 29-episode Eastbound. In a show famous for its moments of harmonious insanity, this episode ends with Kenny and Stevie, who is dressed as a geisha, running from cannonballs being fired by Will Ferrell’s Ashley Schaeffer at an 1800s-style plantation while Korean car salesmen watch in horror and drink Fanta. Schaeffer is attempting to murder Kenny and Stevie, and he’s already killed one person to show he’s serious. But the person who played that murder victim was in fact not an actor and apparently wasn’t afraid to tell Ferrell to slow down.

“In one of the early scenes, there’s two guys at the Kia dealership, Joey [Brinkley] and Jeff Seibenick, who was the editor, and they’re teasing me as I’m waxing the tires,” says Little. Seibenick was one of Eastbound’s lead editors and had been given a role, but had just quit smoking, which added to his nerves, says Little — so they switched and gave his lines to Brinkley, who was the husband of David Gordon Green’s nanny. “He was a real southern dude, shooting guns and stuff. David liked Joey so much that he put him in the scene with all the Korean car salesman.” Little says that despite his lack of experience, Brinkley was pretty bold on set. “Joey a couple times told Will Ferrell to wait and not step on his lines. So you’ve got this guy who has never acted before, he has no lines then has some lines, the next day he’s acting with Will Ferrell. And then at brunch the next day, Danny and David decided that he needs to die from the cannonball to raise the stakes for Stevie and Kenny. A nonactor. You would think that anybody would let Will Ferrell go and do your thing, but Joey wasn’t like that.” (In a deleted scene, you can see Brinkley tell a story about duck hunting to Ferrell and the Korean car salesmen at dinner.)

“Chapter 20” (Season 3, Episode 7)

Photo: HBO

Building toward the end of season three, tensions are heightened when Stevie’s wife, Maria, leaves him after he cheats on her, which prompts him to go to the extreme length of shaving off all the hair on his head as a way to punish himself. But Hill was considering an even bigger conclusion to that scene. “From what I remember, Jody asked if I’d do a nude scene where they wanted me to come out after shaving my head,” says Little, “and I’m completely naked and completely shaved and I make myself a drink or something. Jody wanted me to say ‘What’s going on?’ to Kenny and then vomit on my dick. And then Kenny Powers says, ‘Nothing, just watching you vomit on your dick.’ But I didn’t do that.”

In “Chapter 20,” Stevie decides to wear a wig and fake eyebrows while attempting to win back Maria, but the wig is ripped off of his head and he freaks out, a moment inspired by the cult classic Canadian kids’ movie The Peanut Butter Solution, says Little. “I remember shooting that scene, and we were worried about the light and trying to go fast and just putting marshmallow goo on my head to make sure that it registers on camera. Looking back, it’s just such an absurd moment: that we have to make sure there’s enough marshmallow on this man’s head, that the audience knows why this man’s screaming. And why did Stevie use so much wig glue anyway?”

“Chapter 29” (Season 4, Episode 8)

Photo: HBO

As far as series finales go, Eastbound & Down did what it was always best at: showing fantastical, heightened versions of TV, which in this case meant borrowing from the Six Feet Under method of flash-forwarding ahead to its characters’ lives. Kenny and April get married and have two kids; the kids grow up and are portrayed by Lindsay Lohan and Alexander Skarsgård. April is shot in the chest and murdered by muggers; Kenny shoots them both dead. Kenny rides a hoverbike into an African village, where he marries a woman and has a bunch of kids and then dies of a heart attack. An older, futuristic Stevie, alongside Lohan and Skarsgård, go there for his Viking funeral. But the show found a way to have its fun while staying grounded in reality, revealing that Kenny is just writing the ending to his screenplay..

“I picked this episode because it’s so insane and such a bold leap,” Little says. “I auditioned for this part where there’s two scenes on the show, and here I am five years later and I’m wearing this space outfit, with those LeVar Burton glasses across my eyes, with Lindsay Lohan and Alexander Skarsgård. Just looking at that journey, it’s really kind of insane.”",Steve Little Walks Us Through His Top 5 Eastbound & Down Episodes,Vulture.com,http://www.vulture.com/article/steve-little-best-eastbound-and-down-episodes.html

Vegas hit the ball with metronomic efficiency to card a bogey-free six-under-par 64 at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens in south Florida.

The Venezuelan had a two-shot advantage over a trio of major champions in Ernie Els, Zach Johnson and Lucas Glover, along with Canadian Ben Silverman.

Yet the big talking point in the lead-up to the first round was the absence of most of the game’s biggest names.

Only three among the top 20 in the world rankings are present — Justin Thomas, Brooks Koepka and Rickie Fowler — making it the weakest field in more than a decade.

Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are among those sitting out the event, even though they all live locally.

A number of big events both before and after the Honda Classic has left the longest title sponsor on the PGA Tour facing a problem not of its making.

Honda, which began sponsoring the tournament in 1982, comes directly after the WGC-Mexico Championship and only two weeks ahead of the Players Championship, a run that is too much golf for many on the tour.

The Players, the most prestigious event outside the four majors, has switched from May to March, while the PGA Championship has moved from August to May.

The tour season will finish in late August instead of late September.

The scheduling was of little concern to Vegas who notched six birdies in benign morning conditions on Thursday.

“I was able to drive... really well today, hit my irons incredibly well,” said 34-year-old Vegas, who is ranked 131st in the world.

“I only missed three greens and of those I left two within 15 feet of the hole.”

Veteran Els compiled six birdies for a share of second place with a round marred only by a double-bogey at the par-three 15th, where his eight-iron came up short and found the water.

The four-times major champion, now ranked 398th in the twilight of his career at age 49, said he enjoyed playing on a course with firm greens.

“They are not very receptive, even this morning, so going to get even firmer but I like that,” he said.

“It means you’ve got to hit it on the fairways. (The ball is) not going to stop out of the rough so I’m trying to hit fairways and then you’ve got to hit it properly to stay on the greens.”

Koepka and Fowler also started well, carding three-under 67, while defending champion Thomas shot 68.

German Alex Cejka was disqualified during his round for using greens reading material that did not fit the new scale.",Golf: Vegas leads as big names steer clear of Honda Classic,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-honda-idUSKCN1QH2S4

They are often self-congratulatory, bombastic, and, let’s face it, boring. However, it pays to listen closely because there are times when even an ordinary speech can take a sudden turn and leave the audience wondering whether they heard correctly.

Some speakers, given an opportunity to have their say, make the most of it and decide to let the audience know exactly what is on their mind. Rather than offering easy-to-digest platitudes, the following people chose to use their time at the podium to “put the boot in,” which, if you’re unfamiliar with the expression, essentially means to cruelly, mercilessly attack someone.





10 Charles Spencer At Princess Diana’s Funeral



When Earl Spencer stood up to speak at his sister’s funeral, he appeared to be quite calm. Or as calm as anyone could be with half the world watching. He began his speech by talking about the shock of Princess Diana’s death and the sorrow that people who knew her felt, all of which seemed entirely conventional and uncontroversial.

He praised her compassion, her sense of duty, and her “natural nobility.” This was the first hint of what was about to come, because Diana’s in-laws (with their presumed unnatural nobility) were sitting on the front row, and millions of people were watching their reactions.

For the next five minutes, they had to nod solemnly while he ripped into them in his genteel English manner. He said, “Genuine goodness is threatening to those at the opposite end of the moral spectrum,” and though he didn’t specify who “those” at the opposite end of the spectrum were, everyone listening could take a pretty good guess. He “pledged” himself to protect her sons, saying, “We will not allow them to suffer the anguish that used regularly to drive you to tearful despair.”[1]

Finally, he finished his speech with the words, “I pledge that we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue the imaginative and loving way in which you were steering these two exceptional young men, so that their souls are not simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned.”

Ouch.



9 David Trimble’s Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance Speech

In 1998, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded jointly to John Hume and David Trimble “for their efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland.” John Hume was the Catholic leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, while Trimble was the Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, and they had both been working tirelessly on the Good Friday Agreement to bring peace to their country.

If you win the Nobel Peace Prize, it might be assumed that you are a peaceful sort of guy. We might reasonably expect Nobel acceptance speeches to talk about “unity,” “acceptance,” or “tolerance.” And you are expected to keep on saying it. But when David Trimble jointly won a Nobel Peace Prize, he decided to go with something different. His speech seemed to be remarkably, well, grumpy.

The trouble started with, “It is a truth universally understood that there is no such thing as a free lunch. That being so, John and I are obliged to sing for our supper. In short some expect us to speak . . . ” Considering that he had just shared a million-dollar prize, it seemed a little churlish to be annoyed when asked to speak while accepting it.

The speech also ended on a less-than-hopeful note: “But common sense dictates that I cannot for ever convince society that real peace is at hand if there is not a beginning to the decommissioning of weapons [ . . . ] Any further delay will reinforce dark doubts about whether Sinn Fein are drinking from the clear stream of democracy, or is still drinking from the dark stream of fascism. It cannot for ever face both ways.”[2]

Trimble’s speech in Oslo caused widespread anger at home, which was compounded when he later called Southern Ireland “a pathetic, sectarian State.”





8 Frederick Douglass On The Fourth Of July

Frederick Douglass was a former slave, political activist, and public speaker. He had a prominent role in the abolitionist movement during the Civil War, and he continued to speak for human rights until he died in 1895.

In one of his most famous speeches, delivered on July 5, 1852, he posed the question, “What to the slave is the Fourth of July?” And then he answered it:

[It is] a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy — a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.[3]

That’s telling it like it is.

After the abolition of slavery, Douglass continued to campaign for civil rights. He died of a heart attack on his way home from a women’s suffragist meeting in 1895. Douglass toured America giving speeches about civil rights. The Fourth of July speech received a rousing reception and was repeated often, becoming his most famous.

7 Noel Botham On The Death Of Hughie Green

Noel Botham was a journalist and biographer with an eye for the main chance. In 1997, when he was asked to speak at the funeral of Hughie Green, a popular TV presenter, he must have seen it as a great publicity opportunity, which is nice.

He stood up in front of Green’s family, including his children and grandchildren, and spoke about Green’s four mistresses and numerous love children, one of whom was now one of the most famous faces in British television. Botham claimed that Hughie Green had known and approved of the speech that he was going to give at the funeral.[4]

Although Botham did not name the famous love child at the funeral, he later accepted £100,000 from a newspaper to reveal that it was Paula Yates, the former wife of Live Aid organizer Bob Geldof. Yates had recently suffered the loss of her new fiance, INXS singer Michael Hutchence.

Paula Yates was distraught at the revelation. She never recovered from the hurt of finding out, and the news was thought to have contributed to her death from a heroin overdose in 2000.

6 Nikita Khrushchev On Josef Stalin

When the newly appointed Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, addressed the 20th congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1956, the audience was more than a little nervous. There had not been a congress since their previous leader, Josef Stalin, had died, and no one knew quite what to expect.

Certainly, no one could have predicted what Khrushchev did. In a closed session, Khrushchev denounced Stalin, his crimes, and the imprisonment, torture, and execution of party members. He said, “Stalin acted not through persuasion, explanation, and patient cooperation with people, but by imposing his concepts and demanding absolute submission to his opinion. Whoever opposed this concept or tried to prove his viewpoint, and the correctness of his position—was doomed to removal from the leading collective and to subsequent moral and physical annihilation.”

He went on to talk about the dangers of the “cult of the individual.” Stalin, whose image had been everywhere during his reign, had confused loyalty to the party with loyalty to the leader of the party and punished anyone who disagreed with him. Khrushchev added, “Stalin originated the concept enemy of the people. This term automatically rendered it unnecessary that the ideological errors of a man or men engaged in a controversy be proven; this term made possible the usage of the most cruel repression, violating all norms of revolutionary legality, against anyone who in any way disagreed with Stalin, against those who were only suspected of hostile intent . . . ”[5]

His audience sat stunned, not daring to move or even look at each other while Khrushchev talked for four hours. They were too stunned, or perhaps frightened, to applaud, and Khrushchev left the stage to deafening silence.

Though the speech had been made in closed session, it was somehow leaked to the media, and Stalinism was officially over.







5 Ann Widdecombe On Michael Howard

In 1997, it was well-known in British political circles that the prisons minister, Ann Widdecombe, had a difficult relationship with her boss, Michael Howard. Widdecombe was also known to be extremely plain-speaking. So, when the two clashed in Parliament over the sacking of the head of the prison service, the House of Commons was packed with MPs who wanted to see the show. Widdecombe said the sacking was “unjustly conceived, brutally executed, and dubiously defended,” which seems to be fairly mild parliamentary language.

However, Michael Howard took exception and began a smear campaign against his former junior, implying that she had been having an affair with the head of the prison service. Widdecombe, who had famously stated that she was a spinster and a virgin, was incensed. The warring colleagues appeared on a news program, where Mr. Howard was challenged 14 times about the sacking of the prisons officer, but he refused to answer.

The following week, the two met again in the House of Commons, and this time, it was packed not just with MPs but also with members of the press. Widdecombe alleged that there were at least three occasions when Howard had deliberately misled Parliament. She spoke for 45 minutes, famously ending with the statement that there was “something of the night” about Michael Howard, a phrase which followed him around for the rest of his career, which was brief.

He made a bid for the leadership of the Conservative Party a short time later and came last in the vote.[6]

4 Nellie McClung On Universal Suffrage

Nellie McClung was a Canadian suffragist. Her political activism began when she joined the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, campaigning against alcohol abuse. In 1912, she became a founding member of the Political Equality League.

She and her fellow members staged a mock parliament which held a debate satirizing the dangers of allowing men to vote. McClung mocked a speech that had been made by Manitoba’s premier, Rodmond Roblin, saying, “Man has a higher destiny than politics,” and that his responsibility was to look after his family. After all, he couldn’t be earning money if he was bothering himself with the affairs of the day.[7]

The speech was an instant success, producing howls of laughter from women who recognized the arguments that had been used against them, but despite appeals to Roblin, who seemed not to enjoy being mocked, he refused to back the idea of women’s suffrage.

In 1915, Roblin’s government collapsed. McClung agreed to make a speech in support of Tobias Norris in return for his support on votes for women. In it, she said, “I am not here to beg a favour but to obtain simple justice. Have we not brains to think? Hands to work? Hearts to feel? And lives to live? Do we not bear our part in citizenship? Do we not help to build the empire? Give us our due!”

Norris’s party was elected, and women were granted full suffrage.

3 Alexander The Great To His Army

Alexander the Great was an outstanding military leader. He had led his army undefeated for ten years, but on the eve of the Battle of the Hydaspes in India, he learned that his men were worried about the overwhelming odds against them.

And, as all great leaders do, Alexander confronted the issue head-on. He began in conciliatory terms, “I observe, gentlemen, that when I would lead you on a new venture you no longer follow me with your old spirit. I have asked you to meet me that we may come to a decision together: are we, upon my advice, to go forward, or, upon yours, to turn back?”

No one spoke.

He went on to list their achievements over the last ten years, pointing out the lands they had conquered, and then questioned their courage: “Are you afraid that a few natives who may still be left will offer opposition? Come, come! These natives either surrender without a blow or are caught on the run—or leave their country undefended for your taking.”

More uncomfortable silence.

He finished by saying, “I could not have blamed you for being the first to lose heart if I, your commander, had not shared in your exhausting marches and your perilous campaigns; it would have been natural enough if you had done all the work merely for others to reap the reward. But it is not so. You and I, gentlemen, have shared the labor and shared the danger, and the rewards are for us all. The conquered territory belongs to you [ . . . ] whoever wishes to return home will be allowed to go, either with me or without me. I will make those who stay the envy of those who return.”[8]

They all stayed. And they won. It was Alexander’s last great conquest.

2 Geoffrey Howe’s Resignation Speech

Geoffrey Howe served as the finance minister under Margaret Thatcher’s government and was once considered to be one of her most loyal colleagues. However, they’d had several disagreements, and he suddenly found himself frozen out of Thatcher’s inner circle.

Howe was famously considered to be a mild-mannered man. One opponent described his political attacks as having the ferocity of “being savaged by a dead sheep.” So, when Geoffrey Howe rose to make his traditional resignation speech in 1990, his colleagues could not have anticipated that he was about to bring down Margaret Thatcher completely.

He began his speech in conventional form, summing up his long career as an MP and a cabinet minister. But then he began to talk about Thatcher, her attitude toward the European Union, and the way that she conducted meetings: like a tyrant ignoring the advice of her cabinet. He claimed that she was hampering her colleagues’ ability to negotiate with Europe, saying, “It is rather like sending your opening batsmen to the crease only for them to find, the moment the first balls are bowled, that their bats have been broken before the game by the team captain.”[9]

The speech blew the Conservative Party apart. Before long, knowing she was going to lose a leadership challenge, Margaret Thatcher resigned.

1 Ferenc Gyurcsany And The Oszod Speech

Ferenc Gyurcsany’s mother probably told him that honesty was the best policy. Which it is. Most of the time. However, when the Hungarian prime minister stood up to address his party in closed session in 2006, he might have done well to consider that other well-known proverb about discretion and valor.

Gyurcsany began his speech conventionally enough but soon moved into dangerous territory. Perhaps he had always intended to be so honest, or perhaps he got carried away in the heat of the moment. Talking about the political and economic situation in his country, he said, “We have f—ed it up. Not a little but a lot. No European country has done something as boneheaded as we have. It can be explained. We have obviously lied throughout the past one and a half to two years. It was perfectly clear that what we were saying was not true.”

And then, he went on, “We did not do anything for four years. Nothing. You cannot mention any significant government measures that we can be proud of . . . ”

He ended his speech on a note which turned out to be prophetic. “Divine providence, the abundance of cash in the world economy, and hundreds of tricks, which you do not have to be aware of publicly, have helped us to survive this. This cannot go on. Cannot.”[10]

A tape of the meeting was leaked to the press, which caused riots in the streets by all those citizens who had been lied to, followed, a few weeks later, by a landslide defeat for his party in elections. Gyurcsany himself, however, remained in politics and even survived a no confidence vote on his leadership.

Perhaps, after all, honesty does pay.

Vegas teed off on the 10th and played the tough back nine in four-under.

He rolled in three birdie putts from 14 feet or more, drilling a 16-footer at the par-three seventh.

But he said his iron play was the real key to his round, which put him two strokes in front of a quartet of players on 66 that included three major champions in Ernie Els, Zach Johnson and Lucas Glover along with Canadian Ben Silverman.

World number four Brooks Koepka headed a group of 13 players on 67 that also included Spain's Sergio Garcia, American Rickie Fowler, South African Charl Schwartzel and South Korean Lee Kyoung-hoon.

Defending champion Justin Thomas was in another big group on 68.

""Every time I come around this place and don't make a bogey it's pretty good,"" Vegas said of the Jack Nicklaus-designed course.

""I was able to drive the ball really well today. I hit my irons incredibly well.

""I only missed three greens and out of those three I left two within 15 feet of the hole.""

Els, 49, and seeking to take his tally of PGA Tour titles to a round 20, overcame a double-bogey five on the par-three 15th, where he was in the water off the tee.

""That freaking 15th hole is no good at all on this golf course,"" quipped Els, who countered with six birdies. That included a birdie at his penultimate hole, the eighth, where he stuck his approach less than three feet from the pin.

""I've really been swinging it better lately and this is a golf course where you get it anywhere under par and you're really happy, even in benign conditions like this morning,"" Els said.

Els, who claimed his 19th and most recent PGA Tour title with his victory in the 2012 Open Championship, admitted the idea of No 20 was appealing, but said he wouldn't get ahead of himself.

""Obviously 20 is a great number,"" he said.

""It's late in my career, but I'll take any win now. I'm not thinking about it. I'm just thinking about tomorrow's round and so forth. But it would be magic.""

570,Empty,2019-03-02T05:45:15Z,South Korean Im Sung-Jae shared the Honda Classic halfway lead with American Keith Mitchell on the Champion course at PGA National.,"Miami - South Korean Im Sung-Jae, aiming to parlay his Web.com tour dominance to PGA Tour success, shared the Honda Classic halfway lead with American Keith Mitchell on Friday.

Im, 20, fired a six-under par 64 on the Champion course at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, for a 36-hole total of six-under par 134.

He was tied atop the leaderboard with Mitchell, who posted a 66, with 2009 US Open champion Lucas Glover a shot back on 135 after a 69.

Im, who won twice and led the money list all season in dominating the developmental Web.com tour last season, birdied three of his first four holes and three of his final six on the way, his six-under effort tied for best round of the day.

""All the shots that I wanted to hit turned out the way I wanted,"" said Im, who hit five approach shots to within 12 feet of the pin.

""So it led to a lot of birdies, and I was able to convert a lot of my birdie opportunities. I think that's what led to a successful round today.""

Canadian Adam Svensson also posted a 64 to land on 136, sharing fourth place with eight other players in a group that included 2018 PGA Tour Player of the Year Brooks Koepka (69), New Zealand's Danny Lee (67) and Sweden's Freddie Jacobson (67).

A total of 42 players were within five shots of the lead.

Defending champion Justin Thomas made the cut on the number with a four-over par 74 for a two-over total.

Im, the youngest of the US tour's rookies this season, went off in the first group of the day at 6:45 a.m. and made a quick move with birdies at the second third and fourth holes.

He would add three more before his lone bogey of the day at 16, and he drilled a 25-foot birdie putt at the 18th to cap his round.

Mitchell had five birdies and a bogey in his four-under effort, and after three missed cuts on the tour's West Coast Swing was delighted to be playing on the Bermuda grass greens of Florida.

""I grew up on Bermuda. I know how to putt it,"" he said. ""I know how to read it. It's definitely helped a lot.""

Thomas's hopes of a repeat title on the Jack Nicklaus-designed course faded with his four-over effort, during which he struggled with a ""dead arm"" as well as his concentration.

Thomas, who felt a stinging sensation in his right arm when his nine-iron scraped a tree on a shot on Thursday, said the arm still didn't feel right.

""Just feels like it kind of needs to get popped,"" he said. ""Just doesn't have a lot of strength.""

By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)

It’s Not Real; It’s Puccini: People often suspend realism. In the movie “Spiderman” the hero swings through the canyons of Manhattan using threads of “spider silk” he attaches from building to building as he travels down the street. In Puccini’s La Boheme, the leading lady sings a beautiful aria on her death bed, in the last stages of consumption, tuberculous filling her lungs will bodily fluids. The realist may say that is not possible. The opera buff may respond it’s not real; it’s Puccini.

Human imagination is boundless.

Unfortunately, many scientists, commentators and politicians expect other physicists and commentators to suspend realism when examining climate science produced by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and other reports from similar organizations. Critical thinking is not welcome.

For example, 40 years of calculations from comprehensive satellite data show that the atmosphere is warming modestly, but not over the Antarctic. The calculations are verified using temperature measurements by different instruments in weather balloons, taken over a part of the atmosphere. The greenhouse effect occurs in the atmosphere. The temperature trends in the atmosphere include effects of all greenhouse gases, such as changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor occurring from natural El Niño events.

The IPCC, etc. use surface temperatures, which are not comprehensive and include many other influences such as urbanization and change in land use. Surface temperature trends show a far greater warming rate than atmospheric trends. The IPCC, etc. claim that the primary cause of surface warming is carbon dioxide and that it is dangerous for humans. The advocates of dangerous warming have not produced a substantiated foundation, a tested hypothesis that demonstrates how a minor warming of the atmosphere causes a far greater warming of the surface. Further, the models they use predict a pronounced warming of the upper troposphere above the tropics, a “tropical hot spot.” Observations by balloons, and satellites show that it’s simply not there. It is as if the Climate Establishment is saying about their work: it’s not physics, it’s climate science!

********************

Will Happer – Realist: President Trump did the unthinkable for many. He appointed a distinguished physicist, William Happer, to a committee being formed to review the security risks to the nation from climate change. Readers may recall that TWTW has suggested that the threat assessments are dubious at best. They lack critical thinking. Fort Eustis, VA, on the James River, is listed as one of the military facilities most at risk from sea level rise caused by global warming. The tidal gages in the area show that sea levels are not rising by an unusual extent.

But, the entire area of Norfolk / Newport News, which is on the low coastal plane, is sinking. Land subsidence is occurring, primarily from ground water extraction from two major wells which are forming clear funnels that show subsiding land centered on these wells. One well is at West Point on the York River about 30 miles northeast of Fort Eustis. The other well is in Franklin, Virginia, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Eustis. A cost-effective alternative for water may be to replace these wells with one or two desalination plants similar to that employed in Carlsbad, CA, using prefiltration technology developed in Israel.

When the appointment of Happer was announced, the global warming chorus roared – how dare the president appoint a physicist who may question the threat assessments by experts. The noise may be reminiscent of the uproar the occurred when President Reagan dared question the assessments of the experts who considered that the Soviet economy was comparable to that of the US, including the first US Nobel laureate in economics. After the Soviet economy collapsed, the critics of Reagan forgot their previous economic assessments.

A sample of the response to Happer can be found in an editorial in Science Magazine written by a journalist for an environmental news service, E & E News.

“William Happer, a prominent opponent of climate science in the Trump administration, is heading a new White House effort to downplay the national security risks posed by climate change.”

“Happer, who is not a climate scientist, has rejected mainstream climate science for years. He routinely says that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and that the world could burn more fossil fuels without harm. Happer heads a group called the CO2 Coalition, which advocates for a rejection of climate science, and he has said the world is in a ‘CO2 drought.’”

“’Frankly, it’s insulting to those in the intelligence community and those who are in our science agencies,’ [Francesco] Femia [co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security] said. ‘Within the Pentagon and within the intelligence community, there are a lot of people who are evidence-driven, fact-driven, science-driven patriots, and they see a risk and they begin to put that into their analysis because they know if you don’t do so, you’re going to have a blind spot on security. And that’s never a good thing.’”

Such comments prompt a response such as, “Why do these evidence-driven, fact-driven, science-driven patriots ignore atmospheric temperature trends, where the greenhouse gas effect occurs?” And “What is fact-based about claims of exponential sea level rise, increasing sea levels by an ever-increasing rate?”

But, perhaps the most pointed response came from physicist Luboš Motl in his blog, The Reference Frame, when addressing political comments by former mayor Michael Bloomberg and Senator Chuck Schumer:

“Can’t they see that Happer clearly knows more about these matters – especially the absorption of electromagnetic radiation (the greenhouse effect is an example) and the relative CO2 famine in the present – than they and their Senate clubs and aides combined? Bullying of a scientist by a politician is the right word here.”

This goes to the core. The enormous benefits of carbon dioxide fertilization are well-documented, substantiated by experiments and real-world observations, but ignored by the IPCC and the climate chorus. Worse, the IPCC, etc. have produced a distorted version of the absorption and reemission of electromagnetic radiation (the greenhouse effect). See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy, Defending the Orthodoxy, Changing Seas, and Other Scientific News.

********************

The Greenhouse Effect: this is the first in a series on the greenhouse effect as it is being measured in the atmosphere.

Greenhouse gases are nearly transparent to sunlight but partially opaque to thermal radiation from Earth’s surface and atmosphere. The greenhouse effect is a predicted warming of the surface and lower atmosphere and a cooling of the stratosphere and upper atmosphere as the concentration of greenhouse gases increases. The most important greenhouse gas is water vapor, H2O. Carbon dioxide, CO2, is of lesser importance. Nitrous oxide, N2O, and methane, CH4, make only minor contributions to greenhouse warming. The most abundant gases in the atmosphere, nitrogen, N2, and oxygen, O2, are not greenhouse gases since they are nearly transparent to both sunlight and thermal radiation. There is no doubt that the greenhouse effect exists, but there is considerable uncertainty about how large it is.

Many economic models show that small warming of any kind will benefit the Earth, for example, by lengthening growing seasons and by lessening human mortality due to extreme cold. Separately, increasing concentrations of CO2 have enormously positive effects on the growth of crops and forests. Greening of the Earth from more CO2 is already being observed from satellites. It is important to resolve whether the greenhouse effect from credible increases in CO2 concentrations will be modest and beneficial or large and harmful. Theoretical uncertainties in science have traditionally been resolved by comparing theoretical predictions with observations. Comparing predicted and observed temperature changes of the surface and lower atmosphere is an incisive way to resolve theoretical uncertainties about the magnitude of the greenhouse effect.

Surface and lower-atmospheric temperatures are expected to warm in response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. But surface temperatures, and their global averages, are influenced by other factors, like land-use changes, suburban and urban development. Surface temperatures are measured by thermometers here and there—sometimes in very bad locations—, and effort is made to interpolate between sites, often poorly. In contrast, satellites can measure atmospheric temperatures with nearly full sampling of the globe and with few of the systematic errors that plague surface measurements.

Instruments on satellites measure the intensity of microwave radiation emitted by the atmosphere. Temperatures are deduced from these intensities by methods analogous to those used in scanning temporal thermometers, available in most pharmacies. Atmospheric temperatures determined from satellite observations have been confirmed by direct measurements of temperature from weather balloons, many hundreds of which are launched every day.

Another reason to use atmospheric rather than surface temperatures as the touchstone for testing climate models is that climate models predict maximum warming at altitudes of 5 to 10 km in the tropical atmosphere. Lesser warmings are predicted for the surface, where it is harder to make reliable measurements.

Using atmospheric temperature data, John Christy et al. have repeatedly shown that the global climate models, in general, greatly overestimate the warming of the bulk atmosphere. Using 60 years of weather balloon data, Ross McKitrick and Christy have shown that an assumed pronounced warming centered over the tropics at about 30,000 to 35,000 feet (9 to 11 km, 300 to 200 millibars) is not found. The McKitrick and Christy study reinforces a 2007 study by Douglas, Christy, Pearson and Singer. This “hot spot” may be logically derived from a warming of the surface, whatever the cause. Its failure to appear after 60 years of observations is significant. There is something wrong with the theory. methodology, and/or procedure used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its followers such as the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the models on which they rely.

TWTW addressed this lack of a pronounced warming in the context of the widely accepted Global Annual Energy Budget by Kiehl and Trenberth on January 26 and February 2. The vicinity of center of the graphic depicts the concepts at issue “Thermals and Evapotranspiration” at the surface absorbing heat then rising in the atmosphere then releasing latent heat in the atmosphere. Based on the evidence presented by McKitrick and Christy, these processes are not intensifying. Thus, assumptions that storms, floods, droughts, etc. are intensifying are not justified by observational evidence.

Using observed evidence, Christy et al. have shown that the divergence between climate models and actual nature is increasing. The divergence is likely to continue unless the theory and methodology used by the IPCC, et al., are changed substantially. This is the first of several TWTWs that will address our understanding of the actual greenhouse gas effect and why the efforts of the IPCC, et al. are faulty.

Although not comprehensive and not embodied in a coherent theory, significant observational data of the atmosphere are being collected. These data suggest the IPCC has significantly overestimated the total greenhouse gas effect, especially that of carbon dioxide. These data bring into question the right side of what is depicted in the Kiehl and Trenberth diagram, the outgoing surface radiation resulting in far less outgoing longwave radiation. Unfortunately, outgoing longwave radiation, which is in the infrared range, cannot be observed from the surface.

The 1979 Charney report assumed that the greenhouse gas effect of carbon dioxide, which had been measured by laboratory experiments, would be greatly amplified by increased water vapor. Since there were no comprehensive measurements of outgoing longwave radiation, there was no hard evidence supporting or refuting this concept. Thus, the 1979 Charney report embodied speculation concerning the impact of greenhouse gases that may have been appropriate at that time; but, as with atmospheric temperature trends, this speculation has been superseded by observational data.

To better express the effects of greenhouse gases on outgoing infrared radiation, it is useful to think of placing thin layers of slightly smoky glass over a bright light shining through a window with each layer of glass being less smoky, clearer. As more layers are placed on, the total effect increases, but effect of the last layer is less noticeable than the previous one. In terminology that will follow in future TWTWs, if there is no interference with the light (electromagnetic energy) passing through the atmosphere (the window), it is said to be transparent. If there is considerable interference with the light (electromagnetic energy) passing through the atmosphere, it is said to be opaque. Different greenhouse gases interfere with different wavelengths of outbound infrared energy. At a particular wavelength, carbon dioxide may be transparent to infrared energy, yet at a different wavelength, opaque to infrared energy. The ability of greenhouse gases to absorb, then re-emit energy varies with the wavelength of the energy.

Since the advent of the satellite era, several countries have been compiling data on the atmosphere. For example, with what is called the A-Train of multiple satellites, and a similar, lower orbiting, C-Train, satellites from the US, France, and Japan collect a wide variety of data, including visible, infrared and microwave energy, phases of water, studies of vegetation, atmospheric pollutants, greenhouse gases, aerosols, clouds, water levels on land areas, snow depths, etc. The information is shared among international partners.

Future installments in TWTW will discussed how these data, and other data, are compiled and developed into databases that are available to the public and can be downloaded onto personal computers. Further discussions will include how these calculations based on observations contradict the findings of the IPCC, etc., and their models. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy and Measurement Issues – Atmosphere.

********************

Hurricanes and Climate Change: On her web site, Climate Etc., Judith Curry has posted two installments on a series about Hurricanes & Climate Change. The first is on detection, going back about 5,000 years. The second is on attribution which she states must be based on observations, not models. See links under Models v. Observations.

********************

Additions and Corrections: A reader on WUWT wrote that TWTW linked to the headline of comments on a paper changing ocean pH with changing wind patterns. The link created the impression that the paper contradicted recent lowering of pH claimed by many. Actually, the paper showed 159-year reconstruction of pH based on a set of coral collected in the northern South China Sea. TWTW should have made such a comment under the link.

********************

Number of the Week: Not €1.57 billion, but closer to €7 billion. An EU energy study claimed that annual levies on UK consumers in 2016 for subsidies to renewable electricity were €1.57 billion, whereas the correct figure is closer to €7 billion. It seems that subsidies for green energy are experiencing more exponential growth than increases in sea level. See link under Problems in the Orthodoxy.

White House Panel Will Study Whether Climate Change Is a National Security Threat. It Includes a Climate Denialist.

“Critics of the effort to create the new panel, which was first reported by The Washington Post, pointed to the inclusion of Dr. Happer, a Princeton physicist who serves on the National Security Council as Mr. Trump’s deputy assistant for emerging technologies. Dr. Happer has gained notoriety in the scientific community for his statements that carbon dioxide — a greenhouse gas that scientists say is trapping heat and warming the planet — is beneficial to humanity. The memo did not name other officials to be appointed to the panel.”

Climate change science pioneer Wallace Smith Broecker dies

US professor raised early alarms about climate change and popularised term ‘global warming’

By Jonathan Watts, The Guardian, Feb 19, 2019

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/19/climate-change-science-pioneer-wallace-smith-broecker-dies

“Broecker said his studies suggested that the conveyor belt was the ‘Achilles heel of the climate system’ and a fragile phenomenon that could change rapidly for reasons not fully understood. It would take only a slight rise in temperature to keep water from sinking in the North Atlantic, he said, and that would bring the conveyor to a halt.

“In the 1970s, he worked as a consultant for Exxon and wrote several papers on the effects of carbon dioxide for the oil company.

“His 1975 paper “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?”, which predicted rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to pronounced heating of the planet. This built on earlier studies and helped to push the subject to a wider audience.”

David Lidington Shows His Ignorance About Climate Change

By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Feb 20, 2019

https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2019/02/20/test-3/

“Since 2008, when the Climate Change Act was passed, UK emissions of CO2 have fallen by 162 MTCO2. In that time, the rest of the World’s have increased by 3225 MTCO2.

“If that is not evidence that Lidington’s policy has not worked, I don’t know what is!

“He wants a national debate on how as a country we make the right choices. Please bring it on. But we cannot have one until the public are given the full facts, and not the myths that the government wishes to peddle.”

The Climate Scales in Our Eyes

By David Whitehouse, GWPF, Feb 20, 2019

“You would not teach in Physics 101 that you quote a measurement of a continuous variable to one part in a thousand when its error is a hundred parts in a thousand, as is the case for HadCrut4. The sensible way is to round the annual global temperature to 0.1 degree C. To rank years swimming about in statistical noise yet hype it as a big media story and a policy driver is nonsense.”

Hurricanes & Climate Change: Detection

By Judith Curry, Climate Etc. Feb 17, 2019

https://judithcurry.com/2019/02/17/hurricanes-climate-change-detection/#more-24723

“I am preparing a new Special Report on Hurricanes and Climate Change.

“There has not been a timeline or synthesis of these results for the past five thousand years, either regionally or for the entire coastal region. However, it is clear from these analyses that significant variability of landfall probabilities occurs on century to millennial time scales. There appears to have been a broad ‘hyperactive period’ from 3400 to 1000 years B.P. High activity persisted in the Gulf of Mexico until 1400 AD, with a shift to more frequent severe hurricane strikes from the Bahamas to New England occurring between 1400 and 1675 AD. Since 1760, there was a gradual decline in activity until the 1990’s.”

Hurricanes and Climate Change: Attribution

By Judith Curry, Climate Etc. Feb 20, 2019

https://judithcurry.com/2019/02/20/24737/#more-24737

“Models and theory suggest that hurricane intensity and rainfall should increase in a warming climate. There is no theory that predicts a change in the number of hurricanes or a change in hurricane tracks with warmer temperatures.

“Convincing attribution of any changes requires that a change in hurricane characteristics be identified from observations, with the change exceeding natural variability.”

Judge Tosses Penn. Case, Challenges Legal Merit of Kids Climate Cases

Worldwide Costs for Power Generation

By Donn Dears, Power For USA, Feb 19, 2019

http://ddears.com/2019/02/19/worldwide-costs-for-power-generation/

“The IEA WEO 2018 supports a worldwide energy transition and forecasts capacity additions in power generation, by type, by 2020.

“Using data from the IEA chart, the above calculations demonstrate that electricity from coal-fired and NGCC power plants is far cheaper, four times less expensive when comparing NGCC power plants with PV Solar plants, than renewables.

“There is no need to delve into levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and all the minutia associated with LCOE calculations. The cost and output of units being installed worldwide establishes, unequivocally, that wind and PV Solar are more expensive.”

1. The Green New Deal’s Impossible Electric Grid

Renewable energy can’t consistently balance power supply with demand.

By Robert Blohm, WSJ, Feb 20, 2019

https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-green-new-deals-impossible-electric-grid-11550705997

“Mr. Blohm is an elected member of the Operating Committee and the Standards Committee of the North American Electric Reliability Corp., the continental bulk electric system’s reliability regulator designated by the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 and by all the Canadian provinces’ energy regulators.”

In expressing a critical concern Mr Blohm writes:

“The Democrats’ Green New Deal calls for a fully renewable electric power grid. Regardless of the economic or political challenges of bringing this about, it is likely technologically impossible.

“An electric power grid involves second-by-second balancing between generated supply and consumer demand. In the case of a sudden imbalance—such as from the loss of a generator’s output—all the remaining generators on the grid instantaneously pool together. Each one pitches in a small part of the required power to make up for the lost generator fast enough to keep supply and demand balanced.

“This doesn’t work for wind and solar because you can’t spontaneously increase wind or sunshine. Hydro power is limited and unevenly distributed around the country. And for safety reasons, nuclear power—even if the Green New Dealers accepted it—can’t be cranked up to neutralize imbalances. Nor can consumer demand be suddenly reduced enough.

“Fossil-fuel turbines, by contrast, very naturally compensate for sudden supply outages. The inertia of the spinning mass of rotors provides the extra energy needed to compensate for the loss for the first few seconds. (Wind-rotor inertia is too short-lived.) Meanwhile the generators’ on-line reserve capacity kicks in, giving a rapid boost in power output to prevent the turbines from slowing down. That substitute power, called “governor response,” lasts as long as 15 minutes. During that time a single replacement generator ramps up to compensate entirely for the loss. All the turbines on the grid are thereby restored to their original speed, and the governor response is rearmed for the next disturbance.

An all-renewables grid would require prohibitively expensive battery storage to compensate for sudden power losses. Even with batteries, the lost power would have to be fed through “inverters”—a technology that converts variable-wind-speed alternating current, solar-power direct current, and battery-power direct-current into alternating current—to allow for synthetic inertia and governor response in the case of a disruption.

“But according to a 2017 report from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, if a large enough share of the power grid flows through inverters, the grid itself may collapse. Existing inverter technologies have faced serious software problems and prompted outages where they have been deployed. The IEEE is trying to create a global standard for inverter design—though heavy input by Chinese suppliers bent on commandeering the technology may pose a national-security risk if the U.S. were to incorporate the standard.

“How could the market price in the cost of providing rapid replacement energy that renewable sources can’t provide reliably? The entity that caused the outage should need to pay. Yet the power industry—to say nothing of the Green New Dealers—hasn’t given this much thought. An all-renewables power grid is destined to collapse.”

PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — A year ago at The Honda Classic, Jhonattan Vegas made seven birdies all week.

He’s off to a much better start this time.

Vegas made six birdies and no bogeys Thursday, shooting a 6-under 64 to open a two-stroke lead after the first round. Lucas Glover bogeyed his finishing hole for a 66, leaving him tied with Zach Johnson, Ernie Els and Ben Silverman — who went to college at nearby Florida Atlantic.

“Hit my irons the best I’ve hit them all year and I’ve always liked this golf course,” Vegas said. “It’s kind of one of those courses that I think suits me. You have to hit the ball well and you have to get around really well. And then I made a few putts.”

Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler and Sergio Garcia were in a large group at 67, and defending champion Justin Thomas shot 68 after an eventful day that saw him play the last eight holes without a 9-iron after it bent when he hit it against a tree.

“To feel like I gave quite a few back today and shoot 2-under par on this golf course, it’s great,” Thomas said.

Also at 68 was Sam Saunders, the grandson of golf legend Arnold Palmer. Saunders birdied all three holes in the famed “Bear Trap” stretch at PGA National, the run of holes 15 through 17 where a par 4 is sandwiched by a pair of par 3s that can be treacherous even without much wind.

Vegas made 12 bogeys last year at the Honda, along with three doubles and a triple, wound up beating only one of the 74 finishers and wrapped up the week with a final-round 78. He sprayed irons everywhere, missed half of the fairways, more than half of the greens.

But Thursday, he was dialed in — missing only three of 14 fairways and three of the 18 greens, needing only 29 putts to get through the day.

“I felt like I was in control pretty much all day long,” Vegas said.

The 34-year-old Venezuelan has three PGA Tour victories, winning the 2011 Bob Hope Classic and the RBC Canadian Open in 2016 and 2017.

Vegas took advantage on a day to make noise at PGA National, where the wind was down. And that’s not typical.

Forecasters correctly said breezes would be relatively light all day and should stay that way until perhaps the weekend, though Johnson — whose weather apps said breezes were going to be no more than 3 or 4 mph — was among those who felt the wind was still a factor and fluctuated more than expected.

“We had a stretch there on the front nine where it was a lot more than that,” Johnson said. “The ball curving with the wind, depending on the direction, easily 10 to 15 to 20 yards. And then we made the turn and it started to be more consistent, not as gusty. ... It was not Honda wind. I don’t think we’re going to get Honda wind until Sunday.”

Els had no complaints.

Els has won more than 70 tournaments worldwide, 19 of them on the PGA Tour — the last of those coming in 2012 at the British Open. Getting a 20th on tour, he said, has been a goal for some time.

“Secretly on tour among the players, you know when you win No. 20 you get some benefits,” Els said. “It’s late in my career, but I’ll take any win now.”

Thomas sizzled at the start with three birdies in his first four holes, and made the turn at 4-under.

That’s when his day got eventful.

His drive ended up behind a tree on the 10th, and he figured that his 9-iron would snap on the follow-through of his approach shot. It merely bent instead, and the jolt of the impact meant Thomas was going to be spending some time Thursday night with an icepack on his wrist. He doesn’t believe it’ll impact him Friday.

“Just more of a shock than anything,” Thomas said.

Thomas then found his way into and out of trouble on the Bear Trap — making double-bogey, then having a par putt slide past the hole on 16, and making birdie on 17. He then birdied the last as well.

Garcia also finished strong, with three birdies in his last four holes.

“It’s a great round, at the end of the day,” Garcia said.

DIVOTS: Fowler went into the water twice and wound up making a triple-bogey on the par-4 sixth, his nemesis hole at PGA National. In his last four rounds at the Honda, he’s 7 over on that hole. ... Alex Cejka was disqualified for using an improper greens-reading device, officials said. He withdrew from last year’s tournament and missed the cut in 2017. ... Cody Gribble had an interesting day — making quadruple bogey on No. 6, triple bogey on the par-4 11th, and then eagle on the par-5 18th.

“We had a stretch there on the front nine where it was a lot more than that,” Johnson said. “The ball curving with the wind, depending on the direction, easily 10 to 15 to 20 yards. And then we made the turn and it started to be more consistent, not as gusty. ... It was not Honda wind. I don’t think we’re going to get Honda wind until Sunday.”

Els had no complaints.

Els has won more than 70 tournaments worldwide, 19 of them on the PGA Tour — the last of those coming in 2012 at the British Open. Getting a 20th on tour, he said, has been a goal for some time.

“Secretly on tour among the players, you know when you win No. 20 you get some benefits,” Els said. “It’s late in my career, but I’ll take any win now.”

Thomas sizzled at the start with three birdies in his first four holes, and made the turn at 4-under.

That’s when his day got eventful.

His drive ended up behind a tree on the 10th, and he figured that his 9-iron would snap on the follow-through of his approach shot. It merely bent instead, and the jolt of the impact meant Thomas was going to be spending some time Thursday night with an icepack on his wrist. He doesn’t believe it’ll impact him Friday.

“Just more of a shock than anything,” Thomas said.

Thomas then found his way into and out of trouble on the Bear Trap — making double-bogey, then having a par putt slide past the hole on 16, and making birdie on 17. He then birdied the last as well.

Garcia also finished strong, with three birdies in his last four holes.

“It’s a great round, at the end of the day,” Garcia said.

DIVOTS: Fowler went into the water twice and wound up making a triple-bogey on the par-4 sixth, his nemesis hole at PGA National. In his last four rounds at the Honda, he’s 7 over on that hole. ... Alex Cejka was disqualified for using an improper greens-reading device, officials said. He withdrew from last year’s tournament and missed the cut in 2017. ... Cody Gribble had an interesting day — making quadruple bogey on No. 6, triple bogey on the par-4 11th, and then eagle on the par-5 18th.

574,Empty,2019-03-03T16:16:32Z,He believes the numbers show Quebecers are starting to see the party as a ‘useful’  group with concrete solutions to problems such as climate change,"MONTREAL — The Green Party of Canada’s encouraging result in a federal byelection in a Quebec riding last week has deputy leader Daniel Green hopeful the party can make a major breakthrough in this fall’s general election.

Green, who finished third in Outremont behind the Liberal and NDP candidates, believes it’s possible Quebecers could once again choose to shift their vote en masse to a new party, as they’ve done previously, and send as many as five or six green party MPs to Ottawa.

“Quebec at the federal level has always voted in waves, which have changed Canadian history,” he said in an interview. “We did it with the Bloc Quebecois, we did it with the NDP. Now, it’s the Greens’ turn.”

Green earned nearly 13 per cent of the vote in Outremont, finishing ahead of the candidates from the Bloc Quebecois and the Conservative Party of Canada. It’s a big improvement over 2015, when the party won only 3.6 per cent of the vote.

He believes the numbers show Quebecers are starting to see the party as a “useful” group with concrete solutions to problems such as climate change.

The party, he added, is already scouting a team of experienced candidates for the next election.

“These are mature people, who have already seen snow, some have already done municipal politics, some have done federal politics, have been candidates for other parties,” he said.

As much as Maxime Bernier is cannibalizing the right, we can equally see that elsewhere in Canada, especially in the Maritimes and British Columbia, the left-wing, environmentalist vote is leaving the NDP for the Greens

With the Bloc Quebecois and NDP struggling in Quebec, and the Liberals mired in the fallout of accusations from the former attorney general, the Green party is hoping some of the left-wing votes will swing its way.

But how much chance does the party really have to elect its first Quebec MP?

Philippe J. Fournier, a columnist with L’Actualite magazine and creator of political site 338Canada, believes the party will need to attract a big star candidate in order to win a seat — and it had better be the right one.

“Mr. Green, in Outremont, who got 12.5 per cent, that’s a high point for the Green Party of Canada in Quebec,” he said. “To really make a breakthrough in Quebec, it will take a really big name, because there is no riding that’s takeable, or even close to being takeable.”

Actor and comedian JiCi Lauzon, who is well-known in Quebec, ran for the party in 2015 in a riding south of Montreal, but only managed to win 8.5 per cent of the votes.

But Fournier said the party could certainly play a role in the election, mostly to the detriment of the NDP.

“As much as Maxime Bernier is cannibalizing the right, we can equally see that elsewhere in Canada, especially in the Maritimes and British Columbia, the left-wing, environmentalist vote is leaving the NDP for the Greens,” he said.

He says that if the Green party manages to recruit a star, their best hope may be in two Montreal ridings, Laurier–Sainte-Marie and Hochelaga, which are both represented by NDP MPs who have announced they won’t be running in the fall.

According to a Leger poll in February, eight per cent of Quebecers said they would vote for the Greens if the federal election took place today.

But that number could go down on election day, since voters often tend to opt for the big parties that they feel have a better chance of winning.

“It could be a big balloon that bursts, but it’s been several months that we’re seeing in Quebec that’s it’s eight, nine, 10 per cent…that would be a very good score for them,” Fournier said.

Green is very aware that encouraging poll numbers may not materialize on election day, but he’s hoping to convince Quebecers that voting Green is worth it.

“The challenge in October, is to tell our Green voters to vote Green,” he said. “Vote Green, it’s Ok. It’s a useful vote, a Green vote. It’s a vote that’s necessary to send the message.”","Deputy Green Party leader Daniel Green finishes third in byelection, raising hope for political breakthrough",Nationalpost.com,https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/encouraging-byelection-result-has-greens-hoping-for-a-breakthrough-in-quebec
575,Empty,2019-02-28T21:49:44Z,Only three among the top 20 in the world rankings are present in Palm Beach Gardens,"Jhonattan Vegas took the early first-round lead on Thursday at the Honda Classic, a tournament that has recently attracted a stellar field but has fallen victim this year of the PGA Tour’s new condensed schedule.

Vegas hit the ball with metronomic efficiency to card six-under-par 64 at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens.

Yet the big talking point in the lead-up to the first round was the absence of most of the game’s biggest names from the tournament.

Only three among the top 20 in the world rankings are present - Justin Thomas, Brooks Koepka and Rickie Fowler - making it the weakest field in more than a decade.

Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are among those sitting out the event, even though they all live locally.

A number of big events both before and after the Honda Classic has left the longest title sponsor on the PGA Tour facing a problem not of its own making.

Honda began sponsoring the south Florida tournament in 1982 but this year, it comes coming directly after the WGC-Mexico Championship and only two weeks ahead of the Players Championship.

The Players, the most prestigious event outside the four majors, has switched from May to March, while the PGA Championship has moved from August to May.

The tour season will finish in late August, instead of late September.

The scheduling, however, appeared of little concern to Vegas who notched six birdies in benign morning conditions on Thursday.

“I was able to drive really well today, hit my irons incredibly well,” said the 34-year-old from Venezuela.

“I only missed three greens and of those I left two within 15 feet of the hole.

“Hitting those irons well to some of these tough pins makes the day a little bit easier. Wind wasn’t that hard so you could be a little more aggressive than usual.”

Vegas, ranked 131st in the world, is a three-times PGA Tour winner.

He led by two strokes from South African Ernie Els, American Zach Johnson and Canadian Ben Silverman with half the field back in the clubhouse.

576,Empty,2019-02-25T08:01:47Z,"Southern Utah wasn't always a riding paradise, but as they say, if you build it, they will come. The post 2019 Bible Feature Story: Slow Roll appeared first on BIKE Magazine.","As I climbed out of a truck in Utah's Gooseberry Mesa parking lot, toothy, redrock peaks filled the view to the north and east, highlighted by the world-famous skyline of Zion National Park. I'd been told to expect a two- to three-hour ride that was rugged and technical. But perusing our flat surroundings made me skeptical.

Perhaps sensing my apprehension, Jake Weber, a retired Army combat engineer-turned guide with Utah Mountain Biking Adventures, offered a measure of reassurance. ""We get a lot of people who show up and say they want to ride 30 miles every day of their trip,"" he told me. ""But after about 15 miles on their first day, they're like, 'Yeah, we're good,' and they're ready for a beer at the trailhead.""

Welcome to the land of ""mesa miles."" Maybe you've heard of them. In short—no pun intended—they're harder than standard miles which makes them feel longer. The more you ride them, the more comfortable you get disclosing that you ""only"" rode 10 miles today and it still took two hours.

I had never ridden a mesa mile when I got to Washington County, Utah, which is well known to desert aficionados as a singletrack oasis and has hosted the world's premier freeride competition, Red Bull Rampage, off and on since 2001. Still, it remains something of a hidden gem to the rest of the riding world, in part because it's remote: four hours from Salt Lake City, six hours from Phoenix, nine hours from Denver.

St. George, the county seat and a city of roughly 90,000 people, spent decades as a retirement community for golfers and still attracts celebrities like Michael Jordan to its greens come winter. But starting around the mid 2000s, adventure took a bite out of golf's place as the area's top attraction. The number of local outfitters swelled from a dozen to more than 50. Mountain biking overtook road biking as the most popular two-wheeled pursuit. With an almost 90-percent population jump since 2000, Washington County ranks as the fastest-growing metropolitan area in America. It also has a warmer climate than its sometimes-rival, Moab, five hours to the northeast, and offers legitimate riding and 60-degree temps in the belly of winter.

On this beaming morning in early October, photographer Margus Riga and I had joined a local crew for a spin along the South Rim and through Hidden Canyon. Gooseberry, the original mesa ride and still a lot of locals' favorite mesa of the five with trails, carries an almost-mythical reputation among those who know about it. Mostly that is due to Goose's sandstone features and their surprising, albeit intimidating, ridability.

""They're like giant rock biscuits that you can just roll up onto,"" said 54-year-old Kenny Jones, who owns Gooseberry Yurts and once finished 14 straight Leadville 100s back-to-back. ""A lot of the bottom sections of the rocks have a nice, roll-y out. So they look really steep but then the tranny grabs your front wheel and gets you out of the vertical position.""

We followed Quentin Morisette, owner of Over the Edge Sports in nearby Hurricane, as he weaved between puddles in the rock—and the brine shrimp they hold, making it a no-no to ride through them—and abided by the local code not to leave tracks in the dirt. He led us to a playground that he called the Skatepark: two deep, connected bowls that mimic the flow of a purpose-built concrete bowl. From there we swooped between stands of juniper, piñon and cedar trees, as well as the mesa's namesake gooseberry bushes. After 15 minutes of wrestling our bikes up, down and over the sandstone landscape—a full-body workout that longtime local Bill Bergeron compares to ""being stuck in a cage with a gorilla""—we came upon a 20-foot-tall biscuit that looked like a soft-serve ice-cream tower. It was steep and layered, with a small drop at the entry over significant exposure. Morisette hiked to the top for the second time in his life and prepared to drop in.

The line, my riding partners explained, was not to be confused with the Wall of Considerable Consequences, which we'd pass later, or the Wall of Death, which we'd skip. Morisette rolled in, landed the initial drop and rocketed out the bottom as the rest of us filmed it with our phones. ""You've got to be kidding me!"" shouted Weber, who served two tours in Iraq and left the military after a pair of traumatic brain injuries saddled him with PTSD. Now he coaches a local high school team and rarely sees someone test the sharp end, hence his incredulous response.

Morisette let out a sly grin. ""I've been riding here for 23 years, and it just gets better,"" he said. ""When you're on the rock, the sky's the limit.""

As we continued toward Gooseberry's high point, I realized why locals pay attention to their tires' side knobs here: You need a lof of support to grip the off-camber sandstone. It helps that the trail is marked by white dots on the rock, too; otherwise it's easy to wander off track.

We pedaled over a 4-foot-wide plank to the Point, an airy perch overlooking the valley and Zion. The trail only gains 300 vertical feet from the White Trailhead (elevation: 5,100 feet above sea level) to here, but the entire ride includes about 900 feet of gain. ""It's all 10 feet at a time,"" Morisette quipped.

We ogled the old Rampage venue to the north, which includes the notorious King Kong descent, as well as Flying Monkey, a mesa across the valley where the government, legend has it, used to send furry primates down a rail propelled by a rocket at supersonic speeds to test military ejector seats.

Then we returned the way we came, back to the trailhead. Slightly under the weather, I collapsed in the gravelly shade, feeling like I'd ridden 20 miles if not more. Someone informed me it was actually less than 10. I sighed, chalked it up to the mesa effect and closed my eyes for a nap, while the others tipped back beers in the sun.

According to Washington County's GIS department, the local mountain biking scene encompasses 296 miles of mapped trails to go with a gnarliness spectrum ranging from sublime cross-country favorites like Hurricane Rim, J.E.M. and Dead Ringer, to the five local mesas and their sandstone playgrounds, to big-boy gravity lines that attract the world's best freeriders every October.

The area's rise to prominence happened neither quickly nor due to a mass movement. On the contrary, it started in late 1993 when a pair of native sons took up the sport at age 49. Twin brothers Morgan and Mike Harris had grown up in Rockville, a tiny town on the Virgin River at the mouth of Zion Canyon, but because their father forbade them from riding dirt bikes, they didn't start until they were 26. As Morgan tells it, they rode motos for 20 years, then performance ATVs for three, at which point they grew wary of the danger and turned to mountain bikes.

In the early days, Morgan rode a primitive bike with a shoddy fork. ""Boy, I went home bloody a lot,"" he chuckles. A few other locals were riding at the time, but they mainly stuck to the mellow Green Valley Loop. ""There wasn't any real anchor trail to draw people to the area,"" Harris recalls.

He and Mike used to hunt deer, coyotes and rabbits on Gooseberry Mesa, and they often heard visitors talk about slickrock riding in Moab. They knew Gooseberry contained similar features and started poking around, starting with the slab that parallels the White Road. They built a short trail through one of the mesa's mini-canyons, then found out they needed a permit. So they met with the BLM in 1994 to talk about expanding their work to the north and south rims and Hidden Canyon. ""Originally they wanted 15 cents a foot, per year, for the use of the land,"" Harris says. Then the agency softened its stance. ""They said if you can have everything completed by Trail Days of 1996, we'll do a trail dedication. We had it done, but it took them until '98 to dedicate it.""

With Gooseberry complete, the Harris brothers turned their attention to Little Creek Mountain, which they'd been staring at for years from Gooseberry. They started exploring its slabs, ancient petroglyphs and fossils (there's actually a dinosaur bone embedded in the sandstone in one spot) and potential trail corridors that didn't require slaughtering flora. After a year-and-a-half of building there—with unofficial permission from a BLM official, Harris says—the agency changed its mind and asked them to stop. So they did, again shifting to where they thought the next destination could be. In this case it was a long redrock spine that would come to be known as Church Rocks.

Mike Harris quit riding after Little Creek, leaving Morgan to continue alone. Luckily others picked up the slack, and soon enough a growing community of riders had built Guacamole, which fostered its own mini-network on the mesa including The Whole Guacamole, Holy Guacamole and Salt on the Rim.

Harris left to build trails in Nevada after constructing Holy Guacamole, and now, at age 73, he just maintains existing routes. But the foundation he and Mike laid continues to anchor the network. If you ask 20 locals to name their favorite trail, like I did, you could get 15 different answers. The scene now includes a 100-mile race—True Grit, held every March in St. George—and a respected advocacy organization, the Dixie Mountain Bike Trails Association (DMBTA), which was launched in 2010 by True Grit founder Cimarron Chacon. ('Dixie' is a common moniker in Washington County because the early settlers grew cotton, which led to the area being known as 'Utah's Dixie.')

DMBTA only counts about 75 official members, but more than 2,000 people follow the organization on social media, ""and a lot of them come out to our volunteer days,"" says club president Kevin Christopherson. Others hand him money on the trails, even if they're not from the area. In addition, the Rampage organizers have donated about $14,000 to DMBTA each of the past two years.

The roots and robust support keep the area on the broader map, attracting riders from around the world—with a healthy dose of freeriders each spring, an influx that Morisette affectionately calls the Canadian Invasion. The key to providing such a reliable product when so many other destinations in the region cannot, he says, is the geography. Just north of Hurricane, Interstate 15 goes from 3,500 feet in elevation to above 5,000 and stays there, which places Zion on the northern edge of viable winter and early spring riding.

Although a lot of local rides, particularly the mesas, require driving a fair distance to park at a trailhead, not everywhere does. One of the guys we rode Gooseberry with, a diehard XC fanatic named Josh Wolfe, lives in St. George and doesn't own a car. We bumped into him the next morning in the nondescript parking lot for Zen and Barrel Ride, just over a dirt mound from St. George's subdivisions and commercial sprawl. We had just finished up an ambitious combo ride in a group of eight.

Wolfe was on his way out for a midday loop, and after our morning figure-eight on Zen and Barrel, I understood why he lives so close to these trails. Zen features the kind of ledgy, technical terrain that makes your forearms cramp. Kenny Jones called it a ""rim-basher trail,"" and halfway through our descent it delivered. Jake Miller, a Red Rock ambassador and standout local rider, buckled an $1,800 carbon wheel in two places without crashing. Despite its ride-from-home proximity to a city of 90,000, you still feel like you're away from the hectic rush of civilization when you reach the top. Then the real fun begins. Both Riga, who lives in Vancouver and calls the North Shore home, and I deemed it our favorite trail of the week.

We continued on to the freeride-friendly Barrel from there, led by longtime St. George rider Bryce Pratt, who built it 15 years ago, and Mitchell Curwen, who recently refurbished it and added some features. ""If you want to see what a bike can do, this is a great place to take it,"" Curwen said as we pedaled up a wash toward the top. Pratt designed the trail to snake through a series of barrel cactuses, which look like stunted pony kegs with 3-inch-long thorns.

I followed a mother of three named Angie Anderson down the Waterfall, an aptly named chunky section that serves as Barrel's crux, if you don't count the jumps below. Some of those jumps dropped blindly off of giant boulders into perfectly sculpted transitions. Others were gaps, including one over a creek. Everything seemed to flow just as it should until we were back at the parking lot.

""Doing Zen and Barrel in the same day is a big day. They're probably our two most technical trails in St. George City,"" Curwen said. ""If you can get out of here without a broken bike part or broken body part, that's a win.""

Victorious, Riga and I returned to St. George later that afternoon to check out the Snake Hollow St. George Bike Park—the newest addition to the area's stable of radness. Built on 80 acres of city-owned land through a collaboration between DMBTA, the Southern Utah Bicycle Alliance and the Washington County Tourism Office, the facility was funded by $1.6 million in tax dollars and was slated to open the month after our visit. But there were already dozens of kids testing it out after school. This winter, city workers and volunteers are planning to add a 5.5-mile NICA racecourse through the lava field on the lot's southern end. According to county tourism director Kevin Lewis, it will be the only year-round bike park in Utah.

The most recent addition to Washington County's singletrack menu arrived two years ago when DMBTA finished a 7-mile intermediate loop on Wire Mesa. In its first year of existence, trail counters recorded 16,000 visitors—or an average of 44 a day. It's close to Gooseberry and Grafton mesas, so you'd expect it to see traffic, but the number still quantified the area's growing renown. (In total, 178,000 people rode BLM trails around Washington County last year, including 30,000 on Gooseberry.)

The numbers are a far cry from when Morgan Harris broached the idea of a Gooseberry trail to the BLM 25 years ago. ""At that first meeting, they said, 'Being that remote, 7-and-a-half miles off the highway, you're probably only going to see 36 riders a month, at most,'"" Harris recalled. Within three years of Gooseberry's trails being open, the local bike shop owners told Harris they'd seen a 60-percent increase in sales. Five years later, when Harris' fork fell apart, Zion Cycles founder Fred Pagles gave him a new Trek Remedy and free service and parts for life. When Harris protested, Pagles said: ""If you hadn't done what you did, I wouldn't have a business.""

There is still a touch of uncertainty about what will happen to unofficial trails on BLM land that have become wildly popular and mapped, like Little Creek and Dig It on Grafton Mesa. A long-in-the-works travel management plan is nearing completion, and locals are optimistic the BLM will bring them into the fold and declare them legal, since closing them would be more complicated and potentially hurt the area's economic growth.

But whatever happens, the local scene is plenty healthy, as evidenced by a recent show of support for Harris after he was diagnosed with gum cancer. In mid-May, Harris underwent surgery to remove a tumor, and doctors removed his fibula from his lower right leg and used it to rebuild his jaw. Locals held a fundraiser to help cover his medical bills, bringing in nearly $25,000. Over the Edge built a new Ibis Mojo HD for Harris to ride into his 80s. At a post-ride barbecue in October, Harris said he still didn't have the leg power to ride technical terrain, as much as he wanted to.

Instead, he had been maintaining trails he built a generation ago. ""I get out there at daylight and get done before it gets too hot,"" he said. ""Me and the dog, Hazel."" His tools were hidden in the bushes as he spoke.

I asked Harris what he thinks of the community that he and his brother helped to create. ""It amazes me what's happened here,"" he said. ""When I was building trail, I never expected any payback. Payback was people having a smile on their face, loving what you built. I can't believe this came out of us wanting to ride a trail on Gooseberry.""

RIDE: Although most trails are on MTB Project, for a more localized resource check out swutahtrails.com, a brand-new, one-stop tool for trail descriptions, photos and videos with downloadable maps and GPS navigation. Trails are sorted into geographical zones to showcase the various regions throughout the county.

STAY: You'll find ample lodging options throughout the county via Google. We stayed at a rental house in Sand Hollow Resort, which suited our large group well and was convenient to both Hurricane and St. George. You can also check out Gooseberry Yurts for a more primitive, adventurous option—with four days' worth of riding from your front door. The 20-foot-diameter yurts sleep five to seven adults and cost $150 a night.

EAT: Again, options abound, but you can't go wrong with Lonny Boy's BBQ in Hurricane, George's Corner Restaurant in St. George and the Bit and Spur Restaurant and Saloon in Springdale. Affogato is a worthy coffee shop in St. George, while River Rock Roasting Co., in La Verkin, serves tasty food and everything from coffee to beer on the edge of a canyon carved by the Virgin River.

SHOP: Over the Edge Sports in Hurricane treated our team well, whether that meant providing TLC to the day's testing steeds each evening, sharing local beta on where to ride or leading the way on hard-to-follow loops (OTE also runs a free shop ride every Saturday, which is a great way to see the area's nooks and crannies).

577,Empty,2019-03-05T19:01:14Z,It's an insanely hard country to govern. The Liberals were foolish to pretend otherwise. The post Trudeau’s ‘sunny ways’ were doomed to meet their SNC-Lavalin. Because this is Canada. appeared first on Macleans.ca.,"In 2015, Justin Trudeau and his Liberals formed government against the backdrop of “sunny ways.” Young, energetic, untarnished. Trudeau replaced Stephen Harper and his Conservatives, who were showing their age after nearly a decade in power. For opponents of the Blue Side, it was indeed a bright day: The bad man was gone and light was restored to the land. Today, sunny ways are dead.

While many, including the Prime Minister, like to draw on Wilfrid Laurier’s idiom “sunny ways,” fewer seem to recall the origins of the phrase. In the late 19th century, Canada was swept up by the Manitoba Schools question—a struggle over French language education rights in the province. Laurier described his approach as the “sunny way,” which entailed negotiation over strong-arm tactics. The crisis was eventually solved through compromise, which is to say by selling out francophones in Manitoba. Sunny ways, friends. Sunny ways. Although, perhaps the sun doesn’t shine upon everyone—especially those who’ve been thrown under the bus.

The SNC-Lavalin/Jody Wilson-Raybould affair has undermined Trudeau’s claim to do politics differently, just like the Aga Khan trip before it; the cynically broken promise on electoral reform; the kowtowing to Saudi Arabia while claiming to defend women’s rights and democracy; the meek response to social media companies pushing them around, and so on and so on. Then, on Monday, Treasury Board President Jane Philpott—respected as an honest, competent minister—resigned, leaving the Liberals scrambling to spin her departure without trashing her. Awkward. Later that night, the Prime Minister held a climate rally, interrupted by protesters, in which he appeared shaken. It was a disaster. Like a clown running across a minefield, to borrow a phrase.

All of this is bad news for the government. And it’s all extremely disappointing. But observers of Canadian politics and history will blame the Prime Minister as much for his promise to be different as for his failure to be so. What in this country’s past made him think that would work? Or was it a short-term ploy to win government—a strategy to be replaced four years later with “Jobs!” and “Remember Stephen Harper? Ohhhhh. Spooky!” and “Don’t change a horse in midstream” and “Oh, have we mentioned jobs?”

From the perspective of politics-as-usual, those are fair slogans. They don’t live up to sunny ways, of course. But they were never going to. As someone once put it to me, no party runs for re-election on ethics. And there we meet the fundamental truth of Canadian politics: this is a hard country to govern. That wisdom pops up all the time here. In different quotations and turns of phrase that draw on the many challenges, past and present, of duct-taping this giant land together. Regional tensions. Linguistic tensions. Identity tensions. A wary citizenry. Difficult allies and even more difficult rivals. A caucus that leaks. Cabinet ministers with ambition. An opposition party or two ready to pounce. It’s amazing that any government gets anything done—let alone gets re-elected a second or third or—gasp!—fourth time.

Come to think of it, how does a government anything done? It’s not sunny ways. And therein lies much of the disappointment with Trudeau’s government. It’s not just that the substance of some policy decisions comes up short. Or that the Prime Minister’s Office routinely asserted its right to push, pull, press or do whatever they need to do to make sure that messaging is coherent, everyone is on the same page, and the government’s chance at re-election remained decent. That’s what governing parties do, federally and provincially. Liberal. Conservative. New Democrat. But Trudeau promised to be different yet didn’t pursue institutional reform that would make being different possible. We were all sold a bill of sunny ways goods. And now we hear from the PM and those around him that, well, of course, this is just how it works. I’m sorry. But “buyer beware” isn’t going to cut it.

No one likes a hypocrite. In fact, it turns out that we really, really don’t like hypocrites. As Oliver Burkeman writes in the Guardian, drawing on research from Jillian Jordan and her colleagues, that we don’t like these folks because they’re guilty of “false signaling.” Signals are one way we sort people—good, bad, honest, dishonest. They help us make sense of the world and reach judgments and decisions. People don’t enjoy learning that they’ve been duped. Especially if they believed in you. The lesson here is that if you’re going to aim for the idealists, you’d better not miss or—worse—hit them but later let them down. Because if you do, it’s hello cynicism and anger; goodbye hope and trust.

Trudeau has let down the idealists, those who believed “sunny ways” was more than a slogan. He set the bar high. And then he walked into it. Bad timing, too. Globally, democracy is in retreat—a democratic recession that threatens to become a depression. Democratic norms are under assault. The latest trust numbers from Edelman suggest that Canada fares decent in trust, at least, with 53 percent of folks trusting government. That’s especially good compared to the United Kingdom (42 percent), the United States (40 percent), and France (32 percent). But those numbers include a tension between trusting folks who are well-informed and distrusting folks who aren’t, and they could be inflated by trust acting as a proxy for economic health. Moreover, polarization is on the rise. That’s potentially very bad news. What might all of this come to be if we encountered a sustained economic downturn? Or if we start to feel the worst effects of climate change? Now’s not the time to roll the dice with our democratic institutions and trust.

How did this happen? In moral philosophy, the “pickle-barrel analogy” holds that a good person goes bad the same way a cucumber becomes a pickle when it goes into a briny barrel—it starts out as one thing, enters a new environment and then it changes. The Liberals have become what they once opposed and claimed to stand in stark contrast to by having to govern a country that’s hostile to friendly, smiley politics. They got pickled.

None of this means that Trudeau and the Liberals will lose the 2019 election, although their numbers are softening faster than a peeled banana in the sun. October is a long time from now in electoral days. The CPC still carries the weight of frustration from the Harper years and that will—well—come up. Bernier’s breakaway People’s Party will help by siphoning right-wing votes. The NDP has got their leader a seat in the House of Commons and are working out their messaging, but they’re losing a lot of talent with 13 members of Parliament not returning and they’ll face a centre-right counter-push alongside an electoral system that tends to marginalize them. The Greens may eat into Liberal support and even add seats—Elizabeth May is fierce and the party is an honest broker—but they won’t contend to form government.

But the clouds over Trudeau and his government do mean that sunny ways days are over and they aren’t coming back. It means we’ll all be left a little more tired, frustrated and angry once this story disappears. It means we’ll be a little more cynical and a little less trusting. It means we’ll have lost time and energy and attention that would have been better off spent discussing and debating and passing and implementing policy and law to make the country a better place. All because we were promised that this time it would be different. And some of us fell for it. Of course, a few years from now, promises of change and a different sort of politics will be back. Not from Trudeau, but from whomever comes along promising to drain the pickle barrel.

578,Empty,2019-03-03T16:45:33Z,The real question here is why the Australian government is playing nice by issuing Assange a passport since it has refused to acknowledge evidence of a sealed indictment or provide him with any sort of substantial assistance to get him home in the last eight-…,"CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA — On February 21, 2019, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) issued Julian Assange a new passport despite the fact that DFAT officials had reservations about doing so. According to the article, last year officials stated that Assange’s “entitlement to a passport” might be affected by “an arrest warrant in connection with a ‘serious foreign offence’ within the meaning of Section 13 of the Australian Passports Act 2005.”

Section 13 of the Australian Passports Act states that an application may be rejected if the applicant is subject to an arrest warrant for a serious foreign offense, is restricted from traveling because of a serious foreign offense, or if the issuance of a passport would compromise proceedings connected with a serious foreign offense.

However, it would be extraordinary if the Australian government’s reservations last year had anything to do with a U.S. indictment or charges against Assange, some of which may include charges under the Espionage Act, since it not only went ahead and issued the passport but as recently as last week maintained that there is no evidence of any U.S. charges against Assange.

In fact, parliamentary documents dating back to 2010 reveal not only that the government rarely takes seriously evidence in Assange’s case, but also that it has embraced an entirely passive role in helping to secure his freedom, despite the fact that it has used government pressure and diplomatic power to help free other Australian citizens detained in foreign states.

Transcripts from Parliament also reveal a long-standing pattern when it comes to how the Australian government typically responds to anything Assange-related: “There is no evidence of charges or a sealed indictment against him;” and “We are not able to interfere in the legal processes of any foreign government,” are two sentences from the Australian government we should probably get used to.

This stance has been adhered to despite the fact that there is evidence of charges (evidence is different from proof); Assange has been arbitrarily detained since 2010 and imprisoned in London since 2012; political figures have publicly called for his assassination; the U.K. threatened to storm the Ecuadorian Embassy where Assange sought asylum; the UN has ruled twice that he’s being arbitrarily detained; and he’s been established both legally and professionally as a journalist.

With that said, the real question here is why the Australian government is playing nice by issuing Assange a passport yet it has refused to acknowledge evidence of a sealed indictment against him or provide him with any sort of substantial assistance to get him home in the last eight-plus years.

“Whole-of-government” WikiLeaks Task Force

Australia’s abysmal record on supporting Australian journalist and publisher, Julian Assange, became clear in late 2010, when WikiLeaks published Cablegate — a collection of U.S. diplomatic cables that in its entirety spans over 35 years and includes over 270 U.S. embassies, consulates, and diplomatic missions around the world. At the time, the Australian government established a “whole-of-government” WikiLeaks task force similar in nature to the 2010 U.S. WikiLeaks Task Force (WTF) that was created to “make an inventory of the leaked cables” and to report on their impact.

The Australian task force was established by then Attorney-General Robert McClelland at the behest of the Department of the Prime Minister Cabinet, who then became the chair of the group. Other agencies involved included the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Department of Defence, Office of National Assessments, and the Australian Federal Police (AFP). Their job was to closely monitor future Cablegate publications while the AFP was tasked with determining if Assange had broken any laws.

In the meantime, the Australian government contemplated canceling Assange’s passport while then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard publicly decried the publication as a “grossly irresponsible thing to do and an illegal thing to do,” despite the fact that the AFP had not concluded its investigation nor had she been briefed on any alleged illegalities. On December 17, 2010, the AFP concluded that it could not “identify any criminal offence where Australia would have jurisdiction.”

Undeterred by the AFP’s findings and uninterested in protecting an Australian citizen, two months later former Senator and current Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom George Brandis asked former AFP Commissioner Tony Negus if the AFP had looked into Assange’s “personal involvement” in the “solicitation of the cables or the posting of the cables.”

Brandis’ question, whether purposely or not, served as a U.S.-government talking point that Assange was directly involved with the procurement of documents that Chelsea Manning allegedly leaked to WikiLeaks — propaganda that seems to have originated publicly with the now-deceased hacker and FBI snitch Adrian Lamo and Wired journalist Kevin Poulsen, and that may be one of the charges used against Assange.

Death threats and calls for assassination

After publishing five major publications during 2010, including a U.S. Intelligence report on WikiLeaks, Collateral Murder, the Afghan War Diary, the Iraq War Logs, and Cablegate, Assange had made some powerful enemies, but even political figures calling his assassination didn’t rouse the Australian government’s interest. After being questioned about comments — made by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and the former senior advisor to the Canadian prime minister, Tom Flanagan — that Assange should be “hunted down” and assassinated, then-Minister of Foreign Affairs Kevin Rudd essentially responded that any threats that had occurred should be referred to the United States and Canada.

In the Senate, former Senator Scott Ludlam who fought tirelessly for Assange over the years, tried to address the threats Assange was facing on several occasions, including the possibility of being “transferred without any due process,” also known as “temporary surrender.” During a May 2012 Senate hearing, Ludlam asked the AFP if it would get involved in any situation in which an Australian citizen was being threatened with assassination or extrajudicial killing overseas, to which AFP Commissioner Negus admitted that AFP would need a referral from the Minister of Foreign Affairs — a referral that never came despite “repeated threats of assassination by senior American military officials and civilian political figures.”

﻿

And when then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard was confronted with a question about “senior figures in the United States” calling for Assange’s assassination, Gillard effectively ignored the question and responded with the government’s usual rhetoric, “The Australian government cannot interfere in the judicial processes of other countries,” as if death threats fell under this category.

Stratfor and the sealed indictment

On February 27, 2012, WikiLeaks started publishing over five million leaked emails from Stratfor, a private global intelligence firm located in Texas, called The Global Intelligence Files. One email in particular, written by Stratfor’s Chief Security Officer Fred Burton, stood out: “Not for Pub — We have a sealed indictment on Assange. Pls protect.”

Although Burton’s statement looks like a slam dunk on whether or not evidence exists that the U.S. has charged Assange, the Australian government doesn’t see it that way, nor has it ever.

Two days after WikiLeaks started publishing The Global Intelligence Files, Ludlam asked then-Senator Chris Evans, “How long has the prime minister known of the existence of this sealed indictment?” to which Evans responded, “The Australian government is not aware of any charges by the U.S. government against Mr. Assange.” Ludlam later retorted:

So, even though some ex-State Department guy in Texas running a little intelligence organisation apparently knows…the Australian government apparently does not.”

Three months later, Ludlam addressed the Stratfor email with former Senator Bob Carr, who had recently become Minister for Foreign Affairs:

Ludlam: “What can you tell us about the existence or otherwise of a sealed indictment issued by the United States Department of Justice, which would presumably come with an extradition order back to the United States?”

Carr: “We have seen no evidence that such a sealed indictment exists.”

Ludlam: “Have you sought such evidence?”

Carr: “We have not sought evidence.”

Documents released under a FOIA request show that in mid-2012, then-Minister for Foreign Affairs Kevin Rudd acknowledged that a secret grand jury had been impanelled in the Eastern District of Virginia, stating: “I understand that grand juries can issue indictments under seal, and that theoretically one could already have been issued for Mr. Assange.”

And yet a year later the Sydney Morning Herald reported that, when asked about the Australian government’s interest in whether or not there was still an ongoing U.S. grand jury investigation into Julian Assange and WikiLeaks’ activities, Carr responded that “no further inquiries would be made because it doesn’t affect Australian interest.” In an even more dismal display of non-support of an Australian citizen, he added that he wasn’t going to allocate any resources to it.

Julian Assange is a journalist

The day after the Stratfor release, Ludlam also moved for the Senate to recognize Assange as a journalist. But, despite his best efforts, to this day the Australian government refuses to do so regardless of Assange’s history: Assange was awarded The Economist New Media Award in 2008, the Amnesty International U.K. Media Award in 2009, and the Sam Adams Award, Le Monde Readers’ Choice Award for Person of the Year, and TIME Person of the Year in 2010.

He was also granted the Sydney Peace Foundation Gold Medal, the Australian Walkley Award, the Martha Gellhorn prize for journalism, the Italian International Piero Passetti Journalism Prize of the National Union of Italian Journalists, and the Spanish Jose Couso Press Freedom of Expression Award in 2011. Recently, he was nominated for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize.

But most importantly, on November 2, 2011, the Queen’s Bench Division of the British High Court recognized Assange as a journalist, as did a London tribunal during a FOIA case filed by journalist Stefania Maurizi. The tribunal also recognized WikiLeaks as a media organization.

The storming of the embassy

A few months after the Stratfor release, Assange lost his Supreme Court extradition appeal and immediately sought asylum from Ecuador. He entered the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, 2012, and, just one day before Ecuador was to publicly announce its decision to grant Assange asylum, things came to a boil. The U.K. threatened to storm the embassy.

Ecuador denounced the threats as “political suicide;” the MSM called the U.K.’s reckless move “unprecedented;” and WikiLeaks stated that it condemned “in the strongest possible terms the U.K.’s resort to intimidation.” But, despite the backlash, the U.K. defended its actions by resurrecting a 1987 British law about “revocation of diplomatic status of a building,” and reinforced its security detail around the embassy.

Former Ecuador Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino stated that any move to assault the embassy would be a “flagrant violation of the Vienna Convention,” and the Australian attorney general at the time, Nicola Roxon, commented that the DFAT’s consular services were limited but that she had an “absolute interest in the case.” Parliament was another story.

Ludlam addressed the Senate during the height of the crisis:

My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr. Minister, in response to several carloads of metropolitan police entering the building that houses the Ecuadorian Embassy in the middle of the night London time, cordoning off the street and threatening to break the door down and threatening to rezone the embassy, have you or the High Commissioner in London made representations to the United Kingdom to not violate the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations by entering the premises of the Ecuadorian embassy without the consent of the head of mission?”

Carr responded:

Australia, of course, is not a party to this decision. It is a matter between Mr. Assange and the governments of Ecuador and the United Kingdom…[the] Australian government cannot intervene in the U.K. legal process.”

First, the U.K.’s decision to storm a foreign country’s embassy makes everyone who’s party to the Vienna Convention party to the U.K.’s decision to violate that convention. The U.K.’s threats were not just a danger to Assange but, had they actually followed through with their threat, it would have been a serious violation of international law. Any state that is part of the Vienna Convention should have been concerned, including Australia. The fact that the Minister of Foreign Affairs wasn’t put off at all by these events speaks volumes about the political nature of Assange’s case.

The UN Working Group’s decision

The Australian government has stated on numerous occasions that it has reached out to foreign governments about Assange’s case but Parliament hearings and media reports tend to reflect that this generally means reiterating his right to due process, nothing more. Additionally, it’s questionable how much time the government spends doing that.

For instance, during a February 11, 2016 Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee hearing, then-DFAT’s First Assistant Secretary, Consular and Crisis Management Division, Jon Philp, admitted that the government had not been in contact with Swedish authorities since December 2011. That’s a more-than-five-year period during which Sweden dragged out its investigation by refusing to interview Assange in London, while Australia appears to have done literally nothing diplomatically in terms of the Swedish investigation.

Furthermore, when confronted with a 2015 report from the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention that stated Assange was (and still is) being arbitrarily detained, then-Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Varghese both declared that the decision was not legally binding and then admitted that the Australian government had made no “representations at all of any kind,” to Swedish or U.K. officials in terms of the ruling.

On May 31, 2017, Ludlam brought up the UN Working Group’s decision in front of the Senate committee, this time with regards to its subsequent 2016 finding that Assange was being arbitrarily detained and again Jon Philp — as well as former Senator George Brandis, who had become the attorney general by that time — maintained that the decision was not legally binding.

Ludlam responded: “That is remarkable. It is basically an entirely selective interpretation and selective respect and regard for important UN working groups.”

And although Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has been given credit for Assange’s new passport, on February 6, 2016, the day after the Working Group’s decision was released, Bishop released a statement confirming that she had read the report and was “seeking legal advice on its implications for Mr. Assange, as an Australian citizen.” However, a response to a FOIA request revealed that four days later both Jon Philp and the then-director of the Australian Passports Office advised the foreign minister on the UN decision:

We recommend we not seek to ‘resolve’ Mr. Assange’s case following the WGAD opinion, as we are unable to intervene in the due process of another country’s court proceedings or legal matters, and we have full confidence in the UK and Swedish judicial system.”

The FOIA documents also revealed that Bishop stated: “The U.K. and Sweden have rejected the WGAD opinion and, like Australia, do not recognise the opinion of the UN working groups as legally binding.” It would be another two and half years before Assange would be granted a new passport.

In 2016, Assange argued that the UN Working Group’s decisions were indeed legally binding, stating that they are “an opinio juris, which is higher in the hierarchy of international norms,” and that they are “part of the founding basis of the United Nations which the U.K. and Sweden are part of.” After former U.K. Foreign Minister Philip Hammond called the decision “ridiculous,” Assange shot back that the “lawfulness of my detention or otherwise is now a matter of settled law, adding:

They cannot now seek to object to the findings of a process which they themselves were involved in for 16 months. A jurisdiction which they submitted to, recognized, and, in part, founded together with their early involvement in the United Nations.” You can’t decide that you are going to recognize a forum, take place in proceedings, respond to the other party, and then at the end when you don’t like the outcome because you have been breaking the law and you don’t even bother to appeal, come out with press statements and say, ‘Well, we disagree,’ or engage in purely superfluous ad hominem attacks like saying that a finding is ‘ridiculous.’”

But object is exactly what everyone did. On June 19, 2017, Bishop reiterated that the decision wasn’t legally binding and pointed out that it was directed at the U.K. and Sweden, not Australia. She went on to say that Assange had avoided “lawful arrest” by remaining in the embassy and that the government cannot “intervene in the legal processes of another country.” But that’s exactly what Julie Bishop did with a another case.

Peter Greste

Peter Greste is an Australian journalist who was arrested by Egyptian authorities in 2013 and then charged and sentenced to seven years in prison on terrorism-related charges (in this case, reporting). At the time of Greste’s arrest, Julie Bishop indulged the public with the government’s usual rhetoric, “It is not possible for another nation to interfere in the criminal proceedings of another country.” However, she added, “we will continue to press our position that he should be given conditional release while we consider what more we can do to seek his release overall,” despite the fact of an ongoing court case. There’s more.

In a 2015 sit-down aired by ABC News between Bishop and Greste after his early release, Bishop told him that the Australian government made “representations to the Egyptian authorities” that their retrial of Greste “should not have gone ahead.” Bishop also stated:

I spoke to [Egyptian] Foreign Minister [Sameh] Shoukry on July 16 and set out quite plainly Australia’s position, that we wanted you to be able to clear your name, that we would not accept the verdict as being evidence of your guilt, and that it would have ramifications for the relationship and for Egypt’s reputation more generally.”

“[R]amifications for the relationship and for Egypt’s reputation more generally.” It appears that Australia absolutely interfered in the legal process of a foreign state by pressuring or, rather, threatening Egypt with ramifications. Not only that, Bishop went on to say that the Australian government put forth a “concerted campaign of advocacy” involving “high-level diplomatic contacts with the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and countries in the Middle East.”

In a 2014 hearing, former Australian Greens Senator Christine Milne stated:

It is well worth nothing that this is also about the safety of journalists and a free and fair press. Mr. Greste has worked for Reuters, for CNN, for the BBC; he is a well-known, respected journalist accused of very serious crimes. I do not want to see a situation — as occurred previously with Colin Russell — where there is not the level of political engagement that is necessary. I call on the prime minister to intervene in the case of Peter Greste as soon as he possibly can, because the charges that Peter Greste now faces are serious…I believe he was doing his job as a journalist and we should support him in what he was doing. As an Australian citizen, we should stand up for him.”

Note that there is no mention of Julian Assange. And this from Senator Mitch Fifield:

The Australian government is deeply concerned about the ongoing detention of Mr. Peter Greste by Egyptian authorities. Mr. Greste was detained, along with his colleagues, during the normal course of his work as a journalist. Journalists have a legitimate role to play in any democracy…The Minister for Foreign Affairs has raised Mr. Greste’s case directly with Egypt’s foreign minister and the Egyptian ambassador to Australia, and will continue to do so.”

Again, former Senator Milne:

I believe they [consular staff] are doing everything they possibly can to serve the best interests of Peter Greste and everything they can to argue for his release. But this is not about the consular staff; this is about where the politics takes it. The Prime Minister needs to reassure Peter Greste’s family that, at the highest levels of this government, as well as through the Parliament, everybody stands behind Peter Greste and that we are all doing all we can to get Peter Greste home as quickly as possible.”

Former Senator Jane Prentice even noted that the Australian government had created a “multi-pronged strategy” to assist Greste, which included “making direct and high-level representation to a number of other governments.”

And after Greste was convicted by an Egyptian court and sentenced, then-attorney general for Australia, George Brandis, stated: “The government will be lodging a formal request imminently with President el-Sisi, seeking his intervention in the matter.”

If that isn’t interference in a legal process, I don’t know what is. And this case is a perfect example of why the Australian government refuses to recognize Assange as a journalist.

The passport

Despite any reservations the Australian government may have had about issuing Assange a new passport, those concerns appear to have absolutely nothing to do with any charges filed by the United States or issued by a U.S. grand jury. In a more recent hearing on October 25, 2018, DFAT Chief Legal Officer James Larsen confirmed that Assange had been issued a passport. At the same time, DFAT First Assistant Secretary, Consular and Crisis Management Division, Andrew Todd argued that Assange should hand himself over to U.K. authorities, despite being reminded that the potential exists for Assange to be extradited.

The same message permeated throughout a Senate hearing just last week where Larsen, Todd, and former Minister of Defence, Senator Marise Ann Payne, who is currently serving as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, argued that Assange is not being arbitrarily detained; he can leave the embassy whenever he wants (and that he should leave); they are not aware of any U.S. charges against him; and that they are in no position to interfere in his legal matters. So, despite being fully aware that Assange will likely be extradited to the U.S. to face the Trump administration’s persecution of journalists and America’s long-reaching arm of the law, his home country is essentially pushing for that very outcome.

Furthermore, during the October 25th hearing, Todd admitted that he wasn’t aware of “any discussion about a pathway” to bring Assange home; and just last week, Larsen couldn’t answer whether or not the government had sought assurances that an extradition notice doesn’t exist. It’s not surprising that the Australian government doesn’t want to show its hand but, despite its best efforts, WikiLeaks has been happy to do it for them.

In a December 1, 2010 Stratfor email released by WikiLeaks, Stratfor employee Lena Bell wrote:

Basic fact is that any move to arrest the guy (assuming they get an indictment for him) would require that a friendly government do it and then extradite him. Nick Miller told me the Australians have already offered to do this, as Assange is an Australian citizen, and Australia is the Canada of the southern hemisphere when it comes to its relations with the U.S.”

If this information is true, it shows that after the AFP had already found that Assange had broken no laws, the Australian government was willing to conjure up charges in order to hand him over to the United States.

Just yesterday The New York Times reported that Chelsea Manning has received a subpoena to testify before a grand jury. Although they reported that it’s unknown what prosecutors want to ask her, the subpoena was issued in the Eastern District of Virginia — the same district where a secret grand jury allegedly issued a sealed indictment for Assange, as well as where a cut-and-paste error last year inadvertently revealed Assange’s name in filed court documents, setting off alarm bells that indeed the U.S. had secretly charged the Australian journalist and publisher.

According to the Times article, “there are multiple reasons to believe that the subpoena is related to the investigation of Mr. Assange,” and there have been indications prosecutors want to talk to her about pertinent past statements that Manning has made. Additionally, according to Julian Assange’s 2013 affidavit, the case number on Manning’s subpoena, “10GJ3793,” matches the grand jury’s case number in the Eastern District of Virginia. More documents on the case can be found through web.archive.org.

It seems likely that the Trump administration is reexamining options to charge Assange for allegedly taking an active role in helping Manning procure documents that she then leaked to WikiLeaks.

So, with Australia’s long-standing history of denying any evidence that suggests the U.S. has charged their own citizen; taking a backseat to historical attacks against a journalist; encouraging their own citizen to risk extradition to the United States; failing to do all that it can to help Assange get home; and engaging in standardized rhetoric while taking a passive stance in Assange’s case, in order to remain in the employ of the United States — one has to wonder why Australia reissued Assange a passport and whether it’s really safe for him to go home at all.

The club is asking the city to extend its lease by an additional 18 years, from 2051 to 2069, at a cost of $870,000.

Craig Trendel, volunteer president of the Mayfair, said that the longer-term lease would allow the club to secure investment so it can move forward with renovations.

Monday, city council's executive committee heard from both interests: golf club shareholders and members of the public pushing to turn the land into public use.

Coun. Ben Henderson put forward a motion that the Mayfair match the lease the city now has with Highlands Golf Club, which opens the greens to public tee-off seven per cent of the total rounds of golf a year.

The city's last lease with Highlands dates back to 2006 and also runs until 2051.

""This isn't an ideal situation,"" Henderson noted. ""I think people are imagining that somehow, somehow or other the ability is there to turn back time, and we can't.""

""If we say 'no' outright, then there's a real chance that the asset can't be maintained.""

Craig Trendel, volunteer president of the Mayfair, said the club is transparent and willing to work with the city. (John Shypitka/CBC)

The Mayfair proposal includes a clause that would see the club offer ""public use of groomed ski trails located on the leased lands for the sole purpose of cross country skiing from December 1 to March 31.""

Trendel attended the committee meeting to show the club is transparent and willing to work with the city.

""It's about finding that right balance,"" he said. ""So I think we're close and I'm sure we'll get something that everybody can live with.""

He said that providing groomed cross-country skiing trails was ""not insignificant"" to the club's operations.

""There will be some investment — potentially some liability — we have to sort all those things out,"" Trendel said.

Henderson's motion also calls for the club to consider added amenities, like public washrooms for cross-country skiers.

Royal Mayfair Club has been a good partner and a good steward of the land - Don Iveson, Edmonton Mayor

The club boasts banquet rooms for rent and hosts some charity events throughout the year.

It hosted the CN Canadian Women's Open in 2013.

Mayor Don Iveson called the relationship with the club a mutually beneficial deal.

""Royal Mayfair Club has been a good partner and a good steward of the land,"" he said. ""It has worked with the city in good faith, for decades.""

Eric Gormley advocates for the land to be turned over to public control by the end of the current lease at 2051.

""Our main issue is it's not public, it's part of the river valley. The river valley is supposed to be for the public use for everybody.""

Like nearby Hawrelak Park, Gormley thinks the land could be used for festivals and recreation.

Kaiser Health News: Patients Experiment With Prescription Drugs To Fight Aging

Dr. Alan Green’s patients travel from around the country to his tiny practice in Queens, N.Y., lured by the prospect of longer lives. Over the past two years, more than 200 patients have flocked to see Green after learning that two drugs he prescribes could possibly stave off aging. One 95-year-old was so intent on keeping her appointment that she asked her son to drive her from Maryland after a snowstorm had closed the schools. (Taylor, 3/6)

Kaiser Health News: Cities And Counties Unlikely To Heed FDA Warning On Importing Foreign Drugs

Cities and local governments in several states said they will continue to use a Canadian company to offer employees prescription drugs at a highly reduced price, even though federal officials raised safety concerns about the practice last week. The municipalities use CanaRx, which connects their employees with brick-and-mortar pharmacies in Canada, Great Britain and Australia to fill prescriptions. (Galewitz, 3/6)

California Healthline: California Looks To Lead Nation In Unraveling Childhood Trauma

Imagine identifying a toxin so potent it could rewire a child’s brain and erode his immune system. A substance that, in high doses, tripled the risk of heart disease and lung cancer and reduced life expectancy by 20 years. And then realizing that tens of millions of American children had been exposed. Dr. Nadine Burke Harris, California’s newly appointed surgeon general, will tell you this is not a hypothetical scenario. She is a leading voice in a movement trying to transform our understanding of how the traumatic experiences that affect so many American children can trigger serious physical and mental illness.

The New York Times: F.D.A. Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, Who Fought Teenage Vaping, Resigns

Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, known for his aggressive efforts to regulate the tobacco and e-cigarette industries, said on Tuesday that he would resign at the end of the month. The reason he gave was family and his weariness with commuting to see his wife and three children, who have remained in their Westport, Conn. home since he took office. But his announcement caught many in Washington and the industries he regulates by surprise and raised questions about whether his push to reduce teenage vaping and lower nicotine levels and ban menthol in cigarettes will continue in an administration that generally has a hands-off approach to business. (Kaplan and Hoffman, 3/5)

Reuters: U.S. FDA Chief Tough On E-Cigs Steps Down In Surprise Resignation

Gottlieb was well regarded by public health advocates and won bipartisan support for his efforts to curb use of flavored e-cigarettes by youths, speed approval times for cheap generic medicines to increase competition and bring down drug prices, and boost the use of cheaper versions of expensive biotech medicines called biosimilars.

President Donald Trump tapped Gottlieb in 2017 to “cut red tape” at the FDA. But Gottlieb bucked expectations by pushing the agency to expand its authorities in several key ways, including an unprecedented effort to make cigarettes less addictive by requiring lower nicotine levels. The 46-year-old physician and former conservative pundit advanced his agenda while managing to maintain the support of the president, Republicans and key Democrats in Congress. (Perrone, 3/5)

His exit will take effect sometime over the next month, after which he is likely to seek a post in the private sector, according to people familiar with his plans. “All of us at HHS are proud of the remarkable work Commissioner Gottlieb has done at the FDA,” Mr. Azar said. “He has been an exemplary public-health leader, aggressive advocate for American patients and passionate promoter of innovation.” (Burton and Maloney, 3/5)

Scott Gottlieb is stepping down as leader of the FDA — and many in health and medicine quickly turned to Twitter to express their displeasure. Gottlieb, who has served as the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration since May 2017, announced on Tuesday that he plans to leave his post in one month. During his tenure, the FDA broke annual records for generic drug approvals, cracked down on unproven stem cell treatments, and took new steps to curb youth e-cigarette use. (Thielking, 3/5)

Modern Healthcare: Mental Health Coverage Case Lost By UnitedHealth Unit For Denying Claims

A federal judge ruled Tuesday that United Behavioral Health breached its fiduciary duty to patients by using unreasonable and overly restrictive guidelines to make coverage decisions for tens of thousands of mental health and substance abuse patients. The decision, if upheld on appeal, could have wide ramifications of what insurers must cover in the fast-growing behavioral healthcare sector.The case stems from two consolidated class-action lawsuits filed in 2014 against UnitedHealth Group's United Behavioral Health, the nation's largest behavioral health insurer.

U.S. Chief Magistrate Judge Joseph C.

In his 106-page decision, Judge Spero described the company’s guidelines as “unreasonable and an abuse of discretion” and having been “infected” by financial incentives meant to restrict access to care. “There is an excessive emphasis on addressing acute symptoms and stabilizing crises while ignoring the effective treatment of members’ underlying conditions,” he said. He dismissed much of the testimony by UnitedHealth’s experts as “evasive — and even deceptive.” (Abelson, 3/5)

The Associated Press: FDA Allows Treatment Of Depression With Club Drug's Cousin

A mind-altering medication related to the club drug Special K won U.S. approval Tuesday for patients with hard-to-treat depression, the first in a series of long-overlooked substances being reconsidered for severe forms of mental illness. The nasal spray from Johnson & Johnson is a chemical cousin of ketamine, which has been used for decades as a powerful anesthetic to prepare patients for surgery. (3/5)

The New York Times: Fast-Acting Depression Drug, Newly Approved, Could Help Millions

The move heralds a shift from the Prozac era of antidepressant drugs. The newly approved treatment, called esketamine, is a nasal spray developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., a branch of Johnson & Johnson, that will be marketed under the name Spravato. It contains an active portion of the ketamine molecule, whose antidepressant properties are not well understood yet. “Thank goodness we now have something with a different mechanism of action than previous antidepressants,” said Dr. Erick Turner, a former F.D.A. reviewer and an associate professor of psychiatry at Oregon Health & Science University. “But I’m skeptical of the hype, because in this world it’s like Lucy holding the football for Charlie Brown: Each time we get our hopes up, the football gets pulled away.” (Carey, 3/5)

The label for the drug will carry a black box warning – the most serious safety warning issued by the FDA. It will caution users they could experience sedation and problems with attention, judgment and thinking, and that there’s potential for abuse and suicidal thoughts. People who take esketamine will have to be monitored for at least two hours after receiving a dose to guard against some of these side effects. (Johnson and McGinley, 3/5)

But esketamine presents some challenges because of its similarities to ketamine. In high doses, both drugs can cause sedation and out-of-body experiences.

The Wall Street Journal: FDA Approves Controversial Drug For Depression

The discovery that ketamine can help ease symptoms of depression—and within hours, rather than the weeks required for antidepressants such as Prozac or Zoloft—has shaken up the field of psychiatry. Ketamine targets a different receptor in the brain and appears to have a more direct effect than those drugs. “It really has opened up a whole new way of thinking about depression,” Gerard Sanacora, professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine and director of the Yale Depression Research Program, said of ketamine. Dr. Sanacora was an investigator on some of J&J’s clinical trials of Spravato. (McKay and Loftus, 3/5)

Thousands, perhaps millions, of people who try to quit antidepressant drugs experience stinging withdrawal symptoms that last for months to years: insomnia, surges of anxiety, even so-called brain zaps, sensations of electric shock in the brain. But doctors have dismissed or downplayed such symptoms, often attributing them to the recurrence of underlying mood problems. The striking contrast between the patients’ experience and their doctors’ judgment has stirred heated debate in Britain, where last year the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists publicly denied claims of lasting withdrawal in “the vast majority of patients.” (Carey, 3/5)

The New York Times: Border At ‘Breaking Point’ As More Than 76,000 Migrants Cross In A Month

The number of migrant families crossing the southwest border has once again broken records, with unauthorized entries nearly doubling what they were a year ago, suggesting that the Trump administration’s aggressive policies have not discouraged new migration to the United States. More than 76,000 migrants crossed the border without authorization in February, an 11-year high and a strong sign that stepped-up prosecutions, new controls on asylum and harsher detention policies have not reversed what remains a powerful lure for thousands of families fleeing violence and poverty.

The New York Times: More Migrants Are Crossing The Border This Year. What’s Changed?

President Trump has tried to halt the arrival of undocumented migrants by beefing up border security, limiting who qualifies for asylum and, for a while, separating migrant children from their parents at the border. However, figures released on Tuesday suggest that those measures are failing to deter tens of thousands of migrants from journeying over land to the United States. Indeed, after shriveling to the smallest total in five decades, the number of migrants intercepted at the southern border — the best indicator of how many undocumented people are entering the United States — is soaring again.

A sort of electric hope hangs in the air, said Dr. Steve Deeks, an AIDS specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, who is attending the gathering: “The whole approach to a cure is shifting more from aspiration to something that people are realizing could be feasible.” It is a hope that must be tempered with realism: H.I.V. is a wily adversary, and scientists and patients living with the virus are all too well acquainted with past failures in the fight against the epidemic.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada’s President of the Treasury Board resigned from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cabinet on Monday, the second minister to leave in the wake of a political scandal that has roiled Trudeau’s tenure months before an October election.

Jane Philpott’s resignation follows the departure of former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, who testified last week that government officials inappropriately pressured her to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin avoid a corruption trial.

“I have been considering the events that have shaken the federal government in recent weeks and after serious reflection, I have concluded that I must resign as a member of Cabinet,” Philpott said in a statement released on Twitter.",Second Canadian cabinet minister resigns over SNC-Lavalin scandal,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-politics-snc-lavalin-resignati-idUSKCN1QL23T

Lawyers for Meng Wanzhou said Sunday they filed a notice of civil claim in the British Columbia Supreme Court. Canada arrested Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, at the request of the U.S. on Dec. 1 at Vancouver’s airport. She is wanted on fraud charges that she misled banks about the company’s business dealings in Iran.

The suit alleges that instead of immediately arresting her, authorities interrogated Meng “under the guise of a routine customs” examination and used the opportunity to “compel her to provide evidence and information.” The suit alleges Canada Border Service Agency agents seized her electronic devices, obtained passwords and unlawfully viewed the contents and intentionally failed to adviser her of the true reasons for her detention. The suit said only after three hours was she told she was under arrest and had right to counsel.

“This case concerns a deliberate and pre-meditated effort on the part of the defendant officers to obtain evidence and information from the plaintiff in a manner which they knew constituted serious violations of the plaintiff’s rights,” the claim says.

Meng is out on bail and living in Vancouver awaiting extradition proceedings.

On Friday, Canadian Justice Department officials gave the go-ahead for her extradition proceedings to begin. Meng is due in court Wednesday to set a date for the proceedings to start. It could be several months or even years before her case is resolved.

Meng’s arrest set off a diplomatic furor and severely strained Canadian relations with China. Beijing has accused Washington of a politically motivated attempt to hurt the company.

China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on Dec. 10 in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.

A Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier. Kovrig and Spavor haven’t had access to a lawyer or to their families since being arrested.

Nicholas Dorion, a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency, said it’s not a practice of the agency to comment ?on legal matters that are before the courts. A justice department spokesman referred comment to the border agency and a spokesman of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they were unlikely to comment Sunday.

Gary Botting, a Vancouver extradition lawyer who is not representing Meng, said Canada’s Border Services Agency tends to overstep.

“They took her under custody without telling her why,” Botting said. “They disguised the real reason why they detained her. Her rights were violated.”

Botting said they had no reason to detain her as she had travelled to Canada many times before. “They are trying to get all this information ahead of time and they know ultimately an arrest was in the works,” he said.

Julian Ku, senior associate dean for academic affairs at Hofstra Law, noted the civil action is separate and apart from Meng’s extradition proceeding. He said the lawsuit will allow her to argue she is being unfairly treated and support her broader public relations claim that the detention is part of a U.S and Canadian political conspiracy against Huawei.","Huawei CFO Meng Wangzhou suing Canada, its border agency and the RCMP - Toronto Sun",Canoe.com,https://canoe.com/news/national/huawei-cfo-meng-wangzhou-suing-canada-its-border-agency-and-the-rcmp

It’s risky to predict how this will all play out, both in the short term and for October’s federal election. That’s in part because those outcomes will likely be affected by a series of investigations, both active and proposed, into the actions of the prime minister and his aides.

It’s also where other key players are set to appear, notably Gerald Butts, Mr. Trudeau’s friend who stepped down last month as his top political adviser amid the scandal.

But the justice committee isn’t set up to run a full-scale investigation. It has neither a team of people digging up evidence, nor the power to order up internal government documents.

Jared Kushner’s clearance level raises questions; Canada’s prime minister faces an ill-timed accusation.

Trump reportedly gave his son-in-law top clearance

Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, got a top-secret security clearance despite objections from key White House officials because the president himself ordered it, according to a report Thursday from the New York Times. [NYT / Maggie Haberman, Michael S. Schmidt, Adam Goldman, and Annie Karni]

Trump has the “absolute right” to grant security clearances, according to a response from White House adviser Kellyanne Conway on Friday — and she’s right. However, it’s a problem if Trump denied White House recommendations and gave the clearance anyway. Conway did not reveal whether she knew if Trump had ordered the top clearance for Kushner. [The Hill / Jordan Fabian]

The House Oversight Committee started an investigation into clearances in January. Following this week’s report, committee chair Elijah Cummings announced on Friday he wants to dig deeper into the matter. The White House has not initiated any interviews with the committee concerning the matter, nor made materials that refute reports of its clearance practices available. [NPR / Philip Ewing]

Kushner had an “interim top-secret” clearance that was demoted to a “secret” level in February 2018. His initial clearance was delayed when the FBI and CIA questioned Kushner’s business contacts in foreign countries, including Israel and Russia. He apparently also did not disclose meetings with foreign actors. Kushner met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman this week. [Vanity Fair / Bess Levin]

Both President Trump and Ivanka Trump have defended Kushner, who has been traveling from country to country in the effort to forge a Middle East peace plan. As he meets with top officials abroad, his potentially top-security clearance is important. The extent to which he can negotiate with America’s secrets is not known. [NYMag / Frank Rich]

Trudeau denies turning a trial into a political issue

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has denied accusations that he interfered in a legal case — just eight months before a national election. Trudeau’s former justice minister and Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould testified on Thursday that the PM and his colleagues pushed her to not prosecute a top employer in the Quebec province. [WSJ / Paul Vieira and Kim Mackrael]

Trudeau’s political opponents also issued a letter on Thursday calling for an investigation and the PM’s resignation. This came one day after Wilson-Raybould testified that she had been pursuing corruption charges against the construction firm SNC-Lavalin when Trudeau pressured her to arrange a plea deal with the company, an employer in his hometown. [Politico / Alexander Panetta]

Wilson-Raybould provided notes from phone calls and meetings in which Trudeau and his aides tried to convince her that prosecuting the company would threaten Canadian jobs — and important votes. SNC-Lavalin reportedly faces charges for $36 million in bribes it allegedly offered Libyan officials. [BBC]

On top of it all, China is using the SNC-Lavalin case to talk about Canada’s arrest of Meng Wanzhou, CFO of the mobile giant Huawei. Trudeau claims Wanzhou was arrested in compliance with an extradition treaty with the US and his country won’t interfere in the case. On Friday, a Chinese Communist Party spokesperson was asked if it were hypocritical that Trudeau would interfere with the SNC-Lavalin case but deny getting involved in the Huawei case. The spokesperson replied that attention was on the precedent Canada would set. [Washington Post / Emily Rauhala]

Now Trudeau’s prime ministership faces a rocky future. Wilson-Raybould was demoted after the SNC-Lavalin situation, and she later quit the cabinet. Trudeau admitted that he asked the former AG to protect the company but said he didn’t pressure her. Opposition could call for an early election to be held before October 2019.

America First Action is a Super PAC lacking the leader it needs to raise the $1 billion Trump wants for his 2020 presidential campaign. ACA needs a superior who is close both to Trump and GOP leadership — a difficult position to fill. [Politico / Alex Isenstadt and Gabby Orr]

With $2.16 billion in revenue, Lyft is growing a lot — and spending a lot, according to the ride-hailing company’s IPO files, which were made public on Friday. Lyft is expected to begin trading at the end of the month. [WSJ / Maureen Farrell]

Research finds that violent crime is highly concentrated in small areas of cities and perpetrated by very small numbers of people — so why are whole neighborhoods still painted as “dangerous”? [CityLab / Stephen Lurie]

The committee is investigating whether former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was pressured inappropriately by the Prime Minister's Office to allow the Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin to avoid a criminal trial on corruption charges related to contracts in Libya. Wilson-Raybould offered explosive testimony on the matter last week.

Gerald Butts, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's former top adviser, appeared before the committee in the morning to offer his side of the SNC-Lavalin story.

Here's how to re-watch CBC News' coverage:

Gerry Butts, Trudeau's close friend and former principal secretary, wrote to the committee chair, Liberal MP Anthony Housefather, stating that after watching the testimony of Jody Wilson-Raybould, he believes his evidence would be of assistance as the committee considers alleged interference into the decision to prosecute the Quebec-based engineering and construction company.

I just made the following request of the Justice Committee Chair. <a href=""https://t.co/MUCJwnldui"">pic.twitter.com/MUCJwnldui</a> —@gmbutts

""I need a short period of time to receive legal advice concerning my evidence and to be able to produce relevant documents to the committee,"" the wrote in the letter.

The committee agreed to hear from Butts and will invite him to appear next Wednesday. MPs will also call on Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick and Nathalie Drouin, the deputy minister of justice, back to testify.

Wernick and Drouin appeared last week.

Butts resigned from the PMO on Feb. 18 amid allegations he and others exerted political interference on Wilson-Raybould to override the Public Prosecution Service director's decision to prosecute SNC-Lavalin.

""At all times, I and those around me acted with integrity and a singular focus on the best interests of all Canadians,"" Butts said in a statement at the time.

Need for 'solution'

He said the swirling accusations were distracting from the ""vital work"" the prime minister and his staff were doing for Canadians.

""My reputation is my responsibility, and that is for me to defend. It is in the best interests of the office and its important work for me to step away,"" he said.

Trudeau was asked about his recent dealings with Butts today, and he confirmed that the last time the pair spoke was last Wednesday.

In her testimony to committee Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould detailed a meeting with Butts on Dec. 5, 2018. She said she wanted to speak about several things, including the barrage of people ""hounding"" her and her staff about the impact of prosecuting SNC-Lavalin.

""Towards the end of the meeting I raised how I needed everyone to stop talking to me about SNC as I had made up my mind and the engagements were inappropriate,"" she testified. ""Gerry then took over the conversation and said how we need a solution on the SNC stuff — he said I needed to find a solution.""

Jody Wilson-Raybould’s bombshell testimony prompted calls from the Conservative Party and the NDP to resign. 2:14

Wilson-Raybould said she was pressed by 11 PMO and other government officials, who continued to remind her of the economic and political consequences after she had made her independent decision as attorney general to proceed with the prosecution.

Liberal MP and justice committee chair Anthony Housefather issued a statement saying the committee needs more clarification after reviewing Wilson-Raybould's testimony.

""We believe that it is important that Mr. Butts respond to the account of the meeting of the 18th provided by Ms. Jody Wilson-Raybould, in addition to the other allegations about him and PMO colleagues mentioned in her testimony,"" the statement reads.

Given that Wernick and Drouin appeared prior to cabinet confidence, and solicitor client privilege on the SNC file was waived for testimony before the Committee, and the fact they were mentioned by Wilson-Raybould in relation to the December 19 phone call and subsequent events, the committee wants to hear their recollection of events and conversations, Housefather wrote.

""We will consider next steps following hearing from these witnesses,"" he said.

Conservative MP Michael Cooper tweeted that he wants to call Trudeau to testify for two hours. He also wants Wilson-Raybould to return to testify, without any constraints due to solicitor-client privilege or cabinet confidence.

The government tabled a broad waiver, but Wilson-Raybould said it still limited what she could say about her resignation from cabinet, as well as her time as veterans affairs minister.

A criminal conviction would have barred the company from bidding on government contracts for a decade, potentially leading to major job losses in Quebec, where it has its headquarters.

[You can read more here about the SNC-Lavalin case and how it has entangled Mr. Trudeau.]

Ms. Wilson-Raybould resisted the pressure, and quit the cabinet last month. Ms. Philpott was among the few cabinet ministers to publicly side with her.

“There can be a cost to acting on one’s principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them,” Ms. Philpott wrote in her resignation letter to Mr. Trudeau on Monday.

Privately, several members of his caucus have said Mr. Trudeau has badly fumbled his handling of the controversy. Publicly, though, they have spoken in solidarity with the prime minister.

Royce Koop, a political scientist at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, said that might now change.

“Philpott was really the talent pool of the Trudeau cabinet, she got things done,” he said. “The question now is do we now start to see the beginning of a caucus rebellion?

Trudeau's domestic troubles have attracted attention in Chinese state media due to his previous assertion that his government cannot interfere in the case of a senior Huawei executive arrested in Canada and now fighting extradition to the United States.

Canada is likely to announce on Friday that an extradition hearing against Meng Wanzhou, the telecommunication giant's chief financial officer, can proceed, legal experts said, worsening already icy relations with Beijing.

China has repeatedly called for the release of Meng, arrested in Vancouver in December at Washington's request. In late January the U.S. Justice Department charged Huawei and Meng with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.

At a regular daily news briefing in Beijing, China's Foreign Ministry took the opportunity to take Canada to task over possible double standards, by commenting on a domestic Canadian political issue that does not otherwise involve China.

Trudeau has disputed allegations by his former justice minister that government officials inappropriately pressured her to help the SNC-Lavalin construction firm avoid a corruption trial.

Asked by a state media journalist if it was contradictory for Trudeau to say he couldn't interfere in Meng's case while his government is accused of trying to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he ""really liked this question.""

""Of course I think that this is a question that should be asked of the Canadian government,"" Lu said.

""In fact on this case you have mentioned, people in Canada are paying it a great deal of attention,"" he added. ""In fact, not only Chinese and Canadian citizens, but the whole world are extremely interested to hear how the Canadian government answers this question.""

Both Meng and Huawei have denied the U.S. allegations.

Ottawa has until midnight on Friday to announce whether it will issue an authority to proceed, which would allow a court in British Columbia to start a formal extradition hearing.

Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland has stressed that Canada is a ""rule of law"" country and is acting without political interference in the extradition case of Meng.

""In the Meng case, our government has been scrupulous,"" she said during an interview Thursday with CBC Radio's Ottawa Morning. ""Decisions that are correctly taken at the official, ie. non-political level have been scrupulously taken at the official, non-political level, and there has been no interference, political element to the decision.""

Tracking public opinion in such a fluid situation is a lot like trying to hit a moving target.

But as the controversy unfolds, how are Canadians reacting on a week-to-week, and even day-to-day basis?

Abacus Data has been surveying Canadians consistently over the last few weeks, providing before-and-after snapshots of public opinion at key moments of the saga: the initial breaking of the story in the Globe and Mail, former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould's resignation from cabinet, the resignation of the prime minister's principal secretary Gerald Butts, the testimony of Wilson-Raybould and even this week's departure of Jane Philpott from the Liberal cabinet.

The polling numbers show that the Liberals' support is in decline — and that Justin Trudeau himself may be taking the biggest hit. But the numbers also suggest that the party may have hit a floor.

In the wake of Wilson-Raybould's testimony on Feb. 27, the Conservatives opened a seven-point lead over the Liberals in Abacus's polling. But since then, that lead has dwindled to two points.

To go through the polling numbers, Abacus Data CEO David Coletto joins host and CBC polls analyst Éric Grenier on this week's episode of the Pollcast podcast.
