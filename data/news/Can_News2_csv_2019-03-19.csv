A Toronto TV station quoted one man: “It’s a humiliation. Is this because we are of Arab origin? The government said ‘trust us’ and this is the trust I put in them?” It soon became public knowledge—although this, too, was never officially confirmed—that nearly half of the evacuees returned home to Lebanon within the month.

Comments like that did not sit well with many people back in Canada. Some politicians and commentators began to speak of “Canadians of convenience”: people who lived permanently abroad, did not pay Canadian taxes, and remembered their Canadian citizenship only when they needed rescue.

As a partial step to addressing these complaints, the government took steps to tighten rules about expatriate citizenship. It began for the first time to seriously enforce the ban on voting by long-term expatriates, people who had lived outside Canada for five years or longer. As Canada headed into a federal election in 2011 under the new rules, two expatriate Canadians filed a lawsuit to demand restoration of their voting rights. That litigation wended its way through the judicial system. In January 2019, the Supreme Court of Canada pronounced an answer: All Canadian citizens may vote in Canadian elections, no matter how long they have lived outside the country. The text of the decision would seem to apply even to those Canadian citizens who have never lived in Canada at all, or who have acquired nationality in another country.

Even before the decision, the Liberal government of Justin Trudeau had moved ahead with legislation. I number among those supposedly benefited by the new legislation. In November 2018, I testified to the Canadian Senate against it.

My advice went unheeded, obviously. Yet it’s still worth thinking together: How is democracy supposed to work in a world of dissolving national boundaries and proliferating dual, triple, and quadruple citizenships?

Perhaps you think of Canada as an immigration magnet, but Canada also exports people in large numbers: perhaps 2.8 million people, or about 9 percent of the country’s population. (In contrast, only about 9 million nonmilitary Americans live abroad, or less than 3 percent of the U.S. population.)

Naturalized Canadians are three times as likely to live outside Canada as native-born Canadians, according to the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada. About 24 percent of immigrants from Hong Kong return to the territory after acquiring Canadian citizenship, as do 30 percent of immigrants from Taiwan.

You can see the appeal. Hong Kong’s economy is growing much faster than Canada’s. Its income-tax rates top out at 17 percent. Canada does not tax the foreign-source income of nonresident citizens, in effect creating a geopolitical arbitrage opportunity too attractive to miss: the protections of Canadian nationality at low Hong Kong prices.",What Does It Mean to Be a Canadian Citizen?,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/should-expats-always-be-able-vote-home-country/583318/

DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Jagmeet Singh faces the biggest test of his NDP leadership in a by-election on Monday as he vies for a seat in the House of Commons.

The Burnaby South vote in the Vancouver region is one of three by-elections taking place on Monday, with others north of Toronto and in Montreal. The votes come just six months before campaigning is likely to officially begin for the general federal election.

Much is at stake for Mr. Singh, who was elected leader of the NDP in the fall of 2017 on a decisive first-ballot victory. Previous NDP leader Tom Mulcair said in January that it would be difficult for Mr. Singh to stay on as leader if he loses Burnaby South. Mr. Singh at the time insisted he would lead the NDP this fall regardless of the by-election result. The 40-year-old has struggled at times as party leader: He has been criticized for low poll numbers and poor fundraising.

Brad Lavigne, who helped orchestrate Jack Layton’s orange wave in 2011 as NDP campaign chief, said on Sunday that a victory in the by-election would be essential to unite the NDP.

Mr. Lavigne said Mr. Singh has poured considerable personal energy into the riding, through extensive door-knocking and meetings with constituents. The riding has voted NDP in the past on a federal and provincial level. The B.C. NDP dominated Burnaby when John Horgan was elected in 2017, and on Saturday the Premier on Twitter called on voters to get to the polls to back Mr. Singh.

The Burnaby South contest has been turbulent. The Liberals’ first candidate, Karen Wang, stepped down after a social media post on the social messaging app WeChat that zeroed in on Mr. Singh’s ethnicity and highlighted that she was only candidate of Chinese ethnicity. A recent all-candidates’ debate became heated on issues of race and immigration.

Richard T. Lee is the new Liberal candidate. Jay Shin is running for the Conservatives. Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson represents the upstart People’s Party of Canada. The Greens chose not to run a candidate against Mr. Singh.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced criticism last fall for delaying a by-election call after the NDP’s Kennedy Stewart vacated the Burnaby South seat in September to become the mayor of Vancouver.

Mr. Singh said voters are “very disappointed” in Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal government.

“It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation,” said Mr. Singh, referring to the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Story continues below advertisement

Political scientist Richard Johnston at the University of British Columbia said the SNC-Lavalin case could be a “gift” for Mr. Singh, because it could turn some potential Liberal voters to the NDP.

David Moscrop, a political scientist at the University of Ottawa, said it is unclear whether Mr. Singh should stay on as leader of the NDP if he lost.

“There’s this assumption that if he lost the by-election, he couldn’t show his face in the general election. I don’t think Canadians would really care,” Mr. Moscrop said. “The NDP caucus might see things differently.”

In 2015, the NDP barely won Burnaby South, as the Liberals had a strong showing in the province when Mr. Trudeau swept to power. Mr. Stewart, who had won a close race in Burnaby-Douglas in 2011, won 35.1 per cent of the vote in Burnaby South, ahead of the Liberals’ 33.9 per cent. The margin was 547 votes. The Conservatives had 27.1 per cent of the vote.

The Burnaby-South riding is an amalgam of two older ridings, the southern half of Burnaby-Douglas – where the NDP had a long, but narrow, hold on power federally – and the western half of Burnaby-New Westminster – where the NDP had a long, and mostly dominant, hold on power federally.

Germany's Alternative For Germany (AfD) party (previously) are an insurgent neofascist movement with ties to senior mainstream politicians and the country's super-wealthy would-be oligarchs; the party put on a hard push in the the 2018 Bavarian elections and their meme warfare was full of familiar voter-suppression tactics, from garden-variety disinformation to exhortations to stay home on election day.

Also prominent in the group's messaging: hashtags and tropes from the US far-right conspiracy theory Qanon (previously), an incoherent toxic stew of antisemitism, murder accusations, numerology, Islamophobia, and other pathologies of the moment.

The connection between Qanon and AfD comes from an unreleased report from the London School of Economics-affiliated Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which bills itself as an ""anti-extremist think tank""; some details of the study have been reported in the German and US press.

The researchers traced the inclusion of Qanon-affiliated hashtags in AfD social media, including German translations and adaptations of popular Qanon tags (e.g. #linksliegenlassen, #MerkelMussWeg); as with the US-based Qanon activists, the German Qanon phenomenon was driven by small numbers of incredibly prolific social media users -- not bots (Erin Gallagher's research found that Qanon tweeters posting 500+ messages/day were often ""older retired people with a lot of free time"").

There's evidence that US-based Qanon activists forged alliances with German neofascists; some popular fascist hashtags (""#ChemnitzIstDerAnfang"") originated with US Qanon accounts.

Qanon is becoming a kind of ideological signifier among far-right groups: members of the far-right who have adopted the yellow vest for street demonstrations in Canada and the UK have been spotted decorating the vests with Qanon memes and carrying Qanon-boosting signs. Qanon networks have also been used to boost the virality of racist videos.

I think far-right extremism is the intersection of garden-variety bigotry/xenophobia with economic precarity and a breakdown of the epistemological consensus about what constitutes a reliable indicator that something is true.

Xenophobia and bigotry are always around, but they surge when people feel afraid for their overall economic circumstances, and that surge has been supercharged by decades of both scientific denialism (well-funded campaigns to sow doubt about the motives of climate scientists, doctors who warn of the link between smoking and cancer, etc) and corruption -- for example, anti-vax builds on the assertion that experts have corrupt motives and that regulators are so captured that they let them get away with murder. The thing is, regulators really are that captured.

I can't say for sure that a more equitable economic system -- which would cut off the resources used by corporate influences to distort policy, and by ideological entrepreneurs to push expensive, profitable scientific denial -- would neutralize the far-right, but I think it's worth a try.

The crossover between QAnon and far-right German movements like the Chemnitz riots makes sense. Both movements are aggressively anti-Muslim and anti-refugee. And both make vague gestures toward a right-wing revolution. “At the time I got the impression that some people thought Chemnitz was going to be ‘Germany's great awakening,’” Gallagher said, referencing QAnon’s promise of a “great awakening” in America. It’s a trend she’s previously observed, as America’s alt-right moved on to trolling on behalf of their counterparts in Europe after Trump’s victory in 2016. “I've noticed crossover of US alt-right networks with European alt-right for a long time,” she said. “How QAnon fits into all that is a great question, but the international alt-right coordinated swarms—QAnon related or not—do not surprise me.”

Juan Guaidó, the Venezuelan parliament leader who many countries now recognize as the country’s interim president, has worked with the U.S. government to bring millions of dollars worth of aid to the country, where a humanitarian crisis has driven millions to the edge of starvation and forced more than 3 million people – one tenth of the population – to flee. Trucks and warehouses filled with food, medicine and other supplies now sit at several locations just outside the country – in the Colombian border city of Cúcuta, at points along the southern border with Brazil and on the nearby island of Curaçao.

But Maduro, who has refused to abandon the presidency and retains the support of Venezuela’s powerful military, is refusing to let the aid in. He says it is an attempt “to humiliate the Venezuelan people” and has labelled the food “carcinogenic.” On Wednesday he banned all travel to Curaçao and on Thursday closed the border with Brazil. There, soldiers opened fire on civilians who tried to reopen it to get the aid in, killing two indigenous people.

Despite all that, Guaidó has promised the aid will get into Venezuela “one way or another” by Saturday. As aid amasses on the border and Maduro’s military prepares to face-off with Guaidó supporters, here’s what to know about the stand-off:

Why do Venezuelans need humanitarian aid?

Venezuela’s current crisis dates back to its Socialist Revolution in 1998, led by Maduro’s predecessor and mentor Hugo Chávez, who was elected on a platform of eliminating poverty. For years he used Venezuela’s vast oil wealth (the country has the largest proven reserves in the world) to fund expansive social programs, such as subsidized utilities and free health care and education.

But both Chávez and Maduro also presided over widespread corruption and economic mismanagement. The government structured Venezuela’s economy to focus on oil revenues and importing food in order to benefit the military and political elite, which controls both sectors, says Diego Moya-Ocampos, a Venezuela expert at risk analysts IHS Markit.

“They started to generate a crisis, where the country was producing less and less,” he says, adding that the country produces only around 20% of the food it needs. “These shortages have been common in Venezuela for many years now.”

Things got dramatically worse in 2014, when a drop in global oil prices meant the government had less cash to import food. At the same time, falling investor confidence in the country sent the value of Venezuela’s currency, the Bolívar, into free fall. Since then acute shortages of food and other imported goods have lead to widespread hunger, with the average Venezuelan losing 24 pounds in 2017. The lack of basic medicine has crippled the health system. People with chronic illnesses can’t access treatment, and diseases like measles and malaria, previously wiped out, have surged.

Determined to maintain his grip on power, Maduro has grown increasingly authoritarian, sidelining the opposition-held parliament, replacing judges on the supreme court, repressing protests with violence, and imprisoning political opponents.

Who is trying to bring aid into Venezuela?

Guaidó, the 35 year-old leader of an opposition party, claims that Maduro won his second term in May 2018 in rigged elections. Because of this, Guaidó says, the constitution mandates that he, as the head of parliament, take charge to call new elections.

The U.S., along with most other Western democracies, quickly recognized Guaidó as interim president after his inauguration ceremony on Jan. 23 and the Trump Administration has vowed to help him take power. They also answered his call for humanitarian assistance, with National Security Adviser John Bolton pledging $20 million of aid. Canada, Germany and others have also contributed.

Colombia, which has dealt with an influx of over a million desperate Venezuelan refugees, is helping to coordinate efforts to get the aid in. Meanwhile, British billionaire Richard Branson has helped to organize a massive pop concert at the Tienditas bridge near Cúcuta on Friday and Saturday, featuring some of Latin America’s most famous acts, to raise money for more supplies. Maduro has organized his own rival concert on the other side of the border.

U.N. agencies, along with the Red Cross and Catholic charity Cáritas, have refused to help bring aid in, saying that it is too political a move for neutral aid groups to join in. “The action of the Red Cross is based on two principles: humanity and neutrality. Neutrality is the most important one in situations like this,” Francesco Rocca, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies told CNN.

Will the aid get in?

Though Guaidó has pledged to get the supplies into Venezuela by Saturday, it is far from clear that he will be able to do so, because the military is enforcing Maduro’s blockade.

The military used oil tankards to close off the main road bridge to Cúcuta in Colombia. On Thursday night, the Venezuelan national guard blocked the path of a convoy of buses transporting opposition members of parliament participating in the aid efforts. Many fear the next few days will see more violent clashes between the armed forces and Guaidó supporters, like the one at the Brazilian border.

The military’s continued support for the regime in the face of the humanitarian and political crisis can be explained by the comfortable life top generals have enjoyed under him. The regime has given the military control over imports, oil and other industries, and also allowed them to take part in a widespread corruption and organized crime.

“Corruption has corroded the entire institution, all along chain of command, and the counterintelligence agency has kept track of who is involved in what,” Raul Gallegos, a political analyst based in Bogotá, told TIME last month. “We cannot readily expect the security forces to respond the way any other institution would under similar pressure.”

Will the aid help topple Maduro?

Whatever happens, though, the stand-off will undermine Maduro’s grip on power, Moya-Ocampos says. “If he manages to block the aid, it will be clear he is out of touch with the population’s need,” he says. “If it enters, it will show he no longer controls the security apparatus – either way he looks weaker and weaker.”

The international community is hoping that the spectacle of badly-needed aid piled up on the border will prompt the lower ranks of the military to rebel against the high command, either by allowing the supplies in, or even by abandoning their support for Maduro entirely.

Moya-Ocampos says the showdown over aid will be the start, not the end, of fundamental change in Venezuela. “It might not happen immediately, but this episode is going to start off a process of division inside the armed forces, which I do think is irreversible.”

5,Empty,2019-02-21T11:05:05Z,A new poll also shows Canadians have little or no confidence that social media companies can prevent foreign entities from interfering in the election. View Entire Post ›,"BuzzFeed News and the The Toronto Star are investigating the ways in which political parties, third-party pressure groups, foreign powers, and individuals are influencing Canada’s political debate in the run-up to this fall’s federal election. This is the second report. The first report can be found here.

A clear majority of Canadians believe foreign governments — including its closest international ally — will attempt to “influence” the country's 2019 federal election.

New polling conducted by Abacus Data and released exclusively to BuzzFeed News and the Toronto Star shows 60% of Canadians believe it’s likely foreign governments will try to influence the results of this October’s general election.

Where do most expect that influence to come from? Canada’s closest neighbour and ally, the United States.

Most respondents (69%) said it was either moderately, highly, or very highly likely the US would attempt to influence the election, rating it as likely as interference from China.

Abacus CEO David Coletto said that Canadians recognize the US has as much interest in Canadian affairs as Beijing.

“The US has an interest in making sure that our government aligns closely with them as our number one trading partner and security partner, but I think [Canadians] also recognize other global powers are also looking to influence our allies and alliances as well.”

Russia, which has been accused of active interference in multiple western democratic elections including the 2016 U.S. presidential, followed with 65% of respondents perceiving them as a threat.

“Influence” covers everything from a public endorsement — or a 140-character presidential put-down — to more serious clandestine activity.

The Abacus online poll was conducted between Jan. 30 and Feb. 5, with 2,500 Canadians aged 18 and over. Abacus put the margin of error at plus or minus two percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

In 2017, Canada’s electronic intelligence agency warned parliamentarians that they expect it’s “very likely” hackers will target Canada during the 2019 election.

While the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) said it's yet to observe hostile nations attempting to influence Canada’s domestic politics, it’s not a given they won’t in an election year. And the agency is expected to release an updated threat assessment in the coming weeks.

CSE is one of several law enforcement, intelligence and civilian agencies that have been tasked with safeguarding the 2019 vote, including detecting hostile nations’ attempt to meddle in the election.

According to Abacus’ data, Canadians are largely confident that the federal government is up to that task. A full 66% of respondents said they were somewhat or very confident in Ottawa’s ability to prevent “interference” in the federal election, while 34% expressed little to no confidence.

The numbers flipped when respondents were asked about social media platforms. Only 36 per cent said they were somewhat or very confident in social platforms’ ability to prevent foreign interference, while the rest were either not that confident (43%) or not at all confident (20%).

Facebook is acutely aware of concerns and in October announced a Canadian Election Integrity Initiative “to help ensure the platform is a space for authentic civic engagement.” Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould is in the midst of conversations with social media companies, including Facebook, about their obligations this election year.

Coletto said Canadians are giving the government “the benefit of the doubt” when it comes to preventing election interference.

“If we had gotten into some of the details and asked them how they feel about specific aspects of the government’s plan [to safeguard the election] they might feel differently,” Coletto said.

“But on the surface, [Canadians] generally think that the government is competent enough on this and there’s less confidence in social media companies to self-regulate.”",Canadians Say The US Is More Likely Than Russia To Try And Influence The Next Federal Election,Buzzfeed,https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/canadian-election-interference-us-china-russia

""These attacks are not limited to campaigns themselves but often extend to think tanks and non-profit organizations working on topics related to democracy, electoral integrity, and public policy and that are often in contact with government officials,"" writes corporate vice president, customer security & trust, Tom Burt.

Targeted organizations include the German Council on Foreign Relations and the European offices of The Aspen Institute and the German Marshall Fund (GMF), which experienced attacks between September and December last year. In total, 104 accounts belonging to employees located in Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, and Serbia were targeted.

""Consistent with campaigns against similar U.S.-based institutions, attackers in most cases create malicious URLs and spoofed email addresses that look legitimate. These spearphishing campaigns aim to gain access to employee credentials and deliver malware,"" says Burt.

""The attacks we’ve seen recently, coupled with others we discussed last year, suggest an ongoing effort to target democratic organizations. They validate the warnings from European leaders about the threat level we should expect to see in Europe this year.""

Microsoft says it's notified the targets, helped them take steps to secure their systems and taken 'a variety of technical measures' to protect from future attacks.

This includes extending Microsoft's AccountGuard cybersecurity service - designed for political candidates, non-profits, and nongovernmental organizations - to 12 more European countries, including France, Spain and Germany. It's currently available in the U.S., Canada, the UK and Ireland.

According to Burt, Microsoft has identified the attackers as the group known as Fancy Bear, or Strontium - suspected to be associated with the Russian military intelligence agency GRU.

The group is believed to be behind the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee, as well as many other attacks: last summer, Microsoft said it had had to shut down 84 fake websites associated with it over the previous two years.

""These attacks came as no surprise – everything we do as an organization, from our policy research to our work strengthening civil society, is dedicated to advancing and protecting democratic values. The announcement serves as a reminder that the assault on these values is real and relentless,"" says Karen Donfried, president of the GMF.

7,Empty,2019-02-23T06:00:00Z,The B'nai Brith and the Conservative Party resort to�gutter tactics in an attempt to stifle Canada's populist alternative.�,"Recently, with major elections soon taking place, the B'nai Brith of Canada, the sister organization of American ""hate-watch"" group the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), launched a defamatory broadside against the People's Party of Canada (PPC), that nation's brand-new populist alternative to the more establishment-friendly Conservative Party of Canada.

Instead of yielding to pressure, Masse and the PPC fired back, claiming that the attack was completely meritless and that the Conservatives were actually likely involved. In a tough election year against Justin Trudeau's Liberals, and with outspoken PPC founder Maxime ""Mad Max"" Bernier increasingly scoring points against (as he calls them) the ""intellectually corrupt"" Conservatives, even in Canada's otherwise ultra-polite political arena, the Conservatives' involvement looks highly believable.

Although covered by most of Canada's institutional media, the basis for the B'nai Brith's attack was remarkably thin. In their press release, the group quoted lines from blog posts that were not only over a decade old (having appeared on a French-Canadian blog in 2002), but, according to Masse, highly exaggerated and clearly out of context.

For instance, the B'nai Brith accused Masse of ""racism"" and ""having Nazi sympathies"" for stating at the time that the media's labeling of Austria's Freedom Party as a ""group of Nazis"" was overblown — that party is now part of Austria's coalition government. But as Masse had to point out later in his own press release, the B'nai Brith apparently ""missed"" the part in his post where he quoted Simon Wiesenthal saying the exact same thing.

Elsewhere, they accused Masse of anti-Semitism for raising concerns about Israel's policies toward Zionism and its treatment of its Palestinian minority (these were the heady days of the Second Intifada), to which Masse later responded that he most certainly hadn't intend to attack Jewish people as a whole and that, in any case, his general views on Israel had since become more ""nuanced."" Had the B'nai Brith reached out to Masse first to see if his views had indeed since changed, they may have held back. They may have also discovered that Masse is homosexual and accordingly tempered their claims that he is homophobic.

(For a full account of the ""offending"" quotations and their context, find the B'nai Brith's and Masse's press releases.)

But groups like the B'nai Brith never do this. When it comes to individuals or organizations they disagree with, it's shoot first, debate never. Like the ADL or the Southern Poverty Law Center, the B'nai Brith's business model depends on finding ""hate"" wherever it can so as to ensure that donations remain high and steady. This should give major media sources serious pause before they report on their investigations or turn to them for ""expert opinion.""

The B'nai Brith's more direct motivation for the smear campaign was likely related to its CEO, Michael Mostyn, who is closely connected with the Conservative Party. Mostyn ran as a candidate twice for the party in recent federal elections (he lost both times). This was a fact raised in Masse's response but, unfortunately, not in the media's coverage. The media did note that the Conservatives suspiciously had an official condemnation of the PPC ready to go ""less than an hour"" after the B'nai Brith put out its press release. Speculating about the ""political motivations"" behind the attack, when asked about the accusations by reporters, Bernier told them that ""[m]aybe they want to do that because they're supporting another party ... by doing that, they are not doing a favor to their organization.""

This, and the general timing of the attack — again, just two weeks before several key byelections, which kick off the full election year — seems to raise far more questions about the Conservative Party than it does about Masse.

Again, the Conservatives' motivation behind their coordination with Mostyn's B'nai Brith seems clear. If the PPC show strong results in the upcoming byelections (followed by the general election later this year), they'll be taking votes away from the Conservative Party, pressuring them to change their ""Liberal Party-lite"" platform, as some call it. This is something most Conservatives are apparently loath to do. Just as our own conservative establishment before President Trump came to power, the Conservative Party has long tried to keep issues that working-class conservatives care about, like immigration, off the party's platform. Even with property values hitting crisis levels in Canada's heavily immigrant major cities — Nearly 90 percent of Canada's immigrants go to just Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal — Conservatives have not proposed a migration reduction. The PPC, on the other hand, have.

Whether the PPC can persevere through these attacks and establish themselves as a serious conservative alternative, we'll see with the upcoming elections. This latest challenge has certainly proved their leadership's mettle. Unlike what's expected of most conservatives when hit with these sorts of allegations, Masse and Bernier did not back down, and instead castigated the B'nai Brith and the Conservative Party for their gutter tactics and apparent underhanded coordination. Standing firm and staying true to self, this is how conservatives should fight.",Making Canada Great Again?,Americanthinker.com,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2019/02/making_canada_great_again.html
8,Empty,2019-02-24T19:50:32Z,Another subtle move from a Florida man.,"Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio shared these images with his 3.7 million Twitter followers on Sunday (Feb. 24):

The pair of photos show Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi, before and after a US-backed NATO coalition ejected him from power with an air bombing campaign in 2011. That year, he was captured by a rival militia in Libya’s ongoing civil war, tortured, and executed in the streets.

Why is Rubio sharing these images? To threaten Venezuela’s embattled leader, Nicolas Maduro, who was returned to power after elections last year that were called unfair by numerous international bodies, including the European Union, Freedom House and Amnesty International.”

The collapse of Venezuela’s socialist economy and political system—which began after the death of president Hugo Chavez in 2013—is now a full-scale humanitarian crisis. Following large protests against Nicolás Maduro’s government, an elected opposition leader, Juan Guaido, declared himself interim president and was recognized by other Latin American countries, the US, Canada, and eleven European states.

Maduro, however, isn’t going quietly, and his decision to block food, medicine, and other necessaries from reaching people in his country has abetted political chaos. On Saturday (Feb. 23), pro-Maduro security forces set fire to a convoy of aid trucks attempting to cross into the country from Columbia, killing at least four people.

Rubio, whose politics are driven in part by his family’s experience of the socialist revolution in Cuba, has been a vocal supporter of US military action to oust Maduro and relieve the humanitarian crisis. Earlier on Sunday, he shared a less-graphic pair of photos featuring former Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, a US-backed strongman who lost the backing of Washington and was eventually ousted during a US invasion in 1989.

Experts question the wisdom of using US military action to break Maduro’s embargo and allow humanitarian aid, much less to affect regime change. Maduro has already used existing US sanctions to rally his supporters, and a foreign invasion could have a similar effect. A former US Air Force general says that military force is not the right choice. Venezuela is comparable in size to Iraq or Afghanistan, and could require a commensurate commitment of US resources.

9,Empty,2019-02-19T02:30:15Z,Satinder Dhillon says he trademarked the name and applied to Elections Canada to use it before Bernier,"An Abbotsford entrepreneur filed a lawsuit in the Federal Court of Canada on Monday in an attempt to prevent the People’s Party of Canada from using that name in next week’s federal byelection or in the fall general election.

The suit names federal party leader Maxime Bernier, the party’s chief agent, Christian Roy, and the party itself, and also seeks damages to be determined for economic loss, expenses and the “irreparable harm” of having to compete for online search-engine rankings.

According to Satinder Dhillon’s statement of claim, he launched his People’s Party of Canada on Canada Day, 2015, but did not apply to Elections Canada to register the name until Sept. 25, 2018. A few days earlier, it says, he obtained a trademark for the name and obtained a copyright.

Bernier applied to Elections Canada to use the name on Oct. 10, the statement of claim says.

“We own that name, that’s clear to me,” Dhillon said Monday afternoon.

Dhillon was instructed he would need 250 people to mail or personally deliver confirmation of support for the party to Elections Canada headquarters in Gatineau, Que.

However, a Canada Post rotating strike and the fact Elections Canada’s headquarters is close to Bernier and his supporters, but across the country from Dhillon’s core support in B.C., meant Bernier got the required 250 signatures to Elections Canada by mail or in person before Dhillon’s supporters were able to.

On Nov. 15, Dhillon received a letter from Elections Canada asking him to change his party’s name because the “risk of confusion is evident,” the statement of claim alleges.

Elections Canada was wrong to hastily grant the right to use the name People’s Party of Canada in federal elections to Bernier’s party, Dhillon’s lawsuit claims.

“In our view, Elections Canada erred by not taking into account delays caused by the Canada Post strike and Mr. Dhillon’s earlier initial filing, and should have awarded the party name to Mr. Dhillon,” Dean Davison, Dhillon’s Vancouver-based lawyer, said in a statement.

Dhillon, born in Quesnel and raised in Abbotsford, claims there are about 1,000 members of his political party. But unable to use his party’s name, he was unable to field a candidate in the Feb. 25 Burnaby South byelection, he said.

“My vision for this party was that it would represent true Canadian values, economic justice for everybody, equal rights for everybody,” Dhillon said. “It would stand against racism and discrimination, and cast a protest vote against the status quo.

“So, the vision for my party is very different from the vision Mr. Bernier has put out. His is divisive, I’d use that word.”

A cease-and-desist letter sent to the Bernier camp on Jan. 29 was “met with dead silence,” Dhillon said.

“If Mr. Bernier and his candidates were putting forward a platform we could live with, I would have perhaps considered letting them use the name, which is legally mine. But their brand of divisive populism just doesn’t line up with the values held by the people of Canada and I have to speak out about his.”

Bernier’s office was contacted on Monday and promised to get back to Postmedia, but did not reply by deadline.

The Feb. 25 Burnaby South federal byelection, one of three across Canada that day (Bernier’s party has candidates running in all) became necessary after NDP MP Kennedy Stewart resigned in September 2018 to enter the Vancouver mayoralty race.

The Burnaby race is being contested by Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler-Thompson, federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, Liberal Richard T. Lee, Conservative Jay Shin, and independents Valentine Wu and Terry Grimwood.

10,Empty,2019-02-25T12:00:00Z,The nation’s eyes are on B.C. for Monday’s byelections across Canada,"Ballots will be cast in Ontario’s York-Simcoe and Quebec’s Outremont ridings, but no race is being watched more closely than the one in Burnaby South, B.C., where New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh is vying for his first seat in Parliament.

BURNABY, B.C.—A trio of federal byelections on Monday will offer more than just an early glimpse of voters’ dispositions, potentially shaking up the political landscape months before Canadians head to the polls en masse.

“There’s already rumblings that if he loses, it will be difficult for him to stay on as leader — and (it) would probably further undermine the NDP’s electoral prospects going into the federal election after an already underwhelming year.”

“Singh needs to win to consolidate his power as the leader of the party,” explained political scientist David Moscrop, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Ottawa.

Burnaby South is a key test of both Singh’s hold on his left-leaning party and the popularity of Maxime Bernier’s new far-right populist party, focused on immigration and carbon taxes.

Burnaby South is historically a diverse, working-class riding. Its median income falls 18 per cent below the national average. It has a higher proportion of visible minorities than neighbouring Vancouver or Surrey — even higher than Toronto. It was previously an NDP stronghold.

“I think he will win,” said Moscrop. “But he doesn’t have federal experience as MP … Forget forming government: He needs to show he can hold the government accountable, with only months left until the election.”

So it may be Singh’s to lose.

And with Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada running its first big candidate in Burnaby South — former radio host Laura Lynn Tyler Thompson — the election has seen tense all-candidates debates devolve into audience heckling and allegations of racism and extremism.

“If she can nab even 10 per cent, Bernier will be crowing for months,” Moscrop argued. “This is the perfect time for his party to do well. It’s getting outsized media attention, and they can focus on locking down a smaller segment of the electorate.

“Plus, there’s enough disaffection, not to mention xenophobia, today that could express itself as support.”

Here’s what’s at stake in Burnaby South, what voters are saying their top issues are and why this byelection is being so scrutinized across the country.

Who is running?

Singh, a former Ontario provincial politician and lawyer, is facing off against three rival party hopefuls.

One of those rivals, Thompson of the People’s Party of Canada, has generated considerable controversy by tapping into public anxieties around immigration and refugees.

Also running is another former provincial politician, Richard Lee, with the Liberals. Jay Shin is carrying the flag for the federal Conservative party, mounting concerns over the Liberals’ more than three years in office, expressing particular opposition to certain taxes and drug policies.

There are also two independent candidates running.

What is at stake nationally?

It’s seen as a high-stakes byelection beyond the borders of B.C.’s Lower Mainland mainly because experts say it’s a key test of Singh’s hold on the leadership of his party — which he’s headed since 2017 despite not yet holding a seat in Parliament. Facing the Liberals in Ottawa is seen as essential to his party’s chances, and some have speculated he could face an internal coup if he fails his first ballot-box test.

It also remains to be seen whether Bernier’s right-wing populist party, the People’s Party of Canada, has the kind of broad appeal he claims. Burnaby South is the first chance to test that support in a largely working-class city.

Another dynamic is how well the Liberal brand performs, as the party is currently embroiled in allegations that staffers pressured the former attorney general to stop prosecuting Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid a high-profile campaign visit to Lee and faced cheering crowds, but Liberal support has fallen in recent polls across the country, including in B.C.

“Byelections are pretty silly tests of public mood,” Moscrop cautioned, “because they don’t really mimic the conditions of a general election.

“They’re a really strange one-off, or in this case, three. People try to read a lot into them but shouldn’t.”

What is the tone on the campaign trail?

Unusually bitter and divisive for a local riding byelection. Three all-candidates debates in a row have descended into audience members shouting accusations of racism, fascism and extremism against each other and candidates onstage.

The spark has been any conversation about immigration, refugees and people illegally crossing the border into Canada. The subjects have stoked anger at recent Yellow Vests rallies and from the People’s Party of Canada, which alleges all three rival parties are soft on screening people entering the country. The People’s party wants a tighter cap on immigration numbers and more prevention of irregular asylum-seekers.

That’s led to accusations of racism and xenophobia — but some in Burnaby South have cited the murder of a Chinese-Canadian teen, allegedly by a Syrian refugee, as evidence of a public safety risk. Meanwhile, the Liberal and NDP candidates have countered that the actions of one individual should not represent an entire group of people.

The People’s party candidate has accused her Conservative opponent of “smearing” her in a pamphlet delivered to constituents, which included pictures of marijuana leaves and empty syringes and alleged the party supports drugs.

The original Liberal candidate in Burnaby South was forced to resign by the party after the Star unearthed online posts in Chinese pointing out that Singh is South Asian.

What do locals say?

Despite Singh’s future hanging in the balance, when the Star hit the suburban city’s streets to find out what regular voters think, locals appeared more focused on anything but the NDP leader’s prospects in Ottawa.

By far, the most commonly cited issue in this byelection was affordable housing, followed by taxes, jobs, the environment and immigration.

Who are Burnaby’s voters?

Burnaby’s demographics are increasingly young and not white, the 2016 census found. Its average age is three years below B.C.’s average, and 69 per cent of its population identifies as a visible minority, more than triple Canada’s rate. (The Greater Toronto Area, by comparison, was 51 per cent visible minorities.)

Burnaby South is home to a sizable Chinese-Canadian community, followed in number by Caucasians, South Asians and Filipinos.

In fact, 54 per cent of Burnaby South residents say they are immigrants, according to the 2016 census, compared to the Canada-wide figure of 14 per cent. (Immigrants in the Greater Toronto Area make up 46 per cent of the population.)

It’s also a historically working-class riding, with the median income at just $28,183 per year, 18 per cent less than the national average. Burnaby South’s poverty rates are significantly higher than the national average, with 22 per cent of residents being defined by Statistics Canada as low income, compared to 16 per cent nationally.

How can eligible voters cast their ballots?

Polls are open to any eligible Burnaby South resident from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday. Since not all Burnaby residents are eligible — the city contains multiple federal ridings — you can find out if you can vote, and where, on Elections Canada’s website.

12,Empty,2019-02-23T23:10:32Z,"As tech giants grow ever more powerful, Canada and others are under pressure to act TheSpec.com As tech companies grow ever more powerful, countries such as Canada must decide how to protect the public without turning away economic benefits.","Practically it's about tech giants collecting and selling our data to third parties without our consent, she adds. This has been exposed in a slate of recent scandals, from the discovery of a microphone built into Google's Nest Secure home security system, to tracking by Google services on Android devices and iPhones even when privacy settings are turned on.

She singles out Facebook and Google as particularly being a concern.

""They have created a state of surveillance,"" she says.

Amazon is not as bad but there are still concerns, she adds, like with their controversial facial recognition technology, Amazon Rekognition. The company's own shareholders urged Amazon not to sell it to governments, fearing potential human rights abuses.

Microsoft and Apple deserve more credit, she says, and their CEOs have both made public commitments to privacy.

That's because companies like Apple are selling a physical product, unlike Facebook and Google, says Avner Levin, a professor at the Ted Rogers School of Management, Law and Business Department.

""The people that are using the service are the product that is actually being sold to advertisers,"" he says, referring to Facebook and Google.

""We are the product that they are selling.""

Privacy is linked to wider issues like fake news, and the weakening of democratic institutions, he adds. This was illustrated in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, when Russians deployed targeted information to manipulate social media users.

What others are doing:

In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, is currently investigating to see if Facebook violated a 2011 ""consent decree,"" that said they would address concerns about the tracking and sharing of user data, Cavoukian says. Facebook could face a hefty fine if found to be in breach of this order.

But the ""gold standard"" for privacy legislation is the EU, says Levin. The EU passed the comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation, in 2016.

The legislation includes hefty fines (up to 4 per cent of a company's global revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater). It also has strict language on consent, the concept of privacy by design, and the right to be forgotten, under which individuals can apply to have negative search results deleted.

Similar laws have been passed in Japan, Brazil and California, Cavoukian says, and there's discussion in the U.S. about national legislation.

What Canada is doing:

Canada is in ""a significantly weaker situation than the EU,"" says Andrew Clement, professor emeritus in the Faculty of Information, at the University of Toronto.

The federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) was developed in 2000, before Facebook and smartphones, and lacks the ""fining powers"" of the EU law.

""There appears to be more willingness in the EU to use existing powers for bringing the tech giants to account,"" he says.

Levin says there's been an ""absolute lack of will,"" on the part of both the Trudeau and Harper governments to do anything about privacy.

In 2012 in response to complaints, the federal privacy commissioner did an investigation into Facebook. But the office doesn't have the ""power to force Facebook to do anything,"" he says.

The EU, influenced heavily by the Germans, is more attuned to the dangers of a loss of privacy, given their history of totalitarian governments.

""They're a lot more willing to regulate the companies, they're a lot more worried about the consequences,"" he says.

But Cavoukian is optimistic that Canada can catch up.

In 2018, the federal Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics issued a report entitled ""Towards Privacy By Design,"" which she believes shows a ""clear intent"" to enhance the law.

Disinformation

The issue:

In recent years, the world has rudely awakened to the proliferation of hate speech and ""fake news"" on social media — especially during election cycles, when online content can be used to disrupt democratic processes.

Regulators and social media companies have come under pressure to stem the flow of online hate speech and malicious ""disinformation."" But these are complicated problems with no easy fixes; the sheer volume of harmful content online is overwhelming and the notion of regulating speech will always provoke free speech concerns while drawing fierce opposition.

And while some countries have legal definitions for hate speech, defining ""fake news"" is a tricky proposition; it can also be a dangerous one, especially in the hands of authoritarian regimes that want to censor information or crack down on the free press.

Regulators have struggled to find workable solutions. ""No one's figured it out,"" says Heidi Tworek, an assistant professor of history at the University of British Columbia who studies media, democracy and the digital economy. ""We continue to have to really evaluate many of these different schemes that are being proposed. These are such large and complex questions.""

What others are doing:

Several European countries are now moving toward regulating social media platforms, deploying strategies that have drawn both criticism and praise. In France, the government passed a law in November that empowers judges to order the removal of ""fake news"" during elections; violators face a penalty of one year in prison or a €75,000 fine.

In the United Kingdom, a new parliamentary report — released this week following an 18-month investigation — is also calling for platforms like Facebook to be brought under regulatory control. The report proposes several new regulations, including a mandatory code of ethics and independent regulator who can bring legal proceedings against social media companies.

Germany has taken a particularly bold approach to regulating hate speech on social media. In January 2018, the country passed its Net Enforcement Act — sometimes dubbed the NetzDG or ""Facebook law"" — which forces tech companies to remove hate speech within 24 hours of illegal content being reported. (When it's unclear whether content is actually illegal under German law, tech companies have seven days to consult and decide.)

The penalty for breaking this law? Up to €50 million in fines. ""This is probably the furthest anyone has gone in trying to get large social media companies to adopt their policies to local laws,"" Tworek says.

What Canada is doing:

""Canadians, and the Canadian government, are alive and alert to the issues,"" says Dwayne Winseck, a journalism professor at Carleton University and director of the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project.

He points to Canada's recently-passed electoral reform bill, C-76, as a positive step. Online platforms like Facebook and Google must now create a registry of digital advertisements placed by political or third parties during elections and ensure they remain visible for two years. The law also bans the use of foreign money by ""third party"" advocacy groups during campaign periods — meaning social media companies can't knowingly accept advertisements paid for with foreign funds.

Another provision prohibits making false statements about a candidate to influence an election. This only applies narrowly to certain types of statements, however (for example, statements about whether a candidate has broken the law or their place of birth).

In January, the federal government unveiled plans for safeguarding the upcoming election, including a $7 million initiative to improve the public's ability to detect ""online deceptive practices"" and a team of five bureaucrats who will alert the public whenever they find evidence of election interference.

But where Canada could be innovating more is with social media regulation more generally, says journalist Chris Tenove, a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia who studies global governance and digital politics.

He would like to see Canada follow the lead of jurisdictions like the European Union, which worked together with social media companies to develop a code of conduct. As a result, platforms have voluntarily committed to ""quickly and efficiently"" addressing hate speech and early reports have shown good results, he says.

One promising spot is Canada's involvement with an international effort called the Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News. Comprising parliamentarians from nine countries, the committee is scheduled to meet in Ottawa this May and has called for social media executives — including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai — to appear so they can explain what they're doing to stop the spread of disinformation.

Taxation

The issue:

In the mid 1980s, when Canada's GST was still a twinkle in then prime minister Brian Mulroney's eye, the World Wide Web had not yet been invented and Google's founders were still pre-teen boys. Since then, digital technologies have advanced at breakneck speeds and companies like Google — not to mention Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon — have become essential to how Canadians spend their time and money.

They have also been reaping billions in profits. Tax codes, meanwhile, have evolved more slowly and governments are now grappling with how to bring their taxation systems into the digital age.

""There is a missed opportunity for taxing these companies,"" says Rosalie Wyonch, a policy analyst with the C.D. Howe Institute. ""Digital technology has been outpacing our ability to regulate (and) tax.""

Traditionally, tax systems were dependent on the idea of ""permanent establishment,"" Wyonch explains — this assumes a company has a physical presence within a country, or relates to physical goods crossing borders. But ""our tax code hasn't been updated to deal with intangibles,"" she says.

Yet as digital services become more popular, the potential losses in sales tax revenue grow bigger, says University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist, the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law. (In 2017, Wyonch wrote that if Netflix alone were to collect and remit GST/HST, this would inject $50 million per year into Canada's tax coffers).

Meanwhile, domestic companies — which do have to collect and remit sales taxes — argue they are left at a competitive disadvantage, Geist adds.

When it comes to taxing corporate income, global discussions are now underway to figure out how this should be handled when it comes to big tech. ""That is a very complex international system, that we're waiting for consensus on,"" according to Wyonch.

There are major challenges when it comes to simply defining the income of digital companies, she says. Say a foreign company does a digital marketing campaign for a Canadian company. ""Did they earn that income where they're located, or did they earn that income in Canada, if they never entered Canada (or) hosted any of its content on Canadian servers?"" Wyonch asks. ""We don't have a clear way to define, in a black and white way, what would — and would not — be considered Canadian income.""

What others are doing:

The G20 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have set a 2020 deadline for fighting tax avoidance (which tech giants are frequently accused of) and developing international standards for taxing big tech. But several countries — like the U.K., France, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand — are already considering interim measures, raising concerns of creating a hodgepodge of different approaches around the world. The European Union has also unveiled plans for a digital tax of three per cent of revenues, an idea that has received blowback, including from some member states.

What Canada is doing:

Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters last October that Ottawa is studying whether a new regulatory landscape is needed for the digital economy and he is pushing the G20 to speed up its timeline for establishing new rules. But Morneau says Canada's goal is to wait for an international consensus before taking action.

Quebec and Saskatchewan, however, have forged ahead on the sales tax issue and this year, both started applying provincial sales taxes to foreign digital companies. In Quebec, more than 80 international companies — including Amazon, Apple, Google and Netflix — were registered as of Feb. 18 to collect and remit provincial sales tax in that province.

Jennifer Yang

Competition

The issue:

The rise of a short list of dominant tech companies has put reform of traditional notions of competition law at the top of the agenda for policy-makers around the globe.

Modern competition law holds that when companies control large market shares, the result is higher prices and lower quality. It does not, however, make a monopoly illegal, prohibiting only the abuse of the power that a monopoly makes possible through exclusionary practices.

Experts say practices such as a company giving its own products top ranking in its online search engine have been given a boost by so called big data — the corporate accumulation of massive data sets that are automatically processed through computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. Big data could pose competitive threats by allowing exclusive licensing deals for critical data sets, for example, says Ariane Le Strat, a U.K.-based associate with international law firm Bird & Bird, or companies could agree to price-discriminate — charge more to certain people based on their perceived ability to pay — as a result of customer data they have obtained.

The public outcry over the misuse of personal data after the Cambridge Analytica scandal early last year when it was revealed that Facebook had harvested personal information for political purposes without consent ratcheted up the pressure on regulators, Le Strat says, with the U.S. among others vowing vigorous antitrust enforcement in the area.

What others are doing:

The European Union has taken the lead in enforcing stricter laws aimed at tech companies suspected of wilfully abusing their market dominance.

Its competition directorate, for example, has imposed heavy sanctions in cases where it has alleged market abuse by technology giants, including the €2.4 billion fine levied against Google in 2017 for privileging its own products in search results. The European Union has also taken dramatic steps against Microsoft, now requiring its ubiquitous Windows operating system to enable a variety of web browsers.

Germany's competition watchdog has ordered Facebook to curb its data collection excesses and is investigating Amazon after complaints from third-party sellers that their business was being hurt by the company's dual role as both a retailer on its Amazon Marketplace and the platform's owner/operator. The European Commission's competition watchdog is probing whether Amazon gains unfair advantage from the data it collects via transactions on the an e-commerce platform.

Against this backdrop some consumer advocacy groups have called for a breakup of the big U.S. tech companies similar to the tearing asunder of the U.S. Bell system in the 1980s — or at the very least an overhaul of competition statutes to address the new threats from the tech giants' market dominance.

What Canada is doing:

Canada has maintained that while the emergence of firms that control and exploit data can raise new challenges for competition law enforcement, ""this is not in and of itself cause for concern,"" according to the Competition Bureau.

In a February 2018 report, the bureau concluded that while ""big data may require specific methods and tools, the bureau's traditional enforcement framework will continue to apply.""

The report says data tools that analyze and adjust to changes in the conduct of consumers and competitors may ""soften competition"" but this is really just an extension of practices that companies used before information technology was developed.

Moreover, it says conscious parallelism (where firms in an oligopoly are aware that their pricing and output decisions have a significant impact upon rivals and without an explicit agreement co-ordinate their behaviour as if they were engaged in collusive behaviour) is not by itself prohibited under Canadian competition law.

""For competition law enforcement in Canada,"" according to Sandy Walker, a competition law partner at Dentons in Toronto, ""it's déjà vu for now.""

Michael Lewis

Addiction

The issue: This is a newer area, and there's no scientifically established condition of social media or smartphone addiction.

There are however ""problematic behaviours"" associated with the technologies that are similar to the ones found in recognized addictions to drugs, alcohol or gambling, such as not being able to cut back on use, says Centre for Addiction and Mental Health senior scientist Dr. Robert Mann.

Mann says a 2016 CAMH survey of adults found 40 per cent said yes to at least one of a number of questions such as whether screen habits had ever caused the respondent to miss school, work, or important social activities, or whether a family member had ever expressed concern.

Eight per cent of respondents said yes to three or more of the questions.

Matthew Johnson, director of education at digital literacy non-profit, MediaSmarts, wouldn't call it an addiction either. But he has heard of serious problematic behaviours especially among young people using apps or social media sites that seem designed to keep them coming back.

Snapchat streaks, where kids keep sending Snapchats to their friends every day to keep their streak and earn a flame icon, even if it means missing sleep, are one example.

Benjamin Wong, a registered clinical counsellor in behavioural addictions in B.C., says he's seen about a five-per-cent increase over the last five years in people with screen or tech issues. He believes ""hooking"" customers with colourful, engaging social media sites or apps is a ""cornerstone"" of the tech business.

What others are doing:

Other jurisdictions haven't gone as far as they have on issues such as data collection, or fake news.

France recently passed a law that companies with more than 50 employees can't email employees after business hours, giving individuals ""the right to disconnect.""

The goal, said officials in that country at the time, was to prevent burnout and reduce work-related stress. But Mann says such an idea might also help with addictive behaviour.

""I think it's interesting to consider that that kind of a law might reduce the need or the urge to continually access your devices,"" he says.

In the U.K., the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport parliamentary committee launched an inquiry into the growth of ""immersive and addictive technologies"" in December 2018, looking into the ""addictive nature of some technologies,"" and how they can impact behaviour.

What Canada is doing:

""Not a whole lot has been done,"" in this country, says Wong, adding even much of the advocacy around regulating tech giants has been around privacy and data.

Mann says it's a rich area for researchers, who might start by developing guidelines for healthy use.

Copyright

The issue:

Copyright protections are evolving in the digital age as countries ramp up efforts to combat piracy and online infringement. The need for new measures has come to the forefront amid a torrent of illegal downloads of online content from providers including Netflix and YouTube and the pirating of material for commercial and personal use.

What others are doing:

Protections are being updated in jurisdictions including the U.S. and especially the European Union, which is set to vote this spring in the European Parliament on an overhaul that would block copyright-protected material, including software, films, music and books, from being uploaded or electronically shared without permission from creators.

A provision of the proposed policy would effectively mandate that companies including Facebook and Google develop and fund technology to automatically filter out infringed content on their sites and search engines on a mass scale.

In the U.S., meanwhile, momentum is building around proposals in Congress that could formalize and increase royalty payments for music creators whose work is played on digital services.

In many developing jurisdictions, the push to reform intellectual property protections has become part of a plan to boost economic competitiveness, with China for example proposing to make websites liable for promoting unlicensed works as part of a broader reform of property rights.

Australia, which was described by the country's attorney general in 2014 as the ""worst offender"" of pirated content, has proposed new laws that would make if far easier for copyright owners to achieve court orders that would force search engines and internet service providers to block or delete pirated content.

What Canada is doing:

In Canada, part of the response is contained in the Copyright Modernization Act which requires that providers give notice to customers suspected of pirating content. It is left to the injured party to sue with awards capped at $5,000 for non-commercial infringement.

Provisions in Canada's legislation also prohibit demands for payment in the infringement notices, as well as links to any other sites where payments can be made to content creators.

The notice provision has been criticized by groups including the International Intellectual Property Alliance of content creators since if ""fails to provide meaningful incentives for network service providers to co-operate with copyright owners to deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital network environment.""

Another possible impediment to the notice provision stems from the new trade agreement among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico that limits internet platforms' liability for users' content, while the deal also stipulates that Canada eventually extend its copyright term. The liability provision could prevent Canada from adopting European-style digital copyright rules, experts note.

Klynge was referring to former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel's comments during the 2008 financial crisis. Fast-forward a decade, and the world is grappling with another crisis, fuelled by the creations of tech's biggest titans.

""The [Facebook] Cambridge Analytica case, some of the other data leaks — 500 million people have been involved in data leaks in the last 10 months alone,"" says Klynge, appointed by Denmark as the world's first tech ambassador.

WATCH: The National's interview with Casper Klynge, Sunday night on CBC Television and streamed online

""Now, that has been a blessing in disguise in the sense that it sort of makes it evident to most people that there are boundaries, and there are real issues at stake, and it is necessary for us to have a conversation with the companies. Also, to make sure that they [companies] assume a responsibility which is proportional to the kind of influence that they're exercising.""

When you consider that Facebook and Google have more combined users than half the global population, the influence they wield is monolithic, he says. The sheer size and scale of these companies has forced a power shift not seen since the Industrial Revolution.

Now, amid scandals surrounding personal data leaks and hacked elections, governments are scrambling to catch up.

Enter Klynge.

Denmark was ahead of the curve, dispatching Klynge to Silicon Valley 18 months ago with a lofty mandate: to protect Danish interests and democracy in the digital age.

A career diplomat who has served in Kosovo, Darfur and Helmand province, Klynge admits it wasn't the easiest of transitions.

So what exactly is Techplomacy?

While many traditional ambassadors focus their attention on economic issues, Klynge has a different mandate.

""I spend very little time on promoting investment opportunities or export opportunities for Danish companies,"" Klynge says. ""What we're really talking about is the big issues. How technology is potentially undermining democracy, election processes. How content, illegal content like terrorism or extremism, how that is a huge problem for all of us, all democratic countries.

And rather than being posted to a specific country, Klynge's responsibilities are global.

""My embassy is slightly different than all other embassies in the Danish foreign ministry, because it's almost a virtual embassy. Part of my team is in Silicon Valley, another part of it is in Copenhagen, and a third part is actually in Beijing. So we're also trying to treat this in a different way, we have a global mandate, it's not all about Silicon Valley.""

Klynge recently brought his vision for ""techplomacy"" to Ottawa, meeting with Minister of Democratic Institutions Karina Gould to discuss how Canada plans to protect itself in the lead-up to the next federal election.

Watch: Casper Klynge says his mandate is to see that technology protects democracy

With upcoming elections in Denmark and Canada, Danish tech ambassador Casper Klynge says democracy needs to be protected at all costs. 0:40

Klynge hopes to persuade Canada to join an alliance of like-minded nations, and perhaps even create its own tech ambassador.

""To some extent that's almost part of my success criteria, that we do get a critical mass around the table. Because it goes without saying that as a small country with less than six million people, we [Denmark] will never be able to move the agenda, vis-a-vis the big technology companies,"" Klynge says.

""We need other countries around the table and we need more international collaboration, not less, in the digital age. And that again goes back to why this is a foreign policy initiative.""

When coders cross the line

Klynge is a proponent of creating a sort of Hippocratic Oath for people who write software, to ensure they adhere to code of ethics. (Jonathan Castell/CBC)

Aside from protecting democracy, Klynge is pushing for the creation of an international code of ethics that all tech companies would need to adhere to.

He points to a recent airline scam in the U.K. as an example of just one way software engineers have crossed the line in the pursuit of corporate profit.

""Algorithms in some airlines were set up to make sure that families were basically split when they did the seat allocation, to make a little bit extra off having families pay to be seated together. And as a family member I've experienced that many times myself,"" Klynge says.

""But I think the interesting bit is that it also initiated a debate among coders, among programmers, to say who on Earth would actually write algorithms that disperses families across an airline? Is that really what coders should be involved in?

""So I think that resulted in sort of almost a Hippocratic Oath from coders — saying you work in a decent way, you write algorithms without biases — I think that's an important dimension of it as well.""

Can China be trusted?

Klynge says the world's government and corporate leaders are currently wrestling with rules and protections that could determine whether technology will ultimately be a force for good or be abused by those in power. (Jonathan Castell/CBC)

Questions over ethics and trust are at the centre of much bigger debate — whether or not Chinese tech giant Huawei poses a threat to Canadian security.

Ottawa and Beijing have been locked in a diplomatic dispute since the December arrest of Meng Wanzhou. The Huawei executive was detained in Vancouver at the request of the United States, which is seeking her extradition on fraud allegations.

The Trudeau government is still deciding whether to ban Huawei from Canada's 5G networks.

Klynge says whether the debate is over 5G technology or artificial intelligence, China's influence cannot be ignored.

Watch: Casper Klynge says it's important to keep the conversation with China going

Amid tensions between Ottawa and Beijing over the possible ban of Chinese tech giant Huawei's gear from Canadian communications networks, Casper Klynge answers a question on the minds of many: Can China be trusted? 0:40

Whether the finger is being pointed at Beijing or Silicon Valley, Klynge says a much bigger battle is being waged.

""The big debate, or the big conflict if you like, is of course whether technology will be a doer of good. Whether it will promote democracies and freedom, whether it will empower people, bring better health care, better education, or whether technology could also be a means for increased control. And those authoritarian aspects of it — it goes without saying that China plays an important role here that we need to pay attention to.

""But that doesn't mean that we don't need a dialogue with China. And one of the reasons why part of my office is there [in Beijing] is, you know, we might not agree with everything, we might not see eye to eye on everything, but we need to have a conversation.""",Hacking the foreign-policy playbook: Tech-diplomat aims to protect democracy in digital age,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/national-casper-klyge-tech-ambassador-1.4828015

Janet Napolitano, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security from 2009 to 2013, is president of the University of California. She is author of the forthcoming book, “How Safe Are We?: Homeland Security Since 9/11” with Karen Breslau.

In its landmark report condemning the U.S. government’s failure to prevent the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the 9/11 Commission noted that the “most important failure was one of imagination.” President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration to fund a border wall may go down as the opposite: the triumph of one man’s imagination over reality.

Trump’s vision of the southern border as a lawless region teeming with immigrants, gangs, drug dealers, gun runners, human traffickers and terrorists trying to burst through and harm the U.S. and its citizens underlies his insistence on a wall as the sine qua non of homeland security. This approach amounts to a willful misreading of the true threat landscape facing the U.S. nearly two decades after the 9/11 attacks.

Story Continued Below

Here are the facts about the 1,933-mile border between the U.S. and Mexico: illegal crossings are the lowest they’ve been in decades. Technologies like sensors and drones are being deployed to enhance the capabilities of the Border Patrol and are receiving increased funding in the recently signed appropriations bill. And all but around 50 miles of border barriers identified by experts as necessary have already been constructed. The small remainder crosses either private land or lands held by sovereign Indian nations, making their suitability for barrier construction doubtful.

The supposed national emergency at the southern border also makes little sense in the post-9/11 era, in which our adversaries can infiltrate our society and our institutions through digital networks, armed Americans kill more Americans through acts of mass violence than ISIS does, and the emergent ravages of climate change threaten every community in the U.S.

By declaring a national emergency to fund a border wall, Trump is diverting financial and military resources and the attention of policymakers to prepare for threats that are far more real, pervasive and deadly. He also is impeding the public’s ability to understand the likelihood of threats against which they need to protect themselves.

The Department of Homeland Security was created after the 9/11 attacks and assigned a mammoth portfolio of national security, law enforcement and public safety responsibilities. DHS is responsible for immigration and border security, including not only our border with Mexico, but also with Canada, as well as all land, sea and airports of entry, 328 in all. It’s worth noting that 2018 statistics from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection show that the majority of illegal drugs enter through one of these legal ports of entry.

DHS manages nearly two dozen major government agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard, Secret Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Citizenship and Immigration Services and a workforce of 240,000 employees. It leads the federal response for all natural and human-caused disasters, oversees the cybersecurity of the government’s nonmilitary data networks, and protects of critical infrastructure—the energy, financial and communications networks that underpin the U.S. economy and the voting systems that are supposed to secure our democracy.

Homeland security is a matter of assessing risks and assigning resources to mitigate them in proportion to the likelihood they would occur. Every hour spent on photo ops related to the border wall is an hour not spent on other mission-critical tasks that matter far more to making America safe. News of the resignation of the acting FEMA director Brock Long last Wednesday was overtaken by border wall coverage within hours, yet his job touches many more Americans made vulnerable by increasingly severe natural disasters. And the president said nothing about the nearly three dozen school shootings since 17 were killed at a high school in Parkland, Florida, just over a year ago.

As the third secretary of Homeland Security, I thought deeply about my tenure and focused on one question in particular: How safe are we today? The threats we face have evolved significantly since Sept. 11, 2001, when the smartphone had not been invented and social media was the arcane province of geeks. Today’s terrorists, both foreign and domestic, recruit adherents online, inspiring them to radicalize and commit acts of violence, but Trump’s claim before last November’s midterm elections that they were infiltrating migrant caravans from Central America and Mexico and heading to the U.S. border is widely understood to be inaccurate. It is undercut by government data showing that of the 3,755 actual or attempted entries by known or suspected terrorists into the U.S. in fiscal year 2017, few attempted entry via Mexico.

More Americans have died or been displaced by extreme weather events related to climate change since 2001 than by terrorists, foreign or domestic. If Trump wants to build a wall to make America safe, he should start with a seawall.

The public understands these realities far better than Trump does. A poll released this month by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that climate change is the top security concern of people in 13 of 26 countries surveyed, including the U.S. More than 60 percent of respondents across all countries viewed cyber-attacks as a serious concern, up from 54 percent in 2017. And the number of countries that saw the Islamic State as a primary threat fell by double-digit percentage points in the U.S., Israel, Spain and Japan.

The 9/11 Commission urged the creation of the DHS to prevent another catastrophe on American soil. To do that, we must face today’s facts, apply our will, and spend our resources to create a future that truly makes Americans safe.",The Real National Emergencies Trump Is Ignoring,Politico,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/19/trump-national-emergency-225163

The White House is in discussions with former Michigan Senate candidate John James about the vacant United Nations ambassador post, with President Donald Trump leaning toward nominating the former businessman and Iraq War veteran, according to three people close to the process.

The talks have included frequent phone calls as Trump’s team searches for a new top diplomat after State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert withdrew herself from consideration for the post over the weekend, citing family concerns. Trump and James have not met in person since Nauert pulled her name, and it’s unclear if they have spoken by phone.

Story Continued Below

A White House official said James, 37, was previously the “runner-up” for the position last December before Trump nominated Nauert. At the time, James met with several senior Trump administration officials, including the president, vice president and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. James is a “favorite” of Vice President Mike Pence, added a senior White House official, and has won a stamp of approval from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, both of whom are involved in deliberations.

James appeared on Fox News Wednesday afternoon in what some White House officials viewed as a formal audition for the role. He used the six-minute segment to pitch himself as an experienced businessman who could cut through the U.N. bureaucracy to deliver meaningful reforms, and also as someone who is willing to communicate the president’s “America First” vision. Trump has told advisers he wants someone in the job — recently downgraded from its Cabinet rank — who agrees with his foreign policy outlook and can be a ubiquitous presence on television.

“It’s an honor to be considered and I’m looking forward to getting the call should it come,” James told the network, touting his experience as a combat veteran and “someone who understands the growing spheres of communism around the world.”

Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been pushing the White House to tap U.S. Ambassador to Canada Kelly Knight Craft. Like James, she was also previously in the running for the post before Nauert was named.

“The Leader has spoken to the president and recommended Kelly Craft for the position,"" said David Popp, a McConnell spokesman.

Additionally, Trump is considering U.S. Ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell for the position, according to the senior White House official. But two White House officials said Grenell, despite earning the president’s praise, is unlikely to land the job. The openly gay Trump administration official was just tapped to lead a global initiative against the criminalization of homosexuality in dozens of developed countries, NBC reported on Tuesday.

James, who lost a race to unseat Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow last November, has long been discussed in GOP circles as a rising star in the Republican Party. A West Point graduate who helps runs a family-owned shipping business in Michigan, James drew several high-profile guests, including Trump, to stump for him in the final weeks before the 2018 midterm elections.

His closer-than-expected performance in 2018, along with his appeal among black communities — James is African-American — has some people close to the White House encouraging Trump to select a different person for the U.N. so that James can challenge Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan in 2020, according to a person familiar with those conversations.

“If he doesn’t get it this time, I don’t think it’s because they don’t like him, it’s because they want him to run again,” the person said.

An administration official said there “is a desire to find a big league position for” James but cautioned that the U.N. post “may not be the right fit” for him.

Nauert decided to withdraw her nomination last Friday in part because she believed her past employment of an au pair who wasn’t authorized to work in the U.S. would have further complicated the Senate confirmation process, sources familiar with her thinking previously told POLITICO.

Despite James’ popularity within the White House, some outside allies are worried that James may lack sufficient foreign policy experience, echoing a common critique of Nauert, who worked in broadcast journalism prior to joining the State Department in a senior communications role.

One person close to key U.S. senators said there are members who care deeply about the selection for this position and want to ensure the president’s eventual nominee is not untested in the foreign policy arena. Senate Democrats reacted with almost uniform dismay to Nauert’s nomination last year, claiming her loyalty to Trump should not supersede qualifications.

James would likely face similar pushback if nominated, even if some foreign policy experts insist that expertise in their field is not an absolute determiner of who can represent the U.S. well at the powerful international organization.

“Nikki Haley had very little foreign policy credentials before she did it and she did a great job,” said James Carafano, a national security expert at The Heritage Foundation. “She was … a quick learner and she was a strong leader, and those were the most valuable credentials.”

“The one difference,” Carafano allowed, “is Haley had a lot of time in government. She knew how government operated [and] she started doing her homework on foreign policy issues well before she was up for the U.N. appointment.”

Like Nauert, James also has young children at home, potentially complicating a move to New York City, where the official U.N. headquarters is located. A source familiar with the process dismissed such concerns, noting that his wife is already at home full-time and that their three children are not school age yet.

Asked about the status of the U.N. search, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told POLITICO she had “nothing to announce at this time.”

“I thought hard about what life was going to be like as a private citizen, and I think what I’ve always loved is policy — whether it’s foreign policy or domestic policy, I’ve always loved it, and I always want to have a voice,” Haley told the Washington Post.

Stand for America, a social welfare group that cannot endorse candidates or make political donations, vows to help every American accomplish the “American dream” and claims Americans’ success is “being threatened by socialist schemes of higher taxes, burdensome job-destroying regulations, government-run health care, and unsecure borders.” The group also says numerous rogue regimes internationally are jeopardizing U.S. national security.

""As U.S. Ambassador to the UN, I was able to see firsthand the challenges we face around the globe. Iranian-backed radical Islamic terrorism threatens the lives of innocent Americans,” Haley said in a statement Monday. “Communist China is spreading its influence throughout the world and engaging in unfair and illegal trade practices. North Korea still has nuclear weapons that can hit us. Russia meddles in our elections and invades its neighbors with no regard for their sovereignty. In our own backyard, socialist dictators in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua oppress their own people and support narco-trafficking that invades America.”

Haley, a former governor of South Carolina and daughter of immigrants, said her life story is evidence the American dream is still alive, due to “hard work, determination, and the incredible support of the people of South Carolina.”

""My story is proof positive that the American dream is alive and well,” Haley said in a statement Monday. “America’s greatness comes from our freedom and our values and they must be protected for future generations.”

""Even though I have entered private life, I will never stop standing up for America’s freedom and values,” Haley said. “We all have a part to play in keeping our country safe, strong, and prosperous.""

Burnaby South, which was vacated by former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart, who is now Vancouver’s mayor, is an important race for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who is vying for a seat in Parliament.

Liberal Richard T. Lee, Conservative Jay Shin, independent candidates Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu, and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson are also running in Burnaby South.

Polls are open Monday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

Lee is running after Karen Wang stepped down earlier this year after singling out Singh’s ethnicity in an online post. Tyler Thompson, who ran unsuccessfully for a school trustee position on the Burnaby school board, is the first candidate seeking a seat for Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC.

Green party Leader Elizabeth May said her party will respect the “leader’s courtesy” by not running a candidate against Singh.

It could be a close election to watch. The New Democrats beat the Liberals by just over 500 votes in the riding in the 2015 election.

Byelections are also being held in the Ontario riding of York–Simcoe and the Quebec riding of Outremont.

On 5 January, lawmaker Juan Guaido was elected as the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which all other Venezuelan government branches have refused to recognize. On 23 January, two days after the Venezuelan Supreme Court annulled his election, Guaido declared himself the country's ""interim president"". Incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, who was sworn in for his second presidential term on 10 January after winning reelection in a contest partially boycotted by the opposition in May, qualified Guaido's move as an attempt to stage a coup orchestrated by Washington.

The United States immediately recognized Guaido, after which some 50 other countries followed suit. Russia, China, Cuba, Bolivia and a number of other states have, in the meantime, voiced their support for the legitimate government of constitutionally elected Maduro. Mexico and Uruguay have refused to recognize Guaido, declaring themselves neutral and promoting crisis settlement via dialogue.

US Vice President Mike Pence said in Colombia on Monday that the Trump administration was mulling new sanctions against Venezuela's government. Pence also urged Monday all Lima Group members to freeze the assets of Venezuela's oil giant PDVSA and restrict visas for Venezuelan officials. The US vice president also called on these countries to immediately transfer the ownership of Venezuelan assets from the government of incumbent President Nicolas Maduro to self-proclaimed Interim President Juan Guaido.

The company says that numerous attacks carried out between September and December 2018 can be linked to a group known as Strontium.

Also known as Fancy Bear, the group is a cyber espionage outfit with ties to Russian intelligence agencies. At the same time as revealing some details of the attacks, Microsoft also announced the expansion of its AccountGuard security program to more European countries ahead of European Parliament elections.

Microsoft says that the attacks were not limited to particular electoral campaigns, but there was a definite political element to them. The company says that they, ""often extend to think tanks and non-profit organizations working on topics related to democracy, electoral integrity, and public policy and that are often in contact with government officials"".

In a blog post, Microsoft highlights attacks on the German Council on Foreign Relations and European offices of The Aspen Institute and The German Marshall Fund. Tom Burt, the company's corporate vice president of Customer Security & Trust, writes:

The attacks against these organizations, which we're disclosing with their permission, targeted 104 accounts belonging to organization employees located in Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, and Serbia. MSTIC continues to investigate the sources of these attacks, but we are confident that many of them originated from a group we call Strontium. The attacks occurred between September and December 2018. We quickly notified each of these organizations when we discovered they were targeted so they could take steps to secure their systems, and we took a variety of technical measures to protect customers from these attacks. Consistent with campaigns against similar US-based institutions, attackers in most cases create malicious URLs and spoofed email addresses that look legitimate. These spearphishing campaigns aim to gain access to employee credentials and deliver malware.

With European Parliament elections on the horizon, the company also says that it is expanding Microsoft AccountGuard to more European countries: France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain have been added to the existing list of the US, Canada, Ireland and the UK. Microsoft explains:

The markets for which we're announcing AccountGuard today represent places where we've been able to expedite the work needed to offer AccountGuard quickly, and we plan to expand AccountGuard to additional markets in Europe in coming months. Microsoft AccountGuard, which is part of our Defending Democracy Program, is a state-of-the-art cybersecurity service available at no extra cost to all political candidates, parties, and campaign offices operating at a local or national level. It is also available to think tanks, non-profits, and nongovernmental organizations working on issues related to democracy and electoral integrity. Microsoft AccountGuard is offered free-of-charge to organizations using Office 365.

It goes on to say:

The service provides notification of cyber threats, including attacks by known nation-state actors, across both email systems run by organizations and the personal accounts of these organizations' leaders and staff. Eligible organizations can invite selected staff and other associates to enroll, and notification will only occur with the consent of the account owner. Organizations can get protection for external individuals helping with a campaign, board members of non-profit organizations, or volunteers. When we detect threats, we will work directly with participating organizations to notify them and help them secure their systems. AccountGuard also provides covered organizations guidance to help make their networks and email systems more secure. This can include applying multi-factor authentication, installing the latest security updates, and guidance for setting up systems that ensure only those people who need data and documents can access them.

23,Empty,2019-02-19T22:15:49Z,"New advance poll figures released by Elections Canada show turnout is higher in Burnaby South than in the other two ridings hosting byelections on Monday, but not out of the norm.","NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is fighting for his political life in Monday's federal byelection in Burnaby South, spending the last few weeks campaigning in the riding to win himself his first seat in the House of Commons.

Voters don't seem to share his sense of urgency, however. New figures from Elections Canada put advance voting over the weekend on track with other byelections held over the last few years — byelections that didn't feature a national leader on the ballot.

Three byelections are taking place Monday in the ridings of Burnaby South in B.C., Outremont in Quebec and York–Simcoe in Ontario. Voters in the three ridings had the chance to cast their ballots early over four days between Feb. 15 and 18.

According to the advance polling figures released by Elections Canada Tuesday, Burnaby South boasted modestly higher turnout figures than the other two ridings, with 5,462 voters tramping out to the polls over the weekend.

York–Simcoe was next with 4,283, followed by Outremont at 3,795. When rendered as a share of the last tally of eligible voters (the list of electors is revised when new byelections take place), Outremont's advance polling turnout narrowly edged out York–Simcoe at 5.4 to 5.2 per cent.

For Burnaby South, that number was 7.2 per cent. In 2015, Burnaby South also had a higher number of people voting in the advance poll than either Outremont or York–Simcoe. As a share of all voters, advance turnout in 2015 was 12.3 per cent in Burnaby South — lower than Outremont's 12.6 per cent but higher than York–Simcoe's 9.9 per cent.

That suggests that while Burnaby South is punching a little above its weight in advance voting — an indication of some interest on the part of voters — it isn't a notably high number. Four byelections held since 2015 have had higher advance turnout, including two that flipped from one party to another and two that weren't particularly competitive.

The low turnout in Outremont — scene of Tom Mulcair's historic breakthrough for the NDP in a 2007 byelection — also signals that voters aren't taking an abnormally keen interest in these votes.

Byelection turnout typically is much lower than in general elections. It has averaged just under 34 per cent since 1997, while turnout has averaged just over 63 per cent in general elections. The new advance turnout figures in Burnaby South, Outremont and York–Simcoe suggest that these three ridings look to be about on track for that level of voter participation as well.",Advance poll numbers don't show massive early turnout for Burnaby South vote,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/byelections-advance-turnout-1.5025095

Executives from some of the world’s largest digital and social media firms have been invited to appear before an international committee on disinformation and “fake news” when it meets in Ottawa this May.

The “grand committee” of elected politicians from nine countries, including the U.K. and Canada, has already been stymied in its efforts to hear from some of them at earlier meetings in London.

Invitations for a meeting scheduled for May 28 in Ottawa have been sent to Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, as well as executives from WhatsApp and Snapchat, among others.

Zuckerberg declined several requests to appear at the first meeting of the committee in November, sending a Facebook vice-president instead.

This time, alternates will not be permitted, says Canadian Conservative MP Bob Zimmer, who chairs the House of Commons ethics committee, citing “inadequate” answers to questions at the November meeting.

“I am hopeful that these executives will take advantage of this unique opportunity to speak to representatives from around the globe about what their platforms are doing to ensure the privacy of our citizens,” Zimmer said in a news release.

“I am also looking forward to hearing from them about what is being done to stop the spread of disinformation and how they are protecting users from the threats of manipulation online.”

The meeting of the committee comes amid warnings from the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security that foreign actors are likely to try to manipulate Canadian opinion with malicious online activity during this election year.

Considerable evidence has pointed to online Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

The international panel was struck as part of a British committee’s probe that began in 2017 into the influence of false information online. That probe became heightened in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data controversy, which involved the alleged unauthorized use of some 87 million Facebook profiles globally — including those of more than 600,000 Canadians.

In its final report, published earlier this week, the U.K. Parliamentary committee called for an independent regulator to be created to police social media sites, singling out Facebook in particular for breaching privacy and competition laws.

“Companies like Facebook should not be allowed to behave like ‘digital gangsters’ in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law,” the report said. It also included some harsh criticism aimed at Zuckerberg, accusing him of contempt of U.K. Parliament and of the international grand committee for refusing to appear.

The Trudeau government has announced measures to counter possible election interference in Canada, including a panel of high level bureaucrats that will alert the public if they flag any concerns about online activities that could be seen as election meddling once the federal election campaign officially begins later this year.

27,Empty,2019-02-22T04:14:06Z,Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's principal secretary Gerald Butts resigned on Monday amid a growing scandal concerning the allegations that PMO tried to interfere with the potential criminal trial of Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.,"Sputnik discussed this story with Rémi Tremblay, the editor of Le Harfang and a contributor to the Council of Euro-Canadian and the author of Le Canada français, de Jacques Cartier au génocide tranquille.

Sputnik: How seriously will the Trudeau scandal hurt his chances of victory in the next election? Do you think it is a coincidence that this scandal emerged just a few months before the election campaign will officially begin?

Rémi Tremblay: The timing could not be worst for the Liberals, with the elections being just around the corner. It is extremely hard to evaluate the impact on the vote, but ethics has always been the Achille's heel of the federal Liberals. One of the reasons that explain the Conservative victory of 2006 is the corruption scandal revealed by the Gomery commission of inquiry. It took ten years for the Liberals to finally regain Canadians' trust and this new scandal will certainly hurt them. The question is simply to what extent. To add to that, although the decision has nothing to do with politics, Stéphane Roy, a former SNC-Lavalin employee accused of being involved in the corruption scandal in Libya, has seen his charges dismissed this month because the judicial procedures were too long. For many Canadians, it gives the feeling that the men involved will be able to avoid facing justice for what they have done. It is hard to believe that the timing of the revelations is a coincidence, but we must keep in mind that it is the Globe and Mail that first unveiled this scandal to the public. The Globe can definitely not be labelled a Conservative newspaper. We can doubt that it was published to intentionally hurt Trudeau's campaign. In fact, Trudeau could have tried defusing the whole affair and ensured the story deflated quickly and be long forgotten by this fall's elections.

Rémi Tremblay: Butts, although he may not be well-known to the general public was Trudeau's policy maker, his mastermind as well as a close friend since McGill's years. In September 2015, Macleans ran an article about Butts, describing him as the man who ""has shaped and branded the vast majority of policy"" that Trudeau campaigned on. Since then, his influence has increased, not decreased and he was called ""PM Butts"" by some Liberal caucus members. Trudeau, who sees himself as a delegate, an ambassador, relied on Butts for actual policy-making and explained to his MPs that what Butts said could be considered to be Trudeau's own thoughts. Trudeau Senior had Gérard Pelletier, and Trudeau Junior had Gerald Butts.

Sputnik: Both other major parties (the Conservatives & NDP) have spoken out in support of a public inquiry into the Trudeau SNC-Lavalin scandal. Could this lead to new revelations?

Rémi Tremblay: The question that is still left unanswered is the personal involvement of Trudeau. The pressure on Jody Wilson-Raybould and the fact that she was subsequently downgraded to the Veteran Affairs, even if she had been a much publicized caucus member, shows that the pressure came from the top of the government. The resignation of Butts gives the impression that he was the one who actually put pressure to avoid prosecutions for SNC-Lavalin, but he could very well be taking the shot for his personal friend Trudeau. Has tried taking the blame to save private Trudeau? It is the impression left by the move and it is what the Conservatives and Neo-Democrats would like to know.

Rémi Tremblay: The way the whole affair was handled by the government does raise legitimate questions. It is now said that the decision for not suing the company was based on economically based reasons. With around 16 000 employees in Canada, its bankruptcy or major losses could have had a major impact on the economy. However, it is extremely hard to believe that the Liberals did so for economic reasons. If it was so, they would probably have been open about it and not acted the way they did. If the reason was purely rational and for the benefits of Canadians, the Liberals would have been open and transparent about it and would not have pressured and later retrograded Wilson-Raybould.

The thing is the Liberals have had many issues with ethics and corruption in the last decades, so their credibility is limited at best. And we must not forget that SNC-Lavalin is itself accused of corruption. So the whole affair is suspicious, not to say more. As for SNC-Lavalin, allegations of corruption and fraud have been made several times in the past. Since 2010, it has been caught in a fraud linked to McGill's superhospital, bribery in Bengladesh, and was denied contracts by the World Banks because of wrongdoings in Cambodia. It has been hit by the longest ban ever imposed by the World Bank. So there again, it is far from being a spotless record and the credibility is questionable.

Rémi Tremblay: In my personal opinion, many media genuinely try to understand what is going on in Ottawa. No one saw the scandal coming and Butts' resignation was a unanimous surprise. We have seen some Canadian media trying to imply that Trudeau defended SNC-Lavalin because it was from the province of Quebec or much respected CBC explaining that this was damageable for Trudeau as he had lost his only Native minister, but they really miss the point. They just prove how narrow minded they are and the CBC has truly ridiculed itself with that analysis.

What is important to note though is that most media focus on the surface: how Trudeau has handled the affair since the Globe's revelation. But this goes deeper than that. This whole affair first raises the question of corruption in Canada, an issue that is closely linked with the Liberal Party, and also the separation between justice and politics. There again, the questions raised seemed very important. Why does a politician have the power to stop prosecution or alter the course of justice? Talking about the lack of Native representation in Ottawa is a convenient way out of this debate.

ADVERTISING Read more

Singh is standing in a by-election in Burnaby South in the Vancouver metropolitan area, a crucial test for the New Democratic Party (NDP) leader ahead of October’s general elections. He is by no means a dead cert to win: at the last federal legislative vote, in 2015, the party won this seat by a mere 500 votes. And in Monday’s by-election, the two main parties, the centre-left Liberals and the Conservatives, have put up candidates against Singh, breaking with the tradition that other parties do not run candidates against leaders.

Canadian politics operates according to the Westminster model, in which the executive is drawn from the legislature – so party leaders must have a seat in the House of Commons before they can become prime minister.

He became leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP) in October 2017, winning a plurality of the vote in the first round, six years after taking a seat in the Ontario provincial parliament.

‘We need to rethink what it means to be secular’

Singh was born in 1979, to parents from India’s Punjab region. Fluent in Hindi and Punjab as well as Canada’s official languages English and French, he grew up in Newfoundland on Canada’s sparsely populated east coast, before his family moved to the town of Windsor, Ontario, just across the US border.

After being called to the bar in 2006, Singh worked as a defence lawyer in the Toronto area until his election to the Ontario legislature. He has credited this work – especially pro bono work for underprivileged clients – as inspiring him to enter politics.

Indeed, Singh’s political platform is focused on social democratic policies aimed at reducing poverty and inequality. Notably, he advocates increasing the national minimum wage to 15 Canadian dollars (10 euros) per hour, legalising possession of all drugs (on the grounds that “it is not a criminal justice problem” but “a social justice problem and a healthcare problem”) and the removal of tax deductions on higher-rate taxpayers.

The NDP leader has also attracted attention with his opposition to Quebec’s proposed ban on public sector workers wearing religious symbols – which would prevent him from wearing his turban if he worked for the state in the French-speaking province. In an interview with CBC, the Canadian public service broadcaster, Singh argued that “we need to rethink what it means to be secular”, and said he feels he can wear a turban to work while still following Canadian secularism. On a Québécois talk show he added that “my objective is never to convince someone else to accept my identity – it’s to convince people that I share the same progressive values as them”.

‘A very telegenic, easy-to-like guy’

Analysts say that Singh communicates his agenda with considerable charisma. “His leadership can be seen as refreshing. People saw him as this very telegenic, easy-to-like guy, who might be able to compete on the celebrity level with Trudeau,” Lori Turnbull, the director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University, told the Guardian.

Yet – for all his charisma and forthright views on such issues as drugs and secularism – it seems likely that Singh will face a tough challenge in October’s general elections. An aggregate of voter intention surveys by specialist website Calculated Politics on February 21 predicts that the NDP will win a paltry 26 seats, compared to 156 for the Liberals and 141 for the Tories. By contrast, the New Democrats managed to win 44 seats in the 2015 elections.

In a column for Canadian daily the National Post, editorialist Chris Selley pointed out that the New Democrats’ may be polling poorly despite – not because of – Singh’s leadership: “The NDP has always been a party of contradictions not so much a big tent as a tent city. It’s supposed to be a party of both champagne socialists and farmers, of both autoworkers and environmentalists, of both staunch multiculturalists and Quebec nationalists.”

Selley also argued that “if Singh wins his seat, there is reason to hope he might grow into the job. To skeptics [sic] he evinces a distinctly Trudeauvian brand of superficiality, and a similar gift for quotes that land well but fall to pieces if you actually read them back. That hasn’t hurt Trudeau, though.”

Singh has vociferously called for a public inquiry over the SNC-Lavalin scandal, in which Trudeau has alleged to have pressured the justice minister – who subsequently resigned – to help the Montreal-based engineering firm avoid criminal prosecution on corruption charges. However, it remains to be seen whether the NDP leader can capitalise on this issue ahead of the October elections.","Jagmeet Singh, Canada’s ‘Trudeauvian challenger to Trudeau’",France24.com,https://www.france24.com/en/20190224-jagmeet-singh-canada-trudeau-ndp-politics

Singh addressed his supporters, saying “My friends, it’s a new day. It’s a new day,” and promising to take the issues of Burnaby residents to Ottawa.

Singh said many Canadians are falling behind, despite working hard, and they are starting to become fearful for themselves and their children.

He said some people will use that fear to “point at your neighbours, the people you live with, the people you work with.”

Singh said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was trying to protect his “friends at SNC-Lavalin” and subsidizing big oil. He said Canadians are drowning in debt, as he attacked corporations, saying the Liberals and Conservatives are not helping Canadians.

“Times up,” Singh said. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”

The results

Singh has 38.7 per cent of 20,346 votes counted, enough to be declared the winner.

There are 76,204 registered voters in the riding. 181 of 196 polls have been counted so far, representing 92 per cent of the vote.

Singh was up against Liberal Richard T. Lee, Conservative Jay Shin, independent candidates Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu, and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson.

In the 2015 federal election, the NDP won with 35 per cent of the vote, with the Liberals taking 33.9 per cent, the Conservatives 27.1 per cent, Greens 2.8 per cent and 1.1 per cent for the Libertarian party.

Lee has 26 per cent of the votes counted so far. The right-wing vote appears to be split, with Shin so far holding 22.7 per cent of the vote and Thompson with 10.9 per cent. Thompson is the first candidate seeking a seat for former Conversative Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC.

“Singh, Singh, Singh!”

Postmedia News reporter Matt Robinson said Singh supporters broke out into spontaneous chants of “Singh, Singh, Singh”, prior to Singh taking the podium at the election night party at the Metrotown Hilton.

Vancouver-Kingsway MP Don Davies has earlier taken the mic with an optimistic: “Welcome to the victory party.”

Peter Julian, MP for New Westminster-Burnaby, said with voters giving Singh the seat, “they’re saying they want a fighter. They’re saying they want someone who will stand up when the government makes bad choices.”

Jenny Kwan, a former and longtime MLA and now MP in Singh’s party, said “it’s a very exciting night. It’s one we’ve been waiting for for a long time. I know that Jag is so looking forward to going to Ottawa.

“We need a voice in the House of Commons that is on the side of the people and we haven’t had that with the Liberals and not with the Conservatives.”

Second place for Lee

Postmedia reporter Dan Fumano was with supporters of Liberal candidate Lee at the Delta Hotel.

Harjit Sajjan, the Liberal MP for Vancouver South an the Minister of National Defence, was at Lee’s event Monday night. Sajjan said he was happy to support Lee, who he described as a “humble, great person” and “I’ve had the opportunity to go door-knocking with him as well,” Sajjan told Postmedia.

“His compassion that he has for his community, that’s what really, I think, sets him apart.”

The Greens did not run a candidate in this byelection in order to improve the chances of an NDP win.

Burnaby South was vacated by former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart last October, when he was voted in as Vancouver’s mayor.

Quick things to know

• In the 2015 election, the New Democrats beat the Liberals in this riding by just over 500 votes.

• Lee announced he would be running after Karen Wang stepped down earlier this year after singling out Singh’s ethnicity in an online post.

• Tyler Thompson, who ran unsuccessfully for a school trustee position on the Burnaby school board, was the first candidate to seek a seat for Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC. She has been vocal against SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity) education in B.C.’s education curriculum.

• Green party Leader Elizabeth May had said her party will respect the “leader’s courtesy” by not running a candidate against Singh.

The company announced the development via a blog post by the company’s corporate vice president, Customer Security & Trust, Tom Burt.



AccountGuard service, which is already available in the U.K. and Ireland, has now been extended to 12 new European countries, namely Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, Lithuania, Portugal, Spain and Slovakia.



Notably, the service is accessible across the United States and Canada.



AccountGuard Features & Benefits



Microsoft AccountGuard is developed to provide highly targeted individuals and organizations in the political space with robust protection from cybersecurity threats. The service is free of cost “to eligible organizations” and other enterprises utilizing Office 365 email address.



Per the terms of AccountGuard service, the customers will be notified and provided with recommendations in case a threat is verified. The customers are also anticipated to benefit from security guidance and associated practices, including access to cybersecurity workshops and webinars.



We believe Microsoft’s expansion of AccountGuard offering is well-timed, given the uncertainty regarding Brexit and European Parliament elections around the corner. The fact that selection of the new free service complements Office 365 adoption makes it a smart move.



Into the Headlines



Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (“DCU”) and Threat Intelligence Center (“MSTIC”) have recently identified “activity targeting democratic institutions in Europe”.



Microsoft notes that the attempts to disrupt elections is broad-based and is not just limited to democratic institutes but also targets education institutes, think tanks and non-profit organizations.



In fact, the company claims to have identified attacks targeting employees of The Aspen Institutes in Europe, The German Marshall Fund and the German Council on Foreign Relations.



Microsoft claims to have notified the concerned organizations of the phishing attempt. The company is of the opinion that the group it calls “Strontium” is behind the cyber attacks which took place “between September and December 2018.”



In this regard it is important to note that in the recent past, Microsoft’s solid execution to thwart Russia’s attempts to disrupt U.S. mid-term elections has been commendable. Notably, Strontium is also suspected to be responsible for the 2016 Democratic National Committee (“DNC”) email leak.



In the past two years, Microsoft has disabled over 84 fake websites connected with the group, known variously as Fancy Bear, APT28 or Strontium.



What the Investors Need To Know?



The growing need for stringent security measures will compel governments and enterprises to increase spending on cyber-security software.



Going ahead, higher spending on defense globally in 2019 as reflected in the latest Deloitte study is anticipated to boost innovative cybersecurity schemes.



Moreover, there is an underlined correlation of increasing cyber attacks and elections primarily in democratic nations. With European Parliament elections around the corner and the Presidential elections in the United States in 2020, demand for cyber security solutions is projected to grow.



In fact, per MarketsandMarkets data, worldwide cyber-security spending is anticipated to reach $231.94 billion by 2022. Microsoft’s initiatives in cybersecurity position it well to capitalize on the alluring prospects.

However, in the past few weeks, Sardinia was all over the news for another reason. Photos of shepherds pouring milk on highways and town streets have been under the spotlight on social media. The act has given wide attention to the protest of farmers, who have been demonstrating against milk’s extremely low prices. The shepherds accused cheese-makers and industrialists to have allied in order to keep prices for sheep and goat milk so low that they would rather throw the milk away than sell it for close to nothing.

According to Euronews, the price of sheep milk has fallen more than 25%, reaching around €o.60 ($0.68) per liter. In January prices touched a minimum of €0.56 ($0.63) per liter, while costs of production are about €0.70 ($0.79) per liter, making shepherds facing a negative margin of €0.14 ($0.16) for each liter they make. The despair spread around and ended up in the manifestations that saw farmers creating roadblocks and pouring hundreds of liters of milk on the concrete. Shepherds have also threated to stop the regional elections that are going to take place on February 24.

The drop in prices is a consequence of the overproduction of pecorino romano cheese, the product in which most of the sheep milk produced in Sardinia goes to. The wholesale price used to be around €7.5 ($8.4) per kg, but it dropped to €5.5 ($6.2), bringing down the price of the raw material to the point production became unsustainable for shepherds. Luca Saba, the president of the Sardinian Coldiretti, the association that represents agriculture, blamed the processing industries for the fall of prices, explaining that cheesemakers made much more than what the demand could absorb. Last September, the Italian center for agricultural studies alreday warned about the excessive production of pecorino romano cheese in 2018 and registered a surfeit of dozens of thousands of quintals. The crisis was not only triggered by a surplus in production, but also because of a significant decline in exports.

Massimo Forino, the director of the association representing dairy industrialists, told Italian media that pecorino romano cheese’s exports have fallen by 33% while production was raised by 23%, creating an economic imbalance in the sector. The most important market for the pecorino cheese has traditionally been North America, with the United States and Canada representing the biggest buyers of the Italian traditional product. However, in 2018 exports toward America fell by 44%, leaving cheese industrialists with a considerable surplus of unsold production. The drop in exports must also be traced back to the rise in prices. When the Italian pecorino cheese becomes too expensive, North Americans tend to go for a cheaper version of the product, like the one from South America.

As the protests got all the way over to Rome, with farmers demonstrating outside the Italian parliament, the government started working on a solution. The first proposal, that offered €0.70 ($0.79) per liter right away, with the goal of reaching €1 ($1.13) within three months, was rejected. As negotiations continue, the Ministry of Interior has allocated €44 million ($49.7m) to remove from the market all the excess of pecorino cheese to make prices go higher.

What is happening right now in Sardinia is somehow a classic conflict between the parts involved in the food supply chain. The final price of a product is set by the last subject in the chain, the retailer, that appoints it on the basis of the selling price of the processor, the intermediate category that transforms the raw material and delivers to the marketers. The profit that comes from a product often benefits mostly the seller and the industrialist, while producers, the first group of the chain, handle over the raw material at a price that can be extremely lower than the final one. Cyclically, this imbalance generates economical tension within the supply chain and the protests of Sardinian shepherds are the result of that tension. While negotiations are still on, this case is the opportunity for consumers, who only see the finished product and its ending price, to be more informed on the steps of the food supply chain, all the work’s phases and the labor struggles behind what they are buying.",Why Shepherds Are Pouring Milk On Highways In The Italian Island Of Sardinia,Forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/annalisagirardi/2019/02/19/why-shepherds-are-pouring-milk-on-highways-in-the-italian-island-of-sardinia/

When the British electorate voted nearly three years ago to leave Europe behind, the world looked very different than it does today. Instead of a vibrant multinational order, Britain now faces a world challenged by Donald Trump's presidency, cooler relations with China, and electoral manipulation by hostile powers.

OXFORD – Dramatic changes have swept the world since British voters decided in 2016 to leave the European Union. None of them could have been easily foreseen in 2016, but their occurrence makes avoiding a no-deal Brexit a matter of urgent national security for the UK.

Renewing Europe Mar 4, 2019 calls on EU citizens to focus on three goals ahead of the critical European Parliament election in May. Jose Luis Pelaez Inc/Getty Images A Better Populism Feb 27, 2019 argues that beggar-thy-neighbor policies cannot solve the problems facing declining communities. Wojtek Radwanski/AFP/Getty Images Europe, Please Wake Up Feb 11, 2019 argues that the EU cannot be saved without transforming its political party systems. Previous Next

Three shifts, in particular, have created a more hostile environment for a plucky country wanting to set out on its own. First, the global rules-based system has been seriously weakened. Second, China no longer looks like such a good partner for the United Kingdom. And, third, tech platforms have left democracy in Britain – and elsewhere – increasingly vulnerable to foreign interference.

In June 2016, Britain could rely on multilateral arrangements – in trade, security, and diplomacy – which, backed by the United States, offered an alternative to the European Union. As then-US President Barack Obama put it, America would “mobilize the world to work with us” on issues of global concern, such as Iran’s nuclear program. On trade, the Obama administration was committed to using World Trade Organization processes rather than unilaterally imposing sanctions.

The US presidential election in November 2016 dramatically changed Britain’s options. Under President Donald Trump, the US has withdrawn from the nuclear agreement with Iran, imposed unilateral trade sanctions (including on allies), and announced its intention to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. Trump has proclaimed his willingness to tear up existing trade agreements, and is undermining the WTO by refusing to appoint judges to the organization’s dispute-settlement bodies. And, without consulting allies, Trump has announced unilateral US troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and Syria.

This new, go-it-alone America is destabilizing the global alliances, rules, and institutions on which post-Brexit Britain will rely even more heavily if it leaves the EU with no deal. The UK has economic and security interests around the world, but it cannot make and enforce rules on its own. Without the US, the UK needs powerful, like-minded friends with which it can work ever more closely. Its EU neighbors are the most obvious candidates.

A second change concerns Britain’s relationship with China. At the time of the Brexit referendum, China appeared to be a promising and powerful new partner. President Xi Jinping’s lavish, highly publicized four-day visit to the UK in 2015 was hailed as a huge success, with the two sides signing trade and investment deals worth some £40 billion ($52.1 billion). The UK was envisaging a new “golden decade” of bilateral relations.

The relationship shines far less brightly today. China is preoccupied with its US trade war, slower economic growth, the growing challenges of rolling out its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, and the global problems facing telecoms giant Huawei. A UK that is not part of the EU’s single market or customs union would be a much lower priority for China. When British Prime Minister Theresa May visited in early 2018, the reception was low-key. The tenth meeting of the UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue is said to have been postponed indefinitely. And an upcoming visit to China by Chancellor of the Exchequer Phillip Hammond has reportedly been canceled.

When Britain leaves the EU, it will be forced to negotiate with the Chinese on its own, without the leverage of Germany, which has far stronger bilateral trade ties with China. Worse, if Britain leaves with no deal, it will urgently need to sign trade agreements with other countries. Britain would then come under strong pressure to open up critical infrastructure such as energy or telecoms to more Chinese investment, on China’s terms. In a world increasingly defined by US-China competition and confrontation, Britain has a much stronger interest in making common cause with its EU neighbors.

Finally, in June 2016, when a slim majority of the electorate voted to protect British democracy from “foreigners,” few suspected that Russia and other foreign powers were covertly infiltrating and influencing UK politics via social-media platforms. And the data-breach scandal involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica had not yet broken.

We now know that Russia used fake Twitter accounts to tweet #ReasonsToLeaveEU, even on the day of the referendum. But stopping such interference is difficult. After the 2016 US election was infiltrated, the US House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence documented over 3,000 Facebook ads bought by Russia’s Internet Research Agency. Facebook promised to address the issue, yet US officials reported that Russian interference continued during the 2018 US midterm elections.

Taking defensive action is even harder for Britain because the big social-media companies are not based there. Even when the UK Parliament joined forces with its counterparts in Australia, Argentina, Canada, and Ireland to invite Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to address them at a joint hearing, he declined to attend. And on February 18, a British parliamentary committee published a report that sharply criticized Facebook and other large tech companies for failing to counter the spread of disinformation and “fake news.”

The EU currently offers the best defenses for British democracy. It was EU pressure that pushed Google to roll out transparency rules ahead of the upcoming European Parliament elections that will force advertisers to prove they are either EU citizens or Europe-based entities. The EU’s East StratCom Task Force is working to counter Russian and other disinformation campaigns. And a Europe-wide code of conduct for technology firms has impelled them to remove illegal hate speech faster.

Leaving the EU would be a major challenge for Britain in the best of circumstances. But big global shifts since 2016 have made a no-deal Brexit, in particular, an even riskier proposition.

But the perpetrators aren’t the much-talked-about Russian trolls accused of meddling in U.S. elections. They aren’t bot accounts, either. They’re conspiracy theorists riding on an American hoax.

The far-right QAnon conspiracy theory falsely accuses virtually all President Donald Trump’s foes of being involved in a Satanic pedophilia and cannibalism ring. Its nebulous nature, branches of which include belief in time travel and reptilians, makes it a prime conspiracy theory for paranoid Americans. But the German far right—or at least people who support it—are jumping on the U.S.-based theory, according to a new study by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, an anti-extremism think tank. Now those troll armies are using QAnon as a megaphone for their own causes.

“We came across new international far-right networks that are active in Germany, promoting the far right’s political and cultural agenda and attacking the AfD’s [far-right party Alternative for Germany] political opponents,” the ISD study’s authors wrote. “The US-based conspiracy network QAnon has emboldened a German version, linking violent and anti-democratic conspiracy theories across the Atlantic.”

The study tracked down German QAnon groups on messaging apps like Discord, where conspiracy theorists made memes calling for people to vote for far-right parties in Bavaria’s 2018 elections, or abstain from voting altogether. The tactic is similar to the voter suppression efforts allegedly used by Kremlin-backed trolls during the 2016 presidential election, where Russian accounts targeted American (and especially African-American) Facebook users with memes discouraging them from voting. But these users weren’t Russian.

In the run-up to the Bavarian election in October 2018, ISD traced hashtags that supported the AfD. Eighty-three percent of those tweets were traced back to Germany, suggesting a local campaign instead of foreign interference. Of those tweets, 1.7 percent also used the hashtag #QAnon, while another 1.3 percent used the hashtag #Q. Other posts used hashtags with German translations of popular QAnon slogans. One of the most prolific accounts using pro-AfD hashtags had a QAnon reference in their username, the study found.

“Accounts spreading QAnon conspiracy theory content boosted pro-AfD campaign hashtags simultaneously,” the study found. “For example, some accounts using hashtags such as #DrainTheSwamp, #HillaryForPrison and #DrainTheDeepState were also found to systematically boost pro-AfD hashtags such as #linksliegenlassen, #MerkelMussWeg, #AfD and #AfDwirkt – often in the same tweet.”

While the overlap of pro-AfD and QAnon hashtags might seem small, it doesn’t account for the coordinated trolling campaigns popular in QAnon circles. German Q fans worked in private chat groups to roll out memes that could be bulk-posted on Facebook and Twitter.

American QAnon fans use similar spam campaigns. Researcher Erin Gallagher has charted the conspiracy theory’s most active tweeters, some of whom tweeted more than 500 times a day in spring 2018. These Twitter users aren’t “bots,” a common term for an account that tweets automatically. Instead, they’re humans coordinating timed campaigns to flood Twitter with messages and share them across tens of thousands of newsfeeds.

Gallagher used a data visualization program to “graph” the accounts’ activity, which led her to suspect real people were behind the tweets.

“I suspected there were a lot of real people in the QAnon networks because graphs of their hashtags looked unusual,” Gallagher told The Daily Beast.

“Some of the QAnon'ers I spoke with after I published told me they are older retired people with a lot of free time,” she continued. “They follow and retweet everyone and everything in their communities indiscriminately. They participate in ‘follow trains’ which is how they build up such large accounts. They're in DM groups, some of which are dedicated solely to retweeting so you may have up to 50 people in one DM group and they automatically retweet every tweet that gets dropped into the group. The people I talked to were in several DM groups, not just one, so in the aggregate, these DM groups are powerful hubs of activity.”

In September, some QAnon-themed accounts were active in promoting hashtags in support of far-right rallies in Chemnitz, Germany, Gallagher found. Although most of the accounts she observed appeared to be German QAnon fans, a few seemed to be American. One of the most shared tweets under the hashtag “ChemnitzIstDerAnfang” (German for “Chemnitz is the beginning”) came from a prominent U.S. QAnon account, she said.

It’s not just Germany. Right-wingers in Canada and the U.K. have added QAnon to a swamp of protest movements co-opted from other countries, The Daily Beast previously reported. Canadian and British racist groups have rallied in yellow vests, a look borrowed from a complex, bipartisan protest movement originally from France. Some of the ralliers wrote QAnon slogans on their vests, or on posters. The combined effect is a transatlantic protest movement of fringe right-wingers drawing on the public’s favorable perception of Yellow Vest protests, and the digital militancy of the QAnon crowd.

American QAnon fans have also amplified far-right European propaganda. Yellow Vest posts with a right-wing slant are popular in QAnon groups. Last month, a Yellow Vest video from the European anti-immigrant group Pegida spread rapidly through QAnon groups.

The crossover between QAnon and far-right German movements like the Chemnitz riots makes sense. Both movements are aggressively anti-Muslim and anti-refugee. And both make vague gestures toward a right-wing revolution.

“At the time I got the impression that some people thought Chemnitz was going to be ‘Germany's great awakening,’” Gallagher said, referencing QAnon’s promise of a “great awakening” in America.

It’s a trend she’s previously observed, as America’s alt-right moved on to trolling on behalf of their counterparts in Europe after Trump’s victory in 2016.

“I've noticed crossover of US alt-right networks with European alt-right for a long time,” she said. “How QAnon fits into all that is a great question, but the international alt-right coordinated swarms—QAnon related or not—do not surprise me.”",How Fringe Groups Are Using QAnon to Amplify Their Wild Messages,Thedailybeast.com,https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-fringe-groups-are-using-qanon-to-amplify-their-wild-messages

I WAS one of four African trade unionists who observed the 2002 Zimbabwean Presidential elections under the African Union Observer Mission. The international observers including those from Nigeria, led by former Head of Interim Government, Chief Ernest Shonekan, met daily at the Sheraton Hotel to compare notes. There was a consensus that the elections in which President Robert Mugabe had 54 per cent and opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai had 40 per cent, were free and fair. It was, therefore, a shock when the Commonwealth Observer Mission led by former Nigerian Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, had a contrary report; one that was not based on observed facts.

Ukraine’s farcical drama

Based on this contrived report, then Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, Australian Prime Minister, John Howard and South African President Thabo Mbeki, announced the suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth claiming the elections were “marred by a high level of politically motivated violence.” Violence that was not visible to other international observers.

This confirmed my position that nothing involving human beings is value-free. Yes, humans can be objective, but in a subjective way. It is like journalism; the journalist is charged to be objective because ‘facts are sacred’. However, the angle he picks his report, the type of headline cast and the way he interprets the story, cannot be entirely objective. So it is with election monitors and observers. For example, in the 2015 Nigeria elections, the international observers were supposed to have done a clinical job. But the biases of their home governments were quite visible.

These included the refusal to sell the Jonathan government arms to fight the Boko Haram, obstructing the sale of arms by other countries and making statements that seemed innocuous, but clearly tilting towards the then opposition All Progessives Congress, APC. The international observers who are mainly Western or Western-funded, picked their cue from these. The APC benefitted from this as it coasted home to victory assisted by a gentleman President Goodluck Jonathan who insisted that his ambition for a second term was not worth the blood of a single Nigerian.

When, therefore, Western countries began to make the same seemingly innocuous statements in the run up to tomorrow’s Presidential elections, the ruling APC could see through the smokescreen and started shouting about ‘foreign intervention’. Interestingly, it does not see the visit of two governors from Niger Republic to campaign for Buhari, as foreign intervention.

The current drama began on November 18, 2018 when the European Union, EU, and some 24 countries, including the United States of America, USA, United Kingdom, UK, France, Germany, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden, issued a statement which stated in part: “As friends of Nigeria and its people, we will follow the campaigns and election process closely.

Who wins the elections is for the Nigerian people to decide. Our concern is to see a process leading to free, fair, transparent and peaceful elections. We hope to see transparent campaigns and we urge all voters to use their democratic right and vote… We urge all involved to refrain from using hate speech and take a firm stance against violence.”

The APC which had tried in vain to prevent the January 17, visit to the USA by the opposition People’s Democratic Party, PDP, Presidential Candidate, Alhaji Abubakar Atiku, could take it no more when the EU, UK and USA criticised the January 25 controversial suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen by President Buhari. Given this unprecedented Executive action, the countries had worried about the credibility of the Presidential elections.

The ruling APC’s Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State who claims to be close to President Buhari, sent out a chilling message to the Western countries and their observers: “Those that are calling for anyone to come and intervene in Nigeria, we are waiting for the person that would come and intervene, they would go back in body bags…Nobody will come to Nigeria and tell us how to run our country. We have got our independence and we are trying to run our country as decently as possible and we know the history of those countries that are trying to teach us.”

To demonstrate that the governor had official backing, the APC National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu affirmed to the press that: “what Governor El-Rufai said, clearly, is the position of this government.” The Presidency also backed El-Rufai. Presidential Spokesperson, Mallam Garba Shehu in a rather ambiguous statement said: “The governor spoke strongly in defence of national interest.” In reaction, the obviously rattled Western Observers opted to stay rather than flee the country. It was left for President Buhari to assure the observers of their safety.

But I do not think the foreign observers should worry too much as they will not be the only ones in body bags; President Buhari has said those who try to disturb the electoral process or snatch ballot boxes, would also find themselves in body bags. He told the APC National Executive Council meeting this Monday: “Anybody who decides to snatch ballot boxes or lead thugs to disturb it (elections), maybe that would be the last unlawful action he would take. I have directed the police and the military to be ruthless…I am going to warn anybody who thinks he has enough influence in his locality to lead a body of thugs to snatch boxes or to disturb the voting system, he would do it at the expense of his own life.”

But who really puts much stock on what election observers think? Usually, they sanctify election results on the basis that they ‘substantially comply’ with democratic rules. In very rare cases, they cast doubts on the results. For instance, the West condemned the results of the December 30, 2018 Presidential Elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Belgium threatened to drag the country before the United Nations Security Council while French Foreign Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, claimed that the results “do not conform with the results that we have noticed.” That did not stop the country from swearing in President Felix Tshisekedi.

Nigeria should consider itself lucky that the West is here to observe our elections. When Venezuela conducted its May 20, 2018 general elections and invited the EU and UN to observe, it was ignored. That did not stop the EU, USA and their allies from condemning the elections as fraudulent and recognising a fraudster who did not even contest the elections as “Acting President.”

If the foreign observers do not want to return home in body bags, they should allow Nigerians to democratically choose tomorrow, who can better stop the massacres, banditry, insecurity and impunity in the country.","Nigeria, politics of elections and International Observers",Vanguardngr.com,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2019/02/nigeria-politics-of-elections-and-international-observers/

The US vice-president, Mike Pence, has repeated a veiled threat of military intervention in Venezuela, but Washington appeared increasingly isolated in its willingness to contemplate using force to oust President Nicolás Maduro.

European powers and some of Donald Trump’s key Latin American allies – all of whom have recognised the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as Venezuela’s legitimate leader – warned that they would oppose sending troops into the country.

Guaidó had for weeks insisted his movement was focused on peaceful, democratic change. But after the opposition failed in a weekend bid to defy Caracas and bring aid into the country, he called on the international community to “keep all options open”.

That hint at the use of military force won an enthusiastic response from hawks like US senator Marco Rubio, but sparked alarm elsewhere, particularly as Trump has previously mooted ordering an invasion.

Speaking at an emergency summit of regional leaders in the Colombian capital Bogotá, Pence renewed the threat of intervention, describing Maduro as “a usurper”, and calling for a global push to oust him.

“To leaders around the world: it’s time. There can be no bystanders in Venezuela’s struggle for freedom,” he said. “We hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But beyond the US, few appear willing embrace the prospect of violence. In Latin America, there is a painful and bloody history of US interventions, and the terrible fallout from the 2003 invasion of Iraq is another deterrent to the use of military force.

An invasion would be complicated and bloody, with a strong chance of sliding into protracted civil war. Venezuela has armed forces that are more than 300,000 strong, thousands more members of pro-government gangs or guerrilla groups, complex terrain – and a government that still has some support from international partners including China and Russia.

Brazil’s vice-president, retired general Hamilton Mourão, said on Monday that under no circumstances would his country allow the United States to intervene militarily from Brazilian territory, even though the country’s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro has previously vowed to do “everything for democracy to be re-established” in Venezuela.

Colombian president Iván Duque has also now ruled out intervention, according to sources in his administration. Chile and Peru were among other regional powers opposing military action on Monday.

There was similar concern across the Atlantic, where European nations including Spain and Germany made clear they considered the deployment of troops a line that should not be crossed.

“Not every option is on the table,” the country’s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, told the Spanish news agency Efe on Sunday, in a blunt rebuke to both Guaidó and US supporters of intervention.

The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, insisted there could be no military solution to a political crisis.

“The origins of the ongoing crisis in Venezuela are political and institutional, hence the solution can only be a political one,” she said in a statement. “We reiterate our firm rejection and condemnation of violence and of any initiatives that can further destabilise the region.”

Before the meeting of the Lima group of Latin American powers and Canada, Pence told Guaidó, attending as Venezuela’s interim president: “We are 100% with you.”

The Lima group also said credible threats have been made against the life of Venezuelan opposition leader Guaidó and his family, adding that President Nicolas Maduro was responsible for Guaido’s safety.",'Maduro must go': Pence bids to ramp up effort to oust Venezuelan leader,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/apos-maduro-must-apos-pence-193214527.html

Instead silence, or worse, cheer-leading.

Venezuela is a deeply divided society. Maybe a quarter of Venezuelans want the president removed by (almost) any means. A similar proportion backs Nicolas Maduro. A larger share of the population oscillates between these two poles, though they generally prefer the president to opposition forces that support economic sanctions and a possible invasion.

There are many legitimate criticisms of Maduro, including questions about his electoral bonafides after a presidential recall referendum was scuttled and the Constituent Assembly usurped the power of the opposition dominated National Assembly (of course many opposition actors’ democratic credentials are far more tainted). But, the presidential election in May demonstrates that Maduro and his PSUV party maintain considerable support. Despite the opposition boycott, the turnout was over 40% and Maduro received a higher proportion of the overall vote than leaders in the US, Canada and elsewhere. Additionally, Venezuela has an efficient and transparent electoral system — “best in the world” according to Jimmy Carter in 2012 — and it was the government that requested more international electoral observers.

Unlike Venezuela, Haiti is not divided. Basically, everyone wants the current “president” to go. While the slums have made that clear for months, important segments of the establishment (Reginald Boulos, Youri Latortue, Chamber of Commerce, etc) have turned on Jovenel Moïse. Reliable polling is limited, but it’s possible 9 in 10 Haitians want President Moïse to leave immediately. Many of them are strongly committed to that view, which is why the country’s urban areas have been largely paralyzed since February 7.

In a bid to squelch the protests, government forces (and their allies) have killed dozens in recent months. If you include the terrible massacre reported here and here in the Port-au-Prince neighborhood of La Saline on November 11-13 that number rises far above 100.

Even prior to recent protests the president’s claim to legitimacy was paper-thin. Moïse assumed the job through voter suppression and electoral fraud. Voter turnout was 18%. His predecessor and sponsor, Michel Martelly, only held elections after significant protests. For his part, Martelly took office with about 16 per cent of the vote, since the election was largely boycotted. After the first round, US and Canadian representatives pressured the electoral council to replace the second-place candidate, Jude Celestin, with Martelly in the runoff.

While you won’t have read about it in the mainstream media, recent protests in Haiti are connected to Venezuela. The protesters’ main demand is accountability for the billions of dollars pilfered from Petrocaribe, a discounted oil program set up by Venezuela in 2006. In the summer demonstrators forced out Moïse’s prime minister over an effort to eliminate fuel subsidies and calls for the president to go have swelled since then. Adding to popular disgust with Moïse, his government succumbed to US/Canadian pressure to vote against Venezuela at the OAS last month.

So what has been Ottawa’s response to the popular protests in Haiti? Has Global Affairs Canada released a statement supporting the will of the people? Has Canada built a regional coalition to remove the president? Has Canada’s PM called other international leaders to lobby them to join his effort to remove Haiti’s President? Have they made a major aid announcement designed to elicit regime change? Have they asked the International Criminal Court to investigate the Haitian government? Has Justin Trudeau called the Haitian President a “brutal dictator”?

In fact, it’s the exact opposite to the situation in Venezuela. The only reason the Haitian president is hanging on is because of support from the so-called “Core Group” of “Friends of Haiti”. Comprising the ambassadors of Canada, France, Brazil, Germany and the US, as well as representatives of Spain, EU and OAS, the “Core Group” released a statement last week “acknowledging the professionalism shown by the Haitian National Police.” The statement condescendingly “reiterated the fact that in a democracy change must come through the ballot box, and not through violence.” The “Core Group’s” previous responses to the protests expressed stronger support of the unpopular government. As I detailed 10 weeks ago in a story headlined “Canada backs Haitian government, even as police force kills demonstrators”, Ottawa has provided countless forms of support to Moïse’s unpopular government. Since then Justin Trudeau had a “very productive meeting” with Haitian Prime Minister Jean Henry Ceant, International development minister Marie-Claude Bibeau‏ declared a desire to “come to the aid” of the Haitian government and Global Affairs Canada released a statement declaring that “acts of political violence have no place in the democratic process.” Trudeau’s government has provided various forms of support to the repressive police that maintains Moïse’s rule. Since Paul Martin’s Liberals played an important role in violently ousting Jean-Bertrand Aristide’s government in 2004 Canada has financed, trained and overseen the Haitian National Police. As took place the night Aristide was forced out of the country by US Marines, Canadian troops were recently photographed patrolling the Port-au-Prince airport.

Taking their cue from Ottawa, the dominant media have downplayed the scope of the recent protests and repression in Haiti. There have been few (any?) stories about protesters putting their bodies on the line for freedom and the greater good. Instead the media has focused on the difficulties faced by a small number of Canadian tourists, missionaries and aid workers. While the long-impoverished country of 12 million people is going through a very important political moment, Canada’s racist/nationalist media is engrossed in the plight of Canucks stuck at an all-inclusive resort!

The incredible hypocrisy in Ottawa’s response to recent political developments in Haiti and Venezuela is shameful. Why has no major media dared contrast the two?

38,Empty,2019-02-21T13:21:00Z,Strong cases can be made for owning or avoiding the most polarizing pot stock in the world.,"After years of being stuck behind the curtain of prohibition, the legal cannabis industry is finally thriving. In October, Canada became the first industrialized country, and the second overall behind Uruguay, to legalize recreational pot. It was followed not long after by a handful of U.S. states legalizing or expanding access to cannabis in the November midterm elections, and President Trump signing the Farm Bill into law in December, giving the green light to hemp and hemp-based products.

Just how big could the legal weed industry be? While estimates are all over the place, investment firm Cowen Group offers the most robust sales prediction of $75 billion in worldwide sales by 2030. Meanwhile, a co-authored report from Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics is calling for $31.3 billion in global sales by 2022, up from $12.8 billion in 2018.

Figures like these are what has made Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) the most popular stock among millennial investors on free-trading app Robinhood. However, there's probably also no stock that's more polarizing to investors as a whole than Aurora Cannabis. You either think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread, or you find it grossly overvalued, with few if any investors taking a middle-of-the-road stance.

Three very good reasons Aurora Cannabis could make you rich

With this in mind, below you'll find three arguments in favor of buying one of the largest publicly traded pot stocks in the world. Afterwards, I'll tackle three arguments against buying Aurora Cannabis.

If there's a clear top reason to buy into the Aurora Cannabis growth story, it's the company's peak production potential. Although Aurora's management team has guided to ""in excess of 500,000 kilograms"" annually when running on all cylinders, it's hard to see the company near a figure this low. Rather, management had been calling for 570,000 kilos prior to the purchase of ICC Labs in South America for 264 million Canadian dollars late last year. With 92,000 square feet of existing production and 1.1 million square feet of under-construction greenhouse capacity, ICC Labs should help push Aurora close to 700,000 kilograms per year.

Even though production isn't everything, the company's sheer amount of annual output should help lead to ample long-term supply deals with domestic provinces and overseas countries where medical weed is legal. Also, the cannabis industry tends to benefit from economies of scale. This suggests that as production rises, Aurora's per-gram production costs should fall.

Also, Aurora has perhaps the most impressive overseas footprint of any marijuana grower. Having recently reported its quarterly results, Aurora now has a presence in 23 countries on five continents. Being able to export weed to overseas markets will become incredibly important by early next decade when growers are fully operational and licensed, and domestic output handily outpaces Canadian demand. In order to avoid a serious decline in per-gram dried flower pricing, growers need foreign outlets to sell their product. Aurora has done a remarkable job of finding these outlets, which should help somewhat shield it from a decline in dried cannabis flower pricing.

The third reason Aurora Cannabis looks to be a buy is the company's focus on the medical marijuana community. Whereas a substantial majority of Canopy Growth's sales in its most recent quarter were from the recreational side of the business, Aurora still counted more medical weed sales (CA$26 million) than adult-use sales (CA$21.6 million) in its latest quarter. Though the consumer pool is smaller for medical marijuana, the product margins tend to be significantly higher. That's because medical weed patients are more willing to purchase higher-margin alternative consumption options, such as softgel capsules, oil products, and eventually cannabis-infused beverages and/or edibles. By making medical marijuana patients a priority, Aurora appears to be setting itself up for superior operating margins.

Three arguments why Aurora will send its investors to the poor house

Of course, there are two sides to every argument. Here's a look under the hood at why Aurora Cannabis may not be such a blazing-hot buy.

To begin with, it's a company that's been blessed with a couple of quarters of profitability due to one-time benefits, but that's been losing money hand over fist on an operating basis. As an active acquirer and company that's aiming to expand overseas, Aurora's expenses to construct and retrofit greenhouses, and establish overseas sales channels, are immense. Mind you, this doesn't include growing costs for sales and marketing, the addition of new employees, and the ongoing focus on branding and innovation. In other words, it could be some time before Aurora Cannabis is generating a meaningful per-share profit, and an operating profit without the aid of one-time benefits.

Secondly, Aurora Cannabis remains in the shadows in the partnership department. Whereas Canopy Growth landed a $4 billion equity investment from Constellation Brands, Cronos Group snagged a $1.8 billion equity stake from Altria, and HEXO formed a joint venture with Molson Coors Brewing, the largest producer by peak output is still by itself in the corner. There were reports that Coca-Cola was interested in a partnership or possible equity stake in Aurora this past September, but a deal was never reached. Without a brand-name partner with a keen marketing prowess, Aurora could struggle to gain the same validity as its peers.

Third and finally -- and you knew this was coming -- there's the ongoing share-based dilution. Until recently, pot stocks have had minimal or no access to nondilutive forms of financing, such as lines of credit or bank loans. Instead, they've often turned to bought-deal offerings, which involve selling common stock, convertible debentures, options, and/or warrants to raise capital to undertake their expansion strategy. While these offerings are successful, they also wind up ballooning a company's outstanding share count, which weighs on existing investors and pushes down the earnings per share of profitable companies. Aurora's outstanding share count is now just a stone's throw from 1 billion when it was at 16 million less than five years ago.

The only question left to ask is: Which side of the aisle do you fall on with Aurora Cannabis?",3 Arguments For and Against Buying Aurora Cannabis,Fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/02/21/3-arguments-for-and-against-buying-aurora-cannabis.aspx

Brussels issued the threat after the US Commerce Department filed a report that empowers President Donald Trump to apply car duties within the next 90 days.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has labelled as ""frightening"" the prospect that this report could label European car imports as a national security threat to the United States, enabling the tariffs.

The White House has already used the national security argument, saying that undermining the American manufacturing base impairs military readiness, among other claims, to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.

""Were this report translated into action detrimental to European exports, the European Commission would react in a swift and adequate manner,"" EU spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a news briefing in Brussels.

The protectionist Trump has threatened 25 percent duties on European autos, especially targeting Germany, which he says has harmed the American car industry.

European officials have said that Brussels has drawn up a list of 20 billion euros (USD 22.6 billion) of potential countermeasures, without providing further details.

In 2017 just under half of the 17 million cars sold in the US were imported, most of them produced in Canada and Mexico which are expected to be exempt from any new automobile duties.

German automobile groups last year exported 470,000 cars from Germany to the United States, according to the VDA manufacturers' federation.

The transatlantic flare-up followed a truce established in July, in which Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker pledged no new tariffs while both sides pursued a limited trade deal.

Juncker ""trusts President Trump's word. The European Union will stick to its word as long as the US does the same,"" Schinas said.

Germany is pushing hard for the trade deal with the US, but according to a European source, France is reluctant to pursue talks fearing they may stoke popular anger ahead of European elections in May.

EU trade ministers will discuss the talks, as well as the possible countermeasures against the US, at talks in Bucharest on Thursday.

It was 40 years ago in February 1979, that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s theocratic despotism seized the throats of the Iranian people. It’s been 30 years since Khomeini issued his death-warrant fatwa against the novelist Salman Rushdie. It’s been 20 years since truncheons, bloodshed and mass arrests crippled the first rebellion of the revolution’s own children who sought to overthrow the Islamic Republic and lay the foundation of a secular democracy. It was 10 years ago that another paroxysm of bloody repression dashed the hopes of millions of “Green Revolution” Iranians who marched in the streets of Tehran to quietly and peacefully protest the fabricated presidential election of the thug Mahmoud Ahmedinejad.

Last February, a countrywide working-class uprising that had sprung spontaneously from the conservative city of Mashhad only a few weeks earlier was already in its death throes. It was in February last year, too, that Kavous Seyyed-Emami, an Iranian Canadian sociologist and co-founder of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation, died from “suicide” in the dungeons of Evin Prison. He’d been rounded up as part of a mass arrest of Iranian conservationists on trumped-up espionage charges. His wife, Maryam Mombeini, has been prevented from returning to Canada.

Despite the arrests, the beatings and the judicial murders that followed the Mashhad uprising, rebellion has persisted in pockets across Iran and in protests led mainly by trade unionists, by teachers, and by women, in their persistent refusal to submit to the absurd compulsory hijab laws enforced by the regime’s Islamic morality police. Over the past year, the regime’s brutality has deepened into frenzies of persecution.

Hundreds of Christians, Baha’i people, and Sufi Muslims; sugar workers, steelworkers, human rights lawyers and students have been arrested on bogus espionage, blasphemy and national-security charges. The price for demanding an ordinary life in Iran is to be fired, arrested, beaten, lashed, tortured, executed, framed on comically false charge, or taken to a morgue from a prison after having allegedly committed suicide.

On Valentine’s Day, last Thursday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei marked the 30th anniversary of the fatwa against Salman Rushdie for the “blasphemy” of his novel, The Satanic Verses, by reiterating his predecessor’s incitement to murder as “solid and irrevocable.” Khamenei used his Twitter account to amplify his endorsement of Rushdie’s killing. Twitter briefly suspended his account and deleted his tweet.

It should be obvious to the world by now that the Khomeinist regime is irredeemable. It cannot be reformed. The Islamic Republic has to go. But the theocracy’s overthrow can occur only as a direct consequence of a sustained, non-violent campaign of civil resistance mounted by Iranians themselves aimed at pushing the regime to the point of collapse, Shirin Ebadi, Iran’s most prominent human rights champion and Nobel Peace Prize winner, told me on Sunday.

Living in exile in London since 2009, Ebadi has lately ended up at the forefront of a growing consensus among pro-democracy Iranians that the only way to transform the country’s political order is a popular referendum under Article 59 of Iran’s existing constitution, supervised by the United Nations.

For the time being, however, the UN is “useless” to the Iranian people, and any threat of foreign military intervention would only strengthen the regime’s hand, Ebadi said. A reopening of Canada’s embassy in Iran won’t help, and an acceleration of American-style sanctions would only further impoverish the Iranian people. But there is a critical role for liberal democracies to play in hastening the regime’s demise, Ebadi said, and Canada—which has developed a reputation for sheltering corrupt regime millionaires and serving as a bank-account bolthole for assets quietly swindled from the Iranian people—should take a leading role in the project.

“Canada, for a start, could definitely take steps to that end, especially because there are Iranians residing in Canada who have appropriated funds from Iranian coffers, and they have put that money in Canadian banks. You should take or confiscate that illicit money that they have put into your banks,” Ebadi said, speaking through a translator.

A proposed suite of targeted sanctions aimed at Khomeinist regime officials and their collaborators has already won cross-party support in Ottawa, notably from the NDP’s Murray Rankin, Conservative MP David Sweet, the Liberals’ Michael Levitt, chair of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee, and Anthony Housefather, chair of the Justice Committee. (In the interests of full disclosure: I’m a senior fellow with the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, which has been strenuously advocating this course of action).

So far, however, sanctions under the 2017 Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act have singled out only a few dozen officials from Russia, Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and South Sudan. Ebadi says that Canada needs to step up and use the Act—known as Canada’s “Magnitsky law,” after the murdered Russian whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky—to target key regime officials in Iran, seizing their offshore assets and outlawing any dealings with them.

“I believe that any targeted sanctions against regime officials or people within the establishment who have violated human rights would be the best way of helping us. And let us remember what happened in South Africa, and in Eastern Europe, or in particular Poland. Let’s not underestimate the power of popular resistance,” Ebadi said. “If the people do stage this civil resistance and it goes to such an extent that the government finds itself helpless under popular pressure, and feels it is on the verge of collapse, then they will give in to the people.”

If matters reached that point, the Iranian constitution’s Article 59 provides that “a popular vote through a referendum” can be triggered “in extremely important economic, political, social, and cultural matters,”so long as two-thirds of Iran’s parliamentarians agree. “Then there should be a UN monitored referendum on the constitution,” Ebadi said, “to ask people whether they think this constitution in Iran should remain as it is, and are the people happy with the current political structure in Iran, or not. Of course, under no circumstance would the government like to have a referendum that would act against them, but it can happen if the people stage peaceful civil resistance, so that the government eventually gives in.”

That may seem overly optimistic, given the regime’s habits of unbending repression. But the proposition that the regime is incorrigible and incapable of genuine reform is objectively unimpeachable. Despite its pretensions and pantomime elections, the Islamic Republic of Iran is nothing like a democracy. Its constitution ensures that the country’s political and social life must remain confined within the straightjacket of a grim, authoritarian theocracy that describes itself as “a branch of the absolute governance of the Prophet of God.”

All laws must be compatible with Islamic religious law—as interpreted and determined by the Guardian Council, which also gets to decide who may or may not run for political office. The Guardian Council is made up of 12 members—six clerics directly appointed by the unelected Supreme leader, who is appointed by a council of clerics; and six jurists appointed by the head of judiciary, who is in turn appointed by the Supreme leader.

“The Supreme leader has absolute authority over everything. He has the power to abolish laws at his will. He is the commander in chief of the military, and he can appoint religious judges as he chooses,” Ebadi explained. “He is in control over everything.”

It was last February that Ebadi figured prominently among 15 Iranian personalities and human rights defenders in Iran and in exile who issued a public letter calling for an end to the Islamic Republic and a UN-monitored referendum allowing a popular vote on a transition to a completely secular democracy. Canada’s Payam Akhavan was among them, as were well-known exiles in Paris, London and Washington. Nasrin Sotoudeh also signed the letter.

Perhaps the most prominent human rights lawyer in Iran following Ebadi’s exile in 2009, Sotoudeh was arrested last June on charges of “acting against national security” and instructed that she would be spending the next five years in prison. Word of Sotoudeh’s arrest came from her husband, Reza Khandan, who was then arrested and sentenced to a six-year prison term for posting about Sotoudeh’s arrest on Facebook.

Among the most corrupt and bloodthirsty Iranian officials who should be targeted under Canada’s Magnitsky law—there are several proposed by the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights—Ebadi proposes that Supreme leader Ali Khamenei should not be left out. “Khamenei has great amounts of money and immeasurable assets,” Ebadi said. “You should put his name on the list of Iranians to be sanctioned.”

They seemed to have made progress on the “easier” issues , but still have a ways to go on the harder ones such as forced technology transfers and stealing Intellectual Property or IP. Both sides want to make a deal and both will declare whatever they come up with as a win for everyone. The key will be how much will Trump cave on the tough ones .

In a meeting on Friday in the Oval Office it was announced that the groups would extend the talks over the weekend, and President Trump, Vice Premier Liu and Robert Lighthizer, the Administration’s Trade Representative, made the following statements.

President Trump

There is a very good chance a deal can be made

I think it’s more likely a deal does happen but that doesn’t mean it will happen

Both parties want to make it a meaningful deal, a real deal

That is good for both countries and lasts many years

If there is a deal than tariffs don’t have to go up

I set the deadline at March 1. If I see substantial progress being made it would not be inappropriate to extend it

Recommending a meeting with President Xi in March in Mar-a-Lago

Xi and I will make the biggest decisions on trade

We have a deal on currency manipulation

Not currently talking about the criminal charges against Huawei’s CFO but will be talking with the Attorney General

Vice Premier Liu

A deal is very likely it will happen

The Chinese side is ready

Robert Lighthizer

Have made a lot of progress

But a deal has to be done properly

And there are still some great hurdles left on items such as technology transfers

It will be very interesting and critical to see if Lighthizer can continue to convince Trump to walk away from a deal if there isn’t enough strength to whatever agreement is reached about the tough issues such as forced technology transfer and stealing IP. Trump’s willingness to strike a deal, especially leading up to the 2020 elections, may outweigh whatever arguments the trade hawks present.

If a deal is reached the portions about technology transfer and stealing IP will more than likely have high-level language vs. detailed implementation. There just isn’t enough time for the two sides to come up with the checks and verification procedures that will need to be in place.

What will be needed harks back to President Reagan’s statement of “Trust, but Verify” that he used regarding the nuclear deal he struck with U.S.S.R. President Gorbachev. This will be the “kick the can down the road” portion of an agreement.

It will be difficult for China to meaningfully shrink its trade deficit

There are three reasons that it will be challenging for China to shrink what was about a $415 billion goods deficit from 2018, which has increased approximately $68 billion in the two years since Trump took office.

The first is that the U.S. economy is 68% larger than China’s and there are structural differences between them. What makes it even more challenging is that on a per capita basis the average U.S. person makes 7 times more than someone on China.

The second is U.S. consumers and corporations buy over half a trillion dollars in goods from China every year. This has grown from $463 billion in 2016 to about $535 billion last year, an increase of $72 billion in the two years Trump has been in office.

Keep in mind this isn’t necessarily bad since people and companies are voting with their pocketbooks to buy these products either at a lower price than U.S. items or ones that aren’t even being made in the U.S. Unless these products start being produced in another country (which doesn’t address an overall trade deficit) or consumers decide to pay more for them if they are made here, the amount of imports from China could continue to increase and probably won’t decrease in any meaningful way for many years.

The third reason the trade deficit with China won’t materially decrease is that the U.S. doesn’t make enough of what Chinese consumers want or can afford to buy. China bought $116 billion in goods in 2016 (leading to a $347 billion goods deficit) and that has only increased to about $120 billion in 2018 (for a $415 billion goods deficit).

Note that soybeans were the sixth largest imported item in 2017 and even with China announcing it would buy 5 million tons there just aren’t enough other goods that the U.S. makes to substantially shrink the trade deficit.

China plays the long game and Trump is purely transactional

Chinese leaders think in decades while Trump is pretty much looking for his next (or any) “win” so he can tweet about it. China has created 13 five-year economic plans since 1953, and its “Made in China 2025” industrial policy launched in 2015 aims to make the country a leader in multiple high-tech sectors.

China is willing to endure much more economic pain that Trump. China is also well aware of Trump’s political challenges ranging from the Democrats controlling the House and the investigations it will launch, the Mueller investigation and the volatility of the stock market. China also realizes how Trump obsesses over his image, the stock markets and that he wants to boast of winning.

It is unfortunate, and a detriment to containing China, that Trump withdrew from the TPP or the Trans-Pacific Partnership. While he wants to strike one-on-one trade deals, the TPP would have helped provide leverage over China since it would have coordinated pressure from the U.S. and countries such as Australia, Canada, Japan and Mexico.

Sisulu hosted a press briefing at her department's headquarters on Tuesday, following a quarterly engagement with members of the diplomatic corps in the country.

According to Sisulu, the message was all systems go for the elections, with the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) also invited to speak to the diplomats.

""The IEC was allowed in the meeting to keep them (diplomats) updated ahead of the May elections.

""We discussed the level of transparency and the level of preparedness. We have never had a problem with elections, but we like to keep our community informed.

""They (the diplomats) are an important part of our community. Therefore, we would like a close working relationship with them,"" Sisulu said.

A total of 229 political parties are expected to contest the elections on May 8.

65 diplomats to be sent abroad to strengthen voting

In February, News24 shared the story of three South Africans who braved minus 18 degree Celsius weather to visit the South African High Commission in Ottawa, Canada, to exercise their right to vote in the upcoming elections.

In this regard, Dirco says that it has sent a cohort of about 65 career diplomats to strengthen their capacity and will offer the necessary support to South Africans abroad to exercise their rights within ""what is affordable and possible for the ministry"".

""Our missions are very much prepared for the elections. It won't be the first time that we will be facilitating the elections; this will be the fifth time.

""We have no doubt that our missions will ensure that South Africans abroad will have unfettered access come voting time,"" acting director general Mxolisi Nkosi said.

'We are looking forward to having peaceful elections'

Sisulu further added that South Africa was keeping a close eye on Zimbabwe following nationwide protests stemming from a steep increase in fuel prices that made gasoline there the world's most expensive.

""We remain available to support the Zimbabwean government within our means. They are our neighbours therefore the state of peace there affects us, and we would like to make sure it is a prosperous country,"" she added.

Sisulu said an unrelated concern of the diplomatic community was the state of safety in South Africa - both in general, as well as their personal safety.

This, however, had nothing to do with the upcoming elections, Sisiulu said.

""The issue of security is also tied to their investments in the country. This is in no way related to the upcoming elections. We have indicated that this is something we are working on.

""As a result of the diplomatic corp's concerns for their safety, we have brought in the diplomatic police [a part of the South African Police Services] to provide them with protection,"" Sisulu further explained.

Sisulu congratulated other countries on the African continent that had conducted successful elections, such as Madagascar, and said she hoped that South Africa would enjoy the same success.

""With time, we are looking forward to having peaceful elections,"" she concluded.

Following President Nicolás Maduro's inauguration for a disputed second term in January, the speaker of the opposition-dominated parliament, Juan Guaidó declared himself ""interim president"" of the country.

Guaidó was immediately recognised by the US, Canada and a group of Latin American conservative governments, who called upon the Venezuelan military to rise up against Maduro. The UK, France, Spain, Germany and other European countries also recognised Guaidó after Maduro rejected their demand for fresh elections. Paredes, who presented his credentials to President Hage Geingob at State House last week, said the situation is normal, while accusing external forces for attempting to cause political instability in Venezuela.

""If you visit the main cities in Venezuela, you can see people going to work, the kids going to school. Unfortunately, foreign forces are trying to create instability in the country,"" he told New Era and NBC in an interview.

""One of the topics I discussed with President Hage Geingob, who is also the Chairperson of Sadc [Southern African Development Community] was to thank him on behalf of the government of President Nicolás Maduro and the people of Venezuela for his brave and strong support,"" Paredes said.

Last month, Namibia added her voice to growing international concern over the situation in Venezuela, calling on the international community to allow the Venezuelans to resolve their internal issues in an amicable and peaceful manner.

Namibia's Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah at the time said the international community should allow the people of Venezuela to resolve their internal issues within the confines of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

""Namibia has been following with great concern the political developments in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The concern is that the political developments are arising from the unwarranted interference in the domestic affairs of Venezuela by foreign powers,"" Nandi-Ndaitwah said.

Paredes noted that Namibia's support is well received by the democratic institutions in Venezuela as it supports the truth, adding Maduro last year was elected with more than 67 percent of the voters in a process where more than a million people participated in the elections.

He said the African Union (AU) also send a delegation who validated the results. Hence, he said the position of the African countries was very important for the true democratic processes and respect of the international law and the United Nations charter. Since Guaidó's declaration, US President Donald Trump's administration has imposed new sanctions on Maduro's government, seized billions-worth of Venezuelan oil-related assets on US soil, and started making barely veiled threats of military intervention.

Paredes admitted that the country is experiencing hyperinflation due to economic blockade and sanctions imposed by unilateral position of the government of the United States.

According to him, the Venezuela economy has lost more than U$30 billion in the last few years. ""So please tell me which country in the world can resist an impact on their economy with such criminal blockade against our financial institutions and oil industry. That is why we are seeing the challenges in our economy. Despite, this situation, our government never stopped providing assistance to the poor people through social programmes in education, health, housing and in other sectors to stabilise our country,"" he noted.

Because of challenges emanating from the hyperinflation, more than three million Venezuelans are said to have fled the country, causing consternation across the continent.

On Saturday, clashes broke out in Venezuelan border towns, as government allegedly blocked humanitarian aid from crossing from Colombia and Brazil.

Government troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who attempted to collect and transport the supplies.

(Bloomberg) -- U.S. President Donald Trump is ramping up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and pledging to eradicate socialism from the Americas -- but, behind the scenes, even staunch allies have their doubts.

Trump’s speech in Miami on Monday was the latest push by the U.S. and several allies who recognize Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president. The response to Trump’s statements was that Maduro and his generals dug in deeper and are showing no intention of giving up.

Crucial struggles for power lie ahead in coming days, with Guaido pledging to open the country to humanitarian aid on Feb. 23 and Maduro and Virgin Atlantic founder Sir Richard Branson hosting rival benefit concerts. Meanwhile, the EU is dispatching a team to push for new elections. Yet there is a growing sense that Maduro is holding on to power longer than expected and that measures to oust him could even backfire.

""It’s obvious if he resists the pressure, he looks stronger,"" Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said in an interview in Madrid. ""That’s a reality the U.S. surely wasn’t counting on.""

Stalled Momentum?

Maduro has faced a steady drumbeat of countries rallying behind Guaido as interim president -- at first the U.S. and the so-called Lima Group of nations including Brazil, Canada, Argentina and several Latin American nations. The EU parliament and Japan have since followed. “Our country announces that we clearly support interim president Guaido,” Foreign Minister Taro Kono said Tuesday.

Trump has demanded that Venezuela’s military let aid through and warned that “all options are open” to his administration. “They are risking their lives and Venezuela’s future for a man controlled by the Cuban government,” Trump said of the Venezuelan military, urging them to abandon Maduro and take Guaido’s offer of amnesty.

But time is dragging on and patience is running out. A U.K. government official said it feels like momentum has stalled. In private, some Brazilian officials are beginning to wonder whether the whole U.S.-led strategy is beginning to fail, according to a diplomat dealing with the Venezuelan situation.

“Guaido doesn’t control anything in Venezuela other than his office,"" said Mauricio Santoro, professor of international relations at Rio de Janeiro State University. ""The capacity for him to implement any public policy is very limited.""

‘Frustrated’ By Stalemate

""We absolutely are frustrated. The Maduro regime is illegitimate,” Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, told reporters on Feb. 16, two days after speaking with Guaido. ""This is a process led by the people of Venezuela. Our job as the international community is to support them, and that is very much what we’re doing."" She has downplayed the need to consider any military intervention.

Even among Maduro’s critics, cracks remain. EU member nations are united in condemning Maduro but divided in what to do about it. Italy’s populist government is sticking to a domestic compromise it painfully hammered out -- calling for new elections but stopping short of recognizing Guaido as interim president, according to an Italian official who asked not to be named.

Isadora Zubillaga, a Guaido adviser for Europe, believes the EU may impose sanctions on Maduro’s regime and stressed unity in the bloc, despite the handful of nations who still don’t recognize Guaido as interim president.

But while the EU has threatened sanctions, the potential scope is unclear. Any sanctions would have to be imposed by all EU members, the Italian official said, adding that to his knowledge this option has not been discussed in Brussels so far. And without widespread international support, any new U.S. intervention could look more like forced regime change than supporting a rightful leader.

Others are saying it’s still too early to say if the global push against Maduro has stalled. A Canadian government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said nations are keeping up pressure while looking for ways to support the opposition on the ground.

In Brazil, Vice President Hamilton Mourao said it was a matter of time before the Maduro regime crumbled like a house of cards. Pressure would force Maduro to step away peacefully and voluntarily, he said.

The International Monetary Fund is discreetly preparing to help the country if Guaido is installed as president, one official familiar with the situation said on condition of anonymity. That would be the beginning of a massive humanitarian aid and stabilization effort in a country where inflation is skyrocketing and the economy is in collapse, the official said.

Another is her time in Canada. The post Kamala Harris’s father is slamming her for making a ‘travesty’ of her Ja…,"Updated on Feb. 19, 2019 at 12:40 p.m. ET to include response from Kamala Harris and details of later appearances

Eighty-nine weeks from the White House, front-running, formidable and fierce, yet publicly scorned as a “travesty” by her own father, Kamala Harris, hyper-ambitious presidential candidate and former unwilling Quebecker, paces the old stone cathedral.

We’re at South Church, founded in 1713 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire on the Atlantic’s snow-flogged shore, but it could be anywhere in the 50 American states; anywhere that there are cameras and dollars and votes to be pocketed and rivals to be slandered and slain. Hundreds of New Englanders cram the prayer hall, the home of a Unitarian Universalist congregation that is based not on a single Saviour, but on “Wisdom from the world’s religions which inspires us in our ethical and spiritual life.”

Like South Church, the campaign to confront Donald Trump in the 2020 election offers—at this ridiculously early but already fraught and frantic stage—a deity to suit every desire. At least two dozen Democrats already have, or soon will, enter the contest. In June, they will begin to debate each other on stages as wide as wheat farms. Next February—that’s still a year away!—the first intra-party primary elections and arcane county caucuses will begin to winnow the crop. So here we go.

Senators, congresswomen, mayors, governors, billionaires—Beto, Bernie, Bloomberg, Biden; Amy, Kirsten, Tulsi, Pocahontas; Hickenlooper, Inslee, Buttigieg, Bullock—all are in it now, or soon will be. Just as it was with the Republicans in 2016, she or he who talks loudest and most profanely is most likely to be heard above the Democratic din. At every whistle stop, in every city and hamlet, the raw odours of vanity and conceit assault the nose. But also, this time, there are coos of love and healing in the air.

Here’s another metaphor—imagine a round of pool with 25 multi-coloured balls on the baize and only one corner pocket. Charge the ablest players half a billion dollars to ante up. Estimate the trillions of permutations of rebound, ricochet, angle, scratch and spin. And then try to run the table while an orange-skinned shark—call him Fifth Avenue Fats—leans over the rail, licking his lips, chalking his cue, eager to eat the winner.

Back to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Kamala Harris, a first-term U.S. Senator and former San Francisco prosecutor and state attorney general—“the best-looking attorney general in the country,” Barack Obama once called her, a career-ending slur for anyone else in these touchy times—is on her first campaign visit to the Granite State, a sliver of bedrock, ski slopes, and escaped Bostonians whose “first in the nation” primary gives it a numinous status among this country’s peripatetic career politicos. (Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada also are in the early-state recipe, with Harris’s behemoth California to join them in February balloting for the first time in 2020. Advantage, Kamala?)

The senator’s stump speech, which she will give from 20 to 50 times a week for the next 21 months, should she last that long in the race, is heavy on her prosecutorial experience and her eagerness to take on a divisive, calamitous incumbent. Even at the pulpit, she never invokes the homilies of her multiple religious roots, or gives thanks for the support of her husband of four and a half years—a California attorney of the Jewish faith—or mentions his two college-age children by a previous marriage: a son named for John Coltrane, a daughter for Ella Fitzgerald. Domesticity, her culinary skills, the multi-cultural and bi-national aspects of her life—none is touched today. Eighty-nine weeks from the White House, the business of the campaign already is serious business.

“I plan on prosecuting the case against people who do not tell the truth,” she says to a roaring, whooping, left-leaning clientele that has been waiting in the fluffing snow for hours, snaking around Portsmouth’s preciously curated shops and its handy-crafty market-stalls, with the first balloting still a spring and a summer and an autumn and another winter away.

Then (on the need for a single-payer, government-run health care program):

“The system is immoral.”

And (on gun control):

“We should never bow down to those who have a love of money while people are dying in the streets.”

And:

“We are looking at an America today where American values and American dreams are under attack.”

But there is much more about Kamala Harris to be said, and told, and learned. As with all of our lives, there are conflicts and complications, secrets and mysteries. But unlike all but two dozen of us on this planet, she yearns to be President of the United States, and she may well succeed.

“I am a proud daughter of Oakland, California,” Harris said in January, when she formally announced her candidacy at Howard University, her “historically black” alma mater in Washington, D.C. That she considers herself to be African-American is beyond dispute—“I was born black and I will die black,” she told a radio interviewer a few days ago. Crucial to her candidacy will be her defence of her record of filling the penitentiaries of the Golden State with legions of young African-American men. But the annals of American politics reveal that personality and personal history will triumph over policy every time. So it matters deeply to the voters of all the nation’s Portsmouths not only what Kamala Harris says, but who she is.

Again: “I was born black.” Yet Sen. Harris’s mother, née Shyamala Gopalan, was a Brahmin Hindu born in Chennai (Madras), the oceanside megalolopolis of the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu; and her father, raised in Brown’s Town, educated in Port Antonio and at the University of the West Indies, is as Jamaican as the sun and the sea. (Dr. Shyamala Gopalan Harris died in 2009 at the age of 70.) Just as Barack Hussein Obama is the mixed-race descendent of tribal Kenya and sunflowery Kansas, Kamala Harris, potentially Obama’s successor’s successor, is every bit as not-really-a-real-American as her desperate opponents may choose to make her out to be. Will that matter?

(For a few days in January, an asinine and racist “birther” conspiracy against Sen. Harris circulated on the Internet’s extreme right wing—namely, that since her mother was from India and her father was from Jamaica and neither of them had lived in the United States for five full years before Kamala’s birth, she could not be a “natural-born citizen” as required of the president and vice-president by the U.S. Constitution. This was patently and crudely false—Harris’s birth in California swaddled her in American citizenship the instant she drew her first breath. President Trump often has ranted against “birthright citizenship” to enflame his base, but The Donald’s nativist ravings carry no weight in law; at least not yet.)

So far in the 2019-2020 campaign, there has not been much in the way of personal slander. None of the six or seven or eight sitting senators in the race has torn a colleague to shreds. (“That will come later,” Sen. Lindsey Graham coyly predicted to a Maclean’s reporter in Washington last week.) But when Sen. Harris sniggered on New York City radio program that, like the sky-high Honolulu stoner Obama, she had thoroughly enjoyed marijuana—and that, unlike Bill Clinton, she had inhaled—she explained her behaviour by saying, “Half my family’s from Jamaica! Are you kidding me?”

Her father exploded.

Donald Harris, 81, professor emeritus of economics at Stanford University, divorced from Shyamala Gopalan since 1972, offered this comment to the website Jamaica Global Online, whose editor, Ian Randle, shared it exclusively with Maclean’s:

My dear departed grandmothers, as well as my deceased parents, must be turning in their grave right now to see their family’s name, reputation and proud Jamaican identity being connected, in any way, jokingly or not with the fraudulent stereotype of a pot-smoking joy seeker and in the pursuit of identity politics. Speaking for myself and my immediate Jamaican family, we wish to categorically dissociate ourselves from this travesty.

This was not Harris’s first incursion into the ambitions of the elder of his two daughters. (His younger child, Maya Lakshmi Harris, a prominent liberal attorney, professor of law, senior adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the wife of Obama’s associate attorney general, Tony West, is Kamala’s national campaign chair.) In a December article on Jamaica Global Online, the girls’ father took pains to enumerate Kamala’s Caribbean experiences and to reassert the depth of her island heritage. Yet in her new campaign manifesto, The Truths We Hold, Prof. Donald Harris disappears on Page 20 of 300, and never is mentioned again.

The early phase of interaction with my children came to an abrupt halt in 1972, Dr. Harris wrote, when, after a hard-fought custody battle in the family court of Oakland, California, the context of the relationship was placed within arbitrary limits imposed by a court-ordered divorce settlement based on the false assumption by the State of California that fathers cannot handle parenting (especially in the case of this father, “a neegroe from da eyelans” was the Yankee stereotype, who might just end up eating his children for breakfast!). Nevertheless, I persisted, never giving up on my love for my children or reneging on my responsibilities as their father.

In the United States Senate—and especially in her vehement shredding of Brett Kavanaugh (“I’m asking you a very direct question: yes or no”) during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing and Jeff Sessions (“I’m not able to be rushed this fast. It makes me nervous”) during the Russian-collusion investigations, Kamala Harris presented herself as anything but a pot-smoking joy-seeker. “There are flaws in the criminal-justice system and this system needs to be reformed,” she said at Howard U. “Instead of being soft on crime or tough on crime, we need to be smart on crime.”

Barack Obama’s father bolted back to Africa when his son was three years old. They met only once more before Obama, Sr.’s death. But Donald Harris is very much alive. “I have decided to stay out of all the political hullabaloo,” he told Ian Randle, the editor of the Jamaican website (Donald Harris declined to be interviewed for this story). But his vow already has been broken. How much more will we be hearing from him about his daughter’s histories?

And then there is the Canadian/Québécois chapter, another blank page in the candidate’s life.

Shyamala Gopalan of Chennai and Donald Harris of Brown’s Town met and married on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley amid the seething ferment and sexual electricity of a social and cultural revolution. Shyamala—the daughter of a man who had crusaded alongside Jawaharlal Nehru in the campaign for India’s independence from the British Raj—had graduated from the University of New Delhi. At 19 she was confronted with an existential choice—to weigh millennia of expectations and an arranged marriage against emigration and a new life of laboratory science and freedom to choose her own love.

Swept up in the Bay Area’s white-hot protests for equal rights for blacks, Shyamala chose the side of the oppressed minority, and weaned her girls on chanted slogans, justice marches and home-drawn picket signs.

“These were my mother’s people,” Kamala writes in The Truths We Hold. “In a country where she had no family, they were her family—and she was theirs. From almost the moment she arrived from India, she chose and was welcomed to and enveloped in the black community. It was the foundation of her new American life.”

Then, suddenly, Shyamala Harris—scientist and single mom—turned her back on the struggle and flew away. Again, from Kamala’s book:

When I was in middle school, we had to leave. My mother was offered a unique opportunity in Montreal, teaching at McGill University and conducting research at the Jewish General Hospital. It was an exciting step in advancing her career. It was not, however, an exciting opportunity for me. I was twelve years old, and the thought of moving away from sunny California in February, in the middle of the school year, to a French-speaking foreign city covered in twelve feet of snow was distressing, to say the least. My mother tried to make it sound like an adventure, taking us to buy our first down jackets and mittens, as if we were going to be explorers of the great northern winter. But it was hard for me to see it that way. It was made worse when my mother told us that she wanted us to learn the language, so she was enrolling us in a neighborhood school for native French speakers, Notre-Dame-des-Neiges—Our Lady of the Snows. It was a difficult transition, since the only French I knew was from my ballet classes, where Madame Bovie, my ballet teacher, would shout, ‘Demi–plié, and up!’ I used to joke that I felt like a duck, because all day long at our new school I’d be saying ‘Quoi? Quoi? Quoi?’

“By the time I got to high school, I had adjusted to our new surroundings,” she later concedes. And then not another word about Westmount High, about Montreal, about Quebec in the parlous hour of the first independence referendum, about her own coming-of-age.

“Let me begin with a simple statement: Indonesia is part of me,” Barack Obama said in the Bahasa language in Jakarta in 2010. (He lived there from age six to 10 with his mother and her Indonesian husband.) So Canadians may wonder, how much is Quebec part of Kamala Harris, if at all?

The morning after the whoop-fest at the old seacoast Universalist church, the junior senator from California speaks to a far more restrained gathering at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics on the campus of Saint Anselm College in Manchester, an hour inland. The affair is called “Politics & Eggs” and it has been attended by every presidential candidate since the days of the black-and-white photograph. Yes, even Donald Trump came here, and Donald Trump almost never speaks to the unfiltered public.

In Manchester, the phrases that brought down the temple in Portsmouth barely ripple the pond. Harris’s tripwire pledge of “Medicare For All” garners only silence; the words “Kavanaugh,” “Trump,” and “Green New Deal” are never even uttered. There are at least 20 other Democrats yet to hear from, and 50 weeks before the Granite State primary for all of them to be heard.

When the breakfast concludes, a Maclean’s reporter approaches the candidate and asks about Quebec in 1980, how—if—a high school student’s exposure to the crucible of ethnic, linguistic “identity politics”—the very words her own father abjures—affected her values and her views.

“It was certainly very significant,” she responds. “It was about people wanting to be recognized, wanting equal treatment for their culture.”

“Were you a Oui or a Non?” the candidate is asked.

“It was a very significant moment,” says Kamala Harris. “But I was too young to vote.”

Venezuelan opposition leader and self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido will personally accompany a convoy of humanitarian aid currently stationed at the Colombian border as it makes its way into Venezuela on Saturday, Reuters has reported.

According to fellow opposition lawmaker and Guaido ally Edgar Zambrano, the opposition plans to bring the aid in by land and sea to alleviate shortages of food and medicine.

""We will go around the circumstances that arise along the way…constitution in hand, accompanying Guaido,"" Zambrano vowed, speaking in a square in eastern Caracas on Thursday.

It remains unclear just how Guaido and his fellow opposition leaders plan to pass into Venezuela, with the country's military declaring Tuesday that it would be ""on alert"" for any violations of Venezuela's territorial integrity amid plans by opposition-backed groups to bring humanitarian assistance into the country.

On Wednesday, Trump National Security Adviser John Bolton told the Venezuelan military not to ""condone or instigate violence against peaceful civilians at the Colombian and Brazilian borders"" and to ""allow them to peacefully bring in humanitarian aid,"" warning that any infractions ""will not be forgotten.""

The Venezuelan government has described Mr Guaido's presidential claims as an attempted coup d'état, and blasted Washington over its talk about bringing millions of dollars of humanitarian aid into the country while freezing billions in Venezuelan assets abroad and funding the opposition via a special account using oil money from the country's state-owned PDVSA oil company.

Earlier, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro warned that the US and its allies were using ""the pretext of delivering humanitarian aid"" to try to ""destroy the independence and sovereignty of the country."" Caracas would not allow such aid into the country, Maduro said, saying the country was coping with its difficulties and that US 'concerns' over Venezuela's humanitarian crisis were ""fabricated by Washington over the last four years to justify intervening in our country.""

The long-running crisis in Venezuela escalated late last month, after Guaido, leader of the semi-defunct opposition-controlled National Assembly, declared himself interim president pending snap elections. The US, Canada, and numerous US allies in Latin America and Europe rushed to support Guiado, while Russia, China, Iran, Cuba, Nicaragua, Turkey, Syria and others voiced their support for the Maduro government, and urged outside powers not to interfere in the Latin American country's internal affairs.",Juan Guaido to Personally Accompany 'Aid' Convoy Into Venezuela - Lawmaker,Sputniknews.com,https://sputniknews.com/latam/201902211072630527-guaido-to-accompany-aid-convoy-reports/
49,Empty,2019-02-22T13:00:39Z,"Convincing voters is one thing, but Singh's fate may rest on whether his party is well-enough funded and organized to get those voters to the polls.","The only candidate who lives in Burnaby South and is able to vote in Monday’s federal byelection is the guy who has come the longest way to contest it, and has the most to prove and the most to lose.

Despite a history as an NDP stronghold with decades of the party’s federal and municipal politicians in control, Burnaby South is far from a safe bet for NDP leader Jagmeet Singh.

His path to a win got harder when the Liberals’ first candidate resigned over racist remarks and the party appointed Richard T. Lee, who for four terms represented the provincial riding with similar boundaries.

And, for weeks now, members of Singh’s own party (including former leader Tom Mulcair) have openly talked about the Plan B that is in place in case Singh loses.

Canada’s two NDP premiers are feuding over pipelines, with Singh having sided with B.C.’s John Horgan in opposing the twinning of an existing pipeline, which Alberta’s Rachel Notley says is essential for her province.

The split intensified this week with Singh’s support for the $40-billion LNG Canada project in northern B.C. challenged by both Svend Robinson, the Burnaby North-Seymour NDP candidate in October’s federal election, and Julia Sanchez, who is running for the NDP in the Outremont byelection.

With all this going on, it’s fair to say that some party stalwarts are sitting out this byelection in a riding that the NDP barely held on to in 2015.

But fortune may still favour the Ontario-born Singh. The Liberals appear to be in meltdown, especially with all the questions about what exactly happened between former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, the prime minister and his staff regarding SNC-Lavalin’s attempts to halt a federal prosecution.

As for the Conservatives, they seem to be spending a lot more time scrapping it out with Maxime Bernier’s nascent People’s Party of Canada than focusing on either Singh or the Liberals.

While environment is a top-of-mind issue here, at street level it’s housing.

In Burnaby South, 22 per cent of the residents fall below the low-income cut-off line, six percentage points higher than the Metro Vancouver average. Nearly one in four residents spends more than a third of their household income on housing.

And when you look at the average income and the average house price, the gap is unbridgeable.

As the only candidate with a home in the riding, Singh has firsthand knowledge of how hard it is to get a place to live — a problem that he says is driving the insecurity and fears of many Canadians.

Singh lost out on several rentals because he didn’t show up with a cheque for the first months’ rent. It was only after friends interceded and vouched his ability to pay the second month’s rent that Singh managed to get a place.

The riding is a perfect foil for NDP campaign promises of 500,000 units of affordable housing in the next decade, immediate investments in co-ops and non-market housing, elimination of GST on developments with a significant amount of affordable units, an increase in the first-time homebuyers’ tax credit, and relief for renters whose housing costs exceed 30 per cent of their income.

Of course, there is no chance that Singh can make any of that happen. With his party so low in the polls nationally, the best that Singh may be able to do even after the fall federal election is to push either the Liberals or the Conservatives to steal his best ideas.

But it’s immigration that has drawn the heat at all-candidates meetings.

In 2017, 13-year-old Marissa Shen was murdered in 2017 and Syrian refugee Ibrahim Ali has been charged. The case has fuelled worries about Canada’s screening of refugees and ignited ugly comments by both candidates and their supporters at raucous community gatherings.

It’s a potent issue in a riding where 54 per cent of the residents are immigrants. Of those, 89 per cent came for economic opportunity or for family reunification.

People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Thompson has poured the most fuel on the fire, even though the Conservatives have staked it as one of their election issues. Meantime, the Tory candidate, Jay Shin, a Korean-Canadian, has tried to retain social conservatives from defecting to Thompson, a Christian TV talk show host, with brochures in English and Chinese highlighting PPC leader Maxime Bernier’s support for an NDP bill to expunge past pot convictions, and that Marc Emery, the so-called “Prince of pot”, is one of his prominent supporters.

Thompson has responded with a complaint to Elections Canada saying she doesn’t support either cannabis legalization or supervised injection sites.

Singh’s challenges are considerable. He must convince voters that he can be their most effective representative in Ottawa.

But he also needs his party’s members to believe in his leadership strongly enough that they will be there Monday to mobilize voters.

Because with voter turnout traditionally low in byelections, Singh’s fate rests as much on that as it is does on anything else.

This is the second report. The first report can be found here. A clear majority of Canadians believe foreign governments — including our closest international ally — will attempt to “influence” the 2019 federal election.

Voters wait to collect their ballots for Canada's federal election at an advanced polling station in Toronto on Oct. 9 , 2015. For the next federal election in October 2019, there are fears that foreign governments will attempt to influence the outcome. ( Chris Young / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

New polling conducted by Abacus Data and released exclusively to the Star and BuzzFeed News shows 60 per cent of Canadians believe it’s likely foreign governments will try to influence the results of this October’s general election. Where do most expect that influence to come from? Canada’s closest neighbour and ally, the United States. Most respondents (69 per cent) said it was either moderately, highly, or very highly likely the U.S. would attempt to influence the election, rating it as likely as interference from China.

Abacus CEO David Coletto said that Canadians recognize the U.S. has as much interest in Canadian affairs as Beijing. “The U.S. has an interest in making sure that our government aligns closely with them as our number one trading partner and security partner, but I think (Canadians) also recognize other global powers are also looking to influence our allies and alliances as well.” Russia, which has been accused of active interference in multiple western democratic elections including the 2016 U.S. presidential, followed with 65 per cent of respondents perceiving them as a threat. “Influence” covers everything from a public endorsement — or a 140-character presidential put-down — to more serious clandestine activity. The Abacus online poll was conducted between Jan. 30 and Feb. 5, with 2,500 Canadians aged 18 and over. Abacus put the margin of error at plus or minus two percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

In 2017, Canada’s electronic intelligence agency warned parliamentarians that they expect it’s “very likely” hackers will target Canada during the 2019 election. While the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) said they’ve yet to observe hostile nations attempting to influence Canada’s domestic politics, it’s not a given they won’t in an election year. And the agency is expected to release an updated threat assessment in the coming weeks.

Article Continued Below

CSE is one of several law enforcement, intelligence and civilian agencies that have been tasked with safeguarding the 2019 vote, including detecting hostile nations’ attempt to meddle in the election. According to Abacus’ data, Canadians are largely confident that the federal government is up to that task. A full 66 per cent of respondents said they were somewhat or very confident in Ottawa’s ability to prevent “interference” in the federal election, while 34 per cent expressed little to no confidence. The numbers flipped when respondents were asked about social media platforms. Only 36 per cent said they were somewhat or very confident in social platforms’ ability to prevent foreign interference, while the rest were either not that confident (43 per cent) or not at all confident (20 per cent). Facebook is acutely aware of concerns and in October announced a Canadian Election Integrity Initiative “to help ensure the platform is a space for authentic civic engagement.” Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould is in the midst of conversations with social media companies, including Facebook, about their obligations this election year. Coletto said Canadians are giving the government “the benefit of the doubt” when it comes to preventing election interference. “If we had gotten into some of the details and asked them how they feel about specific aspects of the government’s plan (to safeguard the election) they might feel differently,” Coletto said. “But on the surface, (Canadians) generally think that the government is competent enough on this and there’s less confidence in social media companies to self-regulate.” Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

Walter L Hixson is distinguished professor of history at the University of Akron. His forthcoming book is entitled Israel’s Armor: The Israel Lobby and the First Generation of the Palestine Conflict, which will be published by Cambridge University Press in May 2019. On March 22 Hixson will speak at the “Israel Lobby and American Policy” Conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., an event sponsored by the Institute for Research: Middle Eastern Policy, and held annually on the eve of the mammoth AIPAC annual meeting in Washington. Hixson’s previous works include American Settler Colonialism: A History (Palgrave Macmillan 2013) and The Myth of American Diplomacy: National Identity and US Foreign Policy (Yale, 2008).

Last week, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) flippantly tweeted, “It’s all about the Benjamins” alluding to the financial role of pro-Israel groups on unstinting US support for Israel. Widely condemned for invoking an anti-Semitic trope pertaining to Jewish money, Ilhan apologized for the remark but not for the essence of her larger point, which is unquestionably true, namely that money in politics plays a role in the lopsided pro-Israeli policy that the United States has pursued for decades. The absurdity is that everyone in Congress already knows this.

While reams of type and hype have spilled forth concerning the intrusions by the big, bad Russian bear (yes, he’s back after a post-Cold War hibernation) on American politics, we hear very little about Israel’s influence, which has profoundly shaped United States Middle East diplomacy since World War II. As I document in a forthcoming book, the Israel lobby goes much deeper historically than most people realize and has long exercised an outsized influence on Congress and presidential elections.

On February 15 the British Guardian did something American newspapers, magazines—and historians--rarely do: it published an analysis of pro-Israeli financing in American politics. “The data examined by the Guardian suggests that the pro-Israel lobby is highly active and spends heavily to influence US policy.” (“Pro-Israel Donors spent over $22 million in lobbying and contributions in 2018,” The Guardian online.) There’s more to the story than the Guardian grasps, namely individual campaign contributions that are made with the explicit or implicit understanding of unquestioned political support for Israel.

Fear of baseless charges of anti-Semitism must not prevent us from making relevant and scarcely disputable arguments about money and political influence. Let’s examine some basic facts: Israel, a tiny country of 8.5 million people, is the largest recipient of US foreign assistance since World War II (more than $100 billion), according to the Congressional Research Service. In 2016 President Barack Obama--despite being treated contemptuously by Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu--signed a 10-year, $38 billion military assistance pact with Israel.

Well, you might say, Israel needs the money to defend itself from the hostile forces that surround and threaten to destroy it. This cliché misrepresents realities that have prevailed in the Middle East since the creation of Israel, namely that Israel more often than not has been the aggressor in the region, has won every war, and is more than capable of defending itself without receiving another dollar in US military assistance. Since 1967 the country has illegally occupied Palestinian territory and illegally sponsored settlements, which have been funded in part with American money, and has repeatedly engaged in indiscriminate warfare notably in Lebanon and the Gaza strip. Beyond dispute Israel has suffered from terror attacks but it is far from innocent and has killed many times more people than it has lost in the conflict. And now it is illegally absorbing, with Trump’s blessing, a historic holy city that under international law was meant to be shared by people of all faiths.

Even more absurd than over-hyping Russian influence on US elections while ignoring those of Israel, is the widespread condemnation of Iran for supposedly pursuing a nuclear weapon, while ignoring the history of Israel’s utter contempt for nuclear non-proliferation in defiance of the United States dating back to the Eisenhower administration. Israel has the bomb, scores of them, acquired secretly and mendaciously--that is, it was developed even as the American special ally was told Israel would not introduce such weapons to the Middle East. Turns out what Israel meant is that it would not hold a press conference and say, “Hey, we’ve got the bomb!” Meanwhile Netanyahu and the Israel lobby spare no effort to condemn Iran, which unlike Israel proved willing to negotiate a non-proliferation agreement, which it entered into with Obama in 2015. Netanyahu--joined by Trump, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, Elliot Abrams, and other assorted fanatics of the far right who are now in power—are lusting for an excuse to go to war with Iran.

In sum, beyond a doubt, Israel and its American supporters have assembled the most powerful lobby pursuing the interests of a foreign country in all American history. Certainly, there are cultural and historical affinities on the part of American Christians (think Mike Pence) as well as Jews that help explain broad-based and historical US support for Israel. But only a fool—or an apologist—would argue that pro-Israeli money and influence do not play a significant role in American politics.

I hope this gets into print while it is still legal to criticize a foreign country (other than Russia, China, Venezuela--and France and Canada when they don’t do what we tell them). In an effort to head off a growing boycott, divestment and sanctions movement, Israel and the lobby now have set their sights on curbing freedom of speech and expression in this country. The matter is before Congress.

Peter Downing, the man behind the billboards, wants a referendum that puts Alberta separation on the ballot.

""I would have to ask how it benefits Alberta being part of a country that's actively blocking our pipelines,"" said Downing, with Alberta Fights Back, a third-party advertiser registered with Elections Alberta.

The fact is we're a landlocked province. - Lori Williams, political scientist

Downing voiced particular disdain for Quebec and B.C., using the analogy of Alberta being ready to leave an ""abusive relationship"" with the federal government and other provinces.

Elections Alberta filings for Alberta Fights Back show Downing had raised about $2,900 as of Thursday — roughly $1,800 of which came from his own pocket, and $1,000 coming from a single other donor.

That donor is Sharon Maclise, the interim leader of the Alberta Freedom Alliance, a group pushing for provincial independence that's currently gathering signatures to be recognized as an official political party.

Downing said he doesn't support any one political party, but is just urging the next premier to hold a referendum.

His LinkedIn page shows he was an officer with the RCMP for nearly a decade, before working as an independent political consultant until January, when he founded Alberta Fights Back.

Along with the separatist billboard campaign, Alberta Fights Back's website lists what it calls a ""Toxic Masculinity Tour"" — amateur fight nights to support the oil and gas industry.

'An expression of frustration'

Political scientist Lori Williams says calls for separatism aren't new and happen whenever people aren't feeling adequately represented in Canada.

""I think its mostly an expression of frustration, or it's possible actually that some people are looking at this as, 'Well, if we threaten to leave Canada, then they'll appreciate us. They'll realize the contribution we make, and they'll respond more favourably to us.' I think that's part of it as well,"" Williams said.

""It's wanting to sort of go it on our own, without recognizing the benefits of being part of Canada.""

Williams said the chance of getting a pipeline built would be much worse as a separate nation than if Alberta remains a part of Canada, and investment in Alberta would also likely take a hit.

""I mean, the fact is we're a landlocked province,"" she said.

Other big considerations Alberta would have to weigh if it were to separate include trade, airspace, national defence and other benefits the federal government provides, Williams said.

It could be something like the situation the U.K. finds itself in with the complexity of negotiating Brexit with the European Union.

Another issue the province would have to address is the roughly 812,000 hectares of First Nation land contained within its borders — a concern that has been raised over the years with calls for independence in Quebec.

An open threat – yesterday, 18 February, at a Miami University, in a speech of ‘fire and fury’; this time against socialist Venezuela with which he wants to finish, like with all other socialist nations – especially those in his ‘backyard’. So, Cuba, Nicaragua and Bolivia are next in Trump’s crosshairs – and / or the crosshairs of his handlers. Don’t forget, he is a staged and convenient fool for the “Deep State” or the “Profound Government” – whatever you want to call this secret clan of the Chosen People that intends to rule the world.

I cannot help being amazed at what level of inhumanity we have arrived. Trump calls openly out to assassinate those who stand behind the legitimate President of Venezuela – and the rest of the world just looks on, watches and says NOTHING – zilch, zero – tolerates such atrocity coming from the mouth of a buffoon, aka the strongman of the self-proclaimed one and only superpower of the globe. – No, much worse – the so-called civilized west, the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan – and some second- and third class puppet developing countries from South America, whose people are being starved while the elite admires and dances to the tune of the USA; united in what they call the “Group of Lima” (created in Lima in August 2017, to “safe” Venezuela). Members include, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay and Peru.

In the meantime, Mexico, under her new leftwing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, or simply, AMLO, abstains from any decision against Venezuela. To the contrary, Mexico is part of the “Montevideo Mechanism” that comprises Mexico, Uruguay, Bolivia and the member countries of CARICOM and seeks conflict resolution through dialogue with the opposition, for which the Maduro Government has been ready from the beginning of the conflict, but which has been boycotted by the opposition, as were the 20 May 2018 elections which the non-participating opposition now calls a fraud.

The Lima Group was initiated, as such unofficial clubs always are, to out-rule the official routes, by Washington. Similarly, Washington created “The Friends of Syria” – all with the objective to bring about “Regime Change”. In the case of Venezuela, to circumvent the official representation of the Americas – the OAS – Organization of American States. – Why? – Because the empire was unable to get the legitimate majority of the OAS members to side with them against Venezuela. So, they organized the Lima Group, a club of the willing, of the utmost corrupted vassals, who believe at the end of the days to receive some crumbs of ‘gracias’ from their northern master and tyrant – or the vassals’ leaders (sic) hope perhaps for a safe haven, a castle in Miami?

I often wonder whether such a dream of eventually, at the end of the day – the end of all days perhaps? – being saved by the surviving elite of the US of A in an untouched paradise, is also the dream of the European puppets, for example those that pull the EU’s strings – the Macrons, Merkels and Mays – and, of course, the rest of the EU, the puppets of the puppets? – What else could make them so miserably betray their people, hundreds of millions of people? – Do they have not an iota of morals left?

—

Coming back to Venezuela – the Buffoon calls for outright war against the Maduro regime – and to salvage the Venezuelan people, he sent US$ 20 million worth of “humanitarian aid” to Cucutá, border town in Colombia, which, of course, the Bolivarian army does not let enter Venezuela. There is no need for humanitarian aid, let alone for US$ 20 million worth, peanuts, as compared to what Venezuela buys on a daily basis in food and medical supplies.

Undeniably, the US warmongers – specially Bolton, Pompeo and Pence – are preparing for a hot war. Whether they will execute it, remains to be seen. But the Bolivarian military does not idly watch what may happen. They are ready to face any Yankee aggression. The US southern military command, SOUTHCOM, stationed in Florida, is preparing an impressive military build-up. The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, with 3,200 military personnel, 90 fighter planes and helicopters is positioned off the Florida coast, accompanied by the cruise missile carrier, USS Leyte Gulf, and the destroyers, USS Bainbridge, USS Gonzalez, USS Mason, and USS Nite. Joining the fleet is also the Spanish marine ship ESPS Mendez Nuñez.

The Spanish participation in this war game of criminal aggression is outrageous. The Spanish socialist leader, Pedro Sanchez (who certainly does not deserve the attribute of ‘socialist’), has also had the audacity requesting Nicolas Maduro to resign and call elections. Who is the (faltering) head of the fallen Spanish empire to meddle in another country’s internal affairs? – Maybe because the Spaniards can still not stomach having been defeated by Simón Bolívar, still feel superior and behave racist over the ‘brown’ Latinos, or maybe because he wants to please the masters in Washington – or simply because he needs popular support in his own country, as he is leading a minority, currently non-government and had to call snap elections for 28 April 2019?

There are, however, also Russia and China, solid, but rather quiet partners of Venezuela’s. Russia has made it clear, though, “Don’t mess with Venezuela”. Russia has two nuclear capable bombers, TU-160, deployed to the Venezuelan Caribbean island of la Orchila, where Moscow will establish, with the agreement of Venezuela, a permanent military base.

Both Russia and China have tens of billions worth of investments in Venezuela’s hydrocarbon industry. But besides the commercial interests, Russia and China vie for a multipolar world and want to guarantee the independence of Latin America, the sovereignty of the peoples of the Americas.

On 26 January 2019, the US dragged the “Case Venezuela” to the UN Security Council, in an attempt to condemn Venezuela and to trailblaze the path for a military invasion. However, while nine of the 15 UNSC members voted for a special meeting on Venezuela (Belgium, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Kuwait, Peru, Poland, United Kingdom, United States), four voted against (China, Equatorial Guinea, Russian Federation, South Africa), with two abstentions (Côte d’Ivoire, Indonesia). The Russian Federation’s delegate countered that the Council has no role to play in a domestic matter that poses no threat to international peace and security. And right he is!

This UNSC event prompted a solidarity movement of more than 50 states, including China, Russia, Cuba, DPRK, Syria, Iran, Palestine, Nicaragua, and many more, supporting Venezuelan’s Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza’s statement before the Security Council, declaring the illegality of unilateral coercive economic sanctions, and territorial invasions by the United States. As Carla Stea reports,

this new alliance “constitutes a formidable force which Western capitalism will antagonize at its own peril. This is a long overdue counterforce to Western domination of the United Nations, a domination based on money, on the large payments enabling the US and other capitalist powers to bribe, threaten and otherwise control the direction of the UN, and distort and destroy the independence, impartiality and integrity which the UN requires in order to maintain its legitimacy, and implement the sustained global peace and justice for which Franklin Delano Roosevelt created it.”

This new alignment of more than 50 states comprise more than half of the world’s population, to a large extent people who have been exploited, slaughtered and their countries raped and ravaged for hundreds of years by wester capitalist and colonialist powers. This alliance promises to become a solid new face in the otherwise western dominated and bought United Nations.

As to Venezuela’s fate, Trump has made vague indications of 23 February being the deadline for an assault on Venezuela. We will see whether this remains nothing but an intimidating insinuation, or whether it will be real. The latter case would be a disaster not only for Venezuela, and Latin America, but for the entire world. Will Trump’s handlers allow such blunder? – In any case, Venezuela’s armed forces are disposed to confront the empire’s nuclear aircraft carrier, missile launchers, countless fighter planes and the up to 5,000 US troops and mercenaries newly stationed in Colombia and ready to cross the border into Venezuela. – And, not to forget, there are also Russia and China.

The Venezuelan president's speech followed an address by US President Donald Trump in Miami on Monday, where Trump warned that ""all options are open"" in resolving the Venezuelan crisis.

Also on Tuesday, tensions between Venezuela and its neighbours escalated after the Venezuelan military announced that it was ""on alert"" against border violations amid plans by the opposition to bring Western aid into the country.

""The armed forces will remain deployed and on alert along the borders, as our commander in chief has ordered, to avoid any violations of territorial integrity,"" Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said in a statement.

Earlier, the Venezuelan military announced the closure of the country's maritime borders with the Dutch Antilles amid suspected Dutch plans to open a logistical hub for humanitarian aid on the island of Curacao.

Last week’s publication of the final draft of the new EU Copyright Directive baffled and infuriated almost everyone, including the massive entertainment companies that lobbied for it in the first place; the artists’ groups who endorsed it only to have their interests stripped out of the final document; and the millions and millions of Europeans who had publicly called on lawmakers to fix grave deficiencies in the earlier drafts, only to find these deficiencies made even worse.

Take Action

Stop Article 13

Thankfully, Europeans aren’t taking this lying down. With the final vote expected to come during the March 25-28 session, mere weeks before European elections, European activists are pouring the pressure onto their Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), letting them know that their vote on this dreadful mess will be on everyone’s mind during the election campaigns.

The epicenter of the uprising is Germany, which is only fitting, given that German MEP Axel Voss is almost singlehandedly responsible for poisoning the Directive with rules that will lead to mass surveillance and mass censorship, not to mention undermining much of Europe’s tech sector.

The German Consumer Association were swift to condemn the Directive, stating:

The reform of copyright law in this form does not benefit anyone, let alone consumers. MEPs are now obliged to do so. Since the outcome of the trilogue falls short of the EU Parliament’s positions at key points, they should refuse to give their consent.

A viral video of Axel Voss being confronted by activists has been picked up by politicians campaigning against Voss’s Christian Democratic Party in the upcoming elections, spreading to Germany’s top TV personalities, like Jan Böhmermann.

﻿

Things are just getting started. On Saturday, with just two days of organizing, hundreds of Europeans marched on the streets of Cologne against Article 13. A day of action—March 23, just before the first possible voting date for MEPs—is being planned, with EU-wide events.

In the meantime, the petition to save Europe from the Directive—already the largest in EU history—keeps racking up more signatures, and is on track to be the largest petition in the history of the world.

Discoveries of lithium in North America and Europe may loosen China’s tightening hold on the market in time, but the race to find and exploit new deposits is also throwing up other concerns, namely the risk of oversupply or even a glut and political risks that may affect countries with some of the biggest reserves and production.

Lithium is one of the main components of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in smartphones, laptops, and EVs, with demand for the latter anticipated to surge over the next decade or so as manufacturing costs fall and environmental concerns rise. China, eager to reduce oil imports and address chronic air pollution, is driving production of EVs, accounting for 37 percent of passenger EVs sold globally since 2011, according to Bloomberg. The agency forecast in 2017 that by 2040 more than half of all new car sales will be electric vehicles.

Beijing government subsidies and quotas for EV sales appear to have incentivized efforts to corner the electric vehicle supply chain. Reuters reports that Chinese entities now control nearly half of global lithium production and 60 percent of the electric battery production capacity. By 2030, Goldman Sachs predicts China could supply 60 percent of the world’s EVs.

In recent years, China, the biggest global consumer of lithium, has been snapping up stakes in mining operations in South America and Australia, the principal global sources of the metal – derived from brine flats in South America and spodumene ore in Australia. In South America alone, China has reportedly invested $4.2 billion in lithium deals in the past two years. It has also been tightening its grip on the supply of cobalt, another important lithium-ion battery component.

Beijing’s buying spree has worried electric battery- and EV-makers in Japan, South Korea, and Europe. But China has not had it all its own way. In a recent reversal of fortunes, a German company beat off a Chinese challenge in Bolivia – which has one of the world’s largest reserves of lithium – to secure a deal to build a plant mining the country’s biggest deposit. Most of the output will go to Germany, which lobbied heavily for the deal that includes the construction of a rechargeable battery plant.

Yet, not to be outdone, and in a measure of its determination, Beijing quickly sought to secure a foothold in Bolivia with a mining venture in another promising prospect in the country. The Chinese ambassador to Bolivia described the preliminary deal as “historic.” That came just weeks after one of China’s leading miners, Tianqi, completed the purchase of a 24 percent stake in neighboring Chile’s lithium producer SQM, fending off local opposition to the deal – centered on concerns it would unfairly favor the Chinese in the contest to secure resources for EVs.

China’s increasing domination of the global lithium supply appears to have prodded the Europeans and the Americans, whose EV markets are still very much in their infancy, to explore closer to home. Deposits in Germany, the Czech Republic, Portugal, and Sweden have been the focus of attention, while some within the industry have expressed hopes that Canada might have sufficient volumes to meet demand in North America.

But the race for supplies has sparked concerns about the pace of production output. Extraction has been fueled by soaring lithium prices, which more than tripled in the three years to 2018 to over $20,000 per tonne. The data and analytics company GlobalData predicted in September that EV demand will double global lithium production from 26,700 tonnes in 2018 to 58,300 tonnes in 2022. In August, Macquarie Research suggested that the market was “sleepwalking into a tsunami of oversupply.” Then in late November, Moody’s Investor Services warned of excessive production in the early years of the next decade, due to factors including a “heavy concentration” of new mines.

Oversupply left its mark last year when lithium prices in China nearly halved, a problem compounded by the government’s removal of some subsidies on EVs, which slowed sales. Some analysts believe the market will recover in the medium to long term as demand increases, but the risk is that the slough may discourage investment in new production, leading to shortages when prices pick up. Yet that may not be the only break on supply.

President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, a top lithium producer, has opened up the country’s economy, introducing market reforms and easing regulations, but his attempts to repair the economic mismanagement of his predecessors are misfiring, plunging the county into a financial crisis that forced him to go cap in hand to the IMF. His ratings have shrunk, raising the prospect of a populist victory in elections later this year. That might make life difficult for mining investors, especially if his reformist agenda is reversed.

While Bolivia has barely begun to export its lithium, it has huge potential as a supplier – potential being the operative word. The country’s left-wing leader, Evo Morales, recognizes the value of the resource to Bolivian economic prospects. But if he is re-elected in October, investors may be put off if interventionist policies introduced in other sectors are extended to lithium production.

It is unclear how China will deal with such challenges, but given its relentless pursuit of lithium, and the strategic importance it attaches to the metal, solutions will no doubt be found. In many ways, China’s embrace of green transport is a good thing, as it expands interest in the sector and spurs competitor nations to try to catch up in terms of their share of lithium supply and the rechargeable battery market. The danger is that they continue to lag behind, leaving China with a monopoly over what could soon become a mainstream transport sector.

The report, released Wednesday, found that groups pushing racist, anti-LGBT, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim ideologies proliferated in the second year of Donald Trump’s presidency, fueled by the verbal validation and concrete policies of the administration and its allies.

“The numbers tell a striking story – that this president is not simply a polarizing figure but a radicalizing one,” Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC’s Intelligence Project, said in a statement. “Rather than trying to tamp down hate, as presidents of both parties have done, President Trump elevates it.”

In 2018, the U.S. saw the fourth straight year of hate group growth and a 7 percent increase over the 954 groups counted in 2017, according to the SPLC.

The SPLC defines hate groups as organizations that target an entire class of people based on their race, religion or other identifying characteristics; only groups that participate in activities like “marches, rallies, speeches, meetings, leafleting, publishing literature or criminal acts” are included in their annual count.

Per the SPLC’s research, concerns of an “accelerating, state- and Silicon Valley-orchestrated ‘white genocide’” escalated the spike in white supremacist hatred last year. Trump’s failure to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and the banning of white nationalists from social media platforms contributed to these enduring race-based fears.

At the same time, hatred was reinforced and codified in key Trump administration policies, from the forced separation of immigrant families at the border to the ban on transgender people serving in the military, the report noted. Staffers for virulently anti-immigrant groups like the Federation for American Immigration Reform and Center for Immigration Studies were given high-level posts in the Trump administration, while anti-LGBT groups like the Family Research Council regularly meet with Trump appointees.

The SPLC blames Trump’s allies in the conservative media, particularly Fox News’ Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, for spreading fears of demographic change to a broader audience.

By the SPLC’s count, the greatest spike in hate group chapters came from “white supremacist groups birthed in the age of Trump,” like Identity Europa and Atomwaffen Division. Black nationalist hate groups grew as well, but, as the report notes, “black nationalists have little or no impact on mainstream politics and no defenders in high office.”

The climax of “radical right” violence came in the hectic weeks before the November midterm elections, with Cesar Sayoc mailing pipe bombs to Trump critics and anti-Semite Robert Bowers murdering 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue. In total, the SPLC found that white supremacists killed at least 40 people in the U.S. and Canada last year—up from 17 in 2017.

And 2019 will likely look much the same, according to the SPLC.

“In the absence of major policy shifts to the hard right, such as the building of a border wall, the radical right is poised to continue seething over its fears of ‘white genocide’ as it fearfully anticipates a multicultural wave washing it out,” the report predicts.",SPLC: Number Of Active Hate Groups In US Soared To ‘Record High’ In 2018,Talkingpointsmemo.com,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/splc-annual-hate-count-record-high-2018

In an interview with Univision’s Jorge Ramos, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has just announced that he will run for US president in the 2020 election, has refused to recognise Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s president, having suggested that the US should ensure “free and fair” elections in the Latin American country.

“No. I think what has to happen right now — I think there are serious questions about the recent election. There are many people who feel it was a fraudulent election, and I think the United States has got to work with the international community to make sure that there is a free and fair election in Venezuela”, Sanders said.

When asked whether he believes that Nicolas Maduro is a “dictator” and should step down, Sanders seemingly avoided giving a direct answer to the question:

“I think clearly he has been very, very abusive. That is a decision of the Venezuelan people, so I think, Jorge, there’s got to be a free and fair election”.

Sanders’ reluctance to recognise Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president came shortly before the opposition leader issued his “presidential” decree number 001 in order to authorise the deliveries of humanitarian aid currently stockpiled in neighbouring Colombia.

His decision was made despite President Nicolas Maduro’s strong opposition to the deliveries, which he said might be used as a pretext for a foreign intervention in Venezuela.

White House National Security Adviser John Bolton, in turn, said that the Venezuelan military, who support the Maduro government, should let “peaceful civilians at the Colombian and Brazilian borders peacefully bring in humanitarian aid”, warning that any infractions “will not be forgotten”.

Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump called on Venezuelan military officers to not follow orders given by Maduro to block the humanitarian aid deliveries to the country, adding that Washington is seeking a peaceful transition of power in the country but ""all options"" were on the table.

In the meantime, Maduro said Thursday that he sees a certain connection between Washington's rhetoric against Venezuela and the re-election campaign of Trump.

""Donald Trump has started his pre-election campaign… He's desperate, and so he really liked the idea of attacking Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua, and he thinks that, using this rhetoric of Cold War, he will improve [his rating], which in reality could lead to his total collapse"", Maduro said in remarks broadcast by a local TV channel.

Tensions have been simmering in Venezuela since mid-January when Guaido declared himself the country’s president, challenging last May’s re-election of Maduro. The United States, Canada, Japan, Israel, a host of Latin American countries and a number of European nations have recognised the opposition leader, while Russia, Turkey, China, Mexico, and many others have voiced their support for Maduro as Venezuela’s legitimately elected president.

It may mean losing a few students to the irresponsible school down the road. But it will mean st…,"My college roommates loved nothing more than transforming academics into entertainment. Sophomore year, several of them were enrolled in Political Parties and Elections, a lecture course taught by a visiting professor. One day mid-semester, it was announced that former Speaker of the House of Representatives Jim Wright was on campus and planned to visit the class. Naturally, my roommate Chris Douvos decided to impersonate a Secret Service agent. So he decked himself out in his Secret Service best – trench coat, dark aviator sunglasses and a conspicuous earpiece – and, as students filtered in, wandered around the lecture hall giving interested and vaguely menacing stares from behind his sunglasses. Just as the class was scheduled to start, but with no sign of the professor or the former Speaker, Douvos bounded up on the stage and waited a moment until the room got quiet.

“As you all know, Speaker Wright will be attending this class today. We are expecting the Speaker in… [Douvos checks his earpiece]… just a few moments. Are there any questions?”

[Student in the front row raises his hand] “Is there anything we need to do while the Speaker is here?”

“Yes… [Douvos checks his earpiece]… No sudden movements or jerking motions. Thank you.” [Jumps off the stage and walks out of the class.]

[Students murmuring, including several audible comments to the effect of “These guys don’t mess around.”]

Hopefully impersonating a Secret Service agent is not a crime (or if so, one with a short statute of limitations). But can we really blame Douvos? After all, a full lecture hall is an audience primed for entertainment. And many faculty appear to be following Douvos’s lead. The 2017 Educational Review article “Let Me Entertain You: the Ambivalent Role of University Lecturers as Educators and Performers” indicates that TED Talk culture has come to campus. The study cites examples where faculty feel their role in lecturing is verging on entertainment. Faculty report increased sensitivity to whether students enjoyed lectures or “had a good time.” Several faculty note “growing student demands for more entertaining (rather than, say, stimulating or intellectually challenging) lessons.” According to one faculty member quoted by the researchers: “Teaching nowadays is very much like entertainment. You need to keep students entertained so you really need to be a kind of Instagram in front of them… to attract attention.”

This article reminds me of the cloying term “edutainment,” and also a recent New York Times op-ed, Let Children Get Bored Again, in which Times Book Review editor Pamela Paul argues “it isn’t actually the teacher’s job to entertain as well as educate. Life isn’t meant to be an endless parade of amusements.” In succumbing to student demands to be entertained, colleges are reflecting the parents whose tuition dollars they’re desperately trying to attract. As Paul says: “Only a few short decades ago, during the lost age of underparenting, grown-ups thought a certain amount of boredom was appropriate… Nowadays, subjecting a child to such inactivity is viewed as a dereliction of parental duty.”

Nothing makes this clearer than videogames. As Paul notes, “When not being uberparented, kids today are left to their own devices — their own digital devices, that is. Parents preparing for a long car ride or airplane trip are like Army officers plotting a complicated land maneuver…. Is this an O.K. time to let the kids play Fortnite until their brains melt into the back seat?”

I’m generally enthusiastic about things digital when it comes to closing the skills gap. But I’m deeply skeptical of how videogames are creeping into American higher education. It began in the 1990s with videogame design programs. But this decade, we’re seeing inroads of videogame play or “eSports.” One hundred and twenty eight colleges and universities have now joined the National Association of College eSports (NACE). According to Eduventures, 47% of schools are running “eSports” programs as student activities or clubs. Another 40% organize them through athletic departments (which – given the sedentary nature of “eSports” – is probably an organizational oxymoron), and many are pouring money into new “eSports arenas.” But, as Eduventures notes, “the remainder put their programs elsewhere, such as in academic departments.”

Syracuse is already offering an “eSports” course in partnership with the streaming service Twitch. UC Irvine, UT Arlington, Ohio State and Shenandoah University are planning to offer “eSports” degrees. Shenandoah’s program ostensibly focuses on “how to run and plan eSports events,” but as Inside Higher Education pointed out, it originated as an academic program for gamers. Reportedly, the President of Shenandoah was skeptical. “But the faculty convinced her that the degree would essentially be a sibling to sports management and marketing programs, which the university already offered.”

She was probably also convinced that the program would attract dozens, if not hundreds of additional students. Shenandoah “eSports” director says he thinks it will be an “enrollment driver.” New England College agrees; it has “pulled in fledgling players from Texas and Canada and gotten them to commit to New England – 12 total students have put down deposits for the college because of their interest in eSports… The sticker price at New England is about $36,750 per year, not counting other fees or room and board.”

“eSports” apologists point to employment as a rationale. After all, if higher education has shifted from the inspirational to the transactional (with the primary transaction being a good first job), why not give customers what they want: entertaining classes and programs that lead to employment. But as Eduventures reports, of 40 million jobs posted last year in the U.S., only 1,400 made any mention of “eSports.” Moreover, if you happen to be one of the few people running an eSports business, even given the technical and industry knowledge a new “eSports” graduate may attain, do you really want to hire a candidate who made his or her postsecondary education matriculation decision based on a desire to play videogames?

Ironically, “eSports” – whether as academic programs, varsity “sports” or clubs – probably make students less employable. As Pamela Paul noted, “the ability to handle boredom… is correlated with the ability to focus and self-regulate… teaching children to endure boredom rather than ratcheting up the entertainment will prepare them for a more realistic future… to spend an entire day answering Friday’s leftover e-mail… [or]… to check spreadsheets.” Employers want workers who will show up on time and focus on serving customers rather than staring at their phones. They need employees who are able to get along with colleagues, and take direction from supervisors: a particular challenge for headstrong Millennials. It’s hard to imagine that “eSports” help their cause. (More irony: the acronym selected by the eSports organization – NACE – is the same as higher education’s career services organization: the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Here’s hoping old NACE doesn’t play nice with new NACE.)

When it comes to entertainment’s nemesis – boredom – I figure there’s a Laffer Curve for student outcomes.

The downward slope on the right is the world of disengaged faculty, weed-out courses and non-English-speaking graduate teaching assistants. None of that is desirable. But in the service of giving students what we think they want – and to attract them (and their tuition dollars) in the first place – some colleges and faculty are backsliding down the left slope. Student outcomes may be maximized by courses that are entertaining in the service of learning objectives. But when entertainment is a primary motivation, colleges and universities may find themselves on a slippery slope to courses and programs in “eSports.”

Whether seeing how many students can fit into a phone booth or Volkswagen, or posing as secret service agents, college students have been doing dumb things from time immemorial. And back in the heyday of Volkswagens, when tuition was cheap, it might not have been that harmful for colleges to mess around with programs of study. But the unsustainable cost of college makes that impossible and irresponsible.

America’s colleges and universities have an obligation to resist the siren song of entertainment and videogames; they must be more than a mirror of bad parenting. It may mean losing a few students to the irresponsible school down the road. But it will mean stronger student outcomes. When the book (or eBook) on “eSports” is finally written, I hope we’ll be able to say of higher education what was said of Douvos’s Secret Service agent: “These guys don’t mess around.”",eSports: College's Newest Abdication Of Responsibility,Forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryancraig/2019/02/22/esports-colleges-newest-abdication-of-responsibility/

(“Pan American” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:PAAS) (TSX:PAAS) and Tahoe Resources Inc. (“Tahoe”) (TSX:THO) (NYSE: TAHO) today completed the previously announced transaction (the “Arrangement”) whereby Pan American acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Tahoe.

Michael Steinmann, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pan American Silver, said: "" The completion of the Arrangement establishes the world's premier silver mining company with an industry-leading portfolio of assets, a robust growth profile and attractive operating margins. We are also now the largest publicly traded silver mining company by free float, offering silver mining investors enhanced scale and liquidity.""

Added Mr. Steinmann: ""We have a 25-year track record in Latin America of building successful partnerships with the communities around our operations, respecting the diversity of local populations and safeguarding the natural environment. We welcome the opportunity to work with local communities around the new operations for the benefit of all stakeholders.""

Results of elections by Tahoe shareholders

Pursuant to the Arrangement, Tahoe shareholders had the right to elect to receive either US$3.40 in cash (the “Cash Election”) or 0.2403 of a Pan American share (the “Share Election”) for each Tahoe share, subject in each case to pro-ration based on a maximum cash consideration of US$275 million and a maximum number of Pan American shares issued of 56.0 million. Tahoe shareholders who did not make an election by the deadline of 4:30 pm EST on January 3, 2019 were deemed to have made the Share Election.

The following elections were made:

holders of 23,661,084 Tahoe shares made the Cash Election; and

holders of 290,226,406 Tahoe shares made, or were deemed to have made, the Share Election.

Since the aggregate number of Tahoe shares in respect of which Cash Elections were made is less than the Aggregate Cash Consideration (as defined in the Arrangement agreement dated as of November 14, 2018 among Pan American, Tahoe and 0799714 B.C. Ltd.), holders of Tahoe shares who made or were deemed to have made the Share Election are subject to pro-ration in the manner described in Tahoe's management information circular dated December 4, 2018 and will receive consideration per Tahoe share of approximately 19.7% in cash (US$0.67) and approximately 80.3% in Pan American shares (0.1929 of a Pan American share). Tahoe shares in respect of which Cash Elections were made will receive all cash consideration.

In addition, Tahoe shareholders received contingent consideration in the form of one contingent value right (""CVR"") for each Tahoe share. Each CVR will be exchanged for 0.0497 of a Pan American share upon first commercial shipment of concentrate following restart of operations at the Escobal mine. The CVRs are transferable and have a term of 10 years.

In aggregate, Pan American will pay US$275 million in cash and issue 55,990,512 Pan American shares and 313,887,490 CVRs to Tahoe shareholders under the Arrangement. Upon closing of the Arrangement, existing Pan American and former Tahoe shareholders own approximately 73% and 27% of Pan American, respectively. Upon satisfaction of the payment conditions under the terms of the CVRs, Pan American and Tahoe shareholders will own approximately 68% and 32%, respectively, of the combined company (based upon the number of Pan American shares outstanding as at today’s date).

C. Kevin McArthur and Charles A. Jeannes appointed to Pan American Board

Under the Arrangement, Tahoe was entitled to nominate two of its directors to join Pan American’s Board of Directors. Tahoe has nominated Messrs. C. Kevin McArthur and Charles A. Jeannes. Effective today, Messrs. C. Kevin McArthur and Charles A. Jeannes joined Pan American’s Board of Directors.

"" Kevin and Chuck are seasoned mining executives with deep knowledge of the precious metals industry. I warmly welcome them to Pan American's Board of Directors,"" said Mr. Ross J. Beaty, Chairman of Pan American.

Increase to, and drawdown under, Pan American’s revolving credit facility

Pan American is also pleased to announce that it has amended and extended its revolving credit facility led by The Bank of Nova Scotia and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners. The facility has been increased by US$200 million to US$500 million, and matures on February 1, 2023. At Pan American’s option, amounts can be drawn under the revolving facility and will incur interest based on the Company’s leverage ratio at either (i) LIBOR plus 1.875% to 2.750% or; (ii) The Bank of Nova Scotia’s Base Rate on U.S. dollar denominated commercial loans plus 0.875% to 1.750%. Undrawn amounts under the revolving facility are subject to a stand-by fee of 0.4219% to 0.6188% per annum, dependent on the Company’s leverage ratio.

Pan American has drawn down US$301 million under the facility under LIBOR-based interest rates to fund, in part, the cash purchase price under the Arrangement and to repay, in full, and cancel Tahoe’s second amended and restated revolving facility, under which US$125 million had been drawn.

Delisting of Tahoe shares

The shares of Tahoe are expected to be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange as of the closing of the market on February 26, 2019 and on the New York Stock Exchange effective as of the closing of the market on March 4, 2019, subject to the approval of each exchange. Pan American has applied for Tahoe to cease to be a reporting issuer under applicable Canadian securities laws and will file to suspend Tahoe’s reporting obligations under U.S. securities laws.

Former president Abdoulaye Wade called for protests against the polls after his son was banned from running.","Senegal's presidential candidates had three weeks to convince voters that they have got what it takes to be elected head of the country. Five candidates are in the race for the office of president in one of Africa's most stable democracies. Incumbent president Macky Sall is seeking his final five-year mandate after coming to power with a seven-year mandate in 2012. A 2016 referendum slashed the seven-year presidential term to five and reaffirmed the two-term limit.

Sall is up against two strong and experienced aspirants: former Prime Minister Idrissa Seck and former Foreign Affairs Minister Madicke Niang. Seck is making his third bid for the top job. The 59-year-old promised to build a modern hospital and a local university in each of the country's 45 departments, as well as a health center in each commune. 65-year-old Madicke Niang wants to reform the justice system.

Senegal's President Macky Sall is running for a second term

Specific electoral programs

El Hadji Issa Sall, an academic and lawmaker, and Ousmane Sonko, who is the youngest contestant, are the outsiders in the race. 63-year-old Sall has promised to clean up dangerous suburbs and revamp fish processing plants down the coast. 44-year-old Sonko is a rising opposition figure — he pledged to renegotiate all gas and mining contracts that have already been signed by the current regime. Another two major aspirants, Karim Wade and Khalifa Sall, were barred by the top court over corruption.

Political analyst Gilles Yabi praises the electoral programs

Dr Gilles Yabi, director of WATHI, a pan African think tank, welcomed the candidates' efforts to propose specific electoral programs – something he says is not usually associated with elections in African countries. ""I think this is something that merits praise,"" he said. ""There are many elements regarding the justice system in all the programs, such as the construction of a new prison and the setting up of reintegration program for detainees on their release."" There would also be incentives and obligations for companies to recruit handicapped people with a specific salary, with penalties to be paid if this is not respected, Yabi added. ""There is definitely an effort to present original programs.""

Ex-President Wade calls for protests

But the campaign has not been all smooth sailing. Violence broke out in Tambadounda in the south-east of the country, leaving at least two people dead and 24 arrested. Many others were injured following violent clashes between supporters of incumbent Macky Sall and those of El Hadj Issa Sall. As a result, El-Hadji Issa Sall and Ousmane Sonko's parties decided to take a break and stop their campaign caravans.

It is the first time so few candidates are running in a presidential election since 1988. Tensions are running high in the country dubbed the most stable in West Africa. Ex-president Abdoulaye Wade called on voters to burn down polling stations and their voting cards in protest that his own son is barred from running. His party, the main opposition Democratic Party of Senegal (PDS), is not fielding a candidate. Abdoulaye Wade had called for a boycott of the vote citing threats to security but the government dismissed his call.

Content over personality

Interior Minister Aly Ngouille Ndiaye had given an assurance that the elections would be carried out transparently and said rigging was impossible. However, many Dakar residents are not convinced. Complaints about delays in the issuing of voter ID cards became loud, residents claimed that some people had been waiting for years and still had not received their voting cards. Social media users had also pushed for a first-ever televised pre-election debate with all five candidates, but the National Audiovisual Regulatory Council announced that it would not authorize national television and radio channels to broadcast such a program in the context of the current election campaign.

100 observers from the European Union as well as from Norway, Switzerland and Canada will accompany the election. International communications consultant Amy Sarr Fall thinks that once at the voting booth, people will choose content over personality. ""Citizens will ask themselves: Who will help me best to face what awaits me after the election? Who will help me keep my business efficient, who will help me keep my head above water in a difficult economy - and who will help me keep my job?""",Five presidential candidates for Senegal,Dw.com,https://www.dw.com/en/five-presidential-candidates-for-senegal/a-47629990

Microsoft expands AccountGuard service to customers in the political eco-system in Canada. It has been announced by Kevin Peesker, president at Microsoft Canada, in a post on Linkedin. “Democracies around the world are under attack. Foreign entities are launching cyber attacks to disrupt elections and sow discord. These threats to the democratic process have become a critical concern around the world and it is clear that the tech sector will need to do more to help protect the democratic process,” he wrote. “That is why I am pleased to announce the availability of Microsoft AccountGuard service here. It’s a new security service offered at no additional cost to Office 365 customers in the political eco-system and is designed to help these highly targeted customers protect themselves from cyber security threats”. The service is already at work in the US, UK and Ireland.

The service will boost the cyber security of all the actors of the next elections: candidates, political parties, think tanks and democracy advocacy organizations, and technology vendors involved. Including against disinformation campaigns

Microsoft will give the AccountGuard service to current candidates in Canada for federal or provincial office and their campaigns; all registered federal and provincial political parties; think tanks and democracy advocacy organizations; and technology vendors who primarily serve political campaigns. The service “is a critical component of the Microsoft Defending Democracy Program,” Peesker continued “which is focused on four key priorities: protecting campaigns from hacking; protecting voting and the electoral process; increasing political advertising transparency; and defending against disinformation campaigns”. The core features of the cyber security service include: Advanced threat detection and notification across accounts, Security management and ongoing education, and Early adopter opportunities.

Microsoft AccountGuard will warn customers about cyber threats, including attacks by nation-state actors; it will give best practice guidance to improve the cyber security, and access to private previews of features

Microsoft AccountGuard warns its customers about cyber threats, including attacks by nation-state actors, in a unified way across both email systems run by organizations and the personal accounts of these organizations’ leaders and employees who opt in. Officials, campaigns and related political organizations in Canada will receive best practice guidance specific to those in the political space to help make their networks and email systems more secure. This would cover topics like enabling multi-factor authentication, recognizing a spear-phishing attempt, when and how to install the latest operating systems, and in-depth live sessions on topics such as threat modelling, contingency planning, defensive coding, phishing awareness, identity and device and cloud management.

Outremont's polls are open from 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.,"Liberal Rachel Bendayan has won the federal riding of Outremont in Quebec after taking 40 per cent of the vote with 95 per cent of polls reporting.

""I will honour your vote by working very hard,"" she said Monday night at Liberal party headquarters in Montreal's Outremont.

She stressed that the Liberals would continue to fight climate change and promote a national housing strategy.

Mélanie Joly, the minister of official languages and La Francophonie, said that despite losing to the NDP in 2015, Bendayan was always a strong candidate who continued working in the riding in the years since.

""We hope this is the end of the Orange Wave in Quebec,"" Joly said Monday night.

The NDP, which had held the riding since 2007, trailed in second place with less than 30 per cent of the votes.

Outremont was one of three ridings where federal byelections took place Monday on a crucial day for Canada's major political parties.

Voter turnout was low, as is typical for a byelection. Less than 20 per cent of the 70,400 registered voters in Outremont cast a ballot.

Political insiders had bet that the Liberals would retake the riding — a welcome boost for the governing party's morale in the midst of the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

""Tonight, the people of Outremont and thousands of Canadians voting in these byelections have offered a strong vote of confidence in Justin Trudeau's positive plan to strengthen the middle class,"" said Suzanne Cowan, president of the Liberal Party of Canada.

Outremont resident, Claudette Dumas Bergen, says the weather was holding her back but she adds “my civic duty came to me and I said I have to go because it’s important!” <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Outremont?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Outremont</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/CBCMontreal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CBCMontreal</a> <a href=""https://t.co/H6ds1wsZZ4"">pic.twitter.com/H6ds1wsZZ4</a> —@mia_anhoury

Analysts said the Outremont race was a crucial test for the NDP.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Thomas Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 byelection: the Liberals had lost the riding only once, to the Progressive Conservatives in 1988, since 1935.

The so-called Orange Wave followed in 2011 and boosted the NDP to Official Opposition status for the first time in its history.

While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

These are the candidates who ran in Outremont and how much of the vote they took by the time 95 per cent of ballots had been counted:

40 per cent: Rachel Bendayan — Liberal Party of Canada.

29 per cent: Julia Sánchez — New Democratic Party.

13 per cent: Daniel Green — Green Party of Canada.

11 per cent: Michel Duchesne — Bloc Québécois.

6 per cent: Jasmine Louras — Conservative Party of Canada.

Here is the entire thread:

“Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been spending much of his time making sure a racist, xenophobic, Homophobic Ultra-Right wing fringe party which is the Israeli version of David Duke passes the electoral threshold [of four seats] & makes it into the Knesset in the April 9th elections.”

“The name of this party is ‘Jewish Power’ & its members are followers of Meir Kahana – former leader of ‘Kach’ party which was banned from running in the elections in 1988 and was designated as a terror organization in Israel, the U.S., Canada and the EU.”

“The leader of ‘Kach’ Meir Kahana managed to get elected in 1984 and was boycotted by all the other parties in the Knesset. He tried to pass a law for stripping non-Jews from their citizenship, a law for separate beaches for Jews and Arabs and other racist laws.”

“Back at the time senior members of Likud attacked Kahana’s draft bills and said they were similar to the Nuremberg laws passed by the Nazis before the Holocaust. It was actually a quite accurate comparison.”

“The members of ‘Jewish Power’ are all followers of Rabbi Kahana and his racist ideology. Some of them even said it on the record. Baruch Marzel – a senior member of ‘Jewish Power’ — was the chairman of ‘Kach’ after Kahana was assassinated.”

“Itamar Ben Gvir – a senior member of ‘Jewish Power’ – was convicted numerous times including for support for terror organization & incitement to racism. Michael Ben Ari – former MK from ‘Jewish Power’ – was denied entry to U.S. due to membership in a terror organization (‘Kach’).”

“Netanyahu is making a lot of efforts to get those guys elected. He is pushing privately and publicly all the different factions in the radical right in Israel to unite with “Jewish Power” and form one radical right party.”

“Netanyahu wants a united radical right party with the ‘Kahanists’ in order to make sure no right wing votes go to waste and to make sure the right wing block in the Knesset get at least a 61 members majority.”*

“Inside the Likud – the same party which boycotted ‘Kach’ and Kahana in 1984 – nobody is sounding even the smallest bit of criticism against Netanyahu’s actions. Some in Likud are even supportive of Netanyahu’s efforts to get the Israeli David Dukes into the Knesset.”

The news service reports:

President Donald Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law is operating on at least two tracks — the first is working with a small group studying specific ways to redistribute employment visas and the second is helping lead a series of “listening sessions” with about three dozen interest groups important to Trump to see if there is a position that Republicans can rally around before the 2020 elections.

The invited groups are mostly pro-migration, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Association of Builders and Contractors, and the George W. Bush Center, the report said, adding:

One participant described Kushner as listening a lot and encouraging others to speak. He is less interested in the finer details of immigration policy and focused on reaching a consensus, that participant said. Two people involved said Kushner asks people to talk about what they want instead of what they oppose. … Such language is concerning to conservative immigration groups. Indeed, between Kushner’s business background and the large number of guests with corporate interests, conservatives are worried that the changes Kushner is pursuing run counter to Trump’s “Hire American” priorities.

Trump’s inauguration day promise of a “Hire American” policy is capping the inflow of legal migrants and forcing companies to recruit sidelined Americans and to compete for American workers by raising wages. That low-immigration policy helped deliver wage raises of 3 percent nationally in 2018 and may deliver raises of 4 percent in 2019.

In 2018, wages rose higher in states with lower levels of legal immigration, such as swing-state Minnesota where wages rose 5.2 percent. Employees who switched jobs gained a 4.6 percent gain.

Trump's 'Hire American' policy allowed job switchers to win a 4.6% wage gain in 2018. Of course, CEOs & investors are pushing him & Congress to flood the labor market with immigrants. But how many politicians want to cut voters' wage growth by Nov. 2020? https://t.co/Sspb4N7rbS — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 14, 2019

Trump’s policies are also helping to boost productivity.

Democrats, including presidential candidate and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, are complaining that Trump’s unemployment rate is too low and are calling for a greater inflow of foreign workers.

Dem. Pres. candidate Sen. Klobuchar is worried by low unemployment & wants more foreign workers in Minnesota, where wages rose 5.2% in 2018. What is the political payoff from promising to block voters' wage raises? Why is Pres. Trump saying the same thing? https://t.co/qAKxKRLUJJ — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 13, 2019

One focus of Kushner’s group are guest worker visas, the news service said.

Those visas are critical to business because they allow CEOs and investors to reduce wages paid to middle class, college educated Americans.

Currently, there are at least 1.5 million visa workers holding white-collar jobs which are sought by new American graduates and seasoned professionals. The visa workers arrive via the H-1B, L1, OPT, CPT, O-1, TN, H4EAD, and other visa programs, and they have created a mobile, contingent workforce which reduces the marketplace pressure on companies to raise salaries paid to college educated Americans or to hire new American graduates.

But these programs also impose political costs on GOP candidates. An April 2018 study argued that white-collar immigration pushes American college graduates away from the GOP. “Our strongest and most significant finding is that an increase in high-skilled immigrants as a share of the local population is associated with a strong and significant decrease in the vote share for the Republican Party,” said the report, authored by pro-migration economist Giovanni Peri, Anna Maria Mayda, a Georgetown University professor, and Walter Steingress, an economist at the Bank of Canada.

In 2018, many suburban college graduate voters switched from GOP to back Democrats. The losing candidates included Kansas Rep. Kevin Yoder who was pushing a plan to award many more green cards to Indian visa workers.

Business groups and Democrats tout skewed polls that prod Americans to declare support for migrants and for the claim that the United States is an economy-expanding “Nation of Immigrants,” not a nation of Americans.

The alternative “priority or fairness” polls — as well as the 2016 election — show that voters put a much higher priority on helping their families, neighbors, and fellow nationals get decent jobs in a globalized, high-immigration economy.

President Trump’s tweeted support for foreign H-1B outsourcing workers is a ""betrayal,"" say college-grad supporters who lose pay & jobs to the imported workforce of 1.5 million cheap H1B/ OPT/ L-1/ etc. visa-workers. No surprise: investors are pleased. https://t.co/AZcZNIycls — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 15, 2019

The post Naomi Klein: The Green New Deal Is Changing the Calculus of the Possible appeared first on The Nation.,"Naomi Klein is the author of the best sellers No Is Not Enough, This Changes Everything, The Shock Doctrine, and No Logo. She’s a member of the board of directors of the international climate-action group 350.org. And she’s a senior correspondent for the Intercept, a contributor to The Nation, and the Gloria Steinem Chair in Media, Culture and Feminist Studies at Rutgers University. Ad Policy

Listen to Naomi Klein on the Start Making Sense podcast.

Jon Wiener: How would you describe the Green New Deal resolution introduced by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey?

Naomi Klein: It’s a sweeping plan to radically transform how we get energy, move ourselves around, live in cities, and grow our food; and it puts justice at the center—justice broadly defined, from racial and gender justice to making sure no worker is left behind, battling inequality at every level. It’s really about multitasking. It’s about understanding that we are in a time of multiple overlapping crises, and that we are on an incredibly tight deadline when it comes to lowering greenhouse-gas emissions in time to prevent truly catastrophic warming. In order to bring people along with these necessary changes, there have to be benefits in the here-and-now in terms of the kinds of jobs that are provided and the justice that comes through.

JW: The Green New Deal, you’ve said, is not a question that will be settled through elections alone. What do you mean?

NK: In terms of winning the power to introduce a package as ambitious as the resolution, the only real historical precedent is the original New Deal. And the political dynamics that produced the original New Deal were not a benevolent politician handing reforms down from on high, from the goodness of his heart. Of course it mattered to have FDR in power instead of Herbert Hoover, but it mattered even more to have an organized population which was flexing its muscles in every conceivable way in the 1930s—from sit-down strikes in auto plants, to shutting down the ports on the West Coast, to shutting down entire cities with general strikes. And it mattered also to have more radical voices who were calling for more radical policies than the New Deal was offering, like a truly cooperative economy. All of that created the context in which FDR was able to sell the New Deal to elites. They were grudging about it, but the alternative seemed to be political revolution.

So the only way that something like this happens is if it is accompanied by a huge grassroots mobilization, where every workplace, every sector, every movement is asking, “What would a Green New Deal mean for us? What would it mean in our workplace? What would it mean for the groups that we represent?” If we are going to succeed, they need to make it their own. So it’s going to take a hell of a lot of grassroots organizing, mobilizing all of these sectors to really believe that the Green New Deal is going to make their lives better, coupled with politicians running at every level of government, including for president, with a promise to enact this on day one.

JW: Building political power, you’ve said, is about changing the calculus of what is possible. That’s a big obstacle. We saw that in a column by Gail Collins in The New York Times last week: She argued the Green New Deal is too far-reaching and instead we should focus our efforts on more manageable things like creating more electric generating capacity from solar and wind. It’s not exactly opposing the Green New Deal, but it’s certainly not helping. Current Issue View our current issue

NK: There is this idea that a more incrementalist policy focused just on climate would be more sellable—something that doesn’t talk about fighting inequality, and a huge jobs program, and health care for all. But what’s actually stood in the way of strong climate policy in the past has been that, in times of real economic stress, like the ones we’ve been living in, people consistently rank climate below health care and below jobs. Often it ranks last on the list of political priorities. And that’s why politicians always feel that it can be sacrificed. Obama did that. He looked at the polls and he prioritized health care. And when that led to a huge amount of pushback, he didn’t spend any political capital trying to get a cap-and-trade policy through—even though that was totally inadequate.

And the other thing that stands in the way when politicians actually do introduce climate policies, is that, if they don’t prioritize justice, the proposals are actively unjust. For example, look to Emmanuel Macron in France, where this very neoliberal president introduced a tax cut for the very, very rich at the same time that he introduced a carbon-pricing scheme that increased the cost of living for working people. Then you had an uprising, and rioting in the streets, with the yellow vest movement—precisely because, as one of the protesters put it, “The politicians care about the end of the world when we have to care about the end of the month.” I think the brilliance of the Green New Deal framework is that it doesn’t ask people to choose. It says, “We all care about the end of the world. But we also care about the end of the month. So how do we design policies that simultaneously lower emissions and lower that economic strain?” And that’s exactly what they’re trying to do.

JW: There has been opposition to climate change legislation from the Laborers International Union and some of the building trades. But one of the unions that’s been really good on this is the Canadian Union of Postal Workers.

NK: I’ve been involved in a project in Canada called the Leap Manifesto, which is our people’s version of a Green New Deal, to get off fossil fuels in a hurry, but to put justice and labor protections at the center. After the Leap Manifesto came out, our team worked with that union, at their request, to come up with a plan to apply the principles of the Leap Manifesto to the Post Office—which, at that time, was facing a very real prospect of being privatized and radically downsized. So rather than just saying, “We want to keep things as they are, despite the fact that how we tend to send mail has been radically changed by Amazon and by courier services,” they said, “We want to change this service that has been at the center of communities for so long, and we want to now be at the center of a transition off of fossil fuels. We want to have postal banking, we want to have solar panels on the rooftops of every post office, we want a charging station outside, we want a fleet of vehicles that are all electric and all made domestically, and we want not just to be delivering the mail, but also to be delivering locally grown produce, checking in on the elderly, being part of the caring economy.” It’s a radical plan that’s being championed by an unabashedly progressive union. And coming back to where we started, that’s what it means to make the Green New Deal your own. We need people in every organized workplace to be getting together and imagining what their workplace would look like if they took rapid de-carbonization seriously.

The base isn’t stupid, and if they stay home on election day because you’ve disavowed them in the general election campaign then you aren’t going to pick up enough “moderate” voters to make a difference. That so-called strategy has looked more an more bleak for several years. Now the alleged moderates have not only decreased in number but they actually don’t represent any view on the American political landscape. These two graphs are from the Pew Research Center’s report Political Polarization in the American Public.

CREDIT: http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/section-1-growing-ideological-consistency/

Because our “first past the post” system crushes third parties like the bugs that they are, this polarization hasn’t been felt in American politics. But the same thing is happening in Europe and Australia/Oceania where parliamentary systems and you can see the effect.

Writing at the Washington Post, Harry Olsen has an intriguing piece on how centrist, “third way” politics are foundering basically everywhere after this philosophy had been declared victorious a couple of decades ago. The article is titled Don’t fool yourself. The political center won’t recover anytime soon and I don’t think the phenomenon is as surprising as some.

…Globally, the prevailing trend is rising support for anti-immigrant, nationalist populist parties — not a resurgence of the center. That trend is easy to see almost anywhere you look. Estonia holds national elections in a week, and polls show the big winner is likely to be the Conservative People’s Party of Estonia, which is set to more than double its share of the vote, becoming the third-largest party in the country. Spain’s Socialist president, Pedro Sánchez, recently called for a snap election after his government failed to pass a budget, but again, polls show an anti-immigrant, nationalist party called Vox will likely gain the most. Vox has skyrocketed in support from less than 1 percent in 2016 to an average of around 11 percent in recent polls. A three-party, center-right coalition including Vox shocked the country by winning the state elections last December in the longtime Socialist bastion of Andalusia. It now looks like that coalition will govern Spain, too. …Italy’s Lega is led by the notorious anti-immigrant and social conservative Matteo Salvini, who has garnered international attention with his opposition to admitting refugees from Muslim Northern Africa. Lega’s support has doubled within a year, from 17 percent in last March’s election to more than 35 percent today, easily making the brash populist the most popular political figure in Italy. …That’s the coalition that currently governs New Zealand, where Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, known for her environmental policies and deft use of social media, governs in coalition with the anti-immigrant and nationalist New Zealand First party. Their coalition agreement is opaque on the matter, but annual net migration has declined nearly 30 percent since the coalition took power in 2017. …Quebec elected a center-right government for the first time in decades last year, partially on its promise to reduce immigration to the province by 20 percent. A new political party, the People’s Party of Canada, formed last year with a platform of free-market economic reforms and reducing immigration. It is already receiving more than 2 percent in the polls, and could easily gain more support ahead of this fall’s national election.

What Olsen paints as anti-immigrant is, I think, much more a natural resurgence of nationalism that has been tamped down…tribalism, dontcha know…by would-be elites married to a populism abetted by the breaking of the information monopoly that has large numbers of people looking at the policies promoted by those elites and asking “WTF??” because a blind man could see they do nothing to benefit current or future generations of their nation. Immigration is a lightning rod for this effect because in so many Western nations, the elites either have or have no problem with opening the flood gates to no-skills/low-skills immigrants who either survive on the dole (paid for by the citizen taxpayer) or compete for low-end jobs with disadvantaged citizens and who, either by their own desire or the benighted policies of the host nation, show no desire to assimilate or even pretend to assimilate.

Those bemoaning the loss of a “center” are actually crying over the demise of Failure Theater and the log-rolling and deal-making that benefited only a relatively small number of people to the detriment of most everyone else. They are complaining that the rule by elites is coming to an end now that everywhere people are seeing that what was marketed as “bipartisanship” was actually just a self-serving scam.

This is “how you got Trump” in a nutshell.

As Texas Democrat and populist Jim Hightower was noted for saying, there’s nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos. The 2016 GOP primary demonstrated that in spades. The closer you were to being a “moderate” the sooner you looked like dead armadillo (Scott Walker, Jeb Bush). The closer your views were to those of the average voter the better your chance of survival. Ted Cruz understood that when he ran this commercial in 2016 highlighting the fact that illegal immigration was only supported by people whose jobs were not put at risk by it:

It will be shocking if the same dynamic doesn’t play out in the Democrat primary for 2020.

Fifty years ago, both US parties commanded a broad consensus opinion on the American Experiment. That consensus has unraveled. The two major parties now have very differing ideas about what the nation should look like and how our economic system should operate. The challenge in 2020 will be to appeal to those common values remaining with sufficient strength to bring along people who might not agree with large parts of your platform. It implies that rather than trying to appeal to moderates, the successful candidate will lock down and motivate their base and build enough common ground with some “moderate” elements to create a winning coalition. Will that common ground be reducing illegal immigration, as it is in Europe? Will it be restricting abortion and limiting the ability of the federal government to meddle in our lives? Or will it be guaranteed free day care, a $15/hour minimum wage and a stipend for those who, according to the Green New Deal, are “unwilling to work?” I really don’t know. Regardless, the unalloyed good here is that both sides are coming to see “moderates” as the feckless and uncertain allies that they are.

In October, Canada became the first industrialized country, and the second overall behind Uruguay, to legalize recreational pot. It was followed not long after by a handful of U.S. states legalizing or expanding access to cannabis in the November midterm elections, and President Trump signing the Farm Bill into law in December, giving the green light to hemp and hemp-based products.

Just how big could the legal weed industry be? While estimates are all over the place, investment firm Cowen Group offers the most robust sales prediction of $75 billion in worldwide sales by 2030. Meanwhile, a co-authored report from Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics is calling for $31.3 billion in global sales by 2022, up from $12.8 billion in 2018.

Figures like these are what has made Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: ACB) the most popular stock among millennial investors on free-trading app Robinhood. However, there's probably also no stock that's more polarizing to investors as a whole than Aurora Cannabis. You either think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread, or you find it grossly overvalued, with few if any investors taking a middle-of-the-road stance.

Three very good reasons Aurora Cannabis could make you rich

With this in mind, below you'll find three arguments in favor of buying one of the largest publicly traded pot stocks in the world. Afterwards, I'll tackle three arguments against buying Aurora Cannabis.

If there's a clear top reason to buy into the Aurora Cannabis growth story, it's the company's peak production potential. Although Aurora's management team has guided to ""in excess of 500,000 kilograms"" annually when running on all cylinders, it's hard to see the company near a figure this low. Rather, management had been calling for 570,000 kilos prior to the purchase of ICC Labs in South America for 264 million Canadian dollars late last year. With 92,000 square feet of existing production and 1.1 million square feet of under-construction greenhouse capacity, ICC Labs should help push Aurora close to 700,000 kilograms per year.

Even though production isn't everything, the company's sheer amount of annual output should help lead to ample long-term supply deals with domestic provinces and overseas countries where medical weed is legal. Also, the cannabis industry tends to benefit from economies of scale. This suggests that as production rises, Aurora's per-gram production costs should fall.

Surely, Netanyahu’s attempt is despicable – but what of Gantz’s comparison? BALAD is a predominantly Palestinian-Israeli party which seeks equality in a secular state.

BALAD responded to Gantz officially (Hebrew):

The announcement by Benny Gantz’s “Israeli Resilience” party, wherein he compares between BALAD, a democratic party which represents a large part of the Arab public, and the Kahanist mentors of Jewish terror, shows that Gantz – who not long ago glorified and boasted about the destruction he inflicted on Gaza – is no different from Netanayhu who incites against the Arabs and warns about their coming to vote in droves. Balad is a moral party which promotes the most democratic platform – a state of all its citizens. We will certainly not join a Gantz government and he is barging into an open door. A democratic party like BALAD opposes not only Netanyahu, but also Netanyahu 2 called Gantz.

That’s a great statement. Benny Gantz is supposedly a rival of Netanyahu, but is really his alter-ego inside the Zionist spectrum. Not that there aren’t shades of gray in it, but here Gantz is clearly marking what he, and Zionism, consider completely out of discussion: a democratic, secular state of all its citizens. Such a suggestion is seen as akin to fascist exclusivist Jewish terrorism, because it will supposedly destroy the state from inside.

Such a view is mainstream in the Israeli left-center. The Labor leader Avi Gabbay said as much when he was elected to lead the party in summer 2017:

The Joint List’s current composition includes anti-Zionist elements like [Haneen] Zoabi and [Jamal] Zahalka, so we can’t cooperate with this composition.

(Gabbay was referring to the two BALAD leaders who won’t be running for parliament in coming elections).

This is a sad reality, and it’s not about Benjamin Netanyahu or Benjamin Gantz, Netanyahu 1 or Netanyahu 2. It’s really like Gabbay says – it’s about Zionism. Because equality is simply anathema to Zionism, no matter how much Zionist apologists point out that there are Arab citizens in Israel.

So when the Zionist leaders compete on who is more Zionist, they are bound to incite against those few who dare to challenge the Zionist model. And that puts them in the center, serving as an insurance against claims that they are “Arab lovers” (as former Labor leader Isaac Herzog warned).

“Jewish power”

The Jewish Power (Otzma Yehudit) leaders are followers of Meir Kahane – former leader of ‘Kach’ party which was banned from running in the elections in 1988 and was designated as a terror organization in Israel, the U.S., Canada and the EU. The leader of ‘Kach’ Meir Kahane managed to get elected in 1984 and was boycotted by all the other parties in the Knesset. He tried to pass a law for stripping non-Jews from their citizenship, a law for separate beaches for Jews and Arabs and other racist laws.

These are the party leaders, as David Horovitz characterizes them in the Times of Israel:

– Former lawmaker Michael Ben-Ari. Interviewed on Army Radio on Wednesday afternoon, he was asked to disavow Kahane’s racist ideology. He ridiculed the notion. Kahane, he said, was his teacher, his rabbi.

– Itamar Ben Gvir, made headlines in Israel in 1995 when he held up the Cadillac insignia ripped from prime minister Yitzhak Rabin’s car and bragged to a TV camera, “Just as we got to this symbol, we can get to Rabin” – merely a few weeks before Rabin’s murder.

– Baruch Marzel, a former top aide to Kahane known for organizing parties in celebration of Baruch Goldstein, who massacred 29 Palestinians at prayer in Hebron’s Cave of the Patriarchs in 1994.

– Benzi Gopstein, an ex-Kahane student and Kach activist whose Lehava movement works to prevent relationships — romantic and otherwise — between Jews and Palestinians.

These are the guys that Netanyahu was so bent on having alliance with, to secure his rightwing majority. The fear was that if Jewish Power didn’t make alliance with other right religious-nationalist parties, those parties might fall below the 3.25% Knesset threshold (the so-called blocking line of four seats in the parliament) and go to waste. Jewish Home had already made alliance last week with the National Union faction, but was still resisting pressure to merge with Jewish Power – until Netanyahu spearheaded a personal campaign for them to join forces.

Netanyahu promised to give the Jewish Home party the 28th spot on Likud’s candidate list in return for election merger with Jewish Power. This move is expected to secure the needed 4 seats for this alliance.

These are the sensibilities in the Israeli elections. Netanyahu will make these deals with the Israeli David Dukes, and Gantz will chide him for it, but in doing so incite against those who seek a liberal, democratic, state of all its citizens. In the end, Gantz’s party name “Israeli Resilience” really does translate to Jewish Power. Because that’s what Zionism is about – the “strong Jew”.

For the ‘liberal-Zionists’, the only question remaining is how to make that palatable to everyone else, how to make it sound democratic, how to make it seem liberal, how to make it look moral. But when it comes down to it, Zionists view equality as their destruction.

A recent wave of cybercrime has targeted organizations with employees in Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, and Serbia.

Microsoft is expanding its AccountGuard cybersecurity service to 12 new European markets to help organizations defend against a rise in cyberthreats as they prepare for upcoming Parliament elections.

Nation-states and other attackers aim to influence elections and disrupt democracies around the world. The 2017 French presidential election was subject to hacking and disinformation attacks, and European leaders have predicted more attacks will continue in Europe this year.

These threats extend outside campaigns to hit think tanks and nonprofits that work with government agencies on electoral integrity, public policy, and democracy. Recent attacks, reportedly by Strontium, have targeted 104 accounts of employees of the German Council on Foreign Relations, The Aspen Institutes in Europe, and the German Marshall Fund. Workers were located in Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, and Serbia, Microsoft reports.

Microsoft is expanding availability of AccountGuard to France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia, and Spain. It already was available in the US, Canada, Ireland, and the UK, bringing the total to 14 European countries.

AccountGuard is available at no extra cost to political candidates, parties, and campaign offices at local and national levels, as well as think tanks, nonprofits, and non-governmental organizations working on democracy and electoral integrity.

88,Empty,2019-02-22T11:00:28Z,It's a tale of two creditors – each with distinct foreign policy goals.,"A month ago, Venezuelan National Assembly President Juan Guaidó refused to recognize the legitimacy of President Nicolás Maduro’s fraudulent May 2018 reelection. Guaidó declared himself interim president, calling for new elections — and quickly garnered the support of the United States, Canada, most of the European Union and a dozen Latin American nations.

Absent from that list are two countries with major financial interests in Venezuela: China and Russia. It has been a tale of two creditors, each with a concentrated financial exposure to Venezuela yet distinct foreign policy aims. Our research, reflected in two recently published Wilson Center reports, examines these differences in Chinese-Venezuelan and Russian-Venezuelan economic relations. Here’s what you need to know:

1. For China, oil ties mean Beijing has to be pragmatic about nonintervention.

On the eve of the global financial crisis, President Hugo Chávez and President Hu Jintao laid the foundations of the China-Venezuela state-to-state relationship when they crafted their first loans-for-oil deals in 2007. Chávez was able to court a creditor to help expand the Venezuelan state. For Beijing, Venezuela’s abundant natural resources and energy supplies could help China secure long-term access to these vital national assets.

By 2014, China’s main policy bank, the China Development Bank (CDB), had provided the Venezuelan government with more than $30 billion in new oil-backed loans. They had mainly supported investment in the energy and mining sectors, including power stations, oil refineries and pipelines. However, the initial discretionary nature of these policy bank loans also meant that Venezuela used the proceeds for infrastructure projects in a variety of other sectors, including agriculture, telecommunications, housing and forestry.

[Here are the 3 big shifts in Venezuela that you probably missed — and will change what comes next]

China’s policy banks hoped to avoid the failings of other creditors in Latin America by circumventing the need for policy conditionality with commercial conditions. Beijing used loans-for-oil deals, wagering that the production capacity of Venezuela’s state oil company (PDVSA) was a sufficient guarantee for debt repayment.

This was a miscalculation. China overestimated Venezuela’s ability to sustain oil production and, hence, economic activity, but also its ability to successfully manage several commercial projects that were spread across broad sectors of the economy. China thus paid a high cost when Venezuela fell into arrears on its oil collateral and failed to finance transportation projects in 2014 amid the country’s worsening economic crisis and historic oil sector collapse.

As Venezuela’s economy worsened, China grew cautious

With China’s loans tied to oil production, China’s policy banks were compelled to lend defensively — rolling over about $9 billion of existing bilateral funds — in the hope of boosting Venezuela crude output and recovering their oil collateral. But Beijing also grew reluctant to extend any new financial arrangements, as China became more circumspect about Maduro’s ability to manage the economy. At its peak, between 2010 and 2013, Venezuela accounted for an average of 64 percent of China’s new approved lines of credit to Latin America. But from 2014 to 2017, Venezuela represented 18 percent of China’s total new lines of credit to the region.

[Why did China stand by Maduro in Venezuela?]

China’s strategy revolves around a pragmatic commitment to “nonintervention,” protecting its considerable financial commitments by hedging politically as well as commercially. Chinese leaders courted Venezuela’s opposition leaders during the 2012 presidential and the 2015 parliamentary elections. Guaidó representatives reportedly met with Chinese officials last week to discuss Venezuela’s $20 billion outstanding debt to China.

Guaidó has sought to build on this diplomatic momentum, saying that China’s “support will be very important in boosting our country’s economy and future development.” In Beijing, a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seemed to reciprocate, saying, “No matter how the situation evolves, China-Venezuela cooperation should not be undermined.”

2. Russia is looking to boost both its geopolitical and economic capital

Beginning in 2015, as China grew more cautious and concerned about its exposure in Venezuela, Russia provided about $6.5 billion in new funds through its state-owned enterprise, Rosneft, to Venezuela’s state-owned oil company. Previously, the cornerstone of the Russia-Venezuelan relationship had been military ties, with Venezuela buying more than $4 billion in Russian arms and military equipment.

By financially backing the Maduro regime, Russia seized an opportunity to signal its return to the global and hemispheric stage with a symbolic move in Venezuela, a country in close U.S. proximity. Moscow also demonstrated to its hemispheric allies, such as Cuba and Nicaragua, that it could both exercise Latin American influence and challenge U.S. geopolitical interests.

In the wake of Guaidó’s political ascension, Russia drafted a U.N. resolution expressing “its concerns over threats to use force” against Venezuela. Russia fired a rhetorical shot across the U.S.’s foreign policy bow, warning that “the cynical, overt interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state” must stop. Venezuela’s military, an ongoing supporter of the Maduro regime, has relied on Russia for military equipment — circumventing U.S. sanctions.

Russia’s motivations were largely political

The guiding principles of Russia’s involvement in the oil and gas sectors are also mostly political rather than commercial. In a recent Wilson Center report, analyst Vladimir Rouvinski suggests that Russian political elites “sincerely believe there is an opportunity to improve the situation sometime in the future with Chavistas still in control of Venezuela.”

Russia’s state-owned enterprises emerged as key investors at a time when the Maduro government found it increasingly difficult to secure new credit from anywhere, including China. Rosneft and Gazprom, Russia’s energy giants, provided valued short-term financing to Venezuela’s crumbling oil-state company (PDVSA).

In exchange, PDVSA provided 49.9 percent of its total shares from its U.S. subsidiary, Citgo, as collateral to Rosneft to guarantee future payments. Furthermore, Rosneft has increased in equity stake in the Orinoco’s heavy oil belt joint venture and has also received access to the largest gas reserves in Venezuela.

[Will Venezuela’s military back — or abandon — Maduro? Here are the 4 things it will consider.]

But Moscow appears to be learning from China’s Venezuelan hedge by diversifying its strategic hand beyond the geopolitical card. Facing mounting financial arrears, vulnerable supply chains, U.S. court battles over Citgo shares used as loan collateral, and U.S. sanctions on the Rosneft CEO, there are limits to how far Rosneft can extend its financial exposure in Venezuela.

Rosneft is Russia’s largest oil producer and second-largest gas-producing firm — this means Russia has to protect the company’s commercial interests. Recently, Russia appears to be counterbalancing the tough geopolitical rhetoric with a softer push, saying, “The only way out of this crisis is for the government and opposition to sit down for negotiations.” Notwithstanding ongoing uncertainty regarding Venezuela’s political future, it is clear that both China and Russia plan to be a part of Venezuela’s economic future.

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.

Prior to his official visit to Canada at the end of March, President Reuven Rivlin met with a delegation representing the Board of Directors of CIJA – the Center for Israel and Jewish Affairs – which is the advocacy agent of the Jewish Federation of Canada.



Rivlin said on Wednesday that his visit was by way of showing appreciation to the people and government of Canada for the bipartisan stand that Canada has taken in the fight against antisemitism.

Rivlin confessed that in his youth he believed that the only true Zionist was a Jew who came to live in Israel. While he has not deviated greatly from that concept, he now realizes that “Zionism means understanding, love and connection to Israel” and that “Israel and diaspora Jews are part of one family which must be together.”Voicing Israel’s concern over anti-Israel and antisemitic incidents now permeating the world, Rivlin said “It comes and goes in waves but it never stops.”He disclosed that he had written a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron to thank him for the strong stand that he had personally taken in response to the large-scale desecration of Jewish graves and for visiting the Jewish cemetery at Quatzenheim and the Holocaust memorial in Paris. “The mass desecration of Jewish graves with symbols of neo-Nazism is a shocking reminder that antisemitism is still amongst us,” Rivlin wrote.As he has done with many other groups Rivlin made it clear to his Canadian guests that the creation of the State of Israel was not by way of compensation for the Holocaust. For centuries, he said, Jews had been told by people in the host countries in which they were living to go back to the land of the Bible, and out of 70 Diaspora communities that included Holocaust survivors, the State of Israel had built a nation.In a reference to Israel’s global reputation as a start-up nation, Rivlin attributed this to Israel’s ability to turn challenges into opportunities – often due to defense needs.Within the realm of current challenges, Rivlin said that what is happening just now in the region should be watched with concern – especially the Iranian presence on Israel’s northern border – a factor which for Israel signifies a redline because Iran is always calling for Israel’s destruction.Israel is also mindful of the fact that Russia is holding positions next to the Mediterranean, he commented.As for Syria, Rivlin noted the misplaced thinking of all those who thought that Syria’s President Bashar Assad was history.“He’s killed almost 800,000 people, and Syrian refugees are spreading over the world,’’ said Rivlin, who doubted that Syria could ever become a secular democracy given its complicated demographic composition.During his visit to Canada, Rivlin will be in Ottowa and Toronto and, in addition to his meetings with senior government officials, will be the guest of the Toronto Jewish Community.When arrangements for the visit were initially made, Rivlin was also scheduled to spend time in New York, but that part of the visit was canceled following the announcement that Israel’s national elections would be held on April 9.Rivlin wanted to be sure that he would be home well in advance of Election Day.

HR1 (text here) was, symbolically, the first bill introduced in this session of the House, and it rapidly aqquired 227 co-sponsors — of whom not one was a Republican. The bill garnered a lot of positive coverage. From the Brennan Center for Justice:

The Brennan Center has long advocated for, and in many cases helped innovate, many of the reforms outlined in H.R. 1. “Perhaps more than ever, Americans understand the problems facing our democracy,” said Weiser. “They are hungry for bold and effective solutions to those problems — like those in H.R. 1 — and real action on those solutions.” Weiser submitted written testimony in support of the Act in advance of Thursday’s hearing. In her comments on Thursday, she highlighted three of the reforms outlined in H.R. 1: Restoring the Voting Rights Act, a landmark civil rights law that was hobbled by the Supreme Court’s 2013 Shelby County decision;

a landmark civil rights law that was hobbled by the Supreme Court’s 2013 Shelby County decision; Automatic voter registration (AVR), which would streamline how Americans register to vote — and could add up to 50 million new voters to the rolls; and

which would streamline how Americans register to vote — and could add up to 50 million new voters to the rolls; and Small-donor public financing, which would amplify the voices of ordinary voters by providing public funds to match small donors. Thursday marked the latest in a series of hearings on H.R. 1, which have focused on elements of the bill ranging from presidential ethics to election security. The bill marks the first time in decades that either major political party has made comprehensive reform of the systems of democracy a central priority.

(Let me pause to compliment the Brennan Center for not using the noxious phrase “our democracy.” As the old joke goes, “What do you mean, ‘we’?”) Democrat House organ The New Yorker:

[Last week,] a hearing on H.R. 1, the For the People Act, took place in the House of Representatives. Elijah Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, the new chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, referred to the bill, in his opening remarks, as “one of the boldest reform packages to be considered in the history of this body.” He added, “This sweeping legislation will clean up corruption in government, fight secret money in politics, and make it easier for American citizens across this great country to vote.” That statement was not partisan hyperbole. The bill is a broad, imaginative, and ambitious set of responses to the most pressing challenges facing American democracy, many of which preceded the 2016 election, but almost all of which were brought into sharper focus by it. Implicit in the choice to take up an electoral-reform bill as the first act of the new Democratic majority in the House was the decision to confront not only these injustices but, more fundamentally, the forces that have allowed them to come into existence. The bill contains provisions to insure access to paper ballots, in order to verify the accuracy of voting results; to establish early voting in all states for federal elections; and to launch independent redistricting commissions, to address the problem of partisan gerrymandering.

(“Access” to paper ballots. Oh.) Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a scathing WaPo Op-Ed, dubbed it “the Democrat Politician Protection Act,” and given what we know about how the liberal Democrat establishment operates, it would be strange indeed if the bill did work in their favor, institutionally. Now, I have no doubt that there are good things in the bill; but it’s 600 pages long, and I don’t have time to go through it all to find them. I do think, however, that the bill presents four major problems: Two Easter Eggs, little hidden surprises, and two Trojan Horses, something seemingly benign that is in fact destructive (in this case, of democracy, ironically enough in a bill titled “For the People”). The two Easter Eggs are raised barriers to small parties and digital voting; the two Trojan Horses are a role for the intelligence community, and the nature of campaign contribututions.

Easter Egg: Barriers to Small Parties

Bruce Dixon comments:

HR 1 is surgically aimed to eliminate federal matching funds for Green Party candidates by raising the qualifying amount from its current level of $5,000 in each of 20 states to $25,000 in 20 states. HR 1 would cut funding for a Green presidential candidate in half, and by making ballot access for a Green presidential candidate impossible in several states it would also guarantee loss of the party’s ability to run for local offices.

From the Bill:

SEC. 5202. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR MATCHING PAYMENTS. (a) Amount Of Aggregate Contributions Per State; Disregarding Of Amounts Contributed In Excess Of $200.—Section 9033(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended— (1) by striking “$5,000” and inserting “$25,000”; and (2) by striking “20 States” and inserting the following: “20 States (disregarding any amount of contributions from any such resident to the extent that the total of the amounts contributed by such resident for the election exceeds $200)”.

Easter Egg: Digital Voting

Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!–Edsger W. Dijkstra

In other words, digital must be removed everywhere in the voting and tabulating process, because otherwise the vote is vulnerable to hacking and election fraud. That’s why hand-marked paper ballots, hand-counted in public, are the world standard. To quote another programming proverb: “The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that aren’t there” (Gordon Bell).

From the Bill; I’ve helpfully underlined and noted in square brackets the problematic portions of the text:

SEC. 1502. PAPER BALLOT AND MANUAL COUNTING REQUIREMENTS. (a) In General.—Section 301(a)(2) of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 21081(a)(2)) is amended to read as follows: “(2) PAPER BALLOT REQUIREMENT.— “(A) VOTER-VERIFIED PAPER BALLOTS.— “(i) PAPER BALLOT REQUIREMENT.— (I) The voting system shall require the use of an individual, durable, voter-verified, paper ballot of the voter’s vote that shall [A] be marked and made available for inspection and verification by the voter before the voter’s vote is cast and counted, and which shall be counted by hand [B] or read by an optical character recognition device or other counting device . For purposes of this subclause, the term ‘individual, durable, voter-verified, paper ballot’ means a paper ballot marked by the voter by hand [C] or a paper ballot marked through the use of a nontabulating ballot marking device or system , [D] so long as the voter shall have the option to mark his or her ballot by hand . “(II) The voting system shall provide the voter with an opportunity to correct any error on the paper ballot before the permanent voter-verified paper ballot is preserved in accordance with clause (ii). “(III) The voting system shall not preserve the voter-verified paper ballots in any manner that makes it possible, at any time after the ballot has been cast, to associate a voter with the record of the voter’s vote without the voter’s consent. “(ii) PRESERVATION AS OFFICIAL RECORD.—The individual, durable, voter-verified, paper ballot used in accordance with clause (i) shall constitute the official ballot and shall be preserved and [E] used as the official ballot for purposes of any recount or audit conducted with respect to any election for Federal office in which the voting system is used. “(iii) MANUAL COUNTING REQUIREMENTS FOR RECOUNTS AND AUDITS.— (I) Each paper ballot used pursuant to clause (i) shall be suitable for a manual audit, and shall be counted by hand in any recount or audit conducted with respect to any election for Federal office.

[A] “be marked” leaves the agent doing the marking unspecified (see notes [C] and [D).

[B] “or read by an optical character recognition device or other counting device” means that the count need not be by hand, and need not be public.

[C] “marked through the use of a nontabulating ballot marking device or system,” for example, hackable touch screens.

[D] “shall have the option to mark his or her ballot by hand” means that voting machine vendors can use UI/UX “dark patterns” to discourage hand-marking.

[E] “used as the official ballot for purposes of any recount” means that the paper ballot is not the official ballot (!!) until a recount is performed. But how do we know to perform a recount if an election has been successfully hacked? Why not just make the paper ballot the official ballot to begin with[1], and get rid of all the digital cruft, as they do in Canada, Germany, and the UK?[2]

Collectively, the notes show that the section title — “Subtitle F—Promoting Accuracy, Integrity, And Security Through Voter-Verified Permanent Paper Ballot” — is at best deceptive and at worse a bait-and-switch. This entire section is so sloppy and bad it might as well have been written by an e-voting lobbyist. For me, it calls the good faith of the entire bill into question. Anybody who thinks this bill advances the cause of paper ballots in any way is a fool gravely mistaken.

Vice president Mike Pence said four Venezuelan state governors allied to Mr Maduro were the target of the new sanctions, while he urged the international community to freeze assets of the nation's state-run oil company. The US also asked the United Nations Security Council to hold an urgent meeting on the crisis.

“I want to assure you, President Guaidó, that the tragic events of the past weekend have only steeled the resolve of the United States of America,” Mr Pence said at a meeting of the Lima Group in Colombia.

The meeting was attended by opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself Venezuela's president.

According to the Associated Press, Mr Pence added. “We are with you 100 per cent.”

Also in Colombia at the weekend, where he visited efforts to transport US aid across the border into Venezuela – an effort that resulted in violence and several deaths – was Republican senator Marco Rubio, who has been highly influential on Donald Trump’s Latin American policy and whom the New York Times has termed the “ouster in chief”.

On Sunday, he tweeted several messages attacking Mr Maduro’s government before then posting three images of ousted dictators – Libya’s Gaddafi, Panama’s Manuel Noriega and Romania’s Nicolae Ceausescu. The gruesome, blood-laced image of the Libyan leader was taken as he was bayoneted to death by rebels in the city of Sirte in October 2011. Nato had earlier engaged in a devastating bombing campaign against Gadafi's forces.

Mr Rubio’s tweet of the image contained no text, but quickly sparked outcry on social media. A number of commentators said he was tweeting the equivalent of stills from a “snuff movie”.

In Colombia at the meeting of nations from the Americas, Mr Pence spoke with Mr Guaido, who Washington had encouraged to declare himself the country’s “legitimate” president and who it quickly regonised as such after he did so. The UK, Canada and up to 50 other nations quickly followed, while China, Russia and Mexico still recognise Mr Maduo.

Mr Pence accused Mr Maduro’s forces of burning several trucks containing medical supplies over the weekend as the opposition tried to deliver US aid, even though it was unclear how they were set alight.

“As the world watched, the tyrant in Caracas danced as his henchmen murdered civilians and burned truckloads of food and medicine destined for the people of Venezuela,” Mr Pence claimed. “These men worked to block aid for people in need and suppress peaceful protests – and their actions will not go unpunished.

“In the days ahead, the US will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks. We will find every last dollar they have stolen and return that money to the Venezuelan people.

“As we continue to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the Maduro regime, we hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But others - including several European nations - voiced caution. Hamilton Mourão, vice president of Brazil, one of the nations that has recegnised Mr Guaido, said under no circumstances would his country allow the US to intervene militarily in Venezuela from Brazilian territory.

Mr Maduro has denied claims that he is refusing to accept aid. Indeed, the UN has stepped up distribution of humanitarian supplies in the country. His supporters point out the US has previously used shipments of aid in Latin America to smuggle weapons to rebels. Three decades ago, Elliott Abrams, currently Mr Trump’s point person on Venezuela, oversaw such an operation against the democratically elected government of Nicaragua.

Mr Maduro on Monday tweeted that the “empire and its lackey” must understand that in “Venezuela the self-determination of our people reigns. We will solve the problems in a national union, with the Bolivarian government that I preside over. Together for Venezuela!”.

Meanwhile, the US asked the UN Security Council to discuss the Venezuela situation on Tuesday. Reuters said Washington wanted the 15-member council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections in Venezuela with international observers, a move that prompted Russia to propose a rival draft resolution.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - The United States targeted Venezuela's government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of its state-owned oil company PDVSA after deadly violence blocked aid from reaching the crisis-hit country during the weekend.

The United States also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking that body to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The U.S. Treasury Department's sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of embattled President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the United States.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogota as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and opposition leader Juan Guaido met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the Venezuelan crisis.

Pence said the United States would stand by Guaido until freedom was restored to the OPEC member. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA's assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Maduro's ""henchmen"" to Guaido's government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming.

""In the days ahead ... the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks,"" Pence said. ""We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.""

Guaido, sitting next to Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the ""massacre"" of the weekend.

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during the protests and clashes on Saturday as U.S.-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

Guaido, recognised by most Western nations as Venezuela's legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider ""all options"" in ousting Maduro.

Pence repeated an earlier statement that there would be an amnesty for members of the armed forces who throw their support behind Guaido. He said he hopes Maduro and those supported by his ""corruption and his brutality"" will leave Venezuela peacefully.

""We make clear to them that we will support the interim president's call for amnesty, an inclusive government, an inclusive future for members of the armed forces, who have laid down their arms and stand with the Guaido government,"" Pence said.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the United States is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela Martinez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region's other powers in embracing Guaido as Venezuela's rightful president.

""We believe there can be no bystanders, no one on the sidelines of this, particularly in our hemisphere, and our message today very much was intended to say - to Mexico, to Uruguay, to nations across the eastern Caribbean - that they need to come off the sidelines, they need to take a stand for freedom. Stand with us and with the people of Venezuela,"" said Pence.

Washington wants the 15-member U.N. Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela's energy sector and back Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Violence escalated during the weekend when the convoy of trucks with food and medicines was blocked by soldiers and armed groups loyal to Maduro. He says the aid efforts are part of a U.S.-orchestrated coup against Venezuela.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Maduro's government last week.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighbouring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has been wracked by years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as ""trochas"" generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as ""trocheros.""

""We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,"" said Belkis Garcia, 34, walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. ""We have to pay (to cross), so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don’t know what will happen if the border continues closed.""

Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested in unrest since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said in a press conference.

The four governors sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury include the flamboyant Rafael Lacava of state of Carabobo, who in 2018 visited Washington as part of talks that led to the release of Joshua Holt, an American who was imprisoned in Venezuela for nearly two years. Lacava goes by the nickname ""Dracula"" in reference to his habit of doing late-night patrols and is known for off-the-cuff social media videos.

The opinions in this article are those of the author.

(CNN) Since the end of the World War II, Western nations have shared the belief that international trade was a virtue. While progress has too often been lethargic, in the decades since, the United States and European nations have worked together to reduce barriers to trade.

This went hand in hand with a special bond between our two continents -- culturally, militarily, as a broad alliance of free nations.

Together, progress has been achieved in the form of the institutions such as the World Trade Organization and the European Community -- the forerunner to the European Union.

Trade-based agreements between the EU and the United States multiplied. Progress was made toward a comprehensive US-EU trade deal. Perhaps under a different president, these talks could even have been concluded. By signing trade deals with Japan and Canada, the EU has shown it is capable of cutting global trade deals and furthering rules-based trade.

As US companies have invested in Europe, successful European companies -- for example, automakers -- invested in the United States.

BMW, a legendary German carmaker, employs thousands of workers at its biggest production plant in South Carolina, which builds nearly half a million vehicles a year. Many of these are exported to Europe and elsewhere.

As with so many policy areas, the election of Donald Trump -- an isolationist and protectionist -- has upended the status quo . In the capitals of Europe, the trans-Atlantic relationship is turning into a nightmare.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel rightly expressed exasperation at the Trump administration's suggestion that European cars are a threat to US national security, calling it a ""shock."" This was German understatement.

Trump believes the United States ""loses"" when it runs trade deficits with other countries. Confusingly for many Europeans, traditionally free-trading Republicans appear to go along with Trump's 16th-century view of international trade.

Following European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's negotiations with Trump in July, the EU made a number of concessions by committing to importing more liquefied natural gas, soybeans and other products from the United States.

The Trump administration told Europeans that it would not impose trade tariffs on the EU or Japan as long as it continues to make progress in trade talks. Now it seems these promises and the progress we have made are about to be torn up.

What has changed? It is unclear. Trump's personality often requires that someone else must pay the price for the President's failures. It has been the hallmark of his presidency.

As we have seen with Trump's government shutdown over his wall, foreigners are easy scapegoats for domestic economic woes, of which the President has a long list. Europe thus risks becoming the next scapegoat for Trump's failure to do anything to boost the competitiveness or sustainability of US car plants over the long term.

Creating new trade barriers in the globalized world trading system will simply lead to a leakage of jobs by car manufacturers to outside jurisdictions.

The imposition of additional tariffs on the EU would only hurt domestic jobs and investments in the United States. But there would be noneconomic effects of a damaging US-EU trade war, too, which should also be factored in by the Trump administration.

On a human level and in diplomatic circles, even the threat of a trade war against the EU is doing lasting damage to the perceptions of America in European countries, which is deeply regrettable.

Never in my lifetime have US politicians been so tone-deaf to the aspirations and hopes of Europeans. Never have I seen the trans-Atlantic alliance look so fragile. One look at the eye-wateringly awkward responses to Vice President Mike Pence's recent speeches at the Munich Security Conference and elsewhere reaffirm this.

A trade war against allies still reeling from a global financial crisis triggered by the US subprime crisis more than 10 years ago, just ahead of European parliamentary elections due in May, will not only be economically harmful.

It also would cut deeply into the trans-Atlantic alliance at the worst possible time by giving anti-American, anti-capitalist nationalists and protectionists in Europe a platform to thrive. Anti-American sentiment will grow, and Europe risks a retreat to protectionism.

The post Trump isn’t colluding with the Russians — he’s conspiring with Putin appeared first on Raw Story.,"But not enough attention has been paid to the number of times Trump and Putin have talked since the election. According to The New York Times, Trump and Putin have had at least five meetings in person, and nine conversations over the phone since Trump won the election on November 9, 2016. Trump has gone to extraordinary lengths to keep those conversations secret, including taking away his own translator’s notes after a private meeting with Putin in Hamburg, Germany at the G-20 Summit in 2017. He also had a second meeting with Putin after a dinner at the same summit, during which Trump’s own interpreter was barred from the meeting. “There is no official United States government record of what was said,” according to the Times.

It has been widely reported that Trump accepted Putin’s denials of Russian interference in the 2016 election over the opinions of his own intelligence officials. But we didn’t know until this week with the publication of former FBI deputy director, Andrew McCabe’s book, “The Threat” that Trump had taken Putin’s word over that of American intelligence agencies about the ability of North Korean ICBM’s to reach American shores. During an intelligence briefing in the White House, Trump told his intelligence chiefs, “I don’t care. I believe Putin,” according to the interview McCabe gave to “60 Minutes.”

Why would Trump accept the word of an aggressive adversary over that of his own intelligence agencies? Why would he go to such great lengths to keep secret what he and Putin have talked about in person and on the phone? I think we now have our answer. It’s part of Trump’s continuing collusion with Russian president Vladimir Putin. The collusion didn’t end with the election. It’s ongoing. It’s constant. In fact, I don’t think we really know how many times Trump has talked to Putin. McCabe was asked during an interview this week when Trump had learned from Putin about the abilities of North Korea’s missile program. “I don’t know,” McCabe replied. Neither do we.

Trump’s contacts with the Russians go beyond his conversations with Putin. Remember what happened after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May of 2017? One day later, he welcomed into the Oval Office the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and bragged about firing Comey. “I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,” Trump told the Russians.” “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.” He then added, apparently unprompted, “I’m not under investigation.”

But we didn’t learn that from a White House transcript of the Oval Office meeting with the Russians. Nor did we learn it from members of the White House press corps who were present, because none were. No, we learned it days later from leaks by the Russian media, who were present in the Oval Office.

Trump had already spoken with Putin on the phone twice. Now he was reassuring the Russians that he had taken care of the man who had announced he was investigating Russian collusion with the Trump campaign, and that he himself was not a subject of an FBI investigation.

That would not remain true for very long. We now know from McCabe’s book that he had opened a criminal and counterintelligence investigation of President Trump soon after he fired Comey. “I was very concerned that I was able to put the Russia case on absolutely solid ground in an indelible fashion that were I removed quickly or reassigned or fired that the case would not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace,” McCabe told CBS’ “Sixty Minutes” last Sunday.

McCabe was correct to be worried that the FBI investigation of Trump would either disappear or come under attack by the president. The New York Times reported yesterday that Trump has attacked the Russia investigation more than 1,100 times. “The attacks, which number nearly 1,200, are part of a strategy to beat back the investigations. They have also opened him to possible obstruction of justice charges. They include statements made on Twitter, in official speeches, at rallies and during news media interviews and other press events.”

Attacking the investigation being carried out by Robert Mueller hasn’t been enough, however. What Trump has been doing with Putin isn’t collusion, it’s a conspiracy. The foundational crime of the conspiracy was to steal the election of 2016. What’s happened since has been a continuing conspiracy to destroy the Mueller investigation and push back at Democrats who are now gearing up to hold hearings to look into Trump and his Russia contacts. That’s why we have recently seen reports of Russian action on social media against Democrats during the midterm election for the house and senate in 2018. And now we’re seeing reports that the same Russians who interfered in the elections of 2016 and 2018 are starting to go after Democratic candidates who have announced for president, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren among them.

Practically every meeting Trump has had with American allies has been hostile. He has constantly threatened the NATO alliance and been critical of close allies like Germany, France, Canada, and Mexico. But everything he’s ever said about Russia and Putin has been positive. Everything. Even after he called off a formal meeting with Putin at the latest G-20 summit in Argentina last November, he managed to have a private conversation with the Russian leader at a dinner that was closed to the press, the White House had to admit later.

The collusion between Trump and Russia didn’t stop after the election. It’s ongoing, every time Trump appears with Putin at a summit, every time they have a private meeting, every time they pick up the phone. You think they might be getting ready for the election in 2020?

The House of Commons standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics will play host to the second meeting of the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News in May, according to a release from the committee today.

The global group is made up of parliamentarians from Canada, the U.K., Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, France, Ireland, Latvia and Singapore.

Along with Zuckerberg, the committee says it also sent invitations to:

Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg,

Google CEO Sundar Pichai,

Former Google executive chair Eric Schmidt,

Apple CEO Tim Cook,

Apple COO Jeff Williams,

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos

Amazon Web Services (AWS) CEO Andrew Jassy,

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey,

WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton and

Snap Inc. CEO Evan Spiegel.

Conservative MP Bob Zimmer, chair of the Canadian committee, said it will be a chance for the executives to explain what they're doing to protect individuals' privacy and stop the spread of disinformation.

""It is vitally important that we hear from these top executives so that we can get the answers we've been seeking,"" he said. ""We will not be accepting testimony from regional representatives at this meeting, as previous experience has shown that their answers have proven to be, frankly, inadequate.""

The global group held its inaugural meeting late last year in London, U.K., where members were hoping to grill Zuckerberg about the website's involvement with Cambridge Analytica.

The consulting firm, which worked on Donald Trump's presidential campaign, obtained the personal data of 87 million Facebook users from a researcher, drawing attention to the use of data analytics in politics.

Instead of Zuckerberg, Facebook sent Richard Allan, the company's vice president of policy solutions, to address the committee.

Minister suggests studying regulation of Facebook, Twitter

NDP MP Charlie Angus made international headlines after that first meeting for lambasting Zuckerberg for not personally answering questions on the matter.

""We've never seen anything quite like Facebook,"" Angus said at the time. ""While we were playing on our phones and apps, our democratic institutions … seem to have been upended by frat-boy billionaires from California.

""Mr. Zuckerberg's decision not to appear here at Westminster to me speaks volumes.""

This week, Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould floated the idea of imposing new rules on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter in the lead-up to the next federal election.



Testifying before the Procedure and House Affairs committee yesterday, Gould suggested the committee study the role of social media in elections.



""I would encourage this committee to do a study of the role of social media in democracy, if that is something that you think is interesting,"" she said. ""To hold the social media companies to account.



""I would welcome suggestions and feedback in terms of how to appropriately regulate or legislate that behaviour, because I think one of the biggest challenges — and you can see this around the world — is the path forward is not as clear.""

Guaido set out in a convoy of vehicles to personally pick up US aid being stockpiled on the other side of the Colombian border, defying Maduro's military to stop him.

Recognized as interim president by more than 50 countries, he left the capital Caracas for the Colombian border in a convoy of several vehicles for the 900-kilometre trip.

Embattled Maduro has dismissed Guaido's humanitarian caravan as a ""cheap show"" and slammed aid as a precursor for a US military intervention in the oil-rich but crippled Latin American country.

The 35-year-old leader of the Venezuelan legislature proclaimed himself acting president Jan 23 and wants to oust Maduro, set up a transitional government and hold new elections.

A separate caravan of buses and trucks containing opposition lawmakers had earlier left eastern Caracas bound for the border.

Several of the trucks were stopped by security forces and their drivers forced to get out, but the rest of the caravan was allowed to continue, lawmakers said.

""We know that the regime is going to put all obstacles to prevent us from reaching the border, but nothing is stopping us, we are going to continue,"" said opposition lawmaker Yanet Fermin.

Signaling his growing disquiet, Maduro announced Thursday that the border with Brazil - which along with Colombia is one of the main potential avenues for aid delivery - would be ""completely and absolutely"" closed from 8:00 pm (0000 GMT) until further notice.

Maria Teresa Belandria, Guaido's designated ambassador in Brazil, said aid deliveries would go ahead nonetheless. ""The operation goes on. There's no going back,"" Belandria told AFP.

She said 100 tons of food, medicines and emergency kits were waiting to be trucked from Boa Vista to Pacaraima on the Venezuelan border.

Maduro also warned on Thursday he was considering ""a total closure of the border with Colombia"" to Venezuela's west.

He has already ordered the military to barricade a major border bridge to prevent supplies from entering the country from Cucuta, Colombia, where tons of humanitarian aid are being stockpiled, most of it from the United States.

The military announced a ban on vessels putting to sea from Venezuelan ports until Sunday to avoid actions by ""criminal"" groups.

FIGHT OVER AID

Meanwhile, Maduro - mirroring Guaido's move in an attempt to show his socialist government was able to look after its people - ordered a shipment of thousands of food boxes to be distributed to the needy along the Colombian border.

Shipments of food and medicine for the crisis-stricken population have become a key focus of the power struggle between Maduro and Guaido.

Guaido, who says 300,000 people could die without an influx of aid, says he aims to rally a million volunteers to start bringing it in by Saturday.

It remained unclear how he proposed to do so if the blockade continues, but experts have pointed to the notoriously porous 2,200 kilometre border, which is perforated by well-worn drug trafficking and contraband routes.

BATTLING BANDS

Guaido said the planned entry points for aid were the Brazilian and Colombian borders, the island of Curacao and the seaports of Puerto Cabello and La Guaira.

Venezuela's vice-president Delcy Rodriguez said the government was shutting down air and sea links between Curacao and Venezuela.

However Carlos Faria, one of the leaders of a group of Venezuelans organizing aid shipments via Curacao, told AFP a plane carrying 50 tons of food and medicine was expected from Miami on Thursday and would be loaded onto a Venezuela-bound ship on Friday.

Amnesty International's Americas director Erika Guevara urged authorities to ""guarantee access"" for those bringing in aid.

Meanwhile, the White House said US Vice-President Mike Pence would visit neighbouring Colombia on Monday in a show of support for Guaido.

Underlining the swell of international support for Guaido, British entrepreneur Richard Branson plans to hold a pro-aid concert just inside Colombia on Friday, while Maduro's government stages a rival concert on its side of the border, around 300 metres away.

The change involving the Special Investigations Unit is part of legislation being introduced Tuesday to overhaul police oversight regulations. It comes after the government paused implementation of a law from the previous Liberal regime that enhanced the mandates of Ontario's three police oversight agencies — the SIU, the Office of the Independent Police Review Director and the Ontario Civilian Police Commission.

Currently, the SIU investigates circumstances involving police and civilians that have resulted in serious injury, death or allegations of sexual assault. That could include cases of suicide or situations in which a person dies after a medical incident.

Under the new legislation, the SIU would limit investigations to when police use of force results in serious injury or death, as well as when an officer has shot at a person or if there is a reported sexual assault, and would have to wrap up investigations within 120 days.

Attorney General Caroline Mulroney said the changes would focus the SIU's mandate to what it was originally created to do: investigate suspected criminal activity.

""That's actually not the case today,'' she said at an announcement in Oakville, Ont. ""If a police officer tries to stop a suicide attempt but is unsuccessful, he or she is treated like a suspect ... If a police officer responds to a violent crime, tries to perform CPR but is unable to save the life, he or she is treated like a suspect. This is not what the SIU should be doing.''

ONTARIO LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY Ontario Minister of Community Safety Sylvia Jones speaks in the legislature.

Community Safety and Correctional Services Minister Sylvia Jones said the Liberal changes to police oversight laws actively undermined policing efforts and public trust in officers.

""Police will no longer be treated like they're guilty until proven innocent,'' she said.

Under the Liberal legislation, officers who didn't comply with SIU investigations could be fined up to $50,000 and/or be sent to jail for up to one year — those fines will be drastically lowered, to $5,000 for a first incident and $10,000 for a second.

As well, the previous legislation allowed police chiefs to suspend officers without pay, and while Jones said that power is being maintained, she said the legislation will clarify the circumstances.

Police will no longer be treated like they're guilty until proven innocent. Minister Sylvia Jones

The new bill would also eliminate the Ontario Civilian Police Commission in order to create a single body to handle public complaints about police — the Office of the Independent Police Review Director would become the new Law Enforcement Complaints Agency. It would receive and screen public complaints about police officers and assign an investigation to a police service or an agency investigator.

The Police Association of Ontario said it hasn't been able to review the legislation before its introduction, but it welcomes the announcement.

""We are optimistic that this Act will restore fairness and respect for professional policing in the province, make oversight more effective, and improve governance, training, and transparency for the profession,'' the group said in a statement.

'Complete capitulation' to police associations, critic says

The Canadian Civil Liberties Association said the changes gut police oversight.

""The changes to police laws that stand the test of time are ones that are welcomed by neither the police unions, the police chiefs and the community groups,'' said executive director Michael Bryant, who is a former Liberal attorney general.

""Usually there's water in the wine for all the parties. Not this one. This one is a complete capitulation to the police associations with little to no collaboration with community groups.''

The 40-year-old former Ontario legislator has lacked a voice in Parliament since becoming party leader in the fall of 2017. Now he finally has his chance in Burnaby South as voters in the riding cast their ballots on Monday after a six-week race.

READ MORE: NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, fellow B.C. byelection candidates face fiery debate

The Liberals got off to a rocky start when their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh’s ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Singh said he’s not taking anything for granted but he’s confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off.

“I think people are very disappointed with what’s going on with the Liberal government,” he said.

“Canadians expect our government works in our interest. It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation.”

WATCH: NDP leader Jagmeet Singh makes statement on SNC Lavalin controversy

Trudeau has denied he or his office directed Wilson-Raybould on the matter. Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, recently said Trudeau repeatedly assured Wilson-Raybould a decision on the prosecution was hers alone to make.

Richard T. Lee, the Liberal candidate who replaced Wang in Burnaby South, said few people are raising the issue on the doorstep.

“I understand some people are concerned about that, but the office of the prime minister and the prime minister himself have made a statement already,” he said.

Byelections typically have low turnouts, but there is evidence the results of them are driven by the popularity of the government and its leader, said Richard Johnston, a University of British Columbia political science professor.

“(Singh) may have been handed the gift of some voters as a result of all this,” he said. “Although it’s just one thing amongst many, boy, he could use a win right now.”

READ MORE: NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh faces potentially career-defining byelection

Singh has faced criticism for poor fundraising and low poll numbers. Burnaby South occupies historically strong NDP territory, so if Singh can’t win in the riding, it adds to the interpretation that he hasn’t secured the support of party loyalists, said Johnston.

The NDP beat the Liberals by just over 500 votes in the riding in 2015, but Johnston said he never expected the Liberals to do as well this time in Burnaby South.

“That was kind of a high point and their support might drop even further,” he said.

Lee said local issues, especially affordable housing, are more important to Burnaby South voters than the situation in Ottawa.

He has touted the Liberal government’s national housing strategy, which promises $40 billion over 10 years, while Conservative candidate Jay Shin has called for lower taxes and job-creation measures to help residents earn and save more money.

WATCH: NDP leader Jagmeet Singh on his parties housing plan

Singh has unveiled a plan to build 500,000 affordable homes across Canada. He challenged Trudeau to eliminate the GST for developers building affordable homes, subsidize low-income renters and double the first-time homebuyers’ tax credit.

Byelections will also take place in York-Simcoe in Ontario and Outremont in Montreal on Monday. The results might provide insight into whether Quebec MP Maxime Bernier’s new right-wing People’s Party of Canada can snatch votes from the Conservatives.

A recent debate in Burnaby South became heated when People’s Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson discussed immigration.

An online video of the debate shows Singh urging audience members to recognize they are all immigrants, unless they are Indigenous.

When Tyler Thompson raises the murder of Burnaby teen Marrisa Shen, in which a Syrian national has been charged, to argue for more careful vetting of refugees, an audience member yells: “That is racist! Shame on you!”

“It’s not racist to have safety,” replies Tyler Thompson.

Shin, the Conservative candidate, recently distributed flyers taking aim at Tyler Thompson, accusing her of supporting supervised injection sites and the legalization of marijuana, which she described as a “smear campaign” based on “Lies.”

However, Shin said he isn’t worried about Tyler Thompson and doesn’t think her message is resonating.

“`When I speak with voters at the doors, I don’t get a sense of that at all,” he said.

Tyler Thompson, a former Christian TV show host who opposes abortion and has protested teaching resources that educate kids about gay and transgender identities, said she believes the Conservatives are threatened by the People’s Party.

“My message is resonating with Canadians because they like my strong stance for family.”

BURNABY, B.C. -- The stakes are high for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh in a Metro Vancouver byelection race, but an expert says recent Liberal turmoil has been a ""gift"" to his campaign.

""I want to highlight something I said at caucus this morning. I apologized to Jody Wilson-Raybould because I wasn’t quick enough to condemn in unequivocal terms the comments and commentary and cartoons made about her last week. They were absolutely unacceptable and I should have done it sooner,"" Trudeau said on his way to question period on Wednesday.

This comes after Wilson-Raybould attended the national caucus meeting Wednesday morning alongside more than 170 of her Liberal MP peers, and after her request to speak to the federal cabinet on Tuesday was granted.

It remains unknown what was discussed in either of those closed-door sessions, but there has been considerable development on the parliamentary side of the scandal since then. The House Justice Committee has agreed to hear her testimony, something Trudeau said Wednesday that he welcomes. Some Liberal MPs emerging from the caucus meeting spoke positively of the conversation inside, without offering specifics.

The Liberals have faced considerable backlash from Indigenous leaders and women in Canada over the way Trudeau and those with ties to the Liberal Party were speaking about Wilson-Raybould in the days after the scandal broke and how her shuffling out of the justice minister role was handled, with some calling it ""gendered.""

Citing stories that emerged over the weekend that quoted unnamed government sources about Wilson-Raybould being ""difficult to get along with,"" the Union of B.C.

MONTREAL -- Julia Sanchez, the NDP's candidate in Monday's Outremont byelection, says people in the riding talk to her about climate change, wealth inequality -- and sometimes what the leader of her party wears on his head.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is Sikh and wears a turban, making him conspicuously religious in front of a heavily secular province. His French is also weaker than the two previous party leaders, complicating the job of appealing to Quebec voters.

Even in multicultural Outremont, located in the geographic centre of the island of Montreal with one of the largest ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in North America, Singh's religious clothing is on some voters' minds.

""Some people are concerned about (the turban),"" Sanchez said during a recent interview following a candidate debate in the riding. She said when she knocks on doors, ""It's definitely not the main thing people bring up .... It does come up.""

Kathryn Furlong, 43, who attended the debate, said she voted for Sanchez, an economist with experience in humanitarian work and climate activism, at an advance poll. She has voted Liberal in the past ""but never by conviction. Sometimes to keep the out the Conservatives.""

She said ""it's a sad notion and a sad question,"" referring to anyone who would have an issue with the NDP leader's expression of faith. ""And I think political parties in Quebec try to exploit that issue.""

Outremont has been represented by the NDP since former party leader Tom Mulcair won a 2007 federal byelection in what had long been a Liberal stronghold. Through the rise and fall of NDP popularity in Quebec, voters elected Mulcair another three times.

Mulcair stepped down last August and is now a visiting professor at Universite de Montreal and a political commentator. The NDP is currently polling fourth in Quebec, far from its highs when Jack Layton helped the party win the majority of the province's seats in 2011.

McGill University philosopher Charles Taylor, a longtime NDP supporter who campaigned with Sanchez ahead of the byelection, said the cool reception Singh has so far received in Quebec is due to the fact he doesn't yet have a seat in Parliament. Singh is his party's candidate in one of the other two byelections Monday, in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

Once he gets inside the House of Commons and is regularly in front of the cameras, Taylor predicted, ""Quebecers will learn to like him. He's very engaging, but he's just not on television all the time.""

The Coalition Avenir Quebec won last fall's provincial election with a promise to prohibit some public servants, including teachers, from wearing religious symbols on the job. But Taylor said Singh is ""going to make a case for: 'You can wear this kind of thing and be a perfectly reasonable person.' And that's something that Quebecers are able to listen to.""

While an NDP loss Monday would further hurt the party in the province, Justin Trudeau's Liberals arguably have more at stake.

The party has 39 seats in Quebec leading into Monday's vote and 179 nationally. Polling indicates Liberal support has declined across the country since the 2015 vote, and Trudeau is looking to pick up seats in Quebec to maintain his party's majority in next fall's general election.

Outremont -- where 36 per cent of residents are immigrants and 66 per cent are bilingual -- is the kind of riding the Liberals must connect with in order to maintain their success in Quebec.

Rachel Bendayan, a lawyer and former political aide, finished second to Mulcair in 2015. Her party has consistently led polls in the province since the last election. But in recent weeks it has been embroiled in controversy over allegations that the Prime Minister's Office improperly pressured former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to help engineering giant SNC-Lavalin escape criminal prosecution.

The Montreal-based company is charged with bribery and fraud over its dealings in Libya, and it has said a conviction could lead to job losses and make it vulnerable to foreign takeover.

Bendayan said it is journalists, not the people she meets when knocking on doors in the riding, who are asking about SNC-Lavalin. ""No, people are not raising it,"" she said in a recent interview recently at her campaign office. ""People here are concerned with issues that affect their day-to-day lives. You'd be surprised how many people talk to me about the ice on the sidewalks.""

Tom Boushel, 72, a Liberal volunteer who will be driving seniors to vote on Monday, said he doesn't think the SNC-Lavalin issue will have as much of an impact in Quebec as elsewhere. ""Quebecers are sensitive to the risk of job losses,"" Boushel said, adding that Montrealers appreciate the prestige of having a global firm headquartered in their city.

Boushel said ""every elected official of every party ... every government has to fight to keep SNC going. I think in Quebec, I think they understand a little better.""

The byelection is the first test for the Bloc Quebecois under its new leader, Yves-Francois Blanchet, who was acclaimed in January. The Bloc is hoping its candidate, author Michel Duchesne, will help the party become competitive once again in the riding.

However, it’s not yet clear how much Wilson-Raybould will be able to reveal. Earlier Tuesday, she said she was still consulting with her lawyer about whether she will be able to speak if called to testify.

The committee will also hear from Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, current Justice Minister David Lametti, and deputy justice minister Nathalie Drouin.

NDP committee member and justice critic Murray Rankin said the invitation falls short of being able to shine a more complete light in the matter. He noted the motion did not spell out what Wilson-Raybould can say or whether anyone from the Prime Minister’s Office will be able to speak.

No date has been set for Wilson-Raybould to speak.

The news comes as the Conservatives attempt to launch an investigation in the Senate legal affairs committee, with Senator Larry Smith, the Leader of the Conservatives in the Senate, giving notice of a motion to call Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself as well as the nine witnesses the opposition originally sought to call before the House of Commons justice committee last week.

News of that motion came as Conservatives tried to persuade Liberal members of the House justice committee to expand the list of witnesses they are willing to call as well as to open up the closed-door meeting to reporters.

WATCH: NDP MP Murray Rankin says he’ll support Wilson-Raybould being invited to Justice Committee

At the very least, it appears there will now be at least four witnesses called by the Liberals on the House committee.

In a tweet Tuesday afternoon, Iqra Khalid, one of the members of that Liberal-dominated committee, said she has given a notice of motion to the committee to invite Wilson-Raybould, who confirmed to reporters shortly before that she remains a Liberal MP, to appear and face questions.

I have given notice of motion at the justice committee to invite the Hon. Jody Wilson-Raybould to appear before the committee. — Iqra Khalid (@iamIqraKhalid) February 19, 2019

Khalid is one of the members who last week refused to commit to calling Wilson-Raybould when the Liberals blocked an opposition motion to call nine key political and bureaucratic figures to answer questions on the case.

While other Liberal members of the committee have not indicated if they will support the motion, Government House Leader Bardish Chagger acknowledged it during question period.

“I understand that a Liberal member will be putting forward a motion today at committee to have the access that members are asking for,” she said.

However, Wilson-Raybould would not say whether she will be able to speak if called.

“I’m still working with my lawyer,” she told reporters when asked about the solicitor-client privilege she has suggested is barring her from talking, before being asked if she remains in the party caucus.

“I am a Liberal member of Parliament.”

Trudeau told reporters afterwards that she had asked to meet with cabinet members but would not say what they discussed.

During question period, Wilson-Raybould could be seen again sitting in her seat in the front row of the government benches.

She did not answer any of the questions on the matter posed by the opposition.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet after Trudeau called the allegations of political interference “false” and suggested her continued presence in cabinet was an indication there was nothing to the reports.

She retained a former Supreme Court justice as her counsel to determine what, if anything, she can say.

The Liberals are facing a hammering from the opposition over unanswered questions in the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Both a meeting of the House of Commons justice committee to discuss potential witnesses for a probe of the matter, as well as an NDP motion calling for Trudeau to waive solicitor-client privilege and demanding a judicial inquiry are dominating the political agenda as MPs return from a week in their constituencies.

But as they do so, the government is missing a prominent figure following the Monday resignation of Gerald Butts, principal secretary to Trudeau.

WATCH BELOW: Trudeau heckled while addressing resignation of Gerald Butts amid SNC-Lavalin affair

Trudeau addressed the resignation in question period on Tuesday as well.

“He made the decision to step down, to step away, because the work this government is doing and indeed the confidence Canadians must have in their institutions … comes before all else,” Trudeau said.

Many Liberals including Treasury Board President Jane Philpott — a friend of Wilson-Raybould’s — were tight-lipped about his sudden resignation as they headed into a cabinet meeting Tuesday morning.

Others, including Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, called the news “sad” but vowed things will continue as before.

“It’s obviously a sad moment for me and Gerry’s many friends, and people who really admire the tremendous work he’s done for Canada,” she told reporters in a scrum.

“Having said that, our work goes on, as Gerry said in his own letter.”

Carolyn Bennett, the Minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, also told reporters Butts resignation was unfortunate but said she has “total confidence in the prime minister.”

‘I think it’s sad whenever a team gets broken up but we will put one foot in front of the other and get the job done for Canadians,” she said.

Indigenous leaders have criticized Trudeau for the government’s handling of the allegations and unnamed officials who criticized her work to media.

The Union of BC Indian Chiefs called comments suggesting Wilson-Raybould was difficult to work with and self-centred both “sexist” and “racist.”

Bill Wilson, a Kwakwaka’wakw hereditary chief and Wilson-Raybould’s father, told Global News it was “a bloody insult to her and Indians across the country” that she was moved from the high-profile portfolio of Attorney General to Minister of Veterans Affairs, shortly after the political interference is alleged to have taken place.

“She upholds integrity and dignity and the rule of law and she gets kicked in the teeth and moved down to veteran affairs. As important as that is, the reality is that it’s near the armpit of the cabinet,” he said.

Butts, one of Trudeau’s closest advisers and a friend since the two were students at McGill University, issued a statement on Monday saying he denies the allegations contained in a bombshell Globe and Mail report two weeks ago of attempts from within the Prime Minister’s Office to pressure Wilson-Raybould into intervening in the criminal case of SNC-Lavalin to help the firm avoid a trial.

He said the allegations were distracting from the “vital work” being done and that his resignation was in the best interests of the government.

WATCH BELOW: Liberal House Leader says Butts stated his decision on resignation

Butts is one of nine witnesses opposition members of the House of Commons justice committee tried to call on last week to answer questions about the allegations, including Wilson-Raybould herself.

Liberal members of that committee blocked attempts by the Conservatives and NDP to call either of them, instead limiting the immediate witness list to three and refusing to commit to calling either Butts or Wilson-Raybould at a further meeting to be held Tuesday afternoon behind closed doors.

Also on Tuesday, MPs will debate a motion from the NDP in the House of Commons that calls on Trudeau to waive solicitor-client privilege and launch a public inquiry into the allegations of political interference.

WATCH BELOW: SNC-Lavalin controversy corroding Trudeau’s credibility, he sounds ‘guilty’: NDP

Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion is already investigating but the Liberals have so far rebuffed calls from the opposition to allow for broader study of the matter through an inquiry or through the extensive witness list proposed at the justice committee last week.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said on Tuesday his party will unanimously support the NDP motion, which will still not bring it enough votes to pass given the Liberals hold a majority of seats in the House of Commons.

He also warned the resignation of Butts will not calm calls for answers.

“We cannot claim to be a country under the rule of law when political agendas can dictate the course of justice,” he said, noting Trudeau has “yet to credibly refute” the allegations.

“He’s blaming everyone from the personnel of his own office to Scott Brison, including the former attorney general herself, for the situation he finds himself in. That is not how a prime minister should act. If he thinks the resignation of his closest adviser will solve the situation, he is mistaken.”

The closed-door justice committee meeting is scheduled for 3:30 PM ET.

In its 700-page report, the energy regulator said the expansion of the crude oil pipeline would be in the public interest by creating a diverse market for Western Canadian oil producers; spurring job creation and economic development for local and Indigenous communities, and enhancing revenues for governments. While the benefits would be largely national and regional in scope, the environmental risks will largely be borne by local communities, including First Nations, the board noted.

The federal government will continue its consultations with First Nations to determine what precise concerns affected communities have about the project, and how their views can be accommodated. Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Ottawa will aim to conclude its consultations and make a decision by June.

Despite negative impacts, “the NEB recommends that the government of Canada finds that they can be justified in the circumstances in light of the considerable benefits of the projects and measures to mitigate the effects,” the board’s chief environment officer, Robert Steedman, told a Friday news conference in Calgary. The board set out 156 conditions the pipeline proponent – now the federal government – would have to meet, while making 16 recommendations to Ottawa for measures that would limit the impact of increased ship traffic in the Salish Sea and help restore the already-polluted, heavily travelled waterway.

The pipeline expansion plan has provoked inter-provincial feuding, oil-industry rage and fears among activists and some First Nations communities over threats to the environment and marine species. The government of Alberta and the oil industry maintain the Trans Mountain project is a crucial economic lifeline to expand crude exports and relieve the frequent price pressure on Western Canadian crude that results from insufficient pipeline capacity. Environmental activists decried the NEB’s conclusion, saying it is clear the pipeline will cause further damage to the orcas in the Salish Sea and would increase greenhouse gas emissions from the oil industry.

Ottawa’s 2016 approval of the pipeline expansion was quashed last August when a Federal Court of Appeal judge found the government’s First Nations consultations had been inadequate and that the NEB did not properly consider the impacts of increased marine traffic.

However, the project was in trouble even before the court decision. Faced with opposition from the government of British Columbia, Indigenous leaders, and environmental groups, former owner Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd., announced last April that it was halting construction.

In late May, the Liberal government announced it would purchase the existing Trans Mountain pipeline and terminal for $4.5-billion and finance the expansion project until it could eliminate much of the political and legal risk and resell it to the private sector. Some First Nations leaders in Alberta and B.C. have expressed an interest in purchasing a stake in the pipeline project, a notion the Liberal government supports.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said the NEB’s revised conditions and additional recommendations were sound, though she cautioned that Friday’s report isn’t the end of the process. Specifically, she acknowledged that the project could still face more court challenges and protests.

“Many obstacles have been put in our way, and quite clearly we are not done yet,” she told reporters in Calgary.

Ms. Notley said that once the federal cabinet makes its decision, which she expects before the federal election, construction would likely resume very quickly. In the meantime, she said she’ll be pressing the federal government to ensure consultations with First Nations are adequate so a new federal approval won’t be derailed by another court challenge.

British Columbia’s Environment Minister, George Heyman, said he was disappointed at the NEB’s ruling. “They found there would be significant impacts on southern resident killer whales, [and] that there would be a catastrophic impact if there was a spill,"" he said. ""And they reached the conclusion, astoundingly, that no new conditions were needed.” He vowed B.C. will continue with legal reference case that will test the constitutional limits of the province’s authority to restrict the flow of oil crossing its borders.

Indigenous leaders opposed to the pipeline project said Friday the board’s report does nothing to allay their concerns about risks to the salmon and killer whales. And they vow to pursue further legal challenges if Ottawa approves it again.

“We have a reciprocal and loving and spiritual relationship with the lands and the water and the things on it like the salmon and the whales,” said Rueben George, of the Tsleil Waututh First Nation, which was part of the legal challenge that quashed the first permit. “We’ll do whatever it takes to protect the things that we love, because no price can be put on the sacred.”

111,Empty,2019-02-20T16:18:00Z,Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday faced legislators from his Liberal Party for the first time since two high-profile resignations over ethics allegations rocked his government.,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday calmed restless legislators at a meeting to discuss two resignations that rocked his Liberal government, but side-stepped questions about how he planned to handle the crisis, party sources said.

Liberals say they are concerned about how Trudeau’s team is dealing with the fallout of a newspaper report that officials from his office put pressure on then justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure construction firm SNC-Lavalin avoided a corruption and bribery trial.

Trudeau insists there was no wrongdoing. But Wilson-Raybould, demoted in a January reshuffle, quit on Feb. 12 and then Trudeau’s principal private secretary and close ally Gerald Butts resigned on Monday.

Liberals fret that the constant media focus on the matter could help knock the government off course ahead of a federal election in October.

Polls suggest the Liberals, once well ahead of their rivals, are now at risk of losing outright, or being reduced a minority government relying on other parties to survive. Minority administrations in Canada rarely last more than two years.

Liberal members of parliament, including Wilson-Raybould, met for almost three hours on Wednesday and had what participants called a useful session to clear the air.

“I’m very satisfied with the overall meeting we had,” said International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau.

Trudeau’s office declined to give details of what had happened in the meeting.

One Liberal described the tone as polite and said “there were no naked raw emotions on the table”, even when Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould spoke.

But the Liberal, who asked for anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, said Trudeau side-stepped questions about why exactly Butts quit and did not give a detailed idea of what the government planned to do next.

“We need to put this to bed. It’s exhausting to be on the defensive and the longer this goes on the harder, it will be to get our message out,” said a second Liberal.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, asked about the chances of the government losing its focus, said “we are working very hard to ensure that doesn’t happen.”

Trudeau is in no immediate danger, since Canadian political leaders are elected by party members at formal conventions and cannot be sacked after a snap vote by parliamentarians, as is the case in Britain and Australia.

A third Liberal said no one in the senior ranks of the party was talking about a leadership challenge, much less trying to arrange one.

Some Liberals complain about what they see as the excessive concentration of power in Trudeau’s office, in particular the leading roles played by Butts and Chief of Staff Katie Telford.

Others say Trudeau’s inner circle pays little attention to the concerns of back-bench legislators and have sidelined more experienced advisors.

The potential political risks for Trudeau are clear. A Leger poll for the Canadian Press on who would make the best prime minister showed just 26 percent chose Trudeau, down seven percentage points from November 2018.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer received 21 per cent support, down one point.

In another sign of unease, two Liberal legislators from Atlantic Canada - a part of the country where the party is expecting to lose seats in October - announced unexpectedly in the past week they are not running again.

Trudeau played down opposition demands for a full public inquiry into the matter, noting that the independent ethics commissioner has launched a probe. The House of Commons justice committee on Tuesday invited Wilson-Raybould to speak.

112,Empty,2019-02-21T19:26:47Z,A newly-proposed bill could become the first legislation to ensure individuals and independent shops can repair brand-name devices in North America.,"Image: Shutterstock

Canada is the newest frontier in the fight for the “right to repair” after an Ontario politician introduced a bill on Thursday that would ensure individuals and independent professionals can repair brand-name computers and phones cheaply and easily.

Manufacturers make it incredibly difficult to repair our broken devices ourselves. Instead of taking a smashed phone to a local repair professional for an affordable fix, a complex matrix of trade secrets and government intervention often means consumers have to make a pricey trip to the Genius Bar or buy a new device entirely. This is bad for your wallet, but also bad for the planet.

Ontario Liberal Party MPP Michael Coteau ran into this issue head-first after his daughter dropped his Samsung smartphone. An official repair job from the manufacturer was more expensive than just getting a new phone from his carrier, he told me over the phone.

“It’s a shame,” Coteau said, “because the Samsung S8 was very good for me. Everything was perfect. I would’ve kept using it. But now I’ve replaced it.”

On Thursday, Coteau introduced a private member’s bill in provincial parliament that, if passed, would be the first “right to repair” law for electronic devices in North America. More than a dozen US states are currently considering similar bills, but nothing is on the books yet in the US or in Canada.

The legislation proposes that tech companies make diagnostic tools, repair manuals, and official parts available to consumers at their request. The legislation would also require that any new products ship with a repair manual. Documents provided to consumers must be free unless they request paper copies, and parts, tools, and software must be provided at a fair price.

“The intention of the legislation is to force a company like Apple to ensure the parts they create for their phones and tablets are available to be purchased,” Coteau said, adding that the legislative process would look for ways to ensure companies’ copyright and intellectual property is respected.

If the bill becomes law, US-based companies like Apple will be forced to change how they operate to sell their wares in Canada’s most populous province. This could lead to a ripple effect not just across Canada, but across the US and potentially the world.

“If Ontario decided, 'We're going to pass the right to repair legislation,' that could actually pass right to repair for the world, because manufacturers aren't going to provide products differently to people in one jurisdiction,” Kyle Wiens, who runs DIY repair site iFixit, told the CBC last year.

The Ontario Liberal Party was decimated in the last provincial election, losing so many seats that it no longer has party status. This likely will make pushing a bill through difficult, especially with a conservative government in power. But Coteau said he believes the fight for the right to repair extends beyond party lines, and the bill is “flexible” and open to amendments.

“This is about making sure technology stays in the hands of the people, and it’s about making sure people have access to a fair and equitable approach to their products when it comes to their repair,” he said.

According to Thompson, the populist party has mobilized the socially conservative Chinese-Canadian vote.","BURNABY—When Ivan Pak went to Maxime Bernier’s first rally in Vancouver last November, he says he was “inspired” by the new party leader’s clear platform and policy commitments. That’s the kind of leader Canada needs, he told Star Vancouver.

Maxime Bernier, leader of the new People’s Party of Canada, meets supporters on Thursday at an event prior to Monday’s federal byelection in Burnaby, B.C. ( Jesse Winter / Star Metro )

Bernier announced the “death of political correctness” via a Tweet last fall to his then 65,000 followers and launched the People’s Party of Canada, which has been gaining rapid traction. Widely viewed as aiming further right of the Conservative party, the PPC has been criticized for being anti-immigrant and espousing anti-globalist values and rhetoric. But Pak, a first-generation immigrant from China, dispels those critiques as myths. “Some people accuse the PPC of being a white people’s party of Canada, but for myself ... I learned to speak English here. I’ve been here 22 years,” he said on Thursday, holding up PPC signs waiting for Bernier to make his first appearance in Burnaby South since Monday’s byelection was called in the riding.

“PPC welcomes people like me to be part of their party as long as we share the same Canadian values.” But experts say core Canadian values are now divided and there’s very little common ground. Michael Valpy is a senior fellow in public policy at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy and a former Globe and Mail journalist who has been tracking the rise of ordered populism in Canada — or what economists refer to as “drawbridge-up” thinking.

Nathaniel Allen, who supports the People's Party of Canada, drove from Mission, B.C., to attend a campaign event in Burnaby on Thursday. Allen, a former member of the BC Liberals, says he was disillusioned with politics for years until Maxime Bernier's party came along. ( Jesse Winter / Star Vancouver )

Its proponents are often hostile toward immigration, deeply pessimistic about their economic future, mostly male and mainly white, he said. At Bernier’s event on Thursday in Burnaby South, this demographic was also present. Nathaniel Allen, 30, told the Star he was a BC Liberal — the provincial party widely known to embrace conservative policies — 12 years ago until he lost interest. It wasn’t until the PPC came along that he found himself civically engaged.

“It just felt like the most pragmatic decision I could make,” he explained. Read more:

How Canadian populism is playing out in the Burnaby South byelection Burnaby South People’s Party of Canada candidate alleges Conservative Party is ‘smearing’ her Liberal candidate’s WeChat post draws criticism for singling out race of byelection opponent Jagmeet Singh A Star investigation found that far-right supporters have called on their members to infiltrate the PPC, whether the party is willing or not. As the extreme right has done elsewhere, they hope to move on a new party, bit by bit, to bring the political extreme toward the mainstream. Meanwhile, the yellow vest faction — which started as a labour movement in France but has expanded in Canada beyond economic concerns, delving into anti-globalism, nationalism, anti-government sentiment and xenophobia — looks like it’s here to stay. Bernier was there to greet the United We Roll convoy when it arrived in Ottawa last Tuesday. The former federal Conservative cabinet minister, standing beside a man in a yellow vest, told the crowd he was there to promote Canadian unity. Canadians are increasingly opposed to more immigration — and it remains to be seen how that will play out in October’s federal election, Valpy said. Anti-immigrant sentiments often depend on the makeup of neighbourhoods, he added, pointing to the suburban area surrounding Toronto, known as the 905 because of its area code, which is “quite strongly” anti-immigrant despite not being a white majority community. That’s because if communities are homogenous — for instance, predominantly white, brown or Asian — anti-immigrant views can emerge. However, Valpy said, if neighbourhoods are mixed, anti-immigrant views are unlikely. “Ethnic attachment is declining and has declined quite rapidly,” he explained in an interview, citing data from Ottawa-based pollster EKOS Research Associates. “It’s no longer important to us that all our friends are all white, or we live in a brown community.” Valpy said unless there is some shift in inequality or people’s sense that progress is lost, ordered populism is here for the long haul. According to Ivan Pak and the PPC, the principles guiding Canadian values are freedom, personal responsibility, respect and fairness. Pak was a vocal opponent of the provincial education inclusion program for sexual identity and gender fluidity. He ran unsuccessfully on that platform for school trustee in Richmond in last fall’s municipal election. As president of the PPC Richmond Centre EDA, he isn’t eligible to vote in Monday’s byelection. The PPC has promised to lower taxes, abolish corporate welfare and stop supply management. On Thursday, Bernier also said he would privatize Canada Post and abolish the CRTC. The party has formed electoral district associations in all of Canada’s 338 ridings and Bernier has said he will run a full slate of candidates in October’s general election.

Pak said he was no longer keen on the Conservatives because the party has a “lack of leadership ability” (referring to its leader, Andrew Scheer) and “no clean platform.” He also slammed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “When you ask a question in the House of Commons, he never answers it. Is the question period just a joke? It looks like drama,” he said. “Our country is in debt and that debt has to be paid somehow. It will be my children and grandchildren suffering.” Pak was one of many other Chinese-Canadians greeting Bernier when he visited his Burnaby South byelection candidate — and one of his first picks under the new PPC banner — Laura-Lynn Thompson. She is a former Christian radio host, anti-abortion activist and a vocal opponent of B.C.’s student education plan on sexual orientation and gender fluidity, with ties to several community churches. Thompson told the Star last week she’s been able to mobilize the socially conservative Chinese-Canadian vote — and those ties may explain why. During each byelection debate, Thompson directly appealed to prevalent anxieties in the riding about public safety as she repeatedly brought up the case of Marrisa Shen, a 13-year-old girl killed in a Burnaby South park in July 2017. A Syrian refugee has been charged with murder in her death.

Meanwhile, several PPC supporters at the event on Thursday told the Star they were “sick” of identity politics at play in Canada. Sherolinnah Eang said she became a full-fledged PPC supporter after hearing the messaging about “family values and free speech.” “This is the first time I’ve come out for something like this, and I’ve lived in Canada for 45 years,” she said. Burnaby has four distinct town “centres,” a long working-class history and a population density triple that of the region. Its demographics are increasingly young and non-white, according to the 2016 census, and the average age is several years below B.C.’s average, while 64 per cent of its population identifies as a visible minority. On Thursday, Bernier argued diversity is not Canada’s strength — it’s unity. Asked how that message would land in such an ethnically diverse riding, he responded: “Yes, but they are Canadians first.” The response prompted cheers from PPC supporters, with several shouting: “I’m an immigrant.” Thompson, who uttered “Canadians first” at every byelection debate, will face off against federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh — vying for his first seat in the House of Commons — Liberal Richard Lee, Conservative Jay Shin and independents Valentine Wu and Terry Grimwood on Monday in Burnaby South.

Why We Make Bad Political Decisions and How We Can Make Better Ones, and a post-doctoral fellow in the University of Ottawa’s communications department, told the Star that while feelings of anti-globalism and xenophobia have always existed, they haven’t always had an electoral home. Moscrop said this is the perfect time for the PPC to do well because it can focus on locking down a smaller segment of the electorate. And there’s enough disaffection, which could express itself as support for the right-wing party. “This party didn’t even exist 15 minutes ago, so if (Laura-Lynn Thompson) can nab even 10 per cent, Bernier will be crowing for months,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there are more likely PPC voters than would self-report ... because sometimes people won’t admit something to a pollster.

In a statement announcing his departure, Gerald Butts, who has been a close friend of Mr. Trudeau’s since their university days, linked his leaving to the allegations that he, the prime minister and others improperly pressured Jody Wilson-Raybould, when she was the justice minister and attorney general, to quash the criminal prosecution of a major Canadian engineering and construction company.

Mr. Butts repeatedly denied in his resignation letter that any such action took place.

“Any accusation that I or the staff put pressure on the attorney general is simply not true,” Mr. Butts wrote. “But the fact is that this accusation exists. It cannot and should not take one moment away from the vital work the prime minister and his office is doing for all Canadians.”

He added: “It is in the best interests of the office and its important work for me to step away.”

His resignation came a week after Ms. Wilson-Raybould resigned from the Trudeau cabinet. In January, she had been moved from the post of justice minister to minister of veteran’s affairs, a switch widely seen as a demotion.",Justin Trudeau’s Political Crisis Widens as Top Aide and Friend Resigns,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/world/canada/justin-trudeau-gerald-butts-resignation.html

But he was particularly outspoken on one public forum: Twitter.","Key aides to a prime minister generally prefer to stay in the shadows, perhaps providing background information to Parliament Hill journalists, but rarely giving interviews or generating much of a public persona.

In some ways, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's former principal secretary Gerald Butts carried on that tradition, rarely quoted, speaking to journalists only on background.

But he was particularly outspoken on the social media site Twitter.

Butts, who resigned Monday in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin affair, garnered a reputation of being a prolific tweeter, never shy to express his opinions, or ""personal views"" as he referred to them.

He would promote and champion the Liberal Party and the prime minister's policy initiatives. But he would also defend the prime minister, sometimes lash out at critics, take partisan swipes at the Conservatives and engage in Twitter spats with politicians and journalists.

Even before Trudeau became prime minister in 2015, Butts was a presence on Twitter. In that year's election campaign, Butts went after one of his favourite targets, news media company Postmedia, over their articles about Trudeau's insistence that all new Liberal candidates must be pro-choice on abortion.

And just before the election.

Postmedia has done to Canadian journalism what Harper's party has done to Canadian politics. Discuss. —@gmbutts

But after Trudeau became prime minister, Butts's criticism about the media company continued: Sometimes in a more cheeky manner:

Your country is red.<br>Postmedia is blue.<br>They can't figure out what happened. <br>So they blame you.<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoliValentines?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#cdnpoliValentines</a> —@gmbutts

Butts would also tangle with journalists, as he did over a Vogue photo shoot of Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire-Trudeau.

Did Mandela's wife borrow a $5,600 dress for the photo shoot? <a href=""https://t.co/lDufnQdN6t"">https://t.co/lDufnQdN6t</a> —@glen_mcgregor

He also went after the Globe and Mail in 2016 over an editorial about questions surrounding the birthplace of Liberal cabinet minister Maryam Monsef, comparing the article to the birther movement that falsely claimed former U.S. president Barack Obama was not born in the U.S.

The Globe and Mail endorses a homegrown Canadian birther movement. Breathtaking. <a href=""https://t.co/ljKsSyoBtP"">https://t.co/ljKsSyoBtP</a> —@gmbutts

Butts would also tangle with politicians. Conservative MP Erin O'Toole was a regular opponent.

Butts would also get involved in Twitter skirmishes with policy analysts. In February 2016, he debated with experts over the Liberals' ant-ISIS plan.

Twitter was also a tool to launch defences of his boss. He slammed critics who ridiculed Trudeau for using the term peoplekind instead of mankind during a town hall in Edmonton.

Although Trudeau later brushed it off as a ""dumb joke,"" Butts would take a step further, suggesting those who were so offended by the term were alt-right Nazi sympathizers.

The lesson to take from this joke being torqued by Infowars and other alt-right nazi friends of the Rebel is they're paying attention.

Butts regularly employed the alt-right characterization, and he used it again to label those he felt were prejudiced against asylum seekers.

116,Empty,2019-02-22T18:34:42Z,"Premier insists the Progressive Conservatives are not charging for access after the Star revealed that lobbyists have been enlisted to sell $1,250 tickets to a party fundraiser next week.","Speaking to reporters in Washington after the Star revealed consultants are peddling tickets to the PC leader’s dinner, Ford defended his party.

Premier Doug Ford insists lobbyists have no influence on him — even though they are selling $1,250 tickets for his Progressive Conservative fundraiser next week.

But Ford emphasized Friday that lobbyists have no sway in his administration, whether they sell Tory tickets or not.

“We’ve put fundraisers together that are $25 spaghetti dinners as you know, so we have the freebies, we have the $25 fundraisers, and then we have the big fundraiser,” the premier said of the Toronto Congress Centre event Wednesday that should clear $2 million for the governing party.

“I can tell you one thing: no one can influence Doug Ford, no one can influence my ministers or my caucus,” he said.

As first disclosed by the Star on Thursday, the Tories asked lobbyists for help due to the tightened rules around political fundraising introduced in 2016 by the previous Liberal government — including a ban on corporate and union donations — that make it challenging to sell tickets.

“So they can come, they can support us, it’s no different. Lobbyists are here, the lobbyists are in Canada, they want to get their point through, good luck to them. But we’re going to do the right thing for the people.”

Companies could once purchase entire tables for such dinners and then give the tickets to employees, associates or clients. Now, each ticket must be paid for by an individual.

In an email appeal to clients obtained by the Star, Chris Benedetti, a principal at Sussex Strategy Group, a prominent firm run by Conservative and Liberal lobbyists, said the company “has been asked to help with the event.”

“The event is $12,500 for a table of 10 ($1,250/person). To reserve a table please let us know and we can assist you in assembling individual registrations to then be sent in as a package,” he wrote.

Benedetti, who is registered to lobby for 60 different companies at Queen’s Park, said he was contacted by the PC Ontario Fund last month.

“I have not spoken to anyone in the premier’s office about this event, and no one in the office or any other government office has been in touch with me to encourage sales or otherwise,” he said.

Another lobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was “tremendous pressure” put on his firm to sell tickets.

“You’re really made to feel that you’re not pulling your weight if you don’t sell a table or two,” he said.

NDP MPP Taras Natyshak (Essex) said “Doug Ford’s threat-based racket looks like cash-for-access on steroids.”

“This scheme is laced with threats about who will be allowed into Doug Ford’s back rooms, and who will be locked out,” said Natyshak.

“People were clear that they wanted to get rid of cash-for-access schemes when they got rid of Kathleen Wynne and the Liberals. But Doug Ford is making things much worse for them,” he said.

Green Leader Mike Schreiner noted that “when big money gets its hands on our politics, it eats away at democracy.”

“I will not stand quietly by while money, power and influence flow freely between government and lobbyists,” said Schreiner, who considering asking Elections Ontario’s chief electoral officer Greg Essensa to look into the allegations.

“Last year, the premier quietly raised donation limits and ushered in the return of cash-for-access events, burying these rule changes in the fall economic statement and now we have allegations the PC party is pressuring lobbyists to sell fundraising tickets at the risk of losing the ear of cabinet,” he said.

Marcus Mattinson, the PC party’s director of communications, said “dozens of individuals have been assisting the party with fundraising for decades, and this event is no exception.”

Last fall, the Tories quietly opened a loophole in the electoral finance reform bill by repealing a section that forced donors to “certify, in a form approved by the chief electoral officer, that the person has not acted contrary” to the ban on unions or corporations making donations in the name of members or employees.

The change means that a company or union could theoretically make a political contribution in someone else’s name.

But the government said it only made the amendment because the disclosure form was a nuisance to contributors.

Ford noted Friday that his government’s rules “match” the federal campaign finance laws.

The previous Liberal government was forced to reform the law after a Star investigation three years ago.

In a bombshell departure ahead of an election this year, Gerald Butts resigned as Trudeau’s principal secretary on Monday, a holiday in much of the country. The move follows allegations the prime minister’s office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to end a legal case facing the Montreal-based firm. Butts denies he did so.

His decision to step away underscores the weight of the controversy facing Trudeau’s government, which cast itself as progressive and a champion of women, only to face allegations it tried to arm twist one of its most prominent female cabinet ministers to help SNC-Lavalin. Wilson-Raybould quit cabinet last week.

“Any accusation that I or the staff put pressure on the Attorney General is simply not true,” Butts, 47, wrote in his resignation, which was tweeted by Trudeau. “My reputation is my responsibility and that is for me to defend. It is in the best interests of the office and its important work for me to step away.”

Butts is a longtime staffer, college friend and one-time groomsman to Trudeau -- and preeminent among a small inner circle the Canadian leader keeps. Butts and Chief of Staff Katie Telford have been the two most powerful aides in Trudeau’s government since it took power in 2015. Butts also had an unusually public profile among the prime minister’s senior staff, which made him a lightning rod for critics of the administration. Trudeau’s Liberal Party is neck-and-neck with the opposition Conservatives heading into the October election.

Corruption Charges

The Globe and Mail newspaper reported this month the prime minister’s office pressured Wilson-Raybould into helping SNC-Lavalin. The case hinges on years-old corruption charges, which the company has been pressing to settle. The government gave itself the power to do so last year by changing the law to allow for deferred prosecution agreements, whereby the attorney general can order the country’s independent prosecution service to strike a deal to end a criminal case.

Trudeau acknowledged last week his government discussed the issue in part to avoid job losses at SNC-Lavalin, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada. He said he told Wilson-Raybould in September the final decision was hers as attorney general.

What happened between then and a January cabinet shuffle that saw Wilson-Raybould demoted to veterans affairs is unclear. Wilson-Raybould has said virtually nothing since she quit cabinet, and has hired a former supreme court judge to advise her on what she can say publicly. She’s bound by cabinet confidentiality and solicitor-client privilege.

Liberal Ghosts

It’s possibly the gravest political challenge yet for Trudeau, whose slogan of “real change” was meant to breathe new life into a Liberal Party tainted by corruption and back-room deals. But the controversy around SNC-Lavalin -- with its longstanding ties to powerful party members -- is evoking the Liberal Party of old.

“I categorically deny the accusation that I or anyone else” in Trudeau’s office pressured Wilson-Raybould, Butts said.

The country’s ethics watchdog is now investigating whether Trudeau’s office -- run jointly by Butts and Telford -- pressured Wilson-Raybould into ordering an end to SNC-Lavalin’s criminal case. Those investigations typically take months at least.

Butts, the son of a Cape Breton coal miner, was previously a senior aide in the Ontario provincial government and head of World Wildlife Fund Canada. While he helped run virtually every file in government, environmental initiatives were of particular importance. He warned of the need to fight climate change in his resignation statement. “Our kids and grandkids will judge us on one issue above all others. That issue is climate change,” he said.

Butts didn’t specify where he was going after his resignation, and it’s unclear whether he’ll contribute at all to Trudeau’s reelection campaign.

College Friend

Trudeau’s opponents were quick to pounce on the resignation. Butts’s departure is “the clearest indication yet that there is much more to the SNC-Lavalin affair than the Prime Minister has so far admitted,” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said in a statement. New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh called for a public inquiry.

Trudeau, who faces a re-election bid in October, has faced criticism since Wilson-Raybould quit his Cabinet following a Globe and Mail newspaper report this month that officials in Trudeau's office had urged her to let SNC-Lavalin escape with a fine rather than face trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

SNC-Lavalin has said it had sought to avoid a corruption trial because the executives accused of wrongdoing had left the company and it had overhauled its ethics and compliance systems.

Any accusation that ""I or the staff put pressure on the Attorney General (Wilson-Raybould) is not true,"" Butts said in the statement on Monday.

He added that the allegation was distracting from the ""vital work"" Trudeau was doing and that it was in the best interest of the Prime Minister's Office for him to step aside.

Trudeau accepted Butts' resignation and said he had served the country with ""integrity, sage advice and devotion.""

""I want to thank him for his service and continued friendship,"" Trudeau said in a post on Twitter.

Neither Butts nor chief Trudeau spokesman Cameron Ahmad was immediately available for comment.

Butts, 47, has known Trudeau for more than 25 years, going back to when they were students at McGill University in Montreal. Along with Trudeau's chief of staff, Katie Telford, Butts is widely credited with helping Trudeau's Liberals win a surprise election victory in October 2015.

DIVISIVE FIGURE

Butts was a polarizing figure inside the Liberal Party, where some dubbed him PMGB - short for Prime Minister Gerald Butts - and complained privately he had too much influence.

Wilson-Raybould has not commented on the matter, citing solicitor-client privilege. But Butts' resignation fueled an opposition demand to drop the privilege.

""It is now more important than ever before that Mr Trudeau waive solicitor-client privilege so Jody Wilson-Raybould can tell her side of the story to Canadians,"" Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said in a statement.

""The resignation of Gerald Butts, the Prime Minister’s longest serving and most-trusted aide, does not in any way settle this matter,"" added Scheer.

Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to Veteran Affairs in January, a move widely seen as a demotion for one of Canada's most prominent indigenous federal politicians.

Last week, a Canadian parliamentary committee rejected an opposition bid to question senior officials about the allegations of political interference.

""It's impossible to overstate his (Butts') commitment to Trudeau and his importance to this government and today's Liberal Party,"" said senior Liberal Scott Reid, who served as chief spokesman to former Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin from 2003 to 2006.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday said he was still puzzled by the decision of former veterans affairs minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to quit last week, even after she addressed the Cabinet on Tuesday.

Trudeau is battling allegations that his officials last year pressured Wilson-Raybould, then justice minister, to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption and bribery trial.

Trudeau insists there was no wrongdoing and said Wilson-Raybould has not made clear her reasons for leaving. In an unusual move, she was allowed to address her Cabinet colleagues on Tuesday, even though she was no longer a minister.

""I continue to be surprised by Jody Wilson-Raybould's decision ... This is not a decision that remains clear to me,"" he told a televised news conference in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.

Trudeau's version of events was backed up by Michael Wernick, the head of the federal civil service, who was present for several top-level meetings with Wilson-Raybould last year and said nothing untoward had happened.

""There was no inappropriate pressure put on the minister at any time,"" Wernick told the House of Commons justice committee on Thursday, saying Wilson-Raybould had had plenty of opportunities to complain had she felt the need to.

Wilson-Raybould, who on Wednesday said ""I hope that I have the opportunity to speak my truth"", is consulting lawyers to determine how much she is able to say. She is due to address the justice committee next week.

The Globe and Mail on Thursday said Wilson-Raybould told the Cabinet she had come under improper pressure from officials.

""How she interprets and perceives those conversations she can tell you next week. I can tell you my view very firmly is they were entirely appropriate, lawful, legal,"" said Wernick, a civil servant who is not a member of Parliament.

The issue could threaten the ruling Liberals' election chances this October. Opposition politicians have accused the Liberals of a cover-up and want a full public inquiry.

SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in the province of Quebec province, where the Liberals say they need to capture more seats in the October election to have a chance of holding on to power.

""We believe in the independence of the judiciary and we believe in fighting for good jobs,"" said Trudeau.

The prime minister on Wednesday sought to calm restless parliamentarians at a meeting to discuss the resignations of Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau aide Gerald Butts, a major architect of the Liberals' surprise victory in October 2015, who quit on Monday while insisting he had done nothing wrong.

Trudeau sidestepped questions about how he planned to handle the crisis, party sources said.

Signs of stress remain. Two Liberal legislators voted with the opposition on Wednesday in a failed bid to launch a public inquiry, while a female Liberal member of parliament tweeted her support for Wilson-Raybould, adding the hash tag #IStandWithHer.

The former minister, who the Globe and Mail said had ignored the pressure to go easy on SNC-Lavalin, was demoted from the justice ministry last month.

OTTAWA—Jody Wilson-Raybould joined her former cabinet colleagues at a meeting Tuesday — and later on the front benches of the House of Commons — just a day after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s top aide resigned after denying allegations he or anyone in the Prime Minister’s Office pressured the one-time justice minister over a criminal case.

Asked whether she was pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office, as the Globe and Mail reported based on unnamed sources, Wilson-Raybould said only that she was “still working with my lawyer.”

“As I think people can appreciate or should appreciate, the rules and laws around privilege, around confidentiality, around my responsibility as a Member of Parliament, my ethical and professional responsibilities as a lawyer, are layered and incredibly complicated,” she said following the cabinet meeting, “so I’m still working with my lawyer.”

She will have a chance to tell her at least part of her story in the coming days after Liberal MPs dropped their opposition to having Wilson-Raybould testify before the justice committee.

But she was adamant that she remains a member of her party’s caucus, stating, “I am a Liberal Member of Parliament.”

Her appearance in the Commons came in the midst of a crisis for the government, which faces a looming vote for a judicial inquiry into allegations of political interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

In a strange display of nothing-to-see-here-folks, Wilson-Raybould sat in her old minister’s chair during Question Period — the same one she last occupied as veterans affairs minister.

She sat, listened and texted as Conservatives and NDP members attacked the government, saying the resignation of Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerald Butts on Monday proves the need for a public inquiry.

Butts denied any wrongdoing, but said he was leaving the PMO because he didn’t want to be a distraction from the government’s work, and would be freer to defend himself and the PMO against allegations that anyone there had pressured Wilson-Raybould.

No one on the government’s side would elaborate on Wilson-Raybould’s presence at Tuesday’s cabinet meeting.

Trudeau told reporters that she had asked to attend, but said their discussions are covered by cabinet confidence, a line echoed by several of his ministers. Wilson-Raybould later told a CBC camera crew that the cabinet wanted to hear from her.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer labelled the gathering a “damage-control meeting.”

Scheer said questions are raised by the fact that the Liberal-dominated justice committee, which met behind closed doors Tuesday afternoon to discuss possibly expanding its probe, was suddenly willing to call Wilson-Raybould to testify.

“I think it’s very clear that the Liberal Party and Justin Trudeau have been engaged in damage control from the moment these allegations were raised,” he said.

Scheer said the sudden turn of events showed a public inquiry is needed to get to the bottom of allegations that first surfaced Feb. 7 in a Globe and Mail report of political interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

He dismissed suggestions Wilson-Raybould’s reappearance in Liberal ranks proves that nothing untoward happened, adding if the prime minister really wanted to restore Canadians’ confidence, “he would not be stonewalling us, he would not be directing his MPs to cover up at committee, he would not be pretending his principal secretary did nothing wrong and yet also accepting his resignation.”

Wilson-Raybould’s invitation to appear before the justice committee came from Liberal MP Iqra Khalid, who tweeted about it soon after the surprise cabinet appearance.

Although Wilson-Raybould told CBC that she respects the committee and would appear if asked, she noted that she is “continuing to discuss and talk with my counsel about what I can and cannot say. That too would apply at the justice committee were I to appear.”

The committee finalized its witness list, which now also includes several legal academics, Justice Minister David Lametti, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick and deputy justice minister Nathalie Drouin.

But the Liberal majority again shut down opposition efforts to summon Trudeau’s senior aides, such as Butts and Mathieu Bouchard.

“What happened there was a travesty,” NDP MP Murray Rankin said after the closed-door meeting wrapped up.

“The principal secretary to the prime minister of Canada resigned and we’re not allowed to hear from him,” Rankin said. “Doesn’t that strike you as odd?”

An opposition motion to have solicitor-client privilege waived to allow Wilson-Raybould to speak freely at the committee also did not pass, another sore point for Conservatives.

“We want to have more of a discussion than ‘I can’t speak to that. I can’t speak to that. I’m bound by solicitor-client privilege,’” said Conservative MP Lisa Raitt.

Meanwhile, a Conservative senator tabled a motion to hold a parallel probe in the Senate.

Wilson-Raybould’s arrival to take her seat among the Liberal ranks in the Commons clearly boosted the mood of several of her colleagues, even as several stressed their respect for Butts.

Treasury Board President Jane Philpott appeared buoyed, saying the treatment “that was received by people by anonymous sources was offensive and everyone deserves respect.”

Fisheries Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, a fellow MP from B.C., said Wilson-Raybould “remains my friend and she has her own reasons for doing things.”

Asked how she is doing, Wilkinson said, “I think Jody is a very thoughtful and strong person and Jody makes decisions based on what Jody thinks is the right thing to do for herself and I think that she’s doing fine in that context.”

When asked if that means she is not a victim in the whole affair, Wilkinson said, “I don’t think that Jody would ever think herself a victim.

“I think Jody is somebody who speaks her mind and is very comfortable doing that and I thing that is one of the things that we all like about Jody.”

Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, who along with Butts and Trudeau’s chief of staff Katie Telford had led the talks to renegotiate NAFTA, appeared earlier in the day to be reeling at the news of Butts’s sudden departure.

“It’s obviously a sad moment for me and his many friends and people who really admired the tremendous work he’s done for Canada,” said Freeland.

“Having said that, you know, our work goes on, as Gerry said in his own letter.”

Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett said that “on the ground” Indigenous communities had expressed concern over Wilson-Raybould’s departure from cabinet. “There’s no question that there’s great disappointment with the resignation. There’s no bad seat at the cabinet table so that is I think sadness that everybody feels. Absolutely, everybody just wants us to keep going forward.”

Butts was not specifically named in the Feb. 7 Globe and Mail story that first reported claims by unnamed sources that Wilson-Raybould was shuffled out of her job as justice minister because she resisted pressure by unidentified senior PMO officials to cut a deal that would have avoided criminal liability for Quebec-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin in a fraud and bribery case.

The entire Liberal caucus will soon face a bigger test, possibly as early as Wednesday, of its confidence in the government’s handling of the affair.

New Democratic Party ethics critic Charlie Angus tabled a motion Tuesday that will force the Liberal caucus to vote on whether the entire affair should be examined publicly by a federally appointed judge, much as the sponsorship scandal in the early 2000s was.

The NDP motion reads that the House of Commons “call on the Prime Minister to waive solicitor-client privilege for the former Attorney General with respect to allegations of interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin; and urge the government to launch a public inquiry, under the Inquiries Act, in order to provide Canadians with the transparency and accountability promised by the Liberals in the 2015 election campaign.”

In introducing the motion as the cabinet met in West Block, Angus said the SNC-Lavalin allegations of “corruption” and “cronyism” have led to a “corrosion of public confidence.”

“We are here to restore public confidence,” he said.

Scheer told the Commons that his MPs would support the NDP motion.

In a letter he released Monday, Butts “categorically denied” allegations in the Globe story that anyone in the PMO pressured Wilson-Raybould to cut a deal with SNC-Lavalin.

Trudeau and Butts have conceded that they each spoke personally to Wilson-Raybould about the file.

Trudeau says he told his justice minister the decision whether to direct the prosecution was “hers alone” when he spoke to her on Sept. 17. The public prosecutor rejected a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin on Oct. 9.

Butts spoke to her on Dec. 5. The PMO says Wilson-Raybould raised the subject with Butts, and that he told her to talk to Wernick.

Wernick heads the privy council, the central co-ordinating department of the entire government, and is the top public servant who serves as Trudeau’s deputy minister. Wernick declined the Star’s request to say what he told Wilson-Raybould.

Families, Children and Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos indicated he did not believe there was any wrongdoing.

Asked if Wilson-Raybould should be allowed to speak, Duclos said, “Listen, for me, it’s something that seems clear enough right now, that the prime minister has said since the beginning, that there was no pressure or direction to follow on this file.

“The government must respect the independence of the judicial proceedings. It’s always been the policy that we have followed up to now.”

This is our weekly newsletter on all things environmental, where we highlight trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world. (Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.)

This week:

It's called OOM, and it could change the way we generate power

Did Trump help inspire the Green New Deal?

When the rubber hits the snow: How electric cars fare in winter

Meet OOM: Could this off-the-grid technology be the future of electricity?

(OOM Energy)

In August 2003, a sagging high-voltage power line in northern Ohio brushed up against some tree branches. Before long, three transmission lines had short-circuited and 45 million people in the northeastern U.S., as well as 10 million in Ontario, were in the dark — for hours, days, in some cases even a week.

It was a tough lesson for power companies, who implemented recommendations from the investigation that followed (such as keeping power lines away from trees). But the fact is, most of us still rely on the grid to provide electricity to our homes and businesses.

If Craig Clydesdale has his way, however, that will all change. He's the founder and CEO of OOM Energy, an Oakville, Ont.-based company that has developed a new way of providing electricity to customers.

""You're looking at the next big thing,"" Clydesdale said. What he's referring to is his company's Integrated Energy Platform (IEP), an on-site power system that aims to take buildings off the sometimes unstable electrical grid while also reducing their carbon footprint. Oh, and it's portable.

OOM's unit shouldn't be confused with a generator, which creates mechanical energy and delivers it only as a backup, when existing systems fail. What Clydesdale's company provides is private, continuous electricity with no upfront cost for the unit. The customer just pays a regular bill directly to OOM each month.

So what's in the unit? The current version uses natural gas, a battery and an inverter. While it's not a zero-emissions solution, Clydesdale said the system can be modified to include greener energy as it develops and becomes more affordable — such as solar panels or hydrogen, which he believes to be the future.

The unit only generates power when it has to. That's unlike power lines that deliver electricity to your home, which have to be constantly running just in case. OOM uses artificial intelligence to calculate a building's power requirements, so its customers only get ""what they need,"" Clydesdale said.

At the moment, OOM units are being sold to organizations and businesses with large demands, such as ones in agriculture and industrial manufacturing. But they've also been used in high-rise apartments and multi-residential units.

Last month, Stoneridge Ice Centre in Burlington, Ont., became the first arena in North America to adopt OOM's new technology. The estimate is that their annual electricity costs will drop from $180,000 to $145,000 — a savings of 20 per cent.

Although Clydesdale has a unit for his home, right now, OOM's main focus is on commercial and multi-residential buildings.

Clydesdale doesn't know of anything like OOM on the market, but he said he'd be happy to see others rise to the challenge of a green, off-grid solution. At a time when more ice storms are predicted for parts of Canada with climate change, Clydesdale said this type of technology could be the security people are looking for.

He said it's potentially ""a multitrillion-dollar industry. There's lots of room for all of us.""

Given Trump's climate inaction, Green New Deal could be a political winner

(Saul Loeb/Getty Images)

CBC business columnist Don Pittis weighs in on the Green New Deal, the sweeping plan put forth by left-leaning members of the Democratic Party in the U.S. to address climate change.

To conservatives who understand the science of climate change and its potentially dire economic effects, it may seem strange that the decision on whether to halt it has become a left-right issue.

With the announcement of a major climate action initiative in the U.S., that polarization has become even more pronounced.

The idea of a transformational project to boost the economy using green technology has been around for decades. But now, an emerging left-leaning faction of the Democratic Party has offered up the Green New Deal, where fighting climate change is firmly anchored in a platform of wider social change, including items such as eliminating poverty and increasing income equality.

""I think [the Green New Deal] does mix a lot of things that are not necessarily compatible, and subordinates the goal of reducing carbon emissions to a lot of other things on the liberal social democratic wish list,"" Mark Cameron, executive director of Canadians for Clean Prosperity, told me on the phone last week.

A firm supporter of carbon pricing as a business-friendly way of cutting CO2 without distorting the economy, Cameron was director of policy and research for former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper.

But as others told me, the hostility of U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters to the whole idea of fighting climate change has surrendered that political turf to the Democrats.

As the name implies, the Green New Deal is unabashedly a social project, harking back to the original New Deal introduced by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to combat the inequality, unemployment and hunger of the Great Depression.

While critics insist it was actually the massive stimulation from spending on the Second World War that rebooted the U.S. economy, the original New Deal set the tone for a more egalitarian social and economic system that formed the basis of the postwar shared prosperity.

Without a climate change plan of its own, the Trump Republicans have given their Democratic opponents lots of flexibility to formulate a final green policy they think will appeal to voters.

With U.S. unemployment at record lows, massive public sector stimulus on green projects would likely be hard to justify. But if the rich keep on getting richer as the economy goes into recession, and if public worries over the effects of climate change continue to grow, a Green New Deal may catch the voters' imagination as a way to kill two birds with one stone.

The Big Picture: Traffic congestion

Sitting in traffic is no fun, but getting around in some cities is clearly worse than in others. According to research by traffic-analysis firm Inrix, the worst traffic is in Bogota, Colombia — drivers there lost 272 hours to congestion in 2018. As you'll see from the chart below, notoriously bad Canadian cities like Toronto and Montreal come off looking almost manageable in comparison.

What's on your mind?

Last week's story on household waste elicited some interesting emails. One reader pointed out that black plastic, which we cited as something that can't be recycled, is actually recycled in some communities across Canada. The reader helpfully clarified that ""municipalities have different rules because they've invested in different technologies. That makes it tough for consumers and businesses.""

We'll be returning to the topic of zero waste in the coming weeks and months, but if you have comments or suggestions on this topic, we'd be happy to hear them.

Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web

For anyone with a bird feeder, putting out food for our winged friends during the scarcity of the winter months seems like a small act of mercy. But an ecologist at the University of Alberta points out that it also puts birds at risk of accidentally colliding with windows or coming face to face with urban predators.

As Emily Chung wrote in a story last year, online shopping is a significant generator of carbon emissions. Given Amazon's outsize influence in this space, there's reason to be encouraged by the company's announcement this week that it's aiming to make all its shipments ""net zero carbon."" The first target: Making 50 per cent of its shipments net zero by 2030.

A shining example for other sun-drenched cities? A second-year engineering student at the University of Calgary has done research that suggests the city could generate nearly a quarter of its annual power demand if residential rooftops were outfitted with solar panels.

Snow problem: Electric cars in Winterpeg

(Bryce Hoye/CBC)

The coldest days in Canadian winters wreak havoc on vehicle batteries, and so you'd think the problem would be especially acute for electric vehicles (EVs). But many EV owners say that impact isn't a big deal once the rubber hits the snow.

A recent cold snap that swept through Canada provided an interesting case study for Winnipeg, where temperatures were in the -35 C range. On days like that, Jordan Loewen said his Tesla Model 3 was losing as much as 40 per cent of its battery range. Heating the cabin of the car was the main culprit, as it is for many EV owners.

This is the first Winnipeg winter for Loewen's black Tesla, which cost him a cool $75,000.

In ideal conditions, Loewen said his car can do 500 kilometres on a full charge. On the cold days of winter, however, he's getting more like 300 kilometres. On paper, that may look like a problem, but Loewen is a city commuter, and is only logging 60 kilometres a day on average.

Tesla advises against exposing its vehicles to extreme conditions — colder than -25 C, warmer than 60 C — for more than than 24 hours, but Loewen said he hasn't seen any issues.

""It performs and handles well in our winters, exceptionally so,"" said the 32-year-old Loewen.

Ross Redman paid $26,000 for his Mitsubishi i-MiEV seven years ago, and said it has stood the test of time (and temperatures) in Winnipeg.

""I've been told by several people that an electric car will never work in the winter time, and I use it every day,"" said Redman.

Like Loewen, Redman loses range in the winter — about 50 kilometres of the 100 kilometres he would get in the summer. But also like Loewen, he's a city driver, and isn't driving enough for that loss to change his habits.

Both say the loss in winter range is a small price to pay for vehicles that cost less than a few hundred dollars in fuel annually. Redman said he pays about $7 a month in the summer and $10 in the winter months on electricity bills to charge his little hatchback in his garage.

Redman acknowledges one big roadblock to owning an electric car in Manitoba is that he can't hop into his Mitsubishi and cover the province's vast distances without getting what is called ""range anxiety.""

That's because Manitoba, like some other provinces, is a patchwork of charging stations and lacks a supercharger network in particular. Those stations charge most electric vehicle batteries in less than an hour.

The Manitoba Electric Vehicle Association estimates a $4-million investment could establish enough supercharger stations around the province to make long road trips possible for EVs like Redman's, which lack the extended range of Loewen's fancy ride.

More specifically, he's facing criticsm for tapping what The Toronto Star calls ""high-powered lobbying firms"" to help sell tickets.

The 2019 Toronto Leaders' Dinner, as the event is called, will take place this Wednesday at The Toronto Congress Centre in Etobicoke from 5:30 p.m. until 9 p.m. It includes a welcome reception, a dinner program, a dessert reception and, at some point, a keynote speech from Ford featuring members of the PC Caucus.

If you missed Premier Doug Ford's $25-per-plate fundraiser in Kitchener last week, you can head to the PC party's $1,250-per-ticket fundraiser dinner in Etobicoke next month. No word yet if spaghetti is on the menu: https://t.co/ax3P33h4iG — James D.E. Jackson (@JamesDEJ) January 14, 2019

""Doug Ford and our Ontario PC Caucus accomplished a great deal in 2018, working to make life better and more affordable for Ontarians,"" reads a description of the event, which The Star says should net about $2 million for the Progressive Conservatives.

""There is much more to achieve in 2019, and to continue getting things done for the people, we need your help to build up our Party’s financial resources as quickly as possible.""

Some critics are taking the event's promotion as evidence that Ford and his colleagues are ""for sale,"" so to speak.

The premier told reporters in Washington on Friday that this is not the case.

""I can tell you one thing: no one can influence Doug Ford, no one can influence my ministers or my caucus,"" he said, per The Star.

""Lobbyists are here, the lobbyists are in Canada, they want to get their point through, good luck to them,"" he continued. ""But we're going to do the right thing for the people.""

I asked Doug Ford about lobbyists selling tickets to his fundraisers. ""I can tell you one thing: No one can influence Doug Ford,"" he said, which is the same answer Kathleen Wynne gave when I uncovered her government's cash-for-access system #onpoli https://t.co/wdht5crYCs — Adrian Morrow (@AdrianMorrow) February 22, 2019

""It is wrong for ⁦[Ford]⁩ to bring back the same old cash for access events that got the Wynne Liberals in hot water,"" said Ontario Green Party leader Mike Schreiner on Twitter Thursday morning.

""Big money has no place in [Ontario politics]. I call on the Premier to remove the for sale sign on his door.""

""Who can pay for Doug Ford's $1250/plate fundraiser?"" said the Liberal advocacy group Progress Canada on Twitter similarly.

""The nurse working nights? No. The factory worker? No. The restaurant chef? No. Working people? No. Only the rich who work for the rich and against working Ontarians.""

Adding more fuel to the fire are allegations published this week by the Globe and Mail that members of Ford's caucus are pressuring lobbyists to sell tickets under the threat of losing future meetings with government officials.

""Several people helping sell tickets, both in the lobbying and industry worlds, said they are under heavy pressure — including through repeated phone calls and reminders of sales targets by party fundraisers — to fill the room amid concerns about their continued ability to get meetings with key decision-makers,"" reads the Globe piece.

Many are pointing out that the PC party's actions seem a little too similar to what got Kathleen Wynne's Liberal Party into hot water during their time in power.

123,Empty,2019-02-23T02:00:36Z,"Burnaby South voters should do themselves a favour by supporting a successful, accomplished local candidate who likely will be at the centre of power","Three federal byelections are being held Monday, in Burnaby South as well as the ridings of Outremont in Quebec and York–Simcoe in Ontario. The Burnaby race is centre stage because federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh hopes to win his first seat in Parliament here.

Singh — who has lived his entire adult life in Ontario — has parachuted into Burnaby South, which he believes is a safe NDP seat. Despite being party leader, a win for Singh isn’t guaranteed. He’s up against strong candidates from the other established federal parties. And while the NDP often wins in the area, in the 2015 election the NDP’s Kennedy Stewart only edged out the Liberal runner-up by one percentage point (35 per cent of the votes compared to 34).

The Liberal candidate this time is Richard Lee, a longtime Burnaby North MLA, who replaced Karen Wang mid-campaign when she resigned after making a racial social-media comment. Jay Shin, a rookie politician, lawyer and professor who grew up in Burnaby, is hoping to take the seat for the Conservatives — traditionally the runner-up party for area voters. Rounding out the field are People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler-Thompson and independents Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu.

This byelection offers Burnaby South voters a real opportunity to help set the agenda for Canada.

Under Singh’s leadership, the NDP has struggled, with just 14-per-cent support across the country, according to an aggregation of recent polls compiled by the CBC. A Leger poll this week found that just six per cent of Canadians believe Singh would make the best prime minister of the party leaders.

What is clear from national election results and polling is that Canadians don’t believe the NDP and its policies are best for Canada. Singh is poised to continue the party’s long tradition of failure, and it’s no surprise.

He strongly opposes the Trans Mountain pipeline, a project that is clearly in the national interest and essential to economic development in Western Canada. Meanwhile, he favours the $40-billion LNG Canada project, although he faces pressure to oppose that project by NDP members with impractical climate change views.

With the NDP’s frequent opposition to major economic developments that provide jobs and prosperity, combined with its support for higher taxes and endless growth to government programs, it’s understandable that the vast majority of federal voters don’t view the NDP as a viable party to lead the country.

Singh has also never fully explained his views on terrorism, specifically as it relates to calls for the creation of an independent Sikh state, Khalistan, in India. While he has condemned terrorism, he has appeared at events with Khalistan separatists who endorse violence and he also failed in a CBC interview to denounce Talwinder Singh Parmar, thought to be the organizer of the 1985 Air India bombing.

Lee also faces strong headwinds, especially with the turmoil in Ottawa surrounding the resignations of former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould and Gerald Butts, the prime minister’s principal secretary, after reports that Wilson-Raybould was pressured to interfere with the prosecution of Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Trudeau’s fumbling attempts to initially deny the improper attempts to influence what must be independent prosecutors and his subsequent refusal to be transparent should be a grave concern to voters. Lee, an outspoken critic of China as a young man, recently has been criticized for being too close to the Chinese Communist Party, having been photographed dozens of times with Chinese officials.

Conservative candidate Jay Shin is new to politics but has a backstory that the diverse community of Burnaby South can embrace. He immigrated with his family, who ran a grocery store in Burnaby, where he grew up. He has two undergraduate degrees, a master of business administration and a law degree. Shin practises business law, has taught at two Korean universities and teaches at the University of B.C.’s law school.

Shin says the top priority for voters he speaks with in the riding is to rein in excessive spending by the current Liberal government and return to balanced budgets. That’s a worthy goal if we are going to maintain the services Canadians rely on without further taxing middle-class families already stretched to the limit, particularly in Metro Vancouver.

With the Conservatives climbing above the Liberals in the polls and possibly forming the next federal government, Burnaby South voters should do themselves a favour by supporting a successful, accomplished local candidate who likely will be at the centre of power.

I think it’s shameful.”","VANCOUVER — When Jody Wilson-Raybould was demoted in cabinet, a rabbi in her Vancouver Granville riding reached out to her with a message from the Bible. It quoted Joseph, who said after a betrayal: “You meant it for bad, but God meant it for good.”

The intention of the note was to convey that sometimes what looks like a curse can actually be a blessing. While it’s too soon to tell whether that’s the case for Wilson-Raybould, community leaders say recent events have not shaken their strong support for their MP.

“She is very down-to-earth and extremely honest. She never promised something that she couldn’t or wouldn’t try to deliver. And she was really curious,” said Dan Moskovitz, the head rabbi of Temple Sholom, who wrote the encouraging note.

“I just thought she was a lovely person and still is.”

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet last week amid allegations the Prime Minister’s Office pressured her when she was attorney general to help SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution. She was later demoted to Veterans Affairs Canada.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has denied that his office directed her on the matter and has said that the departure of treasury board president Scott Brison necessitated the cabinet shuffle. On Monday, his closest adviser, Gerald Butts, resigned as his principal secretary, while denying any impropriety.

In the Vancouver riding she has represented since 2015, supporters are disappointed Wilson-Raybould is no longer in cabinet but are respectful of her decision. Reverend Steven Epperson said many members of his Unitarian Church of Vancouver are more left-wing than the governing Liberals, but they deeply admire Wilson-Raybould.

“They think that what’s happened is a tragedy,” Epperson said. “We’re not privy to what’s going on behind the scenes, but I think we’re all aghast at the kind of covert and overt discrediting of her that’s going on in some Liberal circles. I think it’s shameful.”

Many church members, regardless of party affiliation, want to find out the truth and hope Wilson-Raybould remains in politics and continues to represent the riding, he added.

Both Moskovitz and Epperson described Wilson-Raybould as a principled, committed MP who met with them and supported their initiatives, including programs to help refugees and people struggling to find affordable housing.

Several community leaders in the riding expressed pleasant surprise when they expected brief meetings with Wilson-Raybould but she stayed for 45 minutes to an hour.

Walter Wells, of the community group the Vancouver Odd Fellows, said Wilson-Raybould was extremely friendly when she sat down with him to discuss a charity contest for high school students to visit Parliament.

“I was very conscious that she was a busy person and we’re just some small, local charity,” he said. “I kept expecting to get out of my chair and say, ‘Thank you for your time and goodbye,’ but she kept asking about our history, our membership and our purpose. … To me, (she is) not a typical politician at all.”

Wells said he supports her “more than ever” after her resignation from cabinet.

“It seems to me that she’s taken a principled stand,” Wells said. “I am so inspired by what I think is going on with her, and disgusted by what I think is going on with the Prime Minister’s Office.”

Wilson-Raybould has not explained why she quit and has cited solicitor-client privilege to refuse comment. She has hired a former Supreme Court justice to advise her on what she may say legally.

The Vancouver Granville Liberal Riding Association said in a statement it stands in full support of Wilson-Raybould and her important work for the community and Canada.

Marpole Oakridge Family Place holds an annual community gathering and Wilson-Raybould has attended every year since she was elected, said Andrea Krombein, literacy outreach co-ordinator.

“She’s talking to whoever wants to speak to her. People are gathering around her. She’s acknowledging everybody. She’s focusing on one person at a time. She’s truly, truly, listening,” she said. “You can actually see from her body language, what she’s saying, that her goal is to connect and educate and reassure.”

Krombein said while no one knows what really happened, she has no doubt Wilson-Raybould has been completely professional.

“I feel that she’s probably working through it the best way she can. It does not change our impression of her at all.”

Most participants were wearing yellow vests - a sign of affiliation with the country's own newly-formed grass-roots protest movement.

Sputnik sat down with Cody Payant — a Yellow Vests activist from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, who's been following the convoy and organized similar protests of smaller scale in his home region. Payant is also a political figure, aiming for People's Party of Canada candidacy in the upcoming 43rd federal election.

Sputnik: You've been following the ""United We Roll for Canada"" convoy going from Red Deer, Alberta, to Ottawa. What are their demands? Is it only about the ""pipeline"", or are there other topics at play?

Cody Payant: The ""pipeline"" is definitely the main one. Justin Trudeau is our prime minister and his father, Pierre Trudeau, used to be our prime minister, and he started what is called ""the National Energy Programme"", which kind of tried to nationalize pipelines, to implement state ownership on energy infrastructure projects. And now, with Justin Trudeau, with the purchase of the pipeline for 4.5 billion dollars of taxpayer money — there is a big problem, because they spent all that taxpayer money on that pipeline, but they can't build it. So, they more or less extorted Canadian taxpayers to pay for this ""imaginary pipeline"", that they can't build. And Canadians are really upset; that has become a big issue for Yellow Vests.

Here' s what may eventually turn into Canada's own grass-roots mass protest movement. A truck convoy moved all the way across the country from Red Deer, Alberta, to Ottawa to protest against federal govt policies. https://t.co/F84fkA5YGu — Denis Bolotsky (@BolotskySputnik) February 21, 2019

Canadians want pipelines because we have some of the cleanest oil and energy practices and industry anywhere in the world. And right now, compared to the United States, the United States is the only country where we can export our oil to, we are locked to them as one customer right now. Our oil is discounted big time right now, so we want a pipeline to Tidewater, so we can access world markets, whether it be Southeast Asia, or Asia.

The Transmountain pipeline will increase the value of Canadian oil by unlocking access to world markets. The carbon tax, over regulation, and state control of our energy sector is only delaying the commercial viability of large scale renewables as a replacement.

So, that was a huge issue, but also, some other issues with Yellow Vests are the United Nations — that's huge. The United Nations and the General Assembly — all of the people that sit in the General Assembly and on the councils — they are all unelected, and sometimes they are unelected in their own countries — the member states that comprise the UN. So, it's been a gradual ""creep"" — it kind of started after the World War [II]. So, the UN-2030 Agenda lays on all of these items that they are suggesting that the member states comply with. So, what the Yellow Vests sees is that Canada is a sovereign country, with sovereign borders; we need to protect our sovereignty as a sovereign nation, respect our ability to legislate ourselves, respect our representative democracy and our constitution. The Yellow Vests, basically, are patriotic, they want to preserve our sovereignty, they want to protect our sovereignty from supranational legislation of the UN trying to supersede Canadian law.

Sputnik: Both Canadian MPs speaking at the rally in Ottawa's Parliament Hill, and Canadian mainstream media seemed to have been avoiding the topics of the UN migrant compact, border policy and similar ""patriotic subjects"". Why is that?

Cody Payant: Part of the reason could be that pipelines are such a big issue right now, and there is a kind of ""competition"", I guess, between two ""pro-pipeline"" parties — the People's Party of Canada — and I'm a candidate with that party, and the Conservative Party of Canada, which also supports pipelines… I think both parties are trying to spread the message, so that could be a partisan thing.

But, also, immigration is a more contentious issue. The pipeline is a contentious issue, but immigration, all over the world, in a lot of places has become a very contentious issue. So, that's why it could be risky from a political perspective to talk about it. The migration pact is something that a lot of countries signed on to, and a lot of countries didn't. And there is a whole list of countries that refused to do so — the Czech Republic, Hungary, Japan, and the list goes on. Essentially, the issue that the Yellow Vests have with the Migration Pact is that — it's not pro- or against immigration, it's more of wanting Canada to be able to have the autonomy to legislate its own laws on immigration. We want Canada to make laws, not the UN.

Sputnik: You're planning to run for public office, and once you announced that you're joining the Yellow Vests movement and then media started speculating about the link between your membership in the People's Party and your Yellow Vests activism being seen as something rather controversial. Do you feel that there is a bias in the media or some kind of pressure?

Cody Payant: It is hard. I got involved in the Yellow Vests because it made its way to Canada from France after I had announced in September that I want to run for the nomination. So, it's kind of aligned. The Yellow Vests issues that they are advocating for are that they want, in terms of being patriotic Canadians who want to protect our sovereignty as a country, [to] protect our ability to legislate ourselves and remove the government from overregulating our industries and pipelines. As you said, the biased media is state-owned here in Canada. CBC gets 1.6 billion dollars per year in tax money, so it's basically a partisan tool for the liberal government right now. And it goes like that not only for Liberals — also for Conservatives — any party that's at power. It's state broadcasting.

126,Empty,2019-02-19T03:35:00Z,Donald Trump holds what he called “the most beautiful copy” of a letter from Shinzo Abe nominating the U.S. president for humankind’s most treasured honor. Does anyone really believe Trump wouldn’t leak it?,"As political bets go, Shinzo Abe’s wager on Donald Trump in November 2016 may go down as modern history’s worst.

Nine days after the U.S. president’s shock election victory, Japan’s prime minister raced to Trump Tower in New York, the first world leader to do so. At the time, Tokyo wags characterized the visit as shrewd realpolitik. Being first to genuflect before The Donald would put Japan in the good graces of a transactional White House. It would preserve the Japan-U.S.-security alliance and earn Tokyo preferential trade access.

What a stark difference 825 days make.

The first hint that true respect might not characterize this bromance was Trump bringing his kids to that meeting on Nov. 17, 2016. Trump made it official 67 days later by doing exactly what Abe implored him not to: he pulled the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Abe spent the previous four years cajoling his protectionist Liberal Democratic Party to join Barack Obama’s ambitious 12-nation TPP scheme. Next Trump cozied up to North Korea’s Kim Jong-un in ways that jeopardize Tokyo’s security. After that, he launched a trade war that imperiled Abe’s six-year effort to defeat deflation.

Yet Abe’s latest Trumpian indignity may be the most damaging: news he nominated the chaotic U.S. leader for humankind’s most treasured honor.

“The bromance between Abe and Trump has been a bumpy road, but perhaps nothing has embarrassed Abe more than Trump divulging that Abe nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize,” says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University’s Tokyo campus. “It makes Abe look craven for toadying to Trump, the least popular U.S. president ever in Japan.”

When 127 million Japanese facepalm in unison, does it make a sound? Shocked lawmakers sure made one, grilling Abe on the parliament floor on Monday. He refused to confirm that he had done Trump’s bidding. He allowed, though, that ""I never said I didn’t"" nominate Trump for his summit with Kim Jong-un last June.

This issue could blow up in unpredictable ways. As Yuichiro Tamaki, an opposition lawmaker, tweeted: such a move would “send the wrong message to North Korea and the rest of international society.” It also sends the last message to the Japanese people that Abe would ever want conveyed: that Abe, a proud and ardent nationalist, is really just Trump’s vassal in Asia.

""Abe must be sweating the possibility that Trump might actually make the letter public,"" Kingston explains. ""It might be hard for Abe to live down the excessive sucking up and kowtowing for an undeserving braggart.""

This puts an intense spotlight on Abe’s naivete in befriending Trump to begin with. Until now, many voters have taken a collective view of the Trump era that can be summed up like this: What choice does Japan have? It sits in a uniquely dangerous neighborhood where Tokyo relies on America’s military umbrella. While Trump is plenty erratic, Abe has to make the best of his for Japan’s sake.

Trump’s tariffs already make this cognitive dissonance hard to sustain. Up until the third quarter of 2018, Japan had been enjoying its longest expansion since the 1980s. The 2.5% drop in annualized growth from July to September bore some of Trump’s fingerprints. His assault on Chinese trade is unending the Asian supply chains on that are Japan Inc.’s lifeblood.

At the moment, Trump’s negotiators are jousting with China’s. Next comes Team Abe. A key Trump priority is a bilateral trade deal with Japan. With his legislative prospects darkening at home and investigations swirling, Trump sees Japan as his best shot at a win on the world stage. Who better to look to for help than dutiful pal Abe in Tokyo?

Abe, after all, gave Trump reason to view him in subservient terms. Trump smells weakness. And Abe’s Trump Tower sprint smacked more of desperation than strength. Trump knows he has Tokyo over the proverbial barrel, as South Korea has learned. First, Trump forced Seoul to renegotiate a 2012 free-trade deal, its own show of disrespect to a key U.S. ally. More recently, Trump shook down President Moon Jae-in for another $500 million to pay for U.S. troops on the peninsula.

Tokyo already faces enough headaches over public discontent with American bases, particularly in Okinawa. Hitting up Japan for more cash would raise questions about Abe’s bet on Trump. So would Trump making good on threats to tax imports of cars and auto parts, a step that would devastate Abenomics.

The zero-sum president doesn’t do trade deals. He does shakedowns. Sure, Tokyo has some leverage. The $1.1 trillion of U.S. Treasury debt it holds is an underappreciated pressure point. Japanese automakers, meantime, employ more than 1.5 million Americans in jobs they could always move to Canada or Mexico.

Yet Abe has consistently seemed cowed by Trump’s whims. Now Trump holds what he called “the most beautiful copy” of a five-page, Abe-penned nomination letter over Tokyo. Does anyone really believe Trump wouldn’t leak it to humiliate Abe? To keep Tokyo in line with Trump’s policies toward North Korea, China, Iran or even Germany?

Don’t downplay the potency of this Nobel absurdity. Abe’s whole modus operandi as a politician is restoring Japan’s World War II greatness. His first stint as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 was spent trying to revise a pacifist Constitution foisted on his grandfather’s generation (his grandfather Nobusuke Kishi was a wartime Cabinet member) by its American captors. Abe is making another run at his life’s work this year.

Being a lickspittle for Trump’s delusions of Nobel grandeur would be toxic to this Abe-dynasty backstory. Abe now has five pages of “beautiful” reasons to live in constant fear of betrayal–and national mortification.

It’s already become fodder for late-night comedians, with the laughs coming at Tokyo’s expense. Twitter is buzzing about who might play Abe in a coming “Saturday Night Live” skit opposite Alec Baldwin’s Trump. Abe sees nothing funny about his efforts to make Japan’s global power great again. That’s why Trump’s Nobel dream just became Tokyo’s nightmare.",Trump's Nobel Dream Is Tokyo's Nightmare,Forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2019/02/18/trumps-nobel-dream-is-tokyos-nightmare/
127,Empty,2019-02-20T11:16:04Z,"Divorce—though originally sanctioned more than 1,400 years ago by Islamic law—is still widely viewed in Muslim societies as a subversive act that breaks up the family. Women who seek divorce can often find themselves ostracized and treated as immoral. Despite…","Istanbul, Turkey—Nebiye A. crossed the Bosphorus on a ferry, far from the home and life she once had. On her way to a meeting, Nebiye’s short hair—once wrapped in a headscarf—blows in the wind. In this chaotic, ancient city of 15 million people, Nebiye feels free. But beyond the sea, in the hinterlands of Anatolia, not long ago, Nebiye had another life as a married woman, one much closer to that of her mother, and her mother before her.

Petite, with a shy smile and freckles, Nebiye, who said that revealing her last name would put her family’s dignity at risk, married at the age of twenty-two, right after graduating from university. Two years later, she left her husband, which meant standing up to her family as well as braving the stigma of divorce in Turkey. “My father told me that he would disown me because I was doing something that God does not agree with. My mom said that she would disown me if I went to live by myself in Istanbul after my divorce,” Nebiye told me, as she drew on a cigarette.

Now six years later, Nebiye, thirty, is no longer in contact with her family. But she has gained a freedom and sense of empowerment that is emblematic of what women are achieving in today’s Turkey and across much of the Islamic world.

Divorce—though originally sanctioned more than 1,400 years ago by Islamic law—is still widely viewed in Muslim societies as a subversive act that breaks up the family. Women who seek divorce can often find themselves ostracized and treated as immoral. Despite such taboos and restrictions, however, divorce rates are rising across Islamic countries, even in ultra-conservative places like Afghanistan.

Turkey, in particular, is seeing a record number of divorces, as both women and men are looking for a way out of unhappy and sometimes abusive marriages. Over the past fifteen years, the divorce rate has risen from under 15 percent of marriages to nearly a quarter of them. Domestic violence is almost always cited as a leading reason by Turkish women seeking a divorce. This is true even outside urban areas, which have also seen a slight growth in divorce cases; increasingly, women are willing to seek divorces in smaller, religious towns such as Konya, in central Anatolia, where Nebiye was raised. More of these girls and women also now have access to education and online information.

Ipek Bozkurt, an outspoken women’s rights activist and Istanbul-based divorce lawyer, told me that one reason for this change in social norms is that more women are working, and they are more aware of their rights. “They’re so fed up with their marriages and the treatment they receive, the treatment their kids receive, all the physical and psychological pressure that they have suffered,” she said. “They’re just willing to let that marriage go.”

Turkey is a predominantly Muslim country governed by secular laws. Women here have equal rights to property and are eligible for alimony after divorce. But over its seventeen-yearslong rule, Turkey’s conservative Justice and Development Party or AKP government has pushed a strong family values agenda: women should get married and have three kids, according to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Turkey provides incentives for married couples such as a tax break, and women who work part-time can get subsidized childcare. Despite such measures—and to the government’s dismay—the rate of marriage has declined by 27 percent over the AKP’s tenure, and women are choosing to marry at an older age. In large part, this is an unintended consequence of Erdoğan’s economic policies, which produced a long boom from 2002 to 2012 that saw women entering the urban workforce in unprecedented numbers.

In November, speaking to a roomful of his women supporters at a “gender justice” summit, Erdoğan boasted of presiding over an increase in the proportion of women in the workforce, up from 28 percent in 2002 to 38 percent today. At the same conference, Zehra Zümrüt Selçuk, the minister of family, labor, and social services, insisted that the government was working hard to encourage marriage and prevent divorce, but she balanced her message with an appeal to women’s growing desire for independence. “Our primary goal,” she said, “is to minimize and solve the problems encountered by the family and to protect its unity without ignoring the rights of the individuals.”

Her department used to be known as the ministry for women and family; that name had changed in 2011—a move intended as a snub, in fact, to women’s rights advocates and to bolster the family values agenda before a general election. At the November summit, Erdoğan’s eldest daughter, Esra Albayrak, criticized Western women’s rights as self-indulgent. She echoed her father’s message that Turkey needs to find its own solutions to gender issues, with a focus on women’s traditional roles as mothers, sisters, and daughters. Albayrak and her conservative allies are fighting a rearguard action against the social changes that are making divorce more acceptable and easier. And last year, Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gül defended Turkish men who’ve been complaining about what they see as the injustice of being obliged to make lifelong alimony payments to their ex-wives.

The AKP commissioned a parliamentary report on how to tackle the rising divorce rate. When it was published, in May 2016, one of the document’s main recommendations was that if a married woman required extended police protection, such as a restraining order against her abusive husband, she would have to provide proof of his violence. Other proposals included advising judges presiding in divorce cases to refer couples to marriage counseling and that alimony payments should end after ten years.

The report received withering criticism from Turkish feminists and women’s rights activists, and none of its recommendations were implemented—although the report did receive widespread coverage. Women’s groups argued that lower income women with minimum wage jobs or single mothers cannot make ends meet without alimony. According to Taylan Acar, an assistant professor of sociology at Istanbul’s Bosphorus University who has studied divorce and marriage, the divorce rate remains moderate and there’s no crisis of the family in Turkey. But “it appears that [the government] has convinced the media and the society that divorce rates have reached crisis levels,” he wrote me.

Changes to the way official statistics are gathered have led to disputed assessments of how rapidly the divorce rate is going up. The government refers to data that appear to show sharp increases from 2000 to 2010, but independent experts argue that more recent administrative data show only a steady but moderate rise—and far from the crisis some in government describe.

Following the report, the government hired more marriage guidance counselors, though critics say that these government counselors, some of whom are imams or clerics, sometimes send wives back to abusive husbands. Bozkurt, the lawyer, said the government is in denial about the real reasons behind domestic violence. “Women’s organizations say that there is an increase in divorce because there is an increase in domestic violence,” she said. “On the other hand, the government says: since the women want to get a divorce, domestic violence has increased.”

It is true that femicide has grown steadily in Turkey over the last decade, with more than 2,000 women killed by their partners. Feminists say that the number of murders is up because more women are resisting inequality and abuse in their marriage, and reporting domestic violence more. Unfortunately, some men are retaliating with deadly violence, said Gülsüm Kav, the co-founder of We Will Stop Femicides, a women’s group that advocates for victims’ families and independently counts women homicides in Turkey. But the solution, activists argue, is not what the government says—that women should stay in abusive marriages and try to work things out with their husbands—but legal reform.

The problem in Turkish law is that the burden of proof in domestic violence cases falls on the victims, who, the women’s rights advocates argue, are treated like pariahs in the justice system. If a man claims that his partner cursed him in an altercation or “provoked” him in some way, the judge all too often gives him, not her, the benefit of the doubt. Chloe Fairweather, a British filmmaker, is making a film about Turkish women who were beaten and shot after leaving their partners, Dying to Divorce.

“While there is often legislation to protect women, it is not always implemented,” she said. “There are often cultural barriers, too. Despite obvious violence, some of the women we met face disapproval from their families who feel [the women] are to blame for the violence they have experienced.”

In 2017, in spite of protests from secularists and feminists, lawmakers passed a measure to permit imams to wed couples, a move that opponents say inches the country toward Sharia law, institutionalizing inequality in marriage and divorce. Islamic practices such as polygamy, marriage under age eighteen, and a man’s right to divorce his wife simply by saying, “I divorce you,” three times, are outlawed under Turkey’s secular Constitution, but some couples, especially in conservative rural Anatolia, still live by these beliefs. Supporters of the new law tried to argue that it could help to decrease the number of child-bride marriages, which account for about 15 percent of marriages in the country, by increasing transparency and government oversight of religious weddings.

Nebiye left her home and religious family in Konya in 2008 to study theology at a private university in Istanbul. As a woman who wore a headscarf, Nebiye could not, at that time, attend a public university because Turkey’s secular Kemalist governments had outlawed their wearing at government institutions. The AKP overturned that law in 2010, the year before Nebiye graduated. Then she landed a job at a literary magazine, where she met the man she would marry.

“He was kind, intelligent, and not authoritarian like the other guys,” she told me. With their families’ approval, the couple were married—and moved away from Istanbul after he was hired as a university professor in a remote town near the Armenian border.

There were hints of problems from the beginning of their relationship, she says—he could be jealous—but the main reason Nebiye eventually wanted out of the marriage was sexual incompatibility. “In secular families, they [both men and women] can talk about sex and even experience it before marriage, but in conservative families, they don’t even talk about it with their mothers,” she explained. “Also, sex is usually for men’s pleasure. Women are just supposed to procreate.”

Nebiye eventually asked for a divorce, and her husband eventually agreed; their court proceedings at least were easy because they didn’t have children or property to dispute. But his family harassed her: her mother-in-law insisted the devil had come between them and her father-in-law would call late at night trying to change her mind.

The hardest part for Nebiye, though, was confronting her own family. Even now, she seemed uncomfortable talking about their negative reaction. She lit up another cigarette and let out a nervous laugh.

She moved back to Istanbul where her friends raised money for her to live on until she got a job. She also stopped wearing the headscarf she had worn since the age of twelve. This was the last straw for her parents, who renounced her. “Of course, I miss my family,” she said, “but I don’t think it’s right for them to have disowned me in the name of God.”

Today, Nebiye is studying for a master’s in new media and working as an activist for labor rights. She feels a loneliness that comes with being single in Turkey and has trouble trusting men. She keeps in touch with her older sister, but aches for losing her parents in exchange for her freedom.

“The more educated women become, the more likely they want partners who are going to match and satisfy them not only economically, but also emotionally and intellectually,” explained Acar, the sociologist. “If not, they postpone marriage or choose to forgo [it] altogether.” It’s not just the divorce rate that is going up; over the last decade, the average age of marriage has risen from twenty-three to twenty-five for women.

Not all Turkish women have found Nebiye’s path open to them. I met Nursel Öztürk, a Canadian-Turkish anthropology researcher, at an Istanbul shopping mall on a rainy day. Her field of study actually concerns the part Islamic traditions play in divorce carried out in the secular courts. Her interest is more than academic, perhaps—she had sought divorce herself, but withdrew her petition because the process was affecting her mental health and threatening her custody of the children. Today, the forty-one-year-old continues to live with her husband, a law professor in Istanbul, in a tense and unhappy silence.

“Women are sick and tired of being second-class citizens. I wanted to be treated like I matter,” she said, with visible anger. Öztürk grew up in a secular home in Toronto, though her family made frequent visits to Turkey. When she turned seventeen, her father—without consulting his teenaged daughter—approved her marriage to her current husband, who was raised in Turkey. After the couple married, they also moved to Canada, and had four children. Öztürk studied as she raised her kids.

“I could be educated but had to do and think what my husband wanted,” she said. “I didn’t have any decision-making power with our children’s morals or education. Diapers and food were my job.”

Her husband eventually wanted to move back to Istanbul and work as an academic and, despite her misgivings, they did. The move put more stress on her marriage, and finally, after twenty-four years, she filed for divorce—though, after getting bogged down in disputes, she eventually abandoned the effort. In Öztürk’s embittered view, Turkey’s secular tradition pays lip service to women’s rights but the reality falls far short.

For Tanyar Ablak, a fit fifty year-old who runs a small business in Istanbul selling honey and dairy, things have gone more smoothly. He has been divorced twice, and both times the process was easy. “Everyone thinks that the woman is the victim in Turkey because she’s the one who is excluded and beaten up, who’s left alone—and a lot of times, it is like that,” he said. “But men can be oppressed in the process as well.” He meant that marriage places so much emphasis on the family that it doesn’t allow for individual development. “Unfortunately, this is our tradition,” he said.

Aware, though, of his privilege as a man in Turkey, where there is little pressure on men to contribute in the home, he is trying to do things differently. He has a girlfriend, but lives across the hall from his ex-wife, who’s also the mother of his son. They’re co-parenting and sometimes they eat the meals that he cooks together as a family.

As the country urbanizes, it is struggling to manage its relationship to modernity within the traditional institution of marriage. Turkey’s AKP government is threatened by liberal ideas, but change is coming—has come already.

“Women will not take it anymore,” Nebiye said.

Even though protesters have different political views, many wear yellow vests and most of them oppose the policies of Justin Trudeau’s government.

If you watch the coverage of Canada's #UnitedWeRoll protest one of the things that may spring to mind is how similar it looks to the 1978 Sam Peckinpah's movie ""The Convoy"", with dozens of trucks driving through the vast North American landscape, with people in small towns and big cities along the way cheering drivers, who turned against corrupt authorities.

​However, unlike the iconic movie with Kris Kristofferson, where the main character is on a mission against an abusive sheriff, the reality of modern-day Canadian protest is much more complicated. Canadian mainstream media almost unequivocally brand the protest as ""pro-pipeline"", saying that it's mainly directed against federal energy and environmental policies.

However, there are also other slogans at play, which the media prefers to either ignore or portray negatively, such as the opposition to the UN Migrant compact and calls to secure the country's borders. Politicians also seem to avoid these ""hot topics"".

​Faith Goldy, a Canadian right-wing journalist, who previously worked as a commentator and reporter for several media outlets and who is a strong opponent of Justin Trudeau's immigration policy, told Sputnik that #UnitedWeRoll is the first cross-country grassroots movement of its kind and its message is being often misread by both the mainstream media and MPs in Ottawa.

""I've talked to many of these protesters, and they've been explicit in their signage and their messaging that they want an end to the UN migrant compact,"" Goldy said. ""And yet, not a single elected official who presented their remarks had included any on the topic of the UN migrant compact. So, the question becomes 'well, why?' when this is what the people are demanding.""

The truckers were met with counter-protests in Ottawa for being ""racist"" and ""white supremacists"" — something they strongly deny. Their objections and explanations, however, mostly got through via alternative media platforms and social networks, rather than public TV and radio.

​Although #UnitedWeRoll is the largest, it's not the first convoy of its kind in Canada. Despite wearing yellow vests, not all protesters identify themselves with the broader ""Yellow Vests"" ideology. Some people, including the organisers, even try to distance themselves from the ""aggressive"" Yellow Vests' profile, which originated in France. But in reality, truckers from Alberta and the ""Yellow Vests"" seem to share many goals.

Cody Payant, an accountant from the city of Saskatoon in Saskatchewan Province, is a ""Yellow Vests"" member. He took part in similar convoys of a smaller scale in his home region earlier this year. Payant says that the movement's ideology is purely patriotic.

@PayantCody to @SputnikInt: “The Yellow Vests, basically are patriotic. They want to protect our sovereignty from being infiltrated by supernational legislation of the UN trying to supersede the Canadian law.” (Image: Cody Payant’s Facebook page) pic.twitter.com/StbLEvDUr8 — Denis Bolotsky (@BolotskySputnik) February 21, 2019

​He is also an active member of Canada's People's Party and is planning to run as a candidate in the 43rd federal election scheduled for 21 October. The mainstream media recently speculated about his membership in the ""controversial Yellow Vests Canada"".

""The biased media is state-owned here in Canada,"" Payant told Sputnik. ""CBC gets 1.6 billion dollars per year in tax money, so it's basically a partisan tool for liberal government right now. And it goes like that not only for liberals — also for conservatives — any party that's at power. It's state broadcasting. So, they tried to paint me, and others too, in the party, as somehow being 'risky'.""

Nevertheless, Payant is optimistic about the future of Canada's grassroots protest movement:

""I know that there have been extremist groups trying to get involved in the Yellow Vests, trying to hi-jack it, to make it into something that it's not, whether it's 'Soldiers of Odin' or 'Antifa' or other groups like that. But, as a whole, I have faith in Canadians. Canadians will keep it on the tracks and overcome the hate, overcome the division and really keep it on the tracks. And I think that rally in Ottawa was really an evidence of that.""

The #UnitedWeRoll for Canada convoy, consisting of around 200 semi-trailers, pickup trucks and buses, departed from Red Deer, Alberta, and travelled all the way across Canada to the capital Ottawa, where activists held a two-day rally on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The protesters are campaigning in favour of the country's energy sector, which suffers from a lack of export capacity, thy opposed to the federal carbon tax, and have expressed criticism of Justin Trudeau's immigration policy and voiced their disapproval of Canada's participation in the UN migrant compact.

First issued by the United States in 1823, it warned European powers against renewed colonization of the Western Hemisphere. Presented as anti-imperialist, the Monroe Doctrine was later used to justify US interference in regional affairs.

We may be seeing the development of a Canadian equivalent. The ‘Trudeau Doctrine’ claims to support a “rules-based order”, the “constitution” and regional diplomacy independent of the US. But, history is likely to judge the rhetoric of the Trudeau Doctrine as little more than a mask for aggressive interference in the affairs of a sovereign nation.

For two years Canada’s Prime Minister has been conspiring with Juan Guaidó’s hardline Voluntad Popular party to oust the government of Nicolas Maduro. In May 2017 Trudeau met Lilian Tintori, wife of Voluntad Popular leader Leopoldo López. The Guardian recently reported on Tintori’s role in building international support for the slow-motion coup attempt currently underway in Venezuela. Tintori acted as an emissary for Lopez who couldn’t travel to Ottawa because he was convicted of inciting violence during the “guarimbas” protests in 2014. According to a series of reports, Lopez is the key Venezuelan organizer of the plan to anoint Guaidó interim president. Canadian diplomats spent “months”, reports the Canadian Press, coordinating the plan with the hard-line opposition. In a story titled “Anti-Maduro coalition grew from secret talks”, the Associated Press reported on Canada’s “key role” in building international diplomatic support for claiming the head of the national assembly was president. This included Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland speaking to Guaidó “the night before Maduro’s swearing-in ceremony to offer her government’s support should he confront the socialist leader.”

Just before the recent Lima Group meeting in Ottawa Trudeau spoke with Guaidó and at the meeting of countries opposed to Venezuela’s president he announced that Canada officially recognized Guaido’s representative to Canada, Orlando Viera Blanco, as ambassador. The PM has called the leaders of France, Spain, Paraguay, Ireland, Colombia and Italy as well as the International Monetary Fund and European Union to convince them to join Canada’s campaign against Venezuela.

“The international community must immediately unite behind the interim president”, Trudeau declared at the opening of the Lima Group meeting in Ottawa.

At the UN General Assembly in September Canada announced it (with five South American nations) would ask the International Criminal Court to investigate the Venezuelan government, which is the first time a government has been formally brought before the tribunal by another member. Trudeau portrayed this move as a challenge to the Trump administration’s hostility to the court and described the ICC as a “useful and important way of promoting an international rules-based order.” In other words, Trudeau would challenge Washington by showing Trump how the “international rules-based” ICC could undermine a government the US was seeking to overthrow through unilateral sanctions, support for the opposition and threatening an invasion, which all contravene the UN Charter.

While Trudeau claims to support an “international rules-based order”, his government has adopted three rounds of illegal sanctions against Venezuela. It has also openly interfered in the country’s affairs, which violates the UN and OAS charters.

The Trudeau Doctrine emphasizes its interpretation of Venezuela’s constitution. On a whole series of platforms the Prime Minister has cited “the need to respect the Venezuelan Constitution”, even responding to someone who yelled “hands off Venezuela” at a town hall by lecturing the audience on article 233 of the Venezuelan constitution, which he claims makes the head of the National Assembly president. It doesn’t.

More fundamental to the Trudeau Doctrine is the mirage of a regional coalition independent of the regional hegemon – the United States.

Ottawa founded the anti-Maduro Lima Group coalition with Peru. Amidst discussions between the two countries foreign ministers in Spring 2017, Trudeau called his Peruvian counterpart, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, to “‎stress the need for dialogue and respect for the democratic rights of Venezuelan citizens, as enshrined in the charter of the Organization of American States and the Inter-American Democratic Charter.” But the Lima Group was established as a structure outside of the OAS largely because that organization’s members refused to back Washington and Ottawa’s bid to interfere in Venezuelan affairs, which they believe defy the OAS’ charter.

While many liberal Canadian commentators promote the idea that the Lima Group operates independently of Washington, their US counterparts are not deceived. In a story titled “Intervening Against Venezuela’s Strongman, Trump Belies ‘America First’” the New York Times described US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s influence over the Lima Group declaration of January 4 that rejected Maduro’s presidency. The paper reported that Pompeo is in “close contact with” Freeland “who has played a leading role in rallying global criticism of Mr. Maduro.”

The claim the Lima Group is independent of Washington conjures up a story Jean Chrétien recounts telling US President Bill Clinton in My Years as Prime Minister:

“Keeping some distance will be good for both of us. If we look as though we’re the fifty-first state of the United States, there’s nothing we can do for you internationally, just as the governor of a state can’t do anything for you internationally. But if we look independent enough, we can do things for you that even the CIA cannot do.”

While currently focused on Venezuela, the nascent Trudeau Doctrine has wider regional implications. Freeland has justified Canada’s aggressive interference in Venezuela’s affairs by saying “this is our neighbourhood” while Trudeau’s personal representative for the G7 Summits and recent appointee to the Senate, Peter Boehm told CBC, “this is our backyard, the Western hemisphere. We have a role here.”

Describing Latin America as “our backyard” is the language favoured by so-called Ugly American politicians seeking to assert the Monroe Doctrine. Latin Americans should beware of the emergence of Ugly Canadians promoting the Trudeau Doctrine.

On February 23 protests are planned in Canada and around the world calling for “No War on Venezuela!”

As with the other two debates, emotions ran high when the subject came to immigration and refugee resettlement. The debate, hosted by the Ismaili Centre on Canada Way, was interrupted by hecklers who shouted at candidates and each other several times.

The emotionally charged debate came just six days before the byelection that could see Singh gain his first seat in the House of Commons since becoming the leader of the NDP in 2017.

NDP and PPC clash on immigration

The most heated moment came as NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson exchanged pointed remarks about Canada’s immigration policies.

“I want everyone to look around this room,” Singh said. “Every single person in this room – except for the first people of this land – the rest of you are all immigrants or from a family of immigrants.”

The NDP leader said Canada “fundamentally” needs immigration. Canada needs to make its immigration system more transparent and must recognize the foreign credentials of skilled immigrants, he said.

Thompson followed Singh by saying most Canadians don’t want an increase in immigration and that the NDP and Liberals are “extreme in this regard.”

The PPC candidate then brought up the 2017 murder of Burnaby teen Marrisa Shen. The man accused in her death, Ibrahim Ali, was a refugee from Syria. There is no publicly known evidence to suggest Ali had a criminal record or other red flags that were missed by Canadian officials. He has yet to stand trial.

Thompson said Shen’s murder “demands that we be careful in vetting the refugees that come to our land.”

This prompted loud cheers and applause from a group of PPC supporters in the crowd, followed by a man wearing a Liberal button who stood and pointed at Thompson, yelling “That is racist! Shame on you!”

Audience shouting match breaks out

The debate ground to a halt as audience members shouted at one another before moderator Jason D’Souza, a CBC broadcaster, got things back under control.

“Let’s acknowledge the emotions in the room,” D’Souza said, adding the exchange of ideas should remain on stage between candidates.

Liberal Richard Lee fought back tears as he tried to answer the immigration question. He said he has met with Shen’s family, who told him they don’t want their daughter’s death politicized.

“All I want to say is let the courts decide,” Lee said.

Most candidates favour immigration

Earlier in the debate, Lee said immigration must continue and be supported. He said he came to Canada in 1971 with his family under a family reunification program initiated by the Liberal government of the time. “Canada is a very compassionate country and we welcome immigrants, including refugees, to come to Canada and to contribute to our economy,” Lee said.

Conservative Jay Shin said he too welcomes more immigrants to Canada.

“I’m an immigrant, so obviously Canada is built on immigration,” he said. “So immigration is something we need to have, but what I support is legal immigration to Canada. “

Shin said the current Liberal government set arbitrary targets for welcoming Syrian refugees without the adequate resources to support them.

The Conservative also said Canadians shouldn’t let the emotions associated with Shen’s murder dictate policymaking.

Independent Terry Grimwood said Canada’s immigration system needs to be more fair. He said he’s met young people in the country on temporary work visas who want to stay longer but can’t.

“I’m all for immigration, and I just would like to see people being able to come here from all parts of the world,” Grimwood said. “It has to be balanced.”

Singh calls out ‘coded language’

A followup question about Shen’s murder and immigration policies brought another round of barbs between Singh and Thompson.

“We’ve got to call out the coded language,” Singh said.

He said people are treating the Shen case differently due to the race of the accused killer.

Singh said people are not using Bruce McArthur, a white man convicted of killing eight men in Toronto, to disparage white people.

“To use a horrible incident to incite violence or hatred against an entire community is wrong; It’s not something we should do as a society,” Singh said. “When people use a horrible incident to incite violence, they’re effectively saying that refugees are murderers.”

The room once again erupted following Singh’s comment, with loud boos and one man yelling “Stupid!” and “Idiot!” repeatedly.

Thompson said she was not being racist.

“I want to go on record as saying that if it was a white person who was coming into our country that was not properly vetted, I would be against that,” she said. “This actually has nothing to do with the colour of anyone’s skin.”

Candidates chart differing political visions

The debate also touched on housing, job creation and climate change.

Shin’s solution to several issues was tax cuts. He said the best way to make housing more affordable would be to grow the economy, which would in turn increase wages.

The Conservative also criticized the Liberal government’s purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline, saying that money could have been better spent on social programs.

Lee touted the Liberal record on a host of issues.

He said the Trudeau government is investing billions in its national housing strategy, as well as job skills training to strengthen the Canadian workforce.

The Liberal repeatedly mentioned he has lived in Burnaby for 32 years and represented the community as a B.C. Liberal MLA for 16 years.

Grimwood, who plans to establish a new party called Canada Fresh, said he has a plan to build 200 service hubs throughout rural Canada that will make travel and work easier.

The independent said his time as a North Vancouver city councillor in the 1970s taught him housing is a municipal issue.

As the debate wrapped up, hecklers once again interrupted as Singh answered a question about his connections to the riding. Two men, including former Burnaby First Coalition council candidate Alain Deng, said the New Democrat was lying when he said he lives in the riding.

Singh moved from Ontario with his wife to Burnaby South in November. Independent Valentine Wu (who was not at the debate) also lives in Burnaby South, where he says he’s been resident for 15 years. Lee lives in North Burnaby; Thompson lives in New Westminster; Shin lives in Vancouver and Grimwood lives in Sechelt on the Sunshine Coast.","Burnaby South candidates called ‘racist,’ ‘liar,’ ‘stupid’ and more at raucous debate",Vancouverisawesome.com,https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/02/21/racist-liar-stupid-final-debate-byelection-burnaby-south/

Now, the Progressive Conservative government are introducing a wide range of measures to streamline police oversight.

The PCs paused implementation of Bill 175 that doubled down on the power of the Special Investigations Unit, the Office of the Independent Police Review Director and the Ontario Civilian Police Commission.

“It’s unfortunate that the previous government looked at police officers and it saw them as potential offenders,” Attorney General Caroline Mulroney said, adding the bill “was, in fact, anti-police.”

The SIU investigates circumstances involving police and civilians that have resulted in serious injury, death or allegations of sexual assault.

That could include cases of suicide or situations in which a person dies after a medical incident.

But that often left subject police officers in limbo for months and sometimes years, including cases in which cops were investigating suicides and drug overdoses.

The new legislation would limit SIU investigation to situations where police use of force results in serious injury or death, when a cop shoots at someone or there is a reported sex assault.

And the SIU would need to wrap up investigations in 120 days.

In short, return the SIU to its roots: Investigate suspected criminal activity.

“That’s actually not the case today,” Mulroney told reporters.

“If a police officer tries to stop a suicide attempt but is unsuccessful, he or she is treated like a suspect … If a police officer responds to a violent crime, tries to perform CPR but is unable to save the life, he or she is treated like a suspect. This is not what the SIU should be doing.”

Community Safety Minister Sylvia Jones added that the Liberal changes to police oversight laws actively undermined policing efforts and public trust in officers.

“Police will no longer be treated like they’re guilty until proven innocent,” she said.

Also in the PC’s sights was a Liberal proposal to fine cops who didn’t comply with SIU investigations up to $50,000.

Now, the fines have been lowered to $5,000 for a first incident, $10,000 for the second.

In addition, the new legislation is taking on much of Justice Michael Tulloch’s proposals on policing, including mandating new cops receive training in human rights, systemic racism, diversity and the Indigenous community.

One aspect of the Liberals’ plan that the Tories are keeping is the First Nations policing provisions that give First Nations greater choice in how their police services are delivered.

The Canadian Civil Liberties Association said the changes gut police oversight, calling it a capitulation to police associations.",Tories dismantle 'unfair' and most 'anti-police' bill ever - Toronto Sun,Torontosun.com,https://torontosun.com/news/provincial/tories-dismantle-unfair-and-most-anti-police-bill-ever
134,Empty,2019-02-20T17:43:35Z,'We're not haters',"OTTAWA — Hundreds of angry energy sector workers arrived in Canada’s capital Tuesday in their big rigs after a week-long trek from Canada’s oil country of Alberta to protest the Trudeau government’s economic policies.

The “United We Roll” convoy stopped right in front of Parliament Hill and blocked traffic on Wellington St. for the day, generating a counter-protest by local Antifa activists who carried signs emblazoned with the Communist hammer and sickle symbols. There was some shouting but no violence as Ottawa police stood nearby to monitor the activity.

The protest received criticism from some mainstream media saying the event was tainted by political extremism. Protestors’ rhetoric during the event, however, did not support this contention.

The Official Opposition Conservatives attended the event with leader Andrew Scheer speaking to the crowd of roughly 500 people, saying, “We’re fighting for you. We’re standing with you.” Peoples Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier also addressed the protesters.

Protestors are hoping the Liberal Party will get rid of its carbon tax and two bills (C-48 and C-69)— one that will give the Canadian government more power to assess energy projects and another that will ban oil tankers from northern British Colombia.

The protest comes at a difficult time for Trudeau, who is increasingly distracted by a major judicial scandal that prompted the resignation Monday of his principal secretary. (RELATED: Trudeau Principal Secretary Gerald Butts Quits In Wake Of Judicial Scandal)

Although the convoy came from Calgary, some people came from the other side of Canada. Timothy MacDougall arrived Monday from New Brunswick. He told The Daily Caller that the protest is all about getting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s attention: “He’s not serving the people. . . . He has his own agenda and he doesn’t seem to care what Canadians are concerned about: our future, our children’s future”

MacDougall said it was imperative to get the Trans Mountain pipeline built from Edmonton to Vancouver to export oil. Even though Trudeau nationalized the project last summer, construction has not moved and “the politicians need to get off their butts.” (RELATED: Trudeau Worries About The ‘Impacts’ Of ‘Male Construction Workers’ On ‘Gender Lens’)

“We’re here to show that we’re proud Canadians and we’re not haters we’re not racists, we’re not the bigots that they say we are. We are just simply proud Canadians who are looking out for our future,” he said.

Steve Bacovsky who owns Calgary’s National Motor Coach took the trip because, as he stated, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “is our problem now. It can’t take 10 years to get a pipeline built.”

Bacovsky noted that 10 oil companies have left Canada since Trudeau became prime minister in 2015. He also told the Caller that Trudeau’s carbon tax is “unfair” and will increase pressure on Canada’s energy sector.

Trudeau avoided the protest and did not make an appearance.

135,Empty,2019-02-19T19:48:03Z,Canada is facing renewed pressure to keep its military helicopters in Mali until a relief force of Romanian aircraft arrives in October.,"Canada is facing renewed pressure to keep its military helicopters in Mali until a relief force of Romanian aircraft arrives in October.

Last week, members of the all-party House of Commons defence committee heard the appeals directly from a senior United Nations representative and government officials in the troubled west African country.

The committee conducted a week-long fact-finding mission in both Mali and neighbouring Senegal — a high-security visit that was carried out under a media blackout.

New Democrat MP Randall Garrison told CBC News on Tuesday that the committee met with Mahamat Saleh Annadif, who heads the UN stabilization mission in Mali.

Peacekeeping gap

Annadif warned the MPs that the peacekeeping mission would have to scale back operations during the gap between the Canadians leaving and the Romanians arriving.

The issue first surfaced last fall, when the UN made quiet overtures to Canada to keep two CH-147F Chinooks and four CH-146 Griffon armed helicopters temporarily in place.

The Canadian aircraft are slated to cease operations at the end of July, even though their Romanian replacements won't arrive in Gao — the principal UN base in the north of the country — for three months.

The notion of an extension was dismissed during Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's whirlwind trip in December to visit aircrew taking part in the mission.

The Liberal government has not budged from that position. The Opposition Conservatives have long argued that Mali, the UN's deadliest ongoing peacekeeping deployment, is the wrong mission for Canada.

""Both the Liberals and Conservatives [on the committee] heard quite clearly what people were saying,"" Garrison said. ""It reduces MINUSMA operations and risks lives to have such a big gap.""

Military and government officials travelling with the prime minister in December pointed out that the UN has the option to contract private helicopter support and noted there was a month-long gap in operations when the Canadians replaced the Germans last summer.

""Everybody was pretty clear, [private contractors] provide less service and they don't go when there is active fire. So it's not quite the same,"" said Garrison, who added he intends to introduce a motion before the defence committee calling on the Liberal government to remain in Mali until Sept. 15, when the gap will be more manageable for the UN.

A spokeswoman for Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan's office confirmed Tuesday the government's position has not changed and the pull-out date remains fixed.

UN and Malian officials also expressed concerns about the Liberal government's unfulfilled commitment, made last summer, to deploy 20 police officers to bolster the UN and European Union training missions.

The police mission

Two Canadian police officers are currently on the ground in Mali, while an additional three will join them sometime this month, he said.

When the deployment was announced last July, senior government officials speaking on background did not give a timeline because planning had only just gotten started. They did, however, emphasize the important role female police officers have played in past peacekeeping missions by advising on local gender-related matters.

Adding police — particularly female officers — to the mission would help meet one of the Liberal government's signature goals: putting women at the centre of a renewed international peacekeeping effort, which is also a stated aim of the UN Security Council.

Garrison said MPs heard praise for the example Canada has set on gender parity.

""Women have a prominent role and there was lots of acknowledgement that that is something that needs to be seen.""

Avoiding a failed state

The MPs were also asked by Malian government officials — including the president of the country's national assembly and the minister for peace and reconciliation — to consider specific bilateral help to reform and improve the country's security sector, including police.

The Canadians also were told Mali needs help with disarming, demobilizing and re-integrating the various fighters and factions in the country's complex civil war.

""I think it's in Canada's interest to avoid a failed state in Mali,"" said Garrison, who is one of the co-deputy chairs of the defence committee.

""It became pretty clear there would be an enormous humanitarian crisis. There would be refugee flows. There would be a safe haven for jihadists. There would be drug trafficking, human trafficking. It's a huge disaster if Mali fails and then its neighbours go down.""",Commons committee hears UN appeal to extend Mali mission,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mali-united-nations-peacekeeping-1.5024968
136,Empty,2019-02-19T22:10:34Z,"The SNC-Lavalin affair raises fundamental questions about how decisions to prosecute are made, and what role elected politicians should have in that process -- if any at all.","The ongoing controversy regarding the prosecution of Canadian engineering company SNC-Lavalin raises fundamental questions about how decisions to prosecute are made and what role elected politicians should have in that process.

The scandal has resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts, amid allegations the Prime Minister’s Office pressured its former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to resolve criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin by a deferred prosecution agreement.

Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council Office and Canada’s top civil servant, has also weighed in, testifying to a House of Commons committee that no undue pressure was exerted on Wilson-Raybould.

My research investigates how accountability, transparency and control of prosecutorial discretion can be structured, an interest inspired by my work as a former prosecutor in British Columbia. In relation to political control over individual decisions, my findings suggest that the risks of partisan political influence on the process are significant.

In Canada, even if there is sufficient evidence to proceed, prosecution must be in the public interest. This test is highly discretionary and depends on the facts of the case.

Looking at publicly available policies from jurisdictions throughout England, Canada and Australia, I found three categories of factors that influence the decision to prosecute: the seriousness of the offence, the expected results of the prosecution (the sentence, for example) and the effects of the prosecution itself (harm to a vulnerable victim, for example).

Assessing the impact

The decision may involve issues of broad public policy or specialized government knowledge, such as an impact on foreign relations or, in the SNC-Lavalin case, the effects of prosecuting a large company that employs thousands of people.

(CP PICTURE ARCHIVE)

The Supreme Court of Canada has recognized it would be unconstitutional for the partisan interests of a political party to determine who is or isn’t prosecuted for an alleged crime.

The dangers of partisan political influence is that, simply put, the allies of a political party may be shielded from prosecution and their enemies may be subject to it.

This risk materialized in Canada most notoriously in 1964 during what was known as the Rivard affair.

Lucien Rivard faced extradition to the United States on charges of drug trafficking. Senior ministerial officials in Lester B. Pearson’s government pressured counsel for the U.S. to agree to Rivard’s release on bail, including an offered bribe of $20,000. The attorney general of Canada, Guy Favreau, resigned following an inquiry that criticized his decision not to prosecute any of the officials involved.

The Shawcross Doctrine

By their nature, decisions on whether to proceed with a prosecution involve allegations that are not tested in court, nor is the full record available for public review. So how can the public be confident that partisan political interests do not affect the decision?

The Shawcross Doctrine is a statement in the House of Lords in 1951 by Hartley Shawcross, the attorney general of England at the time. It asserts that the decision to prosecute is that of the attorney general alone. Wernick, in fact, mentioned the doctrine in his recent testimony.

The doctrine recognizes, however, that the process of determining if a prosecution is in the public interest cannot always be made by the prosecutor in isolation. But Shawcross emphasized that the attorney general should control that process:

“In order to inform himself, he may, although I do not think he is obliged to, consult with any of his colleagues in the government …. the assistance of his colleagues is confined to informing him of particular considerations which might affect his own decision, and does not consist and must not consist, in telling him what the decision ought to be. The responsibility for the eventual decision rests upon the Attorney-General, and he is not to be put, and is not put, under pressure by his colleagues in the matter.”

The Shawcross Doctrine has been widely accepted throughout English common-law countries. However, it cannot be compared to law, either legislation or case law. Rather, it’s a description of the understandings and practice that a constitutional convention flows from.

There are differences between the position of England’s attorney general in the 1950s and in Canada today. That includes the Canadian attorney general’s position in the cabinet and the introduction of a federal Director of Public Prosecutions, whose office handles most prosecutorial decisions. But the attorney general retains the power to issue directions.

Prosecution & politics: What’s the practice?

Surprisingly few cases explore the intersection between politics and prosecution.

Notable exceptions include the Campbell affair of 1924 (which may have contributed to the fall of England’s labour government), the 1977 resignation of Australian attorney general Bob Ellicott (who cited attempts by the government to control his discretion) and the 2007 termination of an investigation into the conduct of BAE Systems Plc, a weapons manufacturer, by the U.K.‘s Serious Fraud Office on the grounds that proceeding could damage the country’s national security interests.

Each of these cases has been studied by scholars (see the work of professors John Edwards and Philip Stenning in particular) for what they can tell us about practice at a particular time and place. But the list of cases that reach the public in full detail is a short one.

The controversy surrounding the SNC-Lavalin prosecution is in its early days and hopefully more information will emerge.

But scrutiny of the relationship between politics and prosecution is critical because practice, not doctrines, is the foundation of prosecutorial independence from partisan politics. With that independence rests the integrity of the entire justice system.",The SNC-Lavalin scandal and the politics of prosecution,Theconversation.com,http://theconversation.com/the-snc-lavalin-scandal-and-the-politics-of-prosecution-111778

The NDP leader is running for a seat in the House of Commons in Burnaby South, one of three federal ridings holding byelections today.

Many New Democrats believe it’s a do-or-die contest – that Singh cannot lead his party in this fall’s general election if he can’t get himself a seat in Parliament.

Singh is hoping a victory tonight will give him much-needed visibility in the Commons in the run-up to the national vote in October, and put to rest grumbling within the NDP about his underwhelming performance since being chosen leader almost 18 months ago.

But Singh’s problems go well beyond his lack of visibility on the main stage of federal politics. The former Ontario provincial politician has faced criticism about his seeming unfamiliarity with federal issues and his handling of internal caucus matters – particularly his decision to kick Saskatchewan MP Erin Weir out of caucus for alleged misconduct, which has infuriated many NDP stalwarts in the province seen as the cradle of the party.

Under his leadership, the NDP has plunged to its lowest standings in public opinion polls since 2000, when it won just 13 seats. The party is mired in debt and its fundraising is sluggish. At least 11 of the 44 MPs who won seats for the party in 2015 have announced they won’t seek re-election this fall.

While many NDP eyes will be glued to Burnaby South tonight, an arguably better gauge of the party’s election-year viability will be going on in Outremont – the Montreal riding vacated last summer by Singh’s predecessor, Tom Mulcair.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 byelection. His victory turned Outremont into a beachhead for the NDP, which helped to launch the so-called orange wave that swept the province in 2011 and boosted the party to official Opposition status for the first time in its history. While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

The betting among political insiders is that the Liberals will retake Outremont, which would be a welcome boost for the governing party’s morale in the midst of the SNC-Lavalin controversy – and a particularly bitter loss for the NDP. The symbolism of losing their erstwhile beachhead would only reinforce polls suggesting New Democrats are in danger of being wiped out altogether in Quebec this fall.

But the blow would be softened, at least, if Singh is able to capture Burnaby South.

It’s no sure thing. The B.C. riding is not a natural home for Singh, who formerly represented Brampton in the Ontario legislature. Nor is it a safe NDP riding: New Democrat Kennedy Stewart, who resigned to become mayor of Vancouver, took the riding in 2015 with just over 600 votes more than his Liberal opponent, with the Conservative candidate not far behind.

While the byelection is thought to be a three-way race, being a party leader should give Singh an edge. The fact that the Green party has chosen not to run a candidate should also help.

Moreover, the Liberals did themselves no favours by dumping their original candidate amid controversy over her suggestion that Singh being of “Indian descent” could help her win. The current Liberal contender, Richard T. Lee, could face headwinds of a different kind, created by the ongoing furor over allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould – who represents a nearby Vancouver riding – to halt a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

WATCH: Unpacking the politics of the SNC-Lavalin affair

The third byelection is being held in the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe, left vacant by the retirement of Peter Van Loan, who had held the seat for the Conservatives since 2004. He won with a healthy 50 per cent of the votes in 2015, and the Tories are expected to easily hang on tonight.

All three contests will give the Conservatives a glimpse of what, if any damage, they might sustain from the advent of the breakaway People’s Party of Canada, formed by one-time Tory leadership contender Maxime Bernier.

The company's lawyers acted so quickly to position their client for a so-called remediation agreement that they contacted prosecutors weeks before lawmakers, even Liberals, were even aware the Trudeau government had tucked the legislation into its 582-page omnibus budget bill.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction firm is at the centre of a controversy that has enveloped the Prime Minister's Office. Since last week, the government has seen the high-profile resignations of one cabinet member — former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, who became the minister of veterans affairs in January — and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's principal secretary, Gerald Butts.

SNC-Lavalin worked hard to avoid criminal proceedings by proposing a remediation agreement, but in September the prosecutor's office declined to invite the company to negotiate. A guilty verdict on bribery and corruption charges has been characterized as an existential threat for SNC-Lavalin and its employees because the company would be barred from bidding on government contracts in Canada for 10 years. Much of its work is in designing, building and operating public infrastructure.

The company lobbied federal officials, including in the Prime Minister's Office, to put remediation agreements into the law in the first place. The tools, known as deferred prosecution agreements in other jurisdictions, had already been enacted in the United States and the United Kingdom.

The Globe and Mail newspaper has reported that Wilson-Raybould came under pressure from staff in the Prime Minister's Office to step in and help SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution related to contracts in Libya.

Early in 2018, SNC-Lavalin wasted little time making its case for a remediation agreement with prosecutors.

Court documents filed last month by the firm's lawyers say they contacted the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ""in or about the month of April 2018, shortly after the Government of Canada introduced the proposed legislative changes to implement a remediation agreement regime.""

This would have been weeks before many lawmakers — including at least one Liberal — tasked with studying the amendment were even aware of its existence.

Seeking remediation

Last May, members of the all-party parliamentary committee examining the large budget bill said they only learned about the remediation-regime proposal after it was brought to their attention during testimony of a Justice Department official. Those included Greg Fergus, the Liberal MP for Hull-Aylmer in Quebec, who said at the time that he hadn't noticed the provision when trying to grasp the document.

While the company's effort began months before the amendment came into force last September, the documents say federal prosecutors declined to ""undertake formal steps towards a remediation agreement regarding this matter (or any other) prior to the enactment of the legislation.""

""The purpose of this contact, and of the discussions which followed, was to ensure that the (Director of Public Prosecutions) possessed all relevant information the applicants could provide in relation to the eventual issuance of an invitation to negotiate a remediation agreement, once the enabling legislation was in force,"" SNC-Lavalin's legal team wrote in the court documents, which were obtained by The Canadian Press.

From there, over the next three months, the documents say federal prosecutors engaged with SNC-Lavalin's lawyers and requested they provide detailed information. The company's legal team argued in the documents that it believed SNC-Lavalin easily met the criteria to receive an invitation to negotiate a remediation agreement — and it made ""repeated submissions to this effect"" to prosecutors.

A letter contained in the court filings shows that Trudeau met with Wilson-Raybould almost two weeks after federal prosecutors informed SNC-Lavalin it would not be invited to negotiate a settlement.

The letter shows the director of public prosecutions told SNC-Lavalin last Sept. 4 about its decision. Trudeau has said that he spoke with Wilson-Raybould about the SNC-Lavalin case 13 days later, on Sept. 17.

The Sept. 4 decision date adds new information to the timeline of events. Until now, it had appeared that Trudeau spoke with Wilson-Raybould before the prosecutor's decision not to proceed with the settlement negotiation. SNC-Lavalin publicly announced it had been refused a negotiation Oct. 10.

This week’s edition of the Culture Wars takes us into some strange territory of twisted logic and musings from the whack jobs on the Left.

It’s All Trump’s Fault

According to Rep. Al Green who looks like he’d be a really good soul singer circa 1972, the shenanigans of politicians in Virginia are all attributable to President Trump. He is so worked up about Democrats dressing in blackface and/or KKK garb that he is calling for the impeachment of a Republican President over the actions of Democratic politicians! In fact, Green has apparently created a term for this: “trickle down bigotry.”

Meanwhile, Over at Yale University…

Isis Davis-Marks is a “journalist” at Yale University who writes for a newspaper, the Yale Daily News. Ms. Davis-Marks is coming after every white person out there. When they appear on CNN or wherever, she says, she’s taking notes on their behaviors from years past and will have no shame in revealing the racist intent behind every utterance by a white boy. Says the crazy moonbat: “I’m watching you, white boy. And this time, I’m taking the screenshot.”

Not To Be Outdone…

Leda Fisher, another aspiring journalist at Dickinson College who looks like she could benefit from a celery-only diet, had this headline: “Should White Boys Still Be Allowed to Talk?” She says that in honor of Black History Month, every real black person should make a vow not to listen to white boys about anything, especially politics. She’s so adamant, she even used the phrase “Godd***” in the article. Oooohhh…

And While On the Subject of Race…

Pramila Jayapal is a despicable liberal Congresscritter from Washington state. Obviously in favor of paying reparations to the 5% of current African-Americans who can trace their ancestors to slaves in America, Jayapal believes that reparations should extend beyond just blacks. Jayapal believes that the government owes reparations to families who entered the country illegally. They screech: “The US government should make reparations for what we have done to these families.”

California Democrats Change Language

The California Democratic Party is splitting its delegates into two categories based on gender. Henceforth, there will be the “Self-Identified Female” category and the “Male/Other Than Self-Identified Female” category. This comes on the heels of the state Senate banning the use of the offensive words “he” and “she” in committee hearings. Perhaps, they should add a third category: “Certifiable Freaks.”

Only in America

Eight illegal immigrants who were caught entering the country are suing the government for millions claiming “trauma” and “inexplicable cruelty.” The government has six months to respond before they can carry through with their claims that ICE intentionally harmed children to “advance a policy objective.” The Left is, if nothing else, original.

He Gets the Last Laugh

Dave Assman (pronounced Oss-man) applied for a vanity plate bearing his last name with authorities in Saskatchewan. The government denied the request claiming it was an “unacceptable slogan.” Exercising his free speech rights while they still exist in Canada, he adorned the back of his pick up with a decal bearing his infamous name in the shape of a Saskatchewan license plate.

When the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in 2016, two-thirds of voters in Scotland—across every single district—voted to remain. Now, as Brexit looms, many experts expect Scotland to forge a more distinct role on the global stage—one that could lead it to independence.

Westminster and the devolved Scottish Parliament differ on a number of issues related to Brexit, beginning with immigration. While anti-immigration sentiment among Brits helped power the Brexit vote, the Scottish government has welcomed newcomers as a solution to an aging population and seeks closer ties with Europe.

“The difference between Scotland and England is only going to grow,” said Kirsty Hughes, the director of the Scottish Centre on European Relations.

In a speech in Washington, D.C., earlier this month, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon spoke of how the reintroduction of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 had allowed the nation to “chart a different course” from the rest of the country on domestic issues, while also raising Scotland’s international profile.

Last year the Scottish government opened innovation and investment offices in Paris and Berlin, and the most recent Scottish trade statistics released at the end of January show that while the United Kingdom remains Scotland’s largest export market, the pace of growth in exports to the EU is more than double that to the rest of the United Kingdom.

“We’re already taking steps to make sure that Brexit doesn’t isolate Scotland and see us turn inward rather than continue to look outward. The expansion of our presence, mainly across Europe but also in the United States and Canada, is all part of that,” Sturgeon told Foreign Policy.

The electorate in Scotland has historically tacked left of center, and this has been reflected in its politics.

“I think Scotland as a whole is, its political culture is very different to the political culture south of the border. It is still a bastion, an increasingly rare bastion … of the old liberal international order, of multinationalism, interest in international cooperation, a view of solidarity across borders for the greater global good,” said Mariot Leslie, a retired diplomat who last served as the U.K.’s permanent representative to NATO.

While authority over foreign policy, immigration, and defense is held by Westminster, the Scottish government, which has been dominated by center-left parties, has sought to make its mark on global affairs.

“Scotland is seen as a small, plucky independent country which has more neutral status. It’s not actually a P5 player with a hard power stick. It’s seen in that more Scandinavian way as a country which is open,” said Mark Muller, a senior mediation advisor to the United Nations Department of Political Affairs who established the Beyond Borders Scotland festival for international dialogue.

On domestic and international issues, governments led by the Scottish National Party have repeatedly suggested that Scotland could play a role similar to that of their Nordic neighbors to the north—small but responsible global citizens that take a strong role on issues of the environment and human rights.

The Scottish government has sought to make the nation a world leader in renewable energy, aiming to have 100 percent of Scotland’s electricity needs met by renewables by 2020. In 2017, the year for which most recent data are available, renewables met 70 percent of Scotland’s electricity demands.

Without control over foreign policy, it can “make it easier to be progressive,” Hughes said.

Daniel Kenealy, a lecturer in politics at the University of Edinburgh who has served as an advisor to the Scottish Parliament’s European and External Relations Committee, said that the Scottish National Party, which has held the largest share of seats in the Scottish Parliament since 2011, is in essence always in campaign mode on issues of foreign policy and defense—without having to implement their proposals.

“They have been really quite skillful, I think at least, at using foreign-policy issues and external affairs-type issues to further their narrative of an independent nation with a distinctive set of interests,” he said.

While the Scottish government welcomes immigration, opinion polls show that voters don’t differ too sharply from the rest of the United Kingdom on the issue of immigration—the lightning rod issue of the Brexit vote—Hughes said.

But underscoring Scotland’s differences with the rest of the United Kingdom may further the Scottish National Party’s goal of eventually securing a successful independence referendum, Kenealy said.

“You can do a lot with the imagination of difference. … If you come to the conclusion that your interests as a nation are exactly or pretty much exactly the same as the bigger nation of which you are a part, well then there’s no point in being independent,” he said.

A referendum on Scottish independence failed 55 percent to 45 percent in 2014. The question of whether an independent Scotland would automatically become a member of the European Union was a subject of lively debate with no real conclusion that year. So far, Brexit has not prompted a surge in support for Scottish independence, but that could change depending on the terms under which Britain leaves the EU.

No timetable for a second independence referendum has been confirmed, and the first minister is expected to only pursue another vote if opinion polls indicate that it could pass.

“Until we know where the U.K. is going with Brexit, it’s difficult to know where Scotland might go,” said Michael Keating, the director for the Center of Constitutional Change at the University of Edinburgh.

Many of the who spoke with FP underscored the uncertainty that still hangs over Brexit, with just over five weeks to go until the March 29 withdrawal date—that, in turn, makes it difficult to predict how it will impact Scotland.

“Scottish politics to me seems relatively normal, as sort of democratic Western politics goes, and British, London, Westminster politics is highly abnormal and in a deep, deep crisis,” Hughes said.

Muller, the U.N. mediation expert, said that the Scotland’s recent history of undergoing devolution and a two-year public debate on independence had helped to solidify the nation’s view of itself.

“Scotland’s had a robust conversation with itself in light of all this constitutional reform and is therefore much more confident about what its role is in the world,” he said.

In the run-up to the independence vote in 2014, “you couldn’t stand in a supermarket queue or sit on the bus without hearing perfect strangers talking about issues of Scotland, what happens next, how do we govern ourselves, what sort of people do we want to be, what’s our place in the world,” said Leslie, the retired diplomat.

“You get the impression in England that it is only finally now coming to terms with some of the big questions about the U.K.’s role in the world, post-colonial role in the world,” Muller added.",Scotland’s Marriage of Inconvenience,Foreignpolicy.com,http://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/19/scotlands-marriage-inconvenience-brexit-independence-nicola-sturgeon/
142,Empty,2019-02-23T09:00:00Z,"It is fitting that the Orange Wave's last stand will begin Monday, with a byelection in the Quebec riding where it all started, Outremont.","In 2007, Tom Mulcair — then in self-imposed exile from Quebec politics — pulled off an unlikely win in a federal byelection, taking the Liberal stronghold of Outremont for the NDP.

It was only the second time the NDP had won a seat in Quebec. But from this narrow beachhead, Mulcair and then leader Jack Layton dramatically grew their support in the province.

Their effort, of course, culminated in the Orange Wave, when the party won 59 of Quebec's 75 seats in the 2011 general election and stormed into Opposition.

Since then, though, NDP support in Quebec has slowly frittered away.

Under Mulcair's leadership, it was cut down to 16 seats in the 2015 election. Early predictions ahead of this fall's contest suggest the party won't win more than a handful of seats, if that.

It is fitting, then, that the Orange Wave's last stand seems to have begun with a byelection Monday in the riding where it all started: Outremont.

Mulcair's shadow

The seat became open when Mulcair quit federal politics last summer, after carrying much of the blame for the party's disappointing performance in 2015.

Julia Sanchez, a former international development executive who lived in Ottawa for many years before recently moving back to Outremont, is now carrying the NDP banner.

She acknowledged the former leader's shadow still looms large in the riding. His name, she said, ""comes up all the time. People were proud of Thomas Mulcair.""

One name that doesn't come up much in the riding, or elsewhere in Quebec, is the NDP's current leader, Jagmeet Singh.

His profile is particularly low in the province, and he was last spotted in Outremont in December.

Singh has been spending most of his time on his own byelection race in Burnaby South, where a loss Monday could be fatal to his leadership.

Sanchez, meanwhile, has been counting on support from the remaining local NDP heavyweights.

Montreal MPs Hélène Laverdière and Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet — two Orange Wavers who won't run in the next election — have been stumping for her. So too has Charles Taylor, the 87-year-old philosopher who has run for the party several times.

""If we can get our people, our base, out to vote … then we will win,"" Sanchez said during a recent interview at a cafe in the riding.

But the party's sympathizers are tempering their expectations ahead of Monday's vote.

""In this byelection the NDP is actually the underdog,"" said Karl Bélanger, a former NDP strategist who worked closely with Layton and Mulcair.

""If the NDP finishes with a strong second place, that would already be a win for the party.""

The most likely scenario on Monday, in his view, is for Outremont to return to the Liberal fold. Before Mulcair's win in 2007, the Grits had held the riding almost continuously since the 1935 election.

The Liberal candidate, Rachel Bendayan, a lawyer and former party staffer, ran against Mulcair in the last election, finishing second by more than 10 points.

This time, she said, she benefits not only from a bit of name recognition, but also the record of the Trudeau government, pointing to investments in public transit, social housing and the Canada Child Benefit.

The Liberals, though, are heading into Monday's three byelections weighed down by the controversy surrounding the government's alleged interference in the prosecution of Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin, which is accused of bribing Libyan officials.

Several recent polls suggest Liberal support has suffered in the wake of the scandal, and they are now in a dead heat nationally with the Conservatives.

Bendayan, though, doesn't believe the scandal is registering with voters in Outremont. ""I haven't heard much about it at the doors,"" she said.

A test of progressive bona fides

Outremont, in many ways, is an atypical riding in Quebec, so the results of Monday's vote may offer little foresight of what will happen in October's federal election.

French-speakers make up less than 50 per cent of Outremont's population, according to 2011 census figures. There are large communities of immigrants in one part of the riding; affluent francophones and progressive-leaning students in another.

Though the Conservatives, the Bloc Québécois, the Greens and Maxime Bernier's upstart People's Party of Canada are all running candidates, none of them is expected to be a factor.

It is, for all intents and purposes, a two-way race between the NDP and the Liberals.

With candidates for both parties indicating the environment is a major concern of voters, the Outremont byelection is providing a test of their progressive bona fides.

""People would like to see action on the environment, and they are very happy to have the leadership of the current Liberal government, particularly when we introduced the price on pollution,"" Bendayan said.

Sanchez, the NDP candidate, countered that the Liberals sacrificed their claim to climate leadership when the government bought the Trans Mountain pipeline.

""It really triggers disbelief, confusion and disillusionment,"" she said. ""How is it possible we spent all this money to buy an old pipeline?""

But the import of these policy differences may be offset by the low voter turnout that tends to characterize byelections, especially those in the dead of winter.

""That's when the machines come into play,"" said Bélanger, the former NDP strategist, referring to the organizational resources parties can mobilize on election day.

Nine candidates are vying to replace Peter Van Loan as the new federal Member of Parliament for the riding and all eyes will be on the PPC to see how many votes they take away from the Conservatives, and whether it would be enough to tip the riding toward the Liberals or NDP.

Van Loan, a member of the Conservative Party, announced his retirement in September after 14 years as the representative of the riding — long considered a Tory stronghold.

Scot Davidson, the new Conservative Party candidate, said he's feeling confident.

""This is really a referendum on the Liberal government,"" said Davidson, a local entrepreneur from the town of Georgina.

Today, byelections will be held in ridings across the country including York–Simcoe in Ontario, Outremont in Quebec and Burnaby South in B.C. (CBC)

The York-Simcoe riding was one of three federal byelections called by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Jan. 9.

Davidson has positioned himself as a businessman looking to apply his skills in helping industries grow, with a keen interest in supporting agriculture.

""Let's face it, this riding being so close to Toronto is a place where farmers themselves want to expand and look at even food processing. It's something that I can bring to the table and help facilitate,"" Davidson said.

He says he's not worried about being new to politics but rather sees it as an asset, insisting that he has ""young legs, I'm ready to run.""

Liberal candidate Shaun Tanaka went head-to-head against Van Loan in the last federal election but fell short.

This time, the mother of two says she's back and has a better chance than ever.

""We increased the Liberal voter turnout by 400 per cent,"" she told CBC News, referring to the last federal election.

""When I asked the family whether I should take this on again because it's a big ask of the entire family, the boys said to me, 'You totally should, because this time you're going to win.'""

Shaun Tanaka is hopeful the headway she made in 2015's federal election will result in a Liberal upset this time around. (CBC)

Tanaka said she isn't worried about the SNC Lavalin scandal currently plaguing the prime minister.

""I am really focused on York-Simcoe, because that's where I'm running. And I'm not hearing it at the doors,"" she said.

""What I'm hearing at the doors [is] that it's hard to raise a family. I'm hearing at the doors that they are concerned about the health of Lake Simcoe,"" said Tanaka, adding that ""I want to be that voice in Ottawa.""

NDP candidate Jessa McLean says she can be the voice of the local working class who are struggling. (Jessa McLean)

NDP candidate Jessa McLean says she's the voice of the working class.

She's a community organizer in the region and a champion of the ""$15 and Fairness"" campaign to push the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

""Our housing rates have gone up the most in terms of Ontario,"" she said.

""Rentals are up 56 per cent while our wages are only up 11 per cent.""

""That generation is so bright, and so exciting. [They] haven't been corrupted yet,"" he said.

""That's where I think Bernier has sort of said, 'Listen, our platform is unfinished because there's some really exciting things we can do if we don't burden ourselves with the old baggage of before.""'

144,Empty,2019-02-24T16:50:21Z,Trump’s nationalism is jeopardizing the rights and safety of Chinese students. The post The Bitter Fruit of Trump’s China Bashing: Anti-Asian Racism appeared first on Truthout.,"Donald Trump’s New Cold War with Beijing has caught Chinese foreign students at U.S. universities in its crosshairs.

The Trump administration has tightened restrictions on their visas, accused them of spying for the Chinese state and its high tech giants, and in the process whipped up a climate of anti-Asian racism.

Trump’s policies yielded bitter fruit most recently at Duke University. The chair of the graduate program in biostatics, Megan Neely, in the wake of complaints from a faculty members about Chinese grad students “speaking Chinese (in their words VERY LOUDLY)” in the student lounge and study areas, wrote an email scolding students for speaking their native language.

She told students to “commit to using English 100 percent of the time” while in department buildings or “any other professional setting.” Even worse she warned them that if they didn’t it might impact their ability to get internships and jobs: “PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE keep these unintended consequences in mind when you choose to speak Chinese.”

This was not the first time that Neely had criticized students for speaking a language besides English in their private time. Last year she sent a message to all the biostatistics students saying, “I don’t like being the language police [but] … speaking in your native language in the department may give faculty the impression that you are not trying to improve your English skills and that you are not taking this opportunity seriously.”

She also warned of “potential downstream effects” that might compromise their professional advancement in the biostatics program and their employability.

These were no idle threats. The two professors whose complaints prompted her most recent email asked for and received photographs of the Chinese students from Neely with the expressed intent of discriminating against them.

Chinese students were shocked by this blatant racism. One PhD student in Chemistry, Chi Liu, said, “All of us are angry. We feel offended. You have this email to the Chinese students saying … if you speak Chinese you will be remembered and identified, and that will affect your performance. That is very serious.”

Duke’s Asian American Student Organization and International Association issued a joint statement that pointed out, “For international students, speaking in their mother tongue is a means of comfort and familiarity with a home and culture that is oftentimes suppressed within the United States. … Within the bounds of one’s personal conversations, people should wholeheartedly be able to speak any language they wish — to strip away this agency is demeaning, disrespectful, and wholly discriminatory.”

Neely’s shocking email provoked a wave of criticism at the university. A group of “concerned students” created a petition, which demanded the school investigate Neely and the two professors collected over 2,000 signatures from the campus community.

The uproar even spread to China. On the country’s equivalent of Twitter, Weibo, the hashtag “Duke University Bans Speaking Chinese” was viewed over 6.7 million times.

Caught in a spiraling scandal, Duke demoted Neely from her chair position and issued an apology. The dean of the medical school, Dr. Mary Klotman wrote, “To be clear: there is absolutely no restriction or limitation on the language you use to converse and communicate with each other. Your career opportunities and recommendations will not in any way be influenced by the language you use outside the classroom. And your privacy will always be protected.”

Duke may have resolved this crisis for now, but Trump’s New Cold War will only provoke more attacks on Chinese students. He has raised tariffs on China’s exports to the US, targeted its companies with sanctions and has begun a military buildup to confront Beijing.

Trump is extending his economic nationalist program against China into the higher education system.

Universities and colleges are directly integrated into the American state through funding as well ties to the military-industrial complex. As a result, the higher education system is linked to the interests of American capitalist class and its imperial domination of the world. Universities and colleges are what Hal Draper called knowledge factories that reproduce the ideas of the dominant class, generate scientific innovations for corporations, and also train different classes for their roles in ruling, managing and working in American capitalism.

During the period of neoliberal globalization, however, the US higher education has undergone a transformation both in function and student composition. First, it became increasingly internationalized, creating connections with higher education systems of other countries.

Second, the increasing privatization of public universities has opened them to a growing number of foreign students, especially ones from China. States across the country have cut funding, universities have dramatically raised tuition, and students have gone into massive debt—now over $1.3 trillion—to afford a degree.

In the wake of the Great Recession, both public and private universities have suffered declining enrollment as American students balk at the enormous debt entailed in getting a degree. Higher education bosses have made up for that drop by luring foreign students who pay full tuition, room and board to attend their undergraduate and graduate programs.

This isn’t simply lucrative for some universities, it’s essential at a time when many, including prestigious institutions like Hampshire College, are struggling to keep their doors open.

As a result, the total foreign students in universities has doubled in the last two decades to over 1 million today. Chinese students have grown the fastest increasing by five fold since 2000 to over 360,000, about 35% of the total.

The overall value of this trade in students is estimated at $42.4 billion for the American economy, a sum greater than the $21.6 billion exports in soybeans and rivalling exports of $51 billion in pharmaceuticals and $53 billion in automobiles.

Duke is an example of the overall pattern. In their master’s program in biostatics heretofore overseen by Neely, Chinese students account for 36 out of a total of 55, and, in the whole graduate program, 1,300 out of 8,500.

Unsurprisingly, the Chinese ruling class and state have used this opening to advance their interests. The Chinese elite are now sending students to undergraduate and graduate programs.

These students overwhelmingly enter undergraduate and graduate programs in sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (the so-called STEM disciplines) as well business administration.

After graduation, some stay and staff key sectors of American big business particularly in high tech while others return to China to bolster the competitiveness of the country’s corporations.

The Chinese state has encouraged their high tech national champions like Huawei to establish contracts with U.S. research institutions to bolster their standing as world leaders in research and development.

At the same time, the Beijing is worried that their students might be influenced by liberal and radical ideas that might encourage them to challenge the Communist Party’s autocratic rule back home.

Therefore, Beijing has established about 150 chapters of the Chinese Students and Scholar Associations on campuses throughout the US. These both organize social activities for students as well as keep tabs on them.

China has established Confucian Institutes on over 100 campuses to promote Chinese language and culture, provide services for Chinese nationals teaching in the US, and facilitate cultural exchanges. They also use the institutes to influence American the universities, registering protest against speakers the state considers anti-Chinese like the exiled religious leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama.

The Communist Party also attempts to influence American academics portrayals of China by threatening to deny them visas to visit and conduct research in the country. For example, Andrew Nathan and Perry Link, editors of The Tiananmen Papers about the Communist Party’s massacre student and workers to quell the uprising in 1989, have been denied visas ever since the publication of their book.

In response, Trump has initiated a campaign against the Chinese state and its corporations influence over universities as well as against Chinese foreign students, their rights and their organizations. Trump aims to discipline the nation’s higher education system to serve “America First.”

Trump’s lapdog Mike Pence’s announced this offensive against “the enemy within” American universities in his speech at the Hudson Institute. Pence warned, “The Chinese Communist Party is rewarding or coercing American businesses, movie studios, universities, think tanks, scholars, journalists, and local, state, and federal officials.”

Pence charged China with creating a “culture of censorship” in universities. He complained that “Beijing provides generous funding to universities, think tanks, and scholars, with the understanding that they will avoid ideas that the Communist Party finds dangerous or offensive. China experts in particular know that their visas will be delayed or denied if their research contradicts Beijing’s talking points.”

Then — in formulations worthy of the poster “Is Your Washroom’s Breeding Bolsheviks?” — he denounced “the Chinese Students and Scholars Association” for alerting “Chinese consulates and embassies when Chinese students, and American schools, stray from the Communist Party line.”

Of course, all of this reeks of hypocrisy. Trump and the right are enemies of academic freedom and scientific thought. They are conducting McCarthyite attacks against progressive academics as advocates of “cultural Marxism,” policing students and academics who are advocates of Palestinian liberation, waging war on the humanities, and are aiming to reduce the function of every level of education to the narrow interests of the American state and corporations in dominating the world system.

Double talk aside, Trump has already begun implementing his plan. He has issued an order instructing public universities to terminate all contracts with Huawei or federal funding would be cut.

And the schools have all obeyed. For example, the University of California at Berkeley has banned any further research projects with Huawei, which has donated $7.8 million to the school over the last two years.

Trump has extended the attack on corporation to Chinese students. The US intelligence agencies are warning universities that they are spying for Beijing and stealing intellectual property for its state corporations and national champions.

To put a stop to this supposed threat, he has denied and delayed issuing visas to Chinese students and threatened to reduce visas for those studying robotics, aviation, and high tech.

Trump’s racist advisor, Stephen Miller, almost convinced the administration to impose a total ban on Chinese nationals studying in the US.

Far from standing up against Trump’s China bashing and protectionism, the Democratic Party, including its progressive and even socialist wing, has joined his chorus. Elizabeth Warren, for example, has denounced against the neoliberal establishment for promising that open markets would bring about democracy in China.

She wrote, “Policymakers promised that open markets would lead to open societies. Instead, efforts to bring capitalism to the global stage unwittingly helped create the conditions for competitors to rise up and lash out. Russia became belligerent and resurgent. China weaponized its economy without ever loosening its domestic political constraints.”

Similarly, Bernie Sanders, who has become a spokesperson for progressive internationalism, has in fact long advocated an economic nationalist program against China.

In 2011, for example, he denounced the Smithsonian Museum for selling busts of American presidents made in China. He complained “that a museum owned by the people of the United States, celebrating the history of the United States, cannot find companies in this country employing American workers that are able to manufacture statues of our founding fathers, or our current president.”

More recently he supported Trump’s tariff war with China, writing, “I strongly support imposing stiff penalties on countries like China, Russia, South Korea and Vietnam to prevent them from illegally dumping steel and aluminum into the U.S. and throughout the world.”

Such nationalism can only breed anti-Chinese and more generally anti-Asian racism. Barbara Ehrenreich plumbed the depths of such bigotry recently when she tweeted, “I will be convinced that America is not in decline only when our de-cluttering Marie Kondo learns to speak English.”

This xenophobia is only the latest expression of the toxic history of anti-Asian prejudices and laws that began with the Chinese Exclusion Act and continued through the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the racist demonization of the Vietnamese during the US war on their country, and the recent bigoted caricatures of Koreans during Trump’s stand-off with Kim Jung-un.

Unsurprisingly, the American political class’s China bashing has triggered a sharp increase in anti-Asian hate crimes and discrimination. NPR reports that “hate crimes against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders are rising exponentially. A report from the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations found that crimes targeting Asian-Americans tripled in that county between 2014 and 2015.”

And since the Trump administration’s rise to power, they increased ever more. There was a 20 percent increase in hate crimes against Asian-Pacific Americans in 2017.

Trump’s Islamophobia, immigrant bashing, and hostility to foreign students and specifically Chinese students drove down international enrollment by 3.3 percent in 2016 and by 6.6 percent in 2017.

Indian graduate school applications dropped by 12% in 2017. While Chinese student enrollment is still increasing it has begun to slow from an increase of 8.1 percent in 2014-15 to 6.8 percent in 2015-16 and 3.1 in 2017-2018.

Those that remain have soured on the US. One study by Purdue University found that the percentage of foreign students holding negative views of the US jumped from 29 percent in 2016 to 42 percent in 2018.

One anonymous student told the South China Post, “More students, including myself, have even considered returning to China as a plan B if we can’t find a job in the US, and some of them are searching for jobs in China simultaneously.”

But, as the Post notes, “the job market for new graduates on the other side of the globe is not much better, as Trump’s trade war begins to cause sweeping lay-offs and hiring freezes in China’s tech industry.” These students are thus caught between two powers struggling for dominance in a crisis-ridden system.

With Trump tearing at the internationalized structure of American higher education and trying to push out Chinese students, some universities and high tech businesses have begun to worry about a possible drop in the pool of Chinese students they can recruit from.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign went so far as take out a $60 million insurance policy to protect against any sudden drop in Chinese enrollment.

The conflict between the US and China is also spilling into other countries with educational systems with large Chinese student populations. For example, when Trump forced Canada to detain Huawei’s the chief financial officer, Meng Whanzhou, on charges that the company violated sanctions on Iran, China responded by threatening to withdraw all its 77,000 students if Ottawa sent Meng to the US to stand trial.

Chinese students account for a large share of the 40 percent increase in foreign students since 2013. These pay an average of $27, 159 a year in tuition—4 times what Canadian residents pay—and spend over $15 billion a year in Canada. Thus, they are an important part not just of the country’s big business in higher education but also the broader economy.

Moody’s Investors Services went so far as to warn “that the intensification of political tensions between the Government of Canada and the government of China poses credit risks for Canadian universities.”

Back in the US, university presidents became so concerned that 65 of them penned a letter supporting a legal challenge to Trump’s threat to ban international students for overstaying their visas.

Some high tech bosses have similarly protested about the loss of access to foreign students in American universities. They point to the fact that about a quarter of new companies worth a billion dollars were started by moguls who first came to the US as students.

Thomas Harnisch from the American Association of State Colleges and Universities said, “International graduate students are pivotal to our economic system, these students go on, many of them earn master’s degrees and PhDs in many highly-needed fields. They’re incredibly important not only to our universities, but our economy as well.”

But the logic of the spiraling inter-imperial rivalry between the US and China will likely continue to pry apart the inter-penetration of their educational systems. The US is already trying to retool its own education system to yield more American talent in the STEM fields and China may redirect its students to its own rapidly improving higher education institutions and those of countries less hostile to it.

Amidst this intensifying conflict, socialists must take a clear stand against China bashing no matter whether it comes from right-wing Republicans like Trump or progressives like Warren and Sanders; it is rank American nationalism that binds workers to their exploiters against their fellow workers in China.

Instead we must unite just like the Duke students did against the racist attacks on Chinese students, defend their right to speak their language of choice, agitate against any restrictions on their visas, and build a movement among both native and foreign students and workers for our common interests against the university bosses, their capitalist masters, and their state overseers.

Such organizing will also open up opportunities to build the international workers movement. Some of these students are part of the developing new left on universities in China that has suffered government repression for organizing solidarity with workers on strike. They should be considered part of our emerging new socialist movement.

We should build this common struggle without in any way supporting the Chinese state, which is a rising imperialist power in the world system that oversees the exploitation of its own population, the oppression of subject nations like Tibet and national minorities like the Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang, and increasingly exploits third world countries in pursuit of raw materials and outlets for its surplus capital.

The slogan for our solidarity movement must therefore be: “Neither Washington, Nor Beijing, But International Socialism.”

Three teachers published a response on Valerie Strauss’s “Answer Sheet” blog on the Washington Post website. They wrote that his words has a chilling effect on educators around the world.

Valerie Strauss wrote:

In this post, three teachers explain why Trump Jr.’s comment was more than simply mean.

Jelmer Evers of the Netherlands, Michael Soskil of the United States and Armand Doucet of Canada were featured authors in the 2018 book “Teaching in the Fourth Industrial Revolution: Standing at the Precipice.”

I wish it was not behind a paywall, along with the rest of the Washington Post, which is a great newspaper. I love its slogan: “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” We are living through one of the very dark moments of our nation’s history.

They wrote:

For teachers around the globe, this was a chilling moment.

In a stadium filled with people chanting “USA, USA,” the son of the president of the United States called for hostility toward teachers because of their so-called political leanings. This is a message you would expect in an authoritarian regime, not at a rally for the U.S. president.

As teachers, we come from varied backgrounds and political leanings, but there is an undeniable core to who we are and what we stand for. Teachers nurture, care and protect students. Teachers champion the pursuit of knowledge.

By working daily with young people, teachers are the stewards of the future. Whether Democratic or Republican, liberal or conservative, right, left, center, blue or red — seeing and reinforcing the value of a teacher should be a national pillar that rises high above partisan politics and cheap applause.

Throughout history, schools and teachers have always been among the first to be targeted by authoritarian regimes and extremists. Independent thinking, creativity, compassion and curiosity are threats to dogmatic beliefs and rule.

Many of our colleagues in countries ravaged by war or in shackled societies teach in difficult circumstances. They are often ruthlessly persecuted and even killed for providing a well-balanced education to children, which should be a basic human right.

Echoes of these authoritarian practices are increasingly being heard in democratic countries as well. In Germany, the radical right party Alternative for Germany has launched a website where students and parents can report “left-wing teachers.”

In the Netherlands, right-wing parliamentarians have called on students to out their socialist teachers because they were indoctrinating their students in “climate change propaganda.”

In Canada, Ontario Premier Doug Ford has accused student unions of “crazy Marxist nonsense” and has raised alarms by throwing out one of the most progressive sex education curriculums, which dealt with topics from consent, to gender identity to “sexting” in the age of social media.

In Hungary, textbooks are censored to follow the government’s nationalistic agenda. After years of denouncing teachers and schools, President Jair Bolsonaro’s first education policy in Brazil is to go after the “Marxist” curriculums, which bars teachers talking about feminism and LGBTQ issues.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has fired thousands of teachers. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte is attacking teacher unions.

Research by the United Nations has shown that the globe is spinning toward a dramatic teacher shortage, with analysts predicting a shortage of 69 million teachers by 2030. This is the crisis we should be talking about.

We’ve seen overcrowded classrooms, long working hours, lack of professional development, burn out, low salaries, terrible retention rates and teachers across the United States striking to demand better teaching and learning conditions.

How does Donald Trump Jr.’s description of teachers as “losers” and the encouragement of hostility toward us solve these problems? How does it ignite passion in a new generation to pursue the world’s most important profession?

If we can be accused of anything, it is that we are on the front line of democracy. Education reformer John Dewey famously said, “Democracy has to be born again each generation and education is its midwife.”

As members of a global profession, we reject the narrowing of the mind and we stand by our colleagues defending academic freedom. We call upon parents, teachers and politicians to stand with us. Our academic freedom is what allows our democracies to remain strong.

My words, not theirs:

Without teachers, there is no education. Without teachers, there are no doctors, no scientists, no creators, no inventors, no advancement of humanity.

What has Donald Trump Jr. or his father or his brother or his sister done to advance humanity? What kind of person separates families and puts children into cages?

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Tuesday the gravity of the core allegation — that there was undue political influence on the criminal prosecution process — demands a thorough study by an independent arbiter.

Watch the Power Panel discuss Wilson-Raybould's appearance at a cabinet meeting on Power & Politics

Francoise, Stockwell, Jen and Tim discuss JWR's appearance at cabinet and the next steps of the justice committee. 10:14

""We cannot claim to be a country under the rule of law when political agendas can dictate the course of justice,"" Scheer said. ""And that's precisely what the prime minister and his office stand accused of.""

The party's deputy leader, Lisa Raitt, said a public inquiry is the best way ""to get to the bottom of something so crucial to the rule of law.""

Amid the calls for an inquiry, the House of Commons justice committee will reconvene today to continue its study of a recent news report that senior members of the Prime Minister's Office pressured then-justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to help Quebec-based multinational engineering firm SNC-Lavalin avoid prosecution on bribery and fraud charges in relation to contracts in Libya.

Gerald Butts, Trudeau's principal secretary and right-hand man, resigned his position Monday, stating that neither he or anyone else in the PMO pressured Wilson-Raybould to direct the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to draft a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — a legal tool resembling a plea deal — for SNC-Lavalin.

""At all times, I and those around me acted with integrity and a singular focus on the best interests of all Canadians,"" Butts said Monday.

Trudeau also has insisted there was no wrongdoing — that he told Wilson-Raybould last fall that any decisions on matters involving the director of public prosecutions were hers alone to make.

In a surprise move, Wilson-Raybould met with Trudeau and his cabinet Tuesday. Speaking to reporters before question period, Trudeau said she asked if she could address her former cabinet colleagues a week after her departure.

Wilson-Raybould spoke briefly with reporters after leaving that cabinet meeting. When asked if she was pressured over SNC-Lavalin, as the media report suggested, she said only that she is still ""working with"" her lawyer.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould says she's still working with her lawyer to see what she can legally say, but that she remains a member of the Liberal caucus. 0:43

""As a member of Parliament, my ethical and professional responsibilities as a lawyer are layered and incredibly complicated,"" she said. She also confirmed that she is still a Liberal MP.

The Liberal government maintains that the federal ethics commissioner's ongoing examination of the still-unsubstantiated allegations is an independent probe therefore a public inquiry is an unnecessary measure. Conservatives say the ethics commissioner is essentially toothless.

Speaking in the Commons, Liberal MP Marc Miller, a parliamentary secretary and personal friend of the prime minister, said demands for an independent inquiry were ""absolutely premature.""

""Despite the many media reports, what we have so far is unsubstantiated allegations. Indeed, we have two high-profile resignations, but we don't know the substance of the allegations,"" Miller said. ""There's very, very little substantiated fact ... I will readily concede that we don't know enough. The issue is whether we are publicly entitled to enough.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer supports an NDP motion in the House of Commons today to launch a pubic inquiry into the Prime Minister's Office amid the SNC-Lavalin case, especially in the wake of the Prime Minister's principal secretary Gerry Butt's resignation from the PMO Monday. 1:08

Miller also said staging an inquiry at this time — while criminal matters related to SNC-Lavalin are still before the courts — would be ill-advised, since parliamentarians generally refrain from discussing matters under judicial review.

Scheer said Butts' departure ""does not in any way settle this matter. In fact, it presents even more questions that must be answered.""

""When the Justice Department said 'no' to SNC-Lavalin, the Prime Minister's Office wouldn't take 'no' for an answer,"" Scheer said. ""Conservatives on the justice committee will continue to demand a thorough and public investigation, and all other options remain on the table. Canadians deserve answers and I will continue to do everything in my power to get them.""

NDP MP Charlie Angus, the party's ethics critic, tabled an opposition motion Tuesday that formally demands an inquiry into the political interference allegations.

Angus said Butts' departure — he calls the former staffer the ""architect of the Sunny Ways"" Trudeau playbook — could provoke a ""political revolution.""

""For Gerry Butts to resign shows how much damage [the scandal] has done inside the Prime Minister's Office ... If Mr. Butts is willing to take a jump for the prime minister, at this point, it shows that they're in free fall and total damage control,"" Angus said in an interview with CBC News Network's Power & Politics.

""The best thing the prime minister could do to restore public confidence is come into the House and agree to an independent inquiry ... or else these questions are going to continue.""

Commons committee to probe interference allegations

The Liberal and opposition members of the justice committee are expected to squabble today over who should be called to testify at the committee, and just how wide-reaching the parliamentary probe should be.

At the top of the opposition witness wish list is Butts himself and Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from cabinet last week after the Globe and Mail published its initial report.

""It's potentially possible, but there's a lot of water to go under the bridge yet,"" says cabinet minister Ralph Goodale on Power & Politics. 8:18

Wilson-Raybould had been demoted from the high-profile justice portfolio to the Veterans Affairs ministry in January.

Wilson-Raybould has stayed silent on the allegations, claiming that solicitor-client privilege prevents her from speaking publicly; as attorney general, she was the government's top lawyer.

She has taken the highly unusual step of retaining Thomas Cromwell, a recently retired Supreme Court justice, as her legal counsel as the scandal enters a new phase.

While the Liberal-controlled justice committee has agreed to study the matter, Liberal MPs defeated an NDP motion last week that would have compelled Butts and Wilson-Raybould to appear.

Following normal parliamentary procedure with respect to committee planning, members will discuss which individuals they want to call before the committee and define the scope of its investigation in private. The opposition parties had demanded these proceedings be held in public, but Liberals successfully pushed for closed-door discussions.

The parliamentary probe itself is expected to be televised.

More to come?

Opposition members have pointed to one line of Butts' resignation statement in particular as indicating that there might be more developments to come.

""My reputation is my responsibility,"" Butts said, ""and that is for me to defend. It is in the best interests of the office and its important work for me to step away.""

Not satisfied with a committee study alone, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is also demanding that Trudeau waive solicitor-client privilege to allow Wilson-Raybould to speak freely at a public inquiry.

Trudeau has said the privilege question is complicated and he is awaiting advice from current Attorney General David Lametti on what he can say in public. He has also said some aspects of the government's handling of the case are protected by cabinet confidentiality.

Speaking to reporters in B.C. a week out from the Burnaby South byelection in which he is running, Singh said intransigence by Liberal members of the justice committee demands another forum for investigation.

""The scandal cuts to the heart of our democracy,"" Singh said. ""Canadians deserve a government that works for them, not a powerful multinational corporation that has deep ties to the Liberal Party.""

Trudeau thanks Butts for his service

​In a tweet Monday, Trudeau said Butts served Canada with ""integrity, sage advice and devotion."" He thanked the former staffer for his service and ""continued friendship.""

In addition to the political partnership, the prime minister is close friends with Butts — a relationship that dates back to their time as students at McGill University in Montreal, where they were members of the campus debating club.

Born in Glace Bay, N.S., a coal-mining town on Cape Breton Island, Butts worked on public policy in Ontario before becoming a senior staffer under former Liberal premier Dalton McGuinty at Queen's Park.

Butts then made the leap to federal politics and helped chart Trudeau's political future as leader of the Liberal Party and later prime minister.

Praised by his allies as a brilliant mind, and vilified by foes as the political puppet master behind the prime minister, Butts said Monday he is proud of his time as Trudeau's top adviser.",'Canadians deserve answers': Opposition to press on with parliamentary probe after Gerald Butts resignation,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/gerald-butts-opposition-parliamentary-probe-1.5023941

Beeley and Webb uncover how influential oligarchs and the non-profits th…","LONDON — Jo Cox, the late Labour MP whose tragic death in 2016 shocked Britain and the world, has recently become a rallying cry for forces within the U.K. Labour Party who seek to weaken Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership and to return the party to the pro-intervention Tony Blair era. As this article (the final installment of our three-part series) will show, this effort to manipulate Jo Cox’s death is the latest move in a wider effort to turn Cox’s legacy to the advantage of pro-intervention interests in Britain and abroad, particularly with regard to foreign intervention in Syria. While these moves — from support for “humanitarian” intervention in Syria to the drive to split the U.K. Labour Party — are cast as people-driven objectives, they are in fact oligarch-driven.

Previous reporting on Jo Cox and her legacy revealed that the Jo Cox Fund, set up soon after Cox’s death, was created by a group of four pro-interventionist “humanitarians” — Mabel van Oranje, Gemma Mortensen, Tim Dixon and Nick Grono — all of whom have a history of involvement, either directly or indirectly, in past regime-change operations. They are all also connected to some of the world’s most ardent imperialists, as well as to the Not for Profit Industrial Complex (NPIC).

The NPIC is effectively the money-laundering operation of the world’s most powerful industrialists. By creating a socially appealing “not for profit” NGO that serves to influence public opinion in the direction of the industrialist agenda, the global elite ensure a monopoly over the chosen market. The oligarchy uses the NPIC to manufacture public consent for the schemes and campaigns that will maintain their power, privilege and wealth. Why would they create an entity that would be detrimental to their survival and success?

The NPIC gives an unsuspecting public the illusion of choice and a stakeholding in resolving our world issues. The reality is that we are being persuaded to “choose” the options that benefit only the world’s most powerful influencers and ensure the exploitation of humanity to secure supremacy for the very few.

The four founders of the Jo Cox Fund, referred to in this article as the “Jo Cox Four,” have used this fund to promote — among other causes — the U.S. coalition-financed White Helmets, whose primary purpose has been to escalate unlawful NATO state-proxy and direct military intervention in Syria.

In addition, these individuals behind the Jo Cox Fund have used that foundation to apply strategies aimed at promoting foreign military intervention that were first perfected during the NATO intervention in the Balkans, as several of the creators of the Jo Cox fund promoted that military intervention to great effect.

In applying those strategies to the current conflict in Syria, these players have helped develop a massive public-relations machine with the White Helmets at its center, and programmed that machine to use Cox’s death to sanctify the controversial group and shield it from scrutiny. Now, they are using her death to justify the creation of a new Labour party to prevent the ascendency of the anti-intervention platform of current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

As this article will reveal, this NGO pro-Syrian-regime-change network — of which the Jo Cox Fund is part — is being promoted by powerful oligarchs with connections to the U.K., U.S. and Canadian governments. In the context of the call to partition U.K. Labour, the efforts driven by these billionaires show that they are hardly “people driven” and are instead being pushed by the same pro-intervention, monied interests that have long supported regime change in Syria and have since helped to weaponize Jo Cox’s death.

This is Part III of a three-part series on the life and legacy of Jo Cox and the posthumous fund set up in her honor. Read part 1 here and part 2 here. In this final part of the series, we focus on exploring the oligarchs who are driving the NGO and PR nexus aimed at manufacturing consent in Western nations for regime change in Syria, with a particular focus on how these oligarch-driven efforts are now fueling an effort to divide the U.K. Labour Party in order to undermine Jeremy Corbyn’s anti-war policies. Notably, those efforts within U.K. Labour are using Jo Cox and her highly manipulated legacy as a rallying cry.

The eBay billionaires and the Syria regime-change PR machine

As previous reporting has detailed, the Jo Cox Fund — the posthumous fund created soon after the late MP’s death — was formed by a group of four individuals who have long been involved in manufacturing consent for foreign “regime change” wars, first in the Balkans and now in Syria, and have been aided in this effort by massive funding from governments and elite billionaires. Yet, of those elite billionaires, some have promoted the Jo Cox Fund founders — and, with them, their pet projects such as the White Helmets — more than others.

One billionaire in particular stands out. One of the “eBay billionaires” who amassed a fortune as the online auction company’s first employee, Canadian billionaire and “philanthropist” Jeffrey Skoll not only shares past connections to the Jo Cox Four but has continuously used his massive wealth and his “charitable” foundation to promote them and their causes.

Indeed, the Skoll Foundation — a partner of USAID, a NPIC-leading U.S. government organization that has a reputation for funding U.S.-friendly subversive forces in foreign countries — has provided funding to the groups directly linked to Jo Cox founders, such as Crisis Action and Global Witness. And the associated Skoll World Forum has promoted the cause of Western-backed regime change in Syria — hosting the founder of the White Helmets, James Le Mesurier; the current leader of the White Helmets, Raed Saleh; the program director of the White Helmet parent organization Mayday Rescue, Farouq Habib; as well as all four of the founders of the Jo Cox Fund: Mabel van Oranje, Gemma Mortensen, Tim Dixon, and Nick Grono.

Who is Jeffrey Skoll?

Following on from his success at Ebay that ensured Skoll’s meteoric rise to the ranks of the billionaire elite, Skoll has capitalized upon that success to garner multiple awards from within the monied elite circles that he now inhabits.

Skoll has been awarded the Carnegie Medal for Philanthropy, which is considered to be the equivalent to the Nobel Peace Prize for philanthropy. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace is a big-business club that is described as a “foreign policy think tank” with centers in Washington, New Delhi, Moscow, Beirut and Beijing. Former President Jessica Matthews said that her aim was to make Carnegie the place where world thinking can be incorporated into thinking about U.S policy and to transmit that thinking to the global audience.

On the Carnegie board of trustees is Syrian oil magnate Ayman Asfari, a U.K. resident and financial contributor to the Conservative government that has been at the forefront of the U.S. Coalition war effort in Syria. Asfari has been instrumental in financing much of the PR industry, including the White Helmets, that builds the “regime-change” narratives that criminalize the Syrian government and its allies, an effort detailed in Parts 1 and 2 of this series.

Skoll established Participant Media (PM) in 2004. As with so many of the social-consciousness documentary production sites that have sprung up in recent times to alter our perception with beautifully crafted storylines designed to mobilize bias in a particular direction, PM claims to combine the “power of a good story well told with opportunities for real world impact.” PM joins the throng of billionaire-funded and -founded media and PR agencies of power.

Diane Weyermann is PM’s president of documentary film and television. Weyermann previously worked with Robert Redford’s Sundance Institute, which has played a pivotal role in promoting the White Helmet Oscar-winning “documentaries.” For seven years Weyermann was the director of the Open Society Institute New York’s arts and culture program. Weyermann also launched the Soros Documentary Fund which later became the Sundance Documentary Fund in 1996.

Skoll has been made an Officer of the Order of Canada “for his generous commitment to social causes and for his innovative practice of philanthropy.” Very often the bridge between big business and government agencies is made by such ostensibly “philanthropic” activities of the capitalist entities and individuals.

The Canadian government reportedly led the organization of the recent evacuation of alleged White Helmet operatives out of southern Syria via Israeli occupied Syrian territory in the Golan Heights, before they were transported to Jordan and on to their countries of resettlement, which include Canada, the U.K., France and Germany.

The Canadian government has been a consistently staunch supporter of the White Helmets, backing their multiple bids for the Nobel Peace Prize despite protests from groups and individuals who campaigned against Canada joining with the France-U.K.-U.S. (FUKUS) alliance that has strongly pushed for the downfall of the Assad government. Canadian foreign policy has effectively aligned itself with the Syrian-linked philanthrocapitalist sector led by individuals like Skoll.

Skoll slots into the billionaire complex that underpins the White Helmet structure with ease. In 2015, Skoll had a “conversation” with Mabel Van Oranje on “Belief in a Collective Future.” Skoll has donated heavily to the Clinton Foundation and met with Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state during the early days of the conflict in Syria. The Skoll Foundation has partnered in at least 21 commitments to programs designed by the Clinton Global Initiative. In April 2012, Clinton met with Skoll and Sally Osberg of Skoll’s charity during a U.S State Department-sponsored forum on government-business partnerships. The same month, USAID, the State Department/CIA contractor for expanding U.S global influence, announced a partnership with the Skoll Foundation to invest in health, energy, governance and food-security innovations. USAID has also provided at least $31m in funding to the White Helmets in Syria via one of its preferred subcontractors, Chemonics.

Skoll united with British business tycoon Richard Branson and Mabel Van Oranje in the funding of The Elders. Van Oranje resigned from her position as CEO of The Elders in 2012. It was Skoll’s Participant Media that produced Al Gore’s 2006 apocalyptic movie An Inconvenient Truth. Gore was Bill Clinton’s Vice President from 1993 – 2001. Skoll’s investment management firm, Capricorn Investment LLC, also received a $35 million investment from Gore following the film’s success, which the firm invested into hedge funds and private partnerships, helping to grow Gore’s now sizeable fortune. Skoll co-founded Capricorn Investment LLC with former Vice President of Goldman Sachs Stephen George.

Skoll Foundation and Forum

When we start to look more closely at the “storytelling” partners of the Skoll Foundation, we draw even closer to the White Helmet PR industry. Skoll partners with the Sundance Institute, the BBC, NPR and Doc Society–Flex Fund, among others. The Sundance Institute, the BBC and Doc Society are central to the production and promotion of the White Helmet movie campaigns, including the Netflix White Helmet documentary that won the Oscar in 2016 and then Last Men in Aleppo that was nominated for the Oscar in 2017.

These organizations are literally the architects of “humanitarian war” and the White Helmets are their centerpiece, the ultimate “story” that, if told well, will draw Western nations deeper into the quagmire of a failed regime-change war in Syria. As Vanessa Beeley wrote in Architects of Humanitarian War:

I believe it’s safe to conclude that there is a vast, well-financed PR machine operating behind the scenes of the White Helmet organisation, whitewashing their discredited image and mapping out their political, media and Hollywood trajectory – in lock-step with the PR campaign is a media defence force headed up by Channel 4, The BBC and The Guardian. The hub of the film and PR sector is Doc Society.”

Listed among the Skoll Foundation “awardees” are Crisis Action and Global Witness — again linking to the White Helmet PR apparatus. Crisis Action brings together Brendan Cox, Gemma Mortensen and Tim Dixon of the Jo Cox Four. Crisis Action’s role in the White Helmet marketing complex was explored in detail in Part 2 of this series. Global Witness connects back to Mabel Van Oranje, who is on the advisory board with Alexander Soros.

The annual Skoll World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship is organized by the Skoll Foundation in partnership with the Said Foundation, or more precisely the Said Business School. The Forum convenes 800 social entrepreneurs, influencers, policy makers, philanthropists and students to “learn, problem solve and build community.” The Said Foundation is “partnered” by Ayman Asfari, previously mentioned in connection with the White Helmet marketing team, headed up by the Syria Campaign.

The Skoll World Forum (SWF) was established in 2004. One of the sessions in the 2018 Forum was on “The Art of Co-creation: a Storytelling Model for Impact and Engagement.” As we have mentioned previously, almost the entire White Helmet PR team and White Helmet leadership have been listed as contributors to the SWF. These include James Le Mesurier, former British MI6 agent who established the White Helmets in Turkey and Jordan while employed by ARK Group; Raed Saleh, former mobile-phone salesman, now leader of the White Helmets; Tim Dixon MD, of Purpose; Farouq Habib, project manager at Mayday Rescue; and Brendan Cox, Mabel Van Oranje, Gemma Mortensen, and Nick Grono. CEO and president of the UN Foundation Kathy Calvin is also a contributor alongside the White Helmet team, and her role in promoting the billionaire-supported “humanitarian” group is further investigated later in this article.

In 2017, the SWF brought together Brendan Cox, Tim Dixon and Gemma Mortensen in a session entitled “Mobilizing a Movement: More in Common,” which focused on the Jo Cox-inspired movement to enable more “inclusive societies that look past our differences and embrace our common humanity.”

During this talk Dixon alludes to the iconic image of Alan Kurdi washed up on a beach in Turkey, which launched the refugee “crisis” in September 2015. The timing of this campaign, so rapidly adopted by the Jo Cox four and their associated PR agencies and billionaire network, was curiously in lock-step with the timing of the Russian intervention in Syria at the behest of the elected Syrian government. During the televised talk, Dixon describes the image of Kurdi’s body as “a defining moment for the More in Common impetus.” Dixon’s cynical exploitation of Kurdi’s death to promote the causes of the Jo Cox Four, including the White Helmets, was exposed by a statement given by Kurdi’s aunt, Tima Kurdi, in February 2017, in Canada:

Regime-change policy has destroyed my country and forced my people to flee. [U.S. Congresswoman] Tulsi [Gabbard]’s message was exactly what I have been trying to say for years, but no one wants to listen. [..]If the West keeps funding the rebels, we will see more people flee, more bloodshed, and more suffering. My people have suffered for at least six years.”

Tima Kurdi established very quickly that the furor over the refugee crisis, generated by the shocking images of her drowned nephew, was nothing more than a marketing campaign designed to facilitate a reaction and military push-back against the Russian intervention that threatened to derail the U.S. Coalition plans to topple the Syrian government.

The many hats of Pierre Omidyar

Undeniably a formidable force in the promotion of the “Jo Cox Four” and the White Helmets, Jeffrey Skoll is not the only eBay billionaire involved in manufacturing consent for Syria regime change or in promoting the activities of the founding members of the Jo Cox Foundation. Indeed, Pierre Omidyar — the founder of eBay who was responsible for hiring Skoll and allowing him to amass his fortune — also shares many of the same connections to these individuals and the “humanitarian” regime change network currently exploiting the death of Jo Cox.

Like Skoll, Omidyar is also increasingly well-connected to the U.S. political establishment and was directly involved in promoting regime change in Ukraine alongside the Obama era U.S. State Department. Omidyar has a close relationship to Obama, having attended the same elite Hawaii school and having made more visits to the Obama White House between 2009 and 2013 than Google’s Eric Schmidt, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, or Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. He also donated $30 million to the Clinton global initiative and directly co-invested with the State Department, funding groups – some of them overtly fascist – that worked to overthrow Ukraine’s democratically elected government in 2014.

Even after Obama left office, Omidyar continues to fund USAID, particularly its overseas program aimed at “advancing U.S. national security interests” abroad. Omidyar’s Ulupono Initiative, a venture-capital fund that operates in his home state of Hawaii, cosponsors one of the Pentagon’s most important contractor expos, a direct connection between Omidyar and the military industrial complex that profits from U.S.-backed regime-change wars.

However, Omidyar’s very clear connections to the U.S. political establishment and U.S.-led regime-change efforts have often been obfuscated by reports on Omidyar’s “philanthropy.” Indeed, Omidyar has been heavily promoted as an “entrepreneurial” philanthropist, having won the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy and received accolades in the mainstream press for his unique “way of giving.”

One of Omidyar’s charitable groups, the Omidyar Network, has given large grants to George Soros’s Open Society Foundations (where Jo Cox Fund founder Mabel van Oranje once worked) and the Tides Center, and has collaborated with the U.K. government and the Ford Foundation. Notably, another arm of Omidyar’s charitable network, Humanity United, provided a considerable portion of the funds that established the Clinton-promoted Freedom Fund, whose inaugural CEO was Nick Grono, one of the founders of the Jo Cox Fund.

Another “philanthropic” project of Omidyar’s is the New York-based publication, the Intercept. That publication was largely founded with the intent of publishing the leaked U.S. government documents provided by Edward Snowden, but over 90 percent of those leaks have yet to be made public over five years after the Intercept’s founding, leading critics to accuse Omidyar of seeking to “privatize” those leaks.

Yet, of the documents that have been published, one published last year exposed the opposition paramilitary group, the Free Syrian Army, as taking marching orders from the Saudi royal family. However, that document was published by the Intercept only after the U.S. State Department itself began to report more honestly on the nature of these so-called “rebels,” even though the Intercept had the document in its possession since 2013.

Furthermore, Intercept writers covering Syria frequently promote Syrian “rebels” and the opposition while also promoting pro-regime change talking points. For instance, Murtaza Hussain – a long-time writer at the Intercept – has written numerous stories downplaying the terrorist and Wahhabist elements of the Syrian “rebels.” In the last three years, Hussain has written pieces portraying known Al-Qaeda propagandists, such as Bilal Abdul Kareem, and Al-Qaeda-linked organizations, such as the White Helmets, in an overwhelmingly positive light — failing to mention in both cases the significant evidence tying these entities to known terrorist groups.

In another piece, published in August 2016, Hussain gave voice to al-Nusra Front leadership in a lengthy interview that largely whitewashed the group’s Wahhabist leanings and links to terrorist acts in Syria. In September 2016, on Twitter, Hussain asserted that Saudi Arabia’s funding of armed factions was not necessarily “good” but that “there is little to indicate they contribute to terrorism.”

Hussain is by no means the only Intercept writer who has taken such a pro-opposition stance regarding Syria. A now infamous Intercept piece on Syria, published last September, committed glaring factual errors on basic facts about the war, while also mistranslating a speech given by Assad so as to link him to American white nationalists. In addition, last year, the paper hired Maryam Saleh, a journalist who has called Shia Muslims “dogs” and has taken to Twitter in recent months to downplay the role of the U.S. coalition in airstrikes in Syria. Saleh also has ties to the U.S.-financed propaganda group Kafranbel Media Center, which also has close relations with the terrorist group Ahrar al-Sham.

Even “anti-interventionist” Intercept journalists like Jeremy Scahill and Glenn Greenwald have come under fire this past year for allegedly promoting inaccurate statements that supported pro-regime-change narratives in Syria, particularly in regard to an alleged chemical-weapons attack in Douma. That attack is now widely believed to have been staged by the White Helmets.

Given Omidyar’s connections to the political establishment, his past efforts aimed at affecting Western-backed regime change, and the way in which the publication he owns has peddled misinformation on Syria, Omidyar — like Skoll — is very much a part of “humanitarian” regime-change complex that uses billionaire “philanthropy” as a disguise for the manipulation of public sentiment in order to justify foreign military intervention to a Western audience.

UN Foundation, Concordia Summit and the White Helmets

Three months after Jo Cox’s murder in September 2016, two of the Jo Cox Fund originators — Tim Dixon of Purpose and Nick Grono, CEO of the Freedom Fund — took part in the annual Concordia Summit. Dixon was a key participant in the Private Sector Forum on Migration and Refugees, with a focus on the Purpose-”incubated” refugee and migration hub. Their Objective? To change hearts and minds in Europe in relation to the refugee “crisis” — a Syria-centric “crisis” that has been largely manufactured and sensationalized with the aim of criminalizing the Syrian government. The reality is that Syrian refugees are returning to Syria as vast swaths of Syrian territory is liberated from Western-backed terrorist occupation.

Brendan Cox was also a speaker at the 2016 event, as were many other supporters of U.S. Coalition intervention in Syria: Lina Attar, of the Karam Foundation; President and CEO of International Rescue Committee, David Miliband; Lara Setrakian of News Deeply, a “rebel”-partisan media outlet funded by Ayman Asfari; George Soros; Johannes Hahn, EU Commissioner; and Hans Vestberg, UN Foundation board member — to name a few.

This is taken from the Purpose website in 2015:

Purpose is proud to have served as a first time programming partner for the 2015 Concordia Summit. Now in its fifth year, the Summit convenes the world’s preeminent thought leaders and decision makers to address the most pressing global challenges by highlighting the potential that effective cross-sector collaboration can have in creating a more prosperous and sustainable future.”

Jeremy Heimans, the co-founder and CEO of Purpose, spoke at this event. Their session, “Introducing: New Power in a Multi-stakeholder World,” featured an exciting line-up of speakers, each pioneering change in their respective industries in innovative ways. The focus was on the “civil society” sectors and their ability to implement transformation via peer-driven participation campaigns. Tapping into global energy and human agency was order of the day. One of the panelists, Scott Heiferman, promoted his model “Meet Up,” which harnesses the power of people-to-people networking: “How can you empower people to turn to each other – how can you unlock that most beautiful phenomenon?”

Jeremy Heimans is also co-founder of an organization, Avaaz, that “unlocks that phenomenon” and harnesses the power of peer participation in influencing public opinion — particularly on Syria, as covered previously in our series of articles.

True to form, Purpose produced a report in May 2017, “Understanding the Conflicted Middle: European Public Opinion towards Refugees,” shifting hearts and minds on refugees and migrants in Europe. While this report presented a number of symptoms and remedies, it does not investigate the root cause of the global refugee crisis, which is due, to a great extent, to the U.S. policy of military intervention globally that results in the mass exodus of peoples from war-torn nations into Europe. There, these refugees are weaponized to manufacture consent for further Western military intervention by organizations that claim to be protecting their interests.

Concordia’s annual report in 2016 described this summit as the “largest and most ambitious event to date, bringing together over 2000 thought leaders from across sectors, including General David Petraeus and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright … and philanthropist George Soros.”

Albright rose to notoriety with her dismissal of the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children as being “worth it” when the U.S. imposed punishing and lethal economic sanctions on Iraq leading up to the first Iraq war in 1991 — sanctions that have, in part, persisted until today.

The Concordia Summit was established in 2011, just as the questionable “Arab Spring” was causing shock waves across the Middle East region. It was designed as an establishment intersection, a hub of global elite influencers and transformers. Cory Morningstar, an expert on the “smart power” complex, noted that the Concordia Summit was modelled on the success of initiatives such as the Wall Street Journal CEO Council and the Clinton Global Initiative: “Mathew Swifte (Chairman and CEO) and Nicholas Logothetis founded the Concordia Summit in February 2011 […] Swifte studied under global ‘leaders’ such as former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright..”

The 2018 Concordia Summit just took place in September at the Grand Hyatt, New York, describing itself as “The largest and most inclusive nonpartisan forum alongside the United Nations General Assembly.” The line-up of soft-power magnates and establishment political and capitalist moguls was impressive. The summit featured the cross-fertilization of influencers, decision-makers and opinion-formers across a multitude of sectors, who came together to ensure the “next generation of partnership-builders” would be shaped in their image with their agenda indelibly imprinted upon the future. In its own language, from the Concordia Annual Summit 2018 overview: “The 2018 Concordia Annual Summit will provide a powerful forum to catalyze action through shared value approaches and social impact objectives.”

In 2018, UNHCR (the UN Refugee Agency) joined forces with Concordia as a “programming partner.” This was not the first time they had collaborated. In 2016, UNHCR also took a central role at the Concordia Summit. In the words of Matthew Swift, co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Concordia:

The mission of UNHCR is truly one of the core values of Concordia’s work. The commitment to ensuring that everybody has the right to seek asylum and find safe refuge, having fled violence, persecution, war or disaster at home is a subject we’ve heavily focused on in the past, and we look forward to continuing these calls to action at the 2018 Concordia Annual Summit.”

Other “programming partners” in 2018 included the NATO-aligned think-tank, the Atlantic Council; the George W. Bush Institute; Open Society Foundation; U.S Chamber of Commerce; U.S State Department (Secretary’s Office of Global Partnerships); U.S Global Leadership Coalition; and the Wilson Center, a Washington-based global issues research center. The Concordia Annual Summit appears to be a thinly disguised cartel established to promote U.S private- and public-sector interests far into the future, with potentially devastating consequences for the countries where such policies will be implemented by the world’s elite “philanthro-capitalists.”

Perhaps more remarkable is how Concordia gathers together so many of the players in the decades-long campaign to destabilize Syria and topple its elected government from power. Players who would capitalize upon the assassination of Jo Cox to appropriate public funds and direct them into financing elements of the regime-change project in Syria such as the Al Qaeda-linked White Helmets.

Kathy Calvin and the UN Foundation

The UN connection extends beyond the role of the UNHCR, with the attendance of Kathy Calvin at the 2016 Concordia Summit. Calvin is the CEO and president of the United Nations Foundation. Calvin, Mabel Van Oranje and Jeffrey Skoll intersect on the Advisory Council of the Elders — alongside British entrepreneur and billionaire Richard Branson and Sally Osberg, who is the president and CEO of the Skoll Foundation. Once more, we see how the star-studded cast of the movement-building and social-change engineering world overlap and circulate in the ever expanding and interwoven spheres of influence.

In a 2011 interview with Forbes, Calvin laid out the objectives of the UN Foundation:

[The UN Foundation is a construct designed to bring together] some of the brightest entrepreneurs under 40 through the Global Entrepreneurs Council to take the UN and the UN Foundation – and our campaigns, partnerships, and programs – to the next level of innovation and impact. They are the next generation of entrepreneurs who understand that working with the United Nations is good for the world and for business. These innovative thinkers will help us engage with new generations to help the UN create 21st century solutions to some of the world’s toughest problems.” (emphasis added)

It would appear that Calvin is suggesting that the influence of the UN be exploited to expand U.S. private-sector business interests worldwide.

The UN Foundation came into existence in 1998 with a $1 billion commitment from former vice chairman of Time Warner and founder of CNN Ted Turner. His investment in the UN Foundation was described as his “gift for the future of Humanity.” Turner believed that the UN Foundation would “catalyze a new movement in philanthropy.”

The list of UN Foundation’s partners is another glittering array of the world’s most powerful foundations and individuals. The Skoll Foundation is on that list alongside AOL, Google, Royal Dutch Shell, Walt Disney, Unilever, and the governments of the U.S, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia, UAE, U.K. and the World Bank. UN Foundation is the heavyweight of philanthropy, backed by billionaires from a vast spectrum of market sectors and political backgrounds.

Ted Turner and Calvin’s connections to Clinton

Ted Turner endorsed Hillary Clinton’s election campaign in 2016. Time Warner was among the myriad of media moguls who financed the failed Clinton campaign to the tune of $50,000 – $100,000, according to statistics published by Politico. CNN reporter Larry King was once caught on open-mic in the early 1990s telling Bill Clinton that “Ted Turner would serve” him. A report in the Washington Times cited Turner as saying “Hillary Clinton is one of the smartest and most powerful people in the world.” Turner praises Clinton uncritically, ignoring her record as one of the most malevolent war-hawks of our generation. It is Clinton’s gleeful celebration of Libya’s Muammar Gadaffi’s sodomization and murder by the U.S.-supported “rebels” that has come to symbolize the moral vacuum of the U.S. neocon foreign policy — policy that also serves the billionaire corporatocracy presided over by moguls such as Ted Turner.

Calvin’s connections to the Clinton clan also run deep. In 2013, the UN Foundation and its Global Entrepreneurs Council announced the “MY World Global Initiative” at the Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting. According to the UN Foundation website:

MY World looks beyond 2015 – the endpoint for the current Millennium Development Goals – to engage people from all parts of the world and ensure their views will be part of the global conversation about the post-2015 global development agenda. To date, approximately one million people from 194 countries have contributed to MY World, and the UN Foundation is committed to helping secure one million more.” (emphasis added)

In 2014, Hillary Clinton, Kathy Calvin and Michael Bloomberg formed a new partnership to “close gender gaps.” Bloomberg is reported to be the eighth richest man in the U.S., with a net worth of $48.9 billion (2018) — a “philanthrocapitalist” whose causes range from gun control to climate change. The event, which took place on December 15, 2014 at Bloomberg Philanthropies in New York, sought to:

[H]ighlight the work of Data2X – a partnership launched by Secretary Clinton in July 2012 to identify and spur efforts to fill gender data gaps – and unveil new partnerships to improve data collection and use for women and girls. Better gender data are needed to guide policies, set targets, and monitor progress for women and girls.” (emphasis added)

Calvin’s links to the PR and media industries pre-date her appointment as CEO of the UN Foundation. Listed in Fast Company’s “League of Extraordinary Women,” before joining the UN Foundation in 2003, Calvin was President at AOL Time Warner Foundation, responsible for its “philanthropic” activities. Immediately prior to joining Time Warner, Calvin was Senior Managing Director at Hill and Knowlton. Hill and Knowlton is perhaps best known for its production of the hoax “incubator baby” story that provided the “humanitarian” pretext for the first Gulf War — later exposed, as recounted in The Diabolical Business of Global Public Relation Firms, as an elaborate staged event:

Before the first Gulf War, a fake news propaganda spectacle took place courtesy of WPP’s Hill & Knowlton. They were hired by Citizens for a Free Kuwait and eventually received nearly $10.8 million to conduct one of the most effective public relations campaigns in history. Hill & Knowlton helped create a national outrage against Iraq by publicizing the horrifying events supposedly caused by Iraqi soldiers during Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait.”

Interestingly, this connection then extends to Tim Dixon and Purpose New York. In September 2014, Purpose welcomed Josh Hendler as Chief Technology Officer. Just prior to joining Purpose, Hendler had held the same position at Hill and Knowlton Strategies.

Hendler’s mission was to “… develop the next-generation of tools to empower people across the globe to build movements…” (emphasis added).

Kathy Calvin has recently teamed up with billionaire Richard Branson on the Virgin Unite Foundation-incubated B-Team. Calvin is one of the 23 leaders whose mission is to “deliver a Plan B that puts people and planet alongside profit.” The B-Team is managed by none other than Purpose.

Branson, the Virgin tycoon, paid tribute to Jo Cox on his website in 2016. In this message, Branson presented a thinly veiled political message alluding to the “More in Common” movement that would shortly be established by Brendan Cox. Cox resigned from his position as director of More in Common in February 2018, following allegations of sexual harassment.

Branson also supports Nick Grono’s Walk Free Foundation, alongside Tony Blair, Hillary Clinton, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, and Bill Gates. Grono is one of the Jo Cox Four. Branson has also promoted the Netflix White Helmet documentary, describing it as offering “real insight into the horror and humanity, happening right now in Syria.” Many of the 20 documentaries promoted by Branson as must-watch reports have been produced by Skoll Foundation’s Participant Media. Another example of the reach and power of the billionaire PR industry.

In a separate report, Vanessa Beeley mapped out the intricate PR and film production processes that propelled the White Helmet movies to international acclaim and award ceremonies. She writes, in Architects of Humanitarian War:

White Helmet propaganda has seduced droves of human beings with a genuine humanitarian reflex that has been exploited by this “centre-piece” perception-changing construct. The story told by the White Helmet media and PR agencies has elevated this Al Qaeda support group to celebrity cult status. The world has fallen in love with what should most horrify it, while the people of Syria have their voices asphyxiated by Hollywood glamour and transformational mass communication.”

Yet again, we see how the web of billionaire philanthrocapitalism functions and how it builds its platforms of influence and behavioral-change power base. The components of this web are interchangeable — mobile and flexible, able to move swiftly and effectively, powered by billionaire resources and financial monopoly of the desired market sectors. It is a formidable force for change in this world, but accountable to none. Thus questions must be asked as to who benefits most from the changes their apparatus will impose upon some of the poorest nations in this world and their poverty-stricken or war-displaced citizens.

The White Helmets benefit from the Billionaire Network

The Social Good Summit (SGS) is held annually during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) week. A gathering of elite change manufacturers and global policy makers who desire to shape the future we apparently want to live in by 2030:

A dynamic exploration of the world we want to live in by 2030, the Social Good Summit will focus on how we can unlock technology’s potential to make the world a better place.”

The SGS is organized in partnership with the UN Foundation, the UNDP (UN Development Programme), Ted Turner-funded media website Mashable, multinational investment bank UBS, Zionist cultural non-profit 92Y, and pharmaceutical giant Pfizer.

The 2017 SGS was clearly a vehicle to further promote and iconize the White Helmets, combining political elite with celebrity cult elements that reinforced the stellar, Oscar-winning status of the faux “humanitarian” group.

Connie Britton, actress and UNDP Goodwill Ambassador, uncritically promoted the group’s carefully cultivated reputation as “civilian do-gooders” during an interview conducted at the summit. The White Helmet representatives Britton interviewed were Khaled Khatib and Mounir Mustafa. We have spoken about Mustafa’s links to armed groups in Syria in Part 2 of this series.

""Even in the midst of the ugliest of wars there is a glimpse of hope of people trying to be good."" – Mounir Mustafa #2030now pic.twitter.com/WPj7cMvKkU — UN Foundation (@unfoundation) September 17, 2017

Despite having the term “social good” in the name, the organizations behind the SGS, as well as its promotion of weaponized “humanitarian” constructs like the White Helmets, again reveal a powerful billionaire-driven PR industry which seeks to manipulate the innate human desire to “do good” and benefit the collective into supporting policy moves — such as regime change abroad — that benefit only the global monied elite.

Using Jo Cox to divide the Labour Party

A more worrying development that has emerged from the exploitation of the murder of MP Jo Cox is the apparent attempt to divide the already beleaguered Labour Party and to undermine its leadership, in particular Jeremy Corbyn.

Cox herself turned against Corbyn shortly before she was killed in 2016 and was forced to apologize after a newsletter had been circulated by one of her aides with the headline “Why I knifed Corbyn.” Two weeks prior, Cox had co-written an article with Neil Coyle in the Guardian, expressing regret over nominating Corbyn and dissatisfaction with his leadership.

Shortly after Cox’s murder, billionaire Branson came into conflict with Corbyn over the privatization of the rail services in the U.K. Corbyn was pushing for public ownership and this came into direct confrontation with the business objectives of Branson’s Virgin empire.

On many fronts Corbyn is challenging the establishment paradigm. As journalist Jonathan Cook explained, “Corbyn is being destroyed, like blowing up a bridge to stop an advancing army.” Part of the advancing army is Corbyn’s apparent determination to investigate and bring an end to military intervention by the British government and its allies. This has set the cat among the Syria “regime-change” pigeons, who have striven towards the destabilization of Syria for at least eight years, many for longer.

When the Labour MP and close ally of Corbyn, Chris Williamson, tweeted his support for the co-author of this report, Vanessa Beeley, the NATO-aligned twittersphere was outraged. Oz Katerji, long-time supporter of the Syrian “revolution” and vocal detractor of the Syrian government, rose to blow up the bridges in an article for the New Statesman.

Katerji has close ties to NATO-aligned “research” website Bellingcat, which has been instrumental in maintaining international pressure upon the Syrian government by supporting the chemical-weapon narratives generated by the White Helmets. Bellingcat’s founder, Eliot Higgins, is employed by the Atlantic Council, which is funded by the U.K., UAE, and U.S. weapons manufacturer Lockheed Martin, among others. Katerji is closely involved with the refugee “crisis,” on the “frontlines” as a team member of the Help Refugees NGO. The common factors that link all members of the war-for-peace-in-Syria cartel become more blatant as we delve deeper into their activities and connections.

Help Refugees is supported by none other than Soros’s Open Society Foundation and the Radcliffe Foundation, led by by philanthro-capitalist billionaire Frank Giustra, among other influential foundations. (Giustra’s connections to the billionaire network were covered in Part 2 of this series)

In February 2017 FSA propagandist Oz Katerji was invited to speak at The House of Lords in the UK Parliament. He was introduced by Baroness Jan Royall as a humanitarian aid worker. Highly revealing expose' on Oz Katerji reveals that he is not as described. https://t.co/O65KL7t5SA pic.twitter.com/uttdKWLcGz — WhiteHelmetsExposed (@WhiteHelmetsEXP) May 5, 2018

Katerji is also a dedicated promoter of the White Helmets, often seen attacking comments on Twitter that provide evidence of the White Helmet affiliations to extremist groups, including Nusra Front and ISIS. Katerji has been hosted by the Fabian Society in the House of Lords to discuss the refugee “crisis” in relation to Syria. Jo Cox’s connections to the Fabian Society are examined in Part 1 of this series.

. @OzKaterji highlights the information war aspect of the Syria conflict. He attacks RT for false attacks on the #WhiteHelmets #FabInt — Fabian Society IPG (@Fabian_IPG) February 27, 2017

In the New Statesman article, Katerji invoked the name of Jo Cox to effectively divide the Labour party along clearly defined lines. On one side, those Labour MPs who will not swing into war on the coat-tails of the Conservative Party, on the other those who would align themselves with the Blairite policies of “intervention at all costs.” Jo Cox is being used as a banner under which the Blairites can renew their campaigns to “do more” in Syria, which effectively signals greater military and economic pressure upon the Syrian people and perpetual war. For the Blairites, war can be prevented only by the departure of the Syrian Government and its replacement with an Islamist regime that would signify the end of Syria’s secular culture. This is an agenda that is not aligned with the wishes of the majority of the Syrian people, a fact that is apparently of no consequence to the “Jo Cox party.”

The title of Katerji’s hit piece, indirectly aimed at Corbyn, was “Labour can be Jo Cox’s party or Chris Williamson’s – it cannot be both.” His article ends with the claim that there is a “war for the heart of the Labour party underway; ultimately Labour cannot be both the party of Jo Cox and the party of Chris Williamson. If Williamson’s latest endorsement receives no censure from the Labour leader’s office, the answer to that question will be heard loudly and clearly all the way from Westminster to Damascus.”

Katerji is right in one way, but what is happening is a much bigger war. It is a war against humanity. A war during which we must connect ourselves even more closely to the peoples of nations under attack by the perpetual war industry sustained by the billionaire network. The powers that be are exploiting every possible avenue to demonize those who would challenge their agenda. From “anti-Semitism” to “genocide denial,” they are weaponizing tragedy and history to serve their own purposes. As Jonathan Cook puts it:

The corporate elites have no plan to go quietly. Unless we can build our ranks quickly and make our case confidently, their antics will ensure the paradigm shift is violent rather than healing. An earthquake, not a storm.”

Chuka Umunna’s new think tank

Beyond Katerji’s invocation of Jo Cox as a justification to divide U.K. Labour and return it to the pro-intervention party it once was under the leadership of former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, there is considerably more evidence that the same billionaire-led “humanitarian” regime-change network working to promote regime change in Syria is also intimately involved in the effort to divide the party. Look no further than Labour MP Chuka Umunna.

Umunna has long been a vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters, whom he has likened to “nasty trolls” for opposing war abroad. Umunna has long staunchly supported U.K. military adventurism, consistently supporting the deployment of U.K. military forces abroad as well as supporting regime change in Syria and the bombing of that country. Indeed, Umunna’s pro-intervention stance is so well defined that former U.K. Prime Minister and pro-interventionist Tony Blair once promoted Umunna to be the future leader of the Labour party.

More recently, Umunna has played a critical role in the anti-Semitism smear campaign targeting Corbyn, calling Corbyn’s Labour “institutionally racist” despite Corbyn’s long past as an anti-racism campaigner. The anti-Semitism issue was also used by Umunna to cast doubt on Corbyn’s ability to lead the party, and to promote a split of that party if Corbyn continued on in his current role as leader.

Given Blair’s past endorsement, Umunna seems poised to lead a new Blairite Labour spin-off if efforts to divide the party are successful. In this context, it is important to note that Umunna himself is directly connected to the same billionaire-led nexus that includes the humanitarian “regime-change” network that has been the focus of this series.

On October 15, Umunna announced via a column in the Independent that he would be chairing a new “progressive” think tank, Progressive Centre UK. However, as Umunna’s own column reveals, the Streatham MP repeatedly conflates “progressivism” with the “centre-left,” which Umunna defines as the politics of neo-liberal corporatists like Tony Blair, Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau.

More and more progressives like @JustinTrudeau @jacindaardern @sanchezcastejon & @EmmanuelMacron are showing it is possible to win, in what some call an age of populism, on a popular progressive platform. — Chuka Umunna (@ChukaUmunna) October 15, 2018

While Umunna’s new think tank does not yet describe its funding or its partners, it does openly note that it is proudly part of the “Global Progress” network, which is an outgrowth of the Global Progress Initiative (GPI). GPI was created in 2009 by the Center for American Progress, a U.S. think tank led by John Podesta, long-time Clinton associate and chair of Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 presidential campaign, as well as another Clinton confidante, Neera Tanden. GPI promotes former neo-liberal leaders like Tony Blair of the U.K., Bill Clinton of the U.S., Helle Thorning-Schmidt of Denmark, Justin Trudeau of Canada, and Ricardo Lagos of Chile as “progressives.”

Notably, Umunna’s ties to John Podesta and the Clintons precede the creation of this new think tank, as Umunna reached out to Podesta, then chair of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, and offered to advise Clinton campaign staff on how to beat the “American Jeremy Corbyn,” U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.

Umunna’s Progressive Centre UK makes it clear that is the U.K. branch of the Global Progress network, as it promotes its partners as the Global Progress network’s other branches in Canada (Canada2020), Italy (Volta) and France (Terra Nova). The Progressive Centre UK’s Italian partner, Volta, does not have a single Italian on its advisory board, despite being an Italian political think tank. Its advisory board includes former Senior Adviser for Innovation to Hillary Clinton, Alec Ross; former U.K. Labour politician and minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, David Miliband; French-born Murdoch lobbyist, Frederic Michel; and former Prime Minister of Denmark, Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Notably, David Miliband was once promoted as the “stand-in” for Jo Cox’s seat in Parliament following her murder and encouraged by Blairites within the Labour Party to challenge Jeremy Corbyn for leadership of the party.

Thorning-Schmidt’s inclusion in this network is also important given that she is currently CEO of Save the Children, where Jo Cox once worked, as did Brendan Cox until his “inappropriate behavior” was exposed. Thorning-Schmidt is a board member of the European Council on Foreign Relations alongside Mabel van Oranje. She is also a member of the board of the International Crisis Group (ICG) alongside George Soros; former Treasury Secretary under Clinton, Larry Summers; and Frank Giustra, among others.

As mentioned in Part 2 of this series, ICG and Save the Children — which both are intimately linked to Thorning-Schmidt — are part of the Crisis Action network, which is directly connected to the Jo Cox Four through Gemma Mortensen, Brendan Cox, and Tim Dixon, as well as Mabel van Oranje. Thorning-Schmidt’s connections are even more notable in the context of the push to divide the U.K. Labour party, given that she is married to Stephen Kinnock, a U.K. anti-Corbyn Labour MP who led the original efforts to split the Labour party following concern over Corbyn’s rise.

Like Volta, the Global Progress Network’s Canadian branch, Canada2020, is similarly problematic. While casting itself as an “independent” and “progressive” think tank, it proudly lists its partners as multinational corporations including Facebook, Google, Amazon, General Electric, massive multinational mining conglomerate Rio Tinto, Mastercard, and Shell Oil. Canada2020 recently hosted the Global Progress summit that Umunna promoted in his column announcing Progressive Centre UK. Umunna attended that summit, which was also attended by Tim Dixon of the Jo Cox Four, as well as Ben Scott of the Omidyar Network and John Podesta himself.

Though the newly-minted Progressive Centre UK has yet to host an event or make its donors and partners public, the other branches of the Clinton-linked Global Progress Network make it clear exactly what this new Umunna-led group will support and with whom it will associate.

Conclusion: Much exposed, much delving yet to do

The Jo Cox Fund, set up following the MP’s sudden and tragic death, formed the basis for the oligarch-backed NPIC network that would weaponize Cox’s death in order to promote pro-intervention policies and to attack actual progressive politicians in the U.K. Labour party who would oppose such British allied intervention abroad.

In their efforts to promote and enact regime change abroad, particularly in Syria, the Jo Cox Four have used their connections to the global elite and elite-funded “humanitarian” organizations to exploit the sympathy and outrage provoked by her death in order to manufacture consent for the pro-intervention policies that are the hallmark of the Blairite wing of U.K. Labour.

However, as the myriad connections between this “humanitarian” regime-change network and elite billionaires show, these policies are supported and designed not by the people but by oligarchs and the political elite. Only by masking their otherwise unpopular policies in the cloak of Jo Cox’s tragedy, and humanity’s natural empathy for good samaritans and the downtrodden, has this small group of powerful individuals been able to launder disastrous wars and military adventurism as “the right thing to do.” The Jo Cox Fund and the four individuals behind it truly exemplify the group of “middlemen” who engineer this manipulation at the behest of some of the world’s richest and most controversial figures.

Though over two years have passed since Cox’s murder, her death continues to be weaponized to suit this same agenda. Now, the global elite continue their fight to oust Jeremy Corbyn from power, fearful that the political triumph of a pacifist will greatly complicate their plans to keep the U.K. embroiled in endless wars abroad, serving their ever expanding economic and global power ambitions.

Yet they can succeed only by hiding their true role in their efforts to oust Corbyn and weaken Labour by dividing it. That is the precise reason that these oligarchs, through their vast fortunes, have constructed a massive inter-connected network of “humanitarian” organizations to convince us that their policies are “people-driven” when they are really “oligarch-driven.”

However, such efforts can bear fruit only under cover of darkness. Only by shining light on this nefarious network, as we have begun to do here, can the public be warned that they are being deceived. No one knows better than the oligarchs that a well-informed public is the greatest threat to their neoliberal policies, their wars, and their ultimate goal of global market monopolies and resource supremacy.

While this investigation has revealed many aspects of this oligarch-driven network, it has only scratched the surface. More work in this field is needed and we encourage any and all inquiring minds to delve deeply into this billionaire-built “humanitarian” regime-change network, exposing its true motives and its manipulative bias mobilization techniques that threaten all our futures.

But the still-developing SNC-Lavalin story and resignation of Jody Wilson-Raybould from cabinet is bewildering and does not fit traditional patterns of Canadian politics.

Three things stand out: The complex nature of the “scandal,” the puzzling resignation of Gerald Butts and the actions of Wilson-Raybould.

First is the nature of the “scandal.” A typical political scandal involves a person who did something wrong out of negligence or motivations of money, personal ambition, sex, etc.

But this is a much more complicated and abstract affair. No one is suggesting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his principal secretary Butts or anyone else in the Liberal Party did anything to line their own pockets, unlike the sponsorship scandal in the early 2000s in which the PMO turned a blind eye as many Liberals benefited handsomely.

Instead, Trudeau and Butts saw political advantage for the government to lighten up on SNC-Lavalin. There are political and economic interests that still clearly carry some weight in Québec.

In public affairs, what is legally wrong is not necessarily unacceptable politically, and vice versa. (For example, despite his outrageous spending practices, Sen. Mike Duffy was acquitted in 2016 of actually breaking the law.)

Alleged pressure

From a legal viewpoint, the issue here is the alleged undue pressure on the attorney-general — which, politically, is an internal matter no different from any other time the PMO throws its weight around. Indeed, this is how Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick recently characterized the entire matter.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld

From a political viewpoint, the more serious matter is the apparent demotion of Wilson-Raybould for not doing what the prime minister asked her to do, which, incidentally, is completely legal from a constitutional viewpoint. The economic dimension and the importance of SNC-Lavalin to Québec complicates matters even further, making this a unique multidimensional “scandal.”

The narrative is complicated and it’s not clear the story has caught fire with the general population. For example, one poll found that while 41 per cent of Canadians felt Trudeau had done something wrong in the affair, another 41 per cent said they weren’t sure.

Given the above muddled narrative, conventional wisdom suggested that the story might just drag out and diminish over time. But then came the bombshell resignation of Butts, which really defies past practice.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick

While other PMO staff have also had great power, they have ultimately been hired help; none have claimed such a deep personal friendship with the prime minister (Brian Mulroney hired many friends, but they generally did not rise to or stay at the top tier).

Nor have any of them played such a public role, like Butts’ independent activity on Twitter. In contrast, Harper’s four chiefs of staff avoided publicity so much that the media was forced to constantly run the same grainy photos of them over and over again.

Political triple play

It’s this triple play of power, friendship ties and public profile that made Butts so exceptional, and thus made it so startling to see him become the first to go in what had seemed a serious but not catastrophic matter.

As the Liberal Party learned to its sorrow after calling the Gomery inquiry into the sponsorship controversy, scandals are best smothered through equivocation and greyness rather than fanning the flames with dramatic action.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld

Butts’ resignation was pretty much the most dramatic action possible and fits no pattern, provoking expectations that there is another shoe waiting to drop.

Finally, Wilson-Raybould’s actions do not fit the pattern of a ministerial resignation. When a minister resigns, they usually either disappear from view to sulk or do everything they can to own the story at the expense of the sitting government — in extreme cases setting up a virtual government-in-exile, like John Turner in relation to Pierre Trudeau or Paul Martin and Jean Chrétien.

Wilson-Raybould has done neither. While complicated by solicitor-client confidentiality (and we do not know who the anonymous sources are that have fed the story to the media), Wilson-Raybould has not adopted the usual techniques of non-stop interviews and op-eds to tell her side of the story, or even a non-story of: “There is so much I wish I could tell you but I can’t say anything.”

Wilson-Raybould’s strategy unclear

Instead, Wilson-Raybould has generally taken the high road. It’s hard to think of another ex-minister asking to come back and speak to the cabinet she just left or appearing in Parliament and then, quite reasonably, abstaining on a vote about herself.

Her intentions and strategy — if there is one — are unclear. It is worth noting that Canada’s first Indigenous woman attorney general and justice minister is doing politics differently and not following the well-worn playbook of dozens of male ex-ministers whose actions have been highly predictable and easily explained by sheer ego and pride.

The SNC-Lavalin story is still developing.

As more information and new developments emerge, we may be able to better fit it into typical patterns of Canadian political history. But for the moment, the SNC-Lavalin affair stands on its own as a complex, multi-dimensional story and not a typical political “scandal.”

The motivations of the key players remain unclear, and its long-term implications, especially for the coming election, are unknown.",Is the SNC-Lavalin controversy truly a scandal?,Theconversation.com,http://theconversation.com/is-the-snc-lavalin-controversy-truly-a-scandal-112208
149,Empty,2019-02-20T13:45:48Z,Women used to be largely ignored by counter-radicalisation strategies. Why that changed.,"Just days after Shamima Begum called for public sympathy for her return to the UK, another young woman was jailed in Baghdad for her role with the so-called Islamic State. Linda Wenzel is German and, like Begum, was 15 years old when she joined Islamic State in 2016. Wenzel has also asked to return to Europe to serve her sentence. There are no signs this will be allowed.

In 2016 I was in Germany, trying to understand young women like Wenzel, for a five-country study on the gender dynamics of violent extremism with my colleague Emily Winterbotham, a senior research fellow at the RUSI think tank. We talked to communities and families affected by radicalisation in the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Canada.

These countries had diverse approaches to radicalisation. France produced counter-radicalisation strategies after the Paris attacks of 2015, while the UK and Netherlands have worked on policy to counter violent extremism since the mid-2000s. Both the Netherlands and UK permit deprivation of citizenship without criminal conviction – which is what has now happened to Begum.

We heard stories of people prevented from travel by police, as well as of both women and men who left for Syria and Iraq. Across the five countries we noted differences in how men and women were recruited, such as more cases of online approaches to women. We also saw how Muslim community anger was often reserved for the young men who fled to join Islamic State. Focus groups within Muslim communities often told us women were “naïve”, lacking in self-esteem, “tricked” by “lover-boys” they met online. They were seen as victims.

Back in 2015-6 this sentiment was mirrored in government policy. France, Germany and the Netherlands tended to treat women jihadists as “victims” of Islamic State. Recent research on returning foreign fighters in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands noted that back then women were “treated with more clemency” and routinely not prosecuted.

That position has changed, with toughening measures for both men and women across Europe. Countries including the UK, Netherlands, Germany and France now investigate and risk-assess both men and women returners. From a position where women and their agency in joining Islamic State were not recognised, the pendulum swung firmly in the other direction.

Hardening attitudes

The first reason why this shift happened was numbers. Countries have had to evolve to catch up with events on the ground. From the Islamic State’s announcement of a “caliphate” in 2014, Europe saw a significant minority of women travel – and women made up around 16-17% of the approximately 6,000 people who left Europe to join the caliphate.

In the case of France, which was new to counter-radicalisation strategies at home and where women made up around 28% of its returners, the shift in policy meant sharp changes to the law and procedures. Canada, which had fewer fighters, adopted a liberal response with few prosecutions of returners – both fighters and others. This prompted accusations from Canada’s opposition Conservative Party of a policy of “group hug sessions”.

A second reason for the hardening of attitudes to women who joined IS was increased knowledge of women’s role in Islamic State. Women were active propagandists, recruiters, ideologues, supporters of current warriors and producers of the next generation. They were involved in the abuse of other women, whether enslaved Yazidis, or in the al-Khansaa brigade, which policed women. Both Begum and Wenzel suggested they were only housewives. But for Islamic State, the wife is the key to the endurance – or baqiya – of both ideology and “caliphate”.

The perception of women’s threat was also explicitly influenced by cases involving women and a seemingly new phenomenon: the all-female jihadist cell. In 2016, three women were arrested in France after a failed attack near Notre Dame. This proved a game-changer for both public opinion and policy regarding returners, despite the fact that these women were radicalised in France. In the UK, another all-female plot was uncovered in 2017.

An increase in threat levels linked to male returners also had an influence on how women were viewed. In 2015, male returners were involved in the Paris attacks and the following year in attacks in Brussels. While women have not yet returned in large numbers, the fear is that women, newly recognised as ideologically committed, might also carry out an attack.

The gender dimension

Both policy and public opinion are shifting from ignoring women in jihadist movements, to “adding” them in to counter-extremism strategies, and increasingly treating the threat they pose as equal to men. There is now an increased assumption in France, the Netherlands and Germany of parity in male and female potential for violence. However, it’s not enough to just to “add women” into existing strategies – governments must recognise the ways in which terrorist groups understand men and women differently.

This means acknowledging two important facts related to power. First, compared to men, instances of women perpetrators of jihadist violence are rare, not because women are “naturally” less violent, or do not support jihad, but because patriarchal jihadi ideology judges female violence highly transgressive. The second relates to the power imbalances in women’s radicalisation. Islamic State ran a systemised online recruitment campaign targeting women, with parallels to child sexual exploitation and grooming. Often older men sought out teenage girls. Women desperate to return emphasise their own victimhood. Some women radicalised to join Islamic State report experiences of sexual abuse, domestic or honour-based violence.

This doesn’t deny women agency or excuse them from complicity in Islamic State atrocities, but recognises the context within which their choices were made. It is more important now, in the current chaos of the end of the caliphate when many women may return to their countries of origin, including within Europe and North America, to recognise the complexity of what it meant to be involved in Islamic State.",Shamima Begum: how Europe toughened its stance on women returning from Islamic State,Theconversation.com,http://theconversation.com/shamima-begum-how-europe-toughened-its-stance-on-women-returning-from-islamic-state-112048

Most recently, we’ve seen attempts to silence dissent in Canada and Sweden.

At Canada’s McMaster University, Chinese students found out that Uighur activist Rukiye Turdush planned to give a talk on campus earlier this month about the detention of Uighurs in Chinese re-education camps. They contacted the Chinese Embassy to ask what they should do, according to The Washington Post. The embassy officials told them to see if any university officials attended the event, find out whether any Chinese nationals organized it, and send them photos and videos of the talk.

At the event on Feb. 11, a Chinese student filmed Turdush before shouting at her and storming out. A few days later, a bulletin signed by five Chinese student groups complained that the school hosted a “separatist” speaker critical of the Chinese government and demanded the university uphold its “duty of supervision.” Turdush is now concerned about the safety of her son, who attends McMaster. One Chinese student wrote in a WeChat group chat, “We should figure out who her son is.”

“The Chinese consulate, using these students, infiltrated [the] academic field in Canada,” Turdush told Radio Free Asia. “This is a war between atrocity and liberal democracy.”

Meanwhile, more than 10,000 people signed a petition protesting the election of Chemi Lhamo, a Tibetan student at the University of Toronto Scarborough, as student president. Chinese students berated her activism promoting Tibetan independence and left hostile messages on her social media accounts. Lhamo said she wouldn’t step down and hoped “this incident will make more people aware of freedom and democracy.”

China’s nationalistic Global Times newspaper applauded the “patriotic action of Chinese students” at both universities.

Over in Sweden, Angela Gui, the daughter of an imprisoned Chinese bookseller, faced a different type of silencing. The Chinese government kidnapped Gui’s father, bookseller and Swedish national Gui Minhai, in Thailand more than three years ago for selling politically sensitive books about top Chinese leaders. He remains in Chinese custody today.

Angela Gui wrote in a recent blog post that in January the Swedish ambassador to China, Anna Lindstedt, contacted her about a “new approach” to her father’s case. She invited Gui to Stockholm to meet with two businessmen she believed could help. For two days, Gui was told to stay in a members-only lounge in a hotel where “there was a lot of wine, a lot of people, and a lot of increasingly strange questions,” she wrote. The “businessmen” asked many personal questions without mentioning how they could help her father. But because Lindstedt was present, Gui assumed the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs had initiated the meeting.

The businessmen said they were negotiating her father’s case and that the bookseller might be released after a trial and short prison sentence. In exchange, Angela Gui needed to agree to stay quiet and stop speaking to the media about the case. According to Gui’s account, Lindstedt agreed to the plan and explained that “if activism and media coverage was to continue, China might ‘punish Sweden.’”

After returning to Britain, where she is studying for a Ph.D., Gui called officials at the Swedish Foreign Ministry and found they did not know this meeting took place or that the ambassador was even in the country. Once she told the businessmen she was declining their plan, they reneged on their promise to reimburse the cost of her trip.

After Gui went public about the incident, the Swedish authorities recalled Lindstedt to Stockholm and placed her under investigation. “We take these reports and other information about contexts where freedom of expression is not fully respected very seriously,” Rasmus Eljanskog, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, told The Washington Post. “The Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs always—and in all contexts—stands up for the fundamental right to freely express oneself, without the threats or reprisals.”",Silence campaigns,Wng.org,https://world.wng.org/2019/02/silence_campaigns

Social agencies expressed confusion, but cautious optimism, at the budget’s lack of a long-promised NDP poverty reduction plan. Instead, there was a $50-a-month increase to the disability and welfare rates, the immediate elimination of interest charges on student loans, and the creation of a provincial renter’s bank to help provide last-ditch loans to avoid eviction.

That disappointed advocates like the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives and Inclusion BC, which said they could see the outlines of an eventual poverty reduction plan, but that the $50 increase was insufficient.

“I think we could have done more,” said senior economist Iglika Ivanova. “I think we definitely have the fiscal capacity.”

Finance Minister Carole James said there will be announcements in the spring, and government has socked away a $500-million forecast allowance, a $750-million contingency fund and $375 million in supplementary estimates to help cover future expenses.

“British Columbia is thriving,” said James. “We have a balanced budget across the fiscal track. We’re the only province with a AAA credit rating … but we will never have a truly prosperous province unless everyone in British Columbia can share in that prosperity.”

One of the marquee announcements was the Child Opportunity Benefit, which would provide up to $1,600 a year for families, depending on income, scale for a child aged up to 18.

“We really want to make sure we have the opportunity for every child to thrive and provide more help to families in raising those children,” said James. “This really is a historic investment, and puts dollars in the pocket of middle-class families.”

But the program does not start until October 2020 — meaning there’s no money set aside in the coming budgetary year and no cheques in the mail for almost 20 months. James said B.C. needed the time to get the Canada Revenue Agency to administer the befit through the income-tax system.

Regardless, the child benefit program doesn’t cut it, said Ivanova.

“No children and families on welfare will be lifted out of poverty by this child benefit,” she said. “It is not big enough.”

The $58-billion fiscal plan for 2019/20 has a projected $274-million surplus. Though the carbon tax is set to increase by a regularly scheduled $5 a tonne on April 1, there was no expansion of last year’s tax measures on high-income earners, corporations, speculators and homes valued at more than $3 million.

“It’s a budget strong on the social side and quite weak on the economic development side,” said Jock Finlayson, executive vice-president of the B.C. Business Council. “It’s complacent. It says the relatively strong economy we’ve been operation on will continue. I’m not sure that’s necessarily true.”

Finlayson said James deserves credit for resisting what must be immense pressure from within her party to spend big. “The fiscal and economic projections I think are credible,” said Finlayson.

The Greater Vancouver Board of Trade gave the budget a “B-“ rating, calling it “a steady as we go budget” built on last year’s tax increases.

Students celebrated the end of interest on their loans, which will save an estimated $2,300 on average for a 10-year loan of $11,200. The program will cost $31 million a year, plus a more than $200 million one-time write-off of existing interest on people with outstanding balances.

“We were very pleased,” said Noah Berson, chairperson of the Alliance of B.C. Students.

The stand-pat budget meant for few flashy announcements on the high-profile NDP election promises of affordable housing and $10-a-day child care.

The budget offered only $9 million in new spending for child care next year, though that’s on top of the $1 billion announced in the last budget spread over three years. That meant the current hybrid system of subsidies and 53 pilot locations for $10-a-day child care won’t be significantly expanded in the coming year, according to ministry officials.

Nor was there any signal when full $10-a-day child care may become a reality.

“Lets remember the child care plan is phased in over time,” said James. “Over the next year, you’ll see the minister and ministry doing evaluation of the prototype of $10-a-day and looking at how we expand those.”

Child care advocate Sharon Gregson said she still believes the government could expand pilot locations and subsidies. “They’ve got room within this funding envelope to do that,” said Gregson. “Now we want to make sure they are spending the money the right way.”

Housing affordability also held to its $7-billion spending plan over 10 years, with a $9-million increase in the budget for “incremental housing initiatives” and more modular housing for the homeless.

There was no sign of an NDP election promise for a $400 annual renters rebate, which is opposed by the NDP’s power-sharing partners the BC Greens.

Green leader Andrew Weaver said he’s pleased to see $902 million over three years for a CleanBC program to promote electricity use and reduce pollution.

“You can clearly see in this budget the signature of B.C. Green influence in a number of ways,” said Weaver.

The money will continue already existing climate action tax credit cheques, as well as extend current $6,000 point-of-sale rebate on electric vehicles, $2,000 to upgrade to an electric heat pump and $1,000 to install better-insulated windows and doors.

The Greens will vote for the budget, said Weaver, thus eliminating the risk the NDP minority government could fall on a confidence vote this year.

Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson said the budget fails to grow the economy or plan for “dark clouds on the horizon” in the economies like the United States, China and Europe.

“The concern is this government is basically trying to buy loyalty from people in ways they can’t afford,” said Wilkinson.

Other small-scale new spending in the budget included $74 million over three years for new mental health and addictions programs for children, and redirecting $297 million in gambling revenue to First Nations over three years.

James said the provincial economy remains the healthiest in Canada, with forecasts of the gross domestic product increased to 2.4 per cent, in part due to the new United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.

A cooling housing market is estimated to cut property transfer tax revenue, lowering it to $1.9 billion from $2.2 billion. Housing starts are expected to drop almost 30 per cent by 2023, compared to the final year of the Liberal government.

However, the budget predicts the average home price “is expected to increase moderately” over three years.

“I don’t think we’re at that stage to say housing is affordable, particularly in our metro centres,” said James.

Paul Kershaw, of Generation Squeeze, said the housing measures “were resting on last year’s laurels.” He said the province should give municipalities incentives to approve more density and purpose-built rental housing.

The budget predicts a stunning turnaround at the Insurance Corp. of B.C., which is on track to lose $1.18 billion but budgeted to only lose $50 million next year once new claims caps and other legal reforms begin.

Health care spending, the single largest item in the annual budget, is budgeted to rise almost $1 billion to $20.8 billion. Elementary and secondary school funding is also budgeted to grow $197 million.

An increase in capital spending for transportation, health, schools and other infrastructure will increase total provincial debt to more than $82 billion in 2021/22, an increase of almost 21 per cent.

Almost four cents of every dollar of revenue will be used to pay for interest on debt. James said the debt-to-GDP ratio on taxpayer-supported debt — a key figure credit agencies use when awarding B.C. a AAA credit rating — remains affordable at an estimated 15 per cent.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is Sikh and wears a turban, making him conspicuously religious in front of a heavily secular province. His French is also weaker than the two previous party leaders, complicating the job of appealing to Quebec voters.

Even in multicultural Outremont, located in the geographic centre of the island of Montreal with one of the largest ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in North America, Singh’s religious clothing is on some voters’ minds. “Some people are concerned about (the turban),” Sanchez said during a recent interview following a candidate debate in the riding. She said when she knocks on doors, “It’s definitely not the main thing people bring up .... It does come up.” Kathryn Furlong, 43, who attended the debate, said she voted for Sanchez, an economist with experience in humanitarian work and climate activism, at an advance poll. She has voted Liberal in the past “but never by conviction. Sometimes to keep the out the Conservatives.”

She said “it’s a sad notion and a sad question,” referring to anyone who would have an issue with the NDP leader’s expression of faith. “And I think political parties in Quebec try to exploit that issue.” Read more: Liberals hoping Outremont byelection win will lead to big gains in Quebec come October Maxime Bernier names People’s Party candidate for Montreal-area byelection Outremont has been represented by the NDP since former party leader Tom Mulcair won a 2007 federal byelection in what had long been a Liberal stronghold. Through the rise and fall of NDP popularity in Quebec, voters elected Mulcair another three times.

Mulcair stepped down last August and is now a visiting professor at Universite de Montreal and a political commentator. The NDP is currently polling fourth in Quebec, far from its highs when Jack Layton helped the party win the majority of the province’s seats in 2011. McGill University philosopher Charles Taylor, a longtime NDP supporter who campaigned with Sanchez ahead of the byelection, said the cool reception Singh has so far received in Quebec is due to the fact he doesn’t yet have a seat in Parliament. Singh is his party’s candidate in one of the other two byelections Monday, in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

Once he gets inside the House of Commons and is regularly in front of the cameras, Taylor predicted, “Quebecers will learn to like him. He’s very engaging, but he’s just not on television all the time.” The Coalition Avenir Quebec won last fall’s provincial election with a promise to prohibit some public servants, including teachers, from wearing religious symbols on the job. But Taylor said Singh is “going to make a case for: ‘You can wear this kind of thing and be a perfectly reasonable person.’ And that’s something that Quebecers are able to listen to.” While an NDP loss Monday would further hurt the party in the province, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals arguably have more at stake. The party has 39 seats in Quebec leading into Monday’s vote and 179 nationally. Polling indicates Liberal support has declined across the country since the 2015 vote, and Trudeau is looking to pick up seats in Quebec to maintain his party’s majority in next fall’s general election. Outremont — where 36 per cent of residents are immigrants and 66 per cent are bilingual — is the kind of riding the Liberals must connect with in order to maintain their success in Quebec. Rachel Bendayan, a lawyer and former political aide, finished second to Mulcair in 2015. Her party has consistently led polls in the province since the last election. But in recent weeks it has been embroiled in controversy over allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office improperly pressured former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to help engineering giant SNC-Lavalin escape criminal prosecution. The Montreal-based company is charged with bribery and fraud over its dealings in Libya, and it has said a conviction could lead to job losses and make it vulnerable to foreign takeover. Bendayan said it is journalists, not the people she meets when knocking on doors in the riding, who are asking about SNC-Lavalin. “No, people are not raising it,” she said in a recent interview recently at her campaign office. “People here are concerned with issues that affect their day-to-day lives. You’d be surprised how many people talk to me about the ice on the sidewalks.” Tom Boushel, 72, a Liberal volunteer who will be driving seniors to vote on Monday, said he doesn’t think the SNC-Lavalin issue will have as much of an impact in Quebec as elsewhere. “Quebecers are sensitive to the risk of job losses,” Boushel said, adding that Montrealers appreciate the prestige of having a global firm headquartered in their city. Boushel said “every elected official of every party ... every government has to fight to keep SNC going. I think in Quebec, I think they understand a little better.” The byelection is the first test for the Bloc Québécois under its new leader, Yves-Francois Blanchet, who was acclaimed in January. The Bloc is hoping its candidate, author Michel Duchesne, will help the party become competitive once again in the riding. Jasmine Louras, a University of Ottawa law student, is representing the Conservatives, while James Seale, a veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces, is running for the People’s Party of Canada, the party Maxime Bernier started after he quit the Conservatives last summer.

They also discussed efforts to end the Syrian conflict.","Syrian President Bashar Assad has visited Iran, his closest regional ally, for the first time since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, state media reported Monday.



Assad met with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani, as well as other top officials in Tehran. It was a rare foreign trip for Assad, who has visited Russia twice since the outbreak of the conflict eight years ago.

Read more: Syria conflict — What do the US, Russia, Turkey and Iran want?

Khamenei praised Assad for strengthening the alliance between Iran, Syria and Hezbollah against US and Western plans for the region.

""The Islamic Republic of Iran sees helping Syria's government and nation as support for the resistance movement and is deeply proud of doing it,"" Khamenei said.

""The creation of the buffer that the Americans are seeking to create in Syria is an example of these dangerous conspiracies which must be strongly denounced and resisted,"" Khamenei added.

Syrian state TV reported that Assad ""thanked the Islamic Republic's leadership and people for what they have given to Syria during the war."" The presidency said ""both sides expressed their satisfaction with the strategic levels reached between the two countries in all fields.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on 'I feel nothing' On February 1, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran from exile in France. When a reporter asked him how he felt upon his return to Iran, Khomeini replied: ""Nothing — I feel nothing."" Some analysts interpreted his remarks as the Shiite leader's idea about embarking on a ""divine mission"" where emotions hardly mattered.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on The Shah ran out of time Two months before Khomeini's return to Iran, an estimated six to nine million people took to the streets in the country's major cities. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, compared to the violent September 8, 1978, protests. The Shah regime, headed by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, had realized that its time in power was over and that they could not stop Khomeini's return.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Even women rooted for Khomeini The revolutionary mood was so intense in Tehran that even many women celebrated Khomeini's return, ignoring the fact that Khomeini had slammed Shah's measures for women's emancipation in exile. In 1963, the Shah of Iran granted women the right to vote.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on A spectacle of exuberance In 1971, the Shah and his wife Farah Diba (seen in the picture) staged a lavish spectacle on the ancient site of Persepolis to mark the ""2,500th anniversary of the Iranian monarchy."" Many heads of state attended the event. Khomeini, in his message from exile, condemned the monarchy as ""cruel, evil and un-Islamic.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Exile and death Under pressure from the Islamic Revolution, the Shah (left) had left Iran on January 16, 1979. After spending time in several countries, he succumbed to cancer on July 27, 1980 in Cairo, Egypt.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Consolidating power In the beginning, women's rights were not a major issue for the Islamic revolutionaries. They only imposed hardline Islam after consolidating their victory.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Soldiers join the revolution Upon Khomeini's return to Iran in 1979, the military did not confront the protesters. On February 11, the army declared itself neutral. Despite that, the revolutionaries executed several generals in February and April.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on New government Soon after his return, Khomeini declared the monarchy, the previous government and parliament illegal, and said he would appoint a government ""because of the fact that this nation believes in me."" According to Iran experts, it was not self-deception but reality.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on The liberal face of the revolution Mehdi Bazargan, a scholar and pro-democracy activist, had campaigned against the Pahlavi dynasty, for which he had been incarcerated for several years. Khomeini appointed him as his first prime minister, although Bazargan was critical of him as well. Bazargan had called Khomeini a ""turbaned Shah"" after a meeting with the Ayatollah in Paris. He remained in office for only nine months.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Occupation of the US Embassy In November 1979, radical Iranian students seized the US Embassy in Tehran and took the embassy staff hostage. The students were fearful of Shah's return to power with US help. Khomeini took advantage of the situation. He dismissed his opponents as ""US allies.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Ali Khamenei – guardian of the revolution In 1989, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was elected by the expert council to succeed Khomeini. Khamenei, to this date, has the ultimate power over all state institutions. Although the 79-year-old does not have the same charisma as his predecessor, he represents the policies of Iranian hardliners who refuse to reform the system and continue to persecute dissidents.

Assad takes victory lap

Assad has retaken major cities and largely defeated rebels seeking to oust him with the support of Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah.

The regime now controls most of the population and about two-thirds of the country, excluding a jihadi-controlled enclave in Idlib, Turkish zones in the north and a part of the country controlled by US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces. Assad has vowed to bring all territory under the state's sovereignty.

Sitting in the room during Assad's meeting with Khamenei was General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force — the overseas arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) which has provided the Syrian regime with military and financial support.

During their meeting, Rouhani assured Assad that ""Tehran will be alongside Damascus in the stabilization, return of refugees and internal political process.""

The two presidents also discussed efforts by Russia, Iran and Turkey to end the Syrian conflict.

Iranian-backed Shiite militias have carved out a major role in Syria's security apparatus, and Tehran and Damascus have in recent months signed a string of economic deals that are likely to further increase Iran's long-term presence in the country.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Rise of Hezbollah Hezbollah, or Party of God, was conceived by Muslim clerics in the 1980s in response to the Israeli invasion of South Lebanon in 1982. The Shiite group has a political and military wing.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization National support against Israel Hezbollah emerged in the 1980s as an amalgamation of Shiite militias and played a major role in the Lebanese civil war. It used guerrilla warfare to drive Israeli forces out of South Lebanon — Israel withdrew in 2000. Israel and Hezbollah fought another war in 2006. Its defense of Lebanon against Israel had won it cross-sectarian support and acceptance in Lebanese society.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Backed by Iran Since its creation, Hezbollah has received military, financial and political support from Iran and Syria. Today, Hezbollah's military wing is more powerful than Lebanon's own army and has become a major regional paramilitary force.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Political apparatus Hezbollah turned its focus to politics following the end of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. It represents a large section of the Lebanese Shiite population and is allied with other sectarian groups, including Christians. Their political development has mostly come under Hassan Nasrallah (pictured), who became the group's leader in 1992.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Armed wing Unlike other parties in Lebanon's multi-sided 1975-1990 civil war, Hezbollah did not disband its armed wing. Some Lebanese political groups, such as Prime Minister Saad Hariri's Future Movement, want Hezbollah to put down its arms. Hezbollah argues its militant wing is necessary to defend against Israel and other external threats.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Terror group? A number of countries and bodies, including the United States, Israel, Canada and the Arab League, consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization. However, Australia and the European Union differentiate between its legitimate political activities and its militant wing.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Hezbollah enters Syria's civil war Hezbollah has been one of the main backers of Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country's civil war. Its entrance into the war helped save Assad, one of its chief patrons; secured weapons supply routes from Syria and formed a buffer zone around Lebanon against Sunni militant groups it feared would take over Syria. As a result it has won considerable support from Shiite communities in Lebanon.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Sectarianism Lebanon has long been at the center of regional power struggles, particularly between Saudi Arabia and Iran. However, Hezbollah's military and political ascendancy, as well as its intervention in Syria, have also helped stoke Sunni-Shiite sectarian tensions in Lebanon and across the region.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Renewed conflict with Israel? Iran and Hezbollah have increased their political and military strength through the war in Syria. Israel views this as a threat and has carried out dozens of airstrikes on Iran/Hezbollah targets in Syria. Israel has vowed to not let Iran and Hezbollah create a permanent presence in Syria. There is growing concern of another war between Hezbollah and Israel that could draw in Iran. Author: Chase Winter

Tensions with Israel, US

Iran's growing influence in Syria has increased the prospect of a conflict with Israel, which has carried out dozens of attacks on Iranian forces, Shiite militia and Hezbollah.

US President Donald Trump announced in December that all American forces would leave Syria, but US officials recently said between 200-400 troops would remain in the country to support US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces and prevent a resurgence of the ""Islamic State."" The US also has a base at al-Tanf, near the Iraqi border, where troops are expected to stay.

The decision to maintain a US troop presence is intended to prevent clashes between US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces and NATO ally Turkey. It is also viewed as an attempt to stop the Assad regime and Iran-backed militia from widening their grip over more of Syria's territory.

In order to get rid of the Liberals, Justin needs to stay right where he is until October

Yesterday Prime Minister Justin Trudeaus principal secretary, Gerald Butts, resigned. Currently the Liberal government is involved in its worst scandal yet, being accused of trying to get then Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould not to proceed with criminal charges against SNC Lavalin, a company that contributes big time to the Liberal Party of Canada.

Butts resignation was one of those things, if this makes sense, which was both shocking and not totally unexpected. Butts and Trudeau go way back and have been friends since their university days or in Justins case, his university minutes. Butts was often referred to as Prime Minister Butts, Trudeaus Brain and Trudeaus Puppet Master. When Trudeau did or said something clearly beyond his mental capacity to do so, that act or statement was believed to have originated with Butts.

156,Empty,2019-02-21T15:11:23Z,We are surprised that no one has hit upon the obvious solution to the Jussie Smollett mystery: Brett Kavanaugh did it.,"(Roman Genn)

• We are surprised that no one has hit upon the obvious solution to the Jussie Smollett mystery: Brett Kavanaugh did it.

• Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar is running for the Demo­cratic nomination for president. She is a relative moderate — relative, that is, to the very recent trend in her party, which means that she would have counted as a down-the-line liberal only a few years ago. She does not favor free four-year college for all, she explained regretfully a few days after her campaign began, because the money has to come from somewhere. Reporters have been unearthing stories of her abusive treatment of her aides. If she continues to dismiss left-wing pipe dreams, a lot of Democratic primary voters may start yelling back.

• Elizabeth Warren plans to make it cheaper for American parents to use “high quality” child care, with taxpayers picking up the tab. It would be a mistake to believe that her plan would expand parents’ options. What the senator proposes would in­stead stack the deck, encouraging parents to choose the child-care arrangement, commercial day care, that they currently favor least, and penalizing parents who choose differently. The latter group includes families with stay-at-home moms, families that hire nannies, and families that rely on informal arrangements, often involving relatives. The Warren-for-president campaign is shaping up to be an expensive way for Americans to get something they don’t want.

• William Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts and Libertarian nominee for vice president, said he will run against President Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. Many of the voters who selected Trump in November 2016 had to overcome serious reservations to do it. Republicans who remain anti-Trump would also have to overcome serious reservations to vote for Weld. They would have to stomach a Republican who favors abortion, is unconcerned about threats to religious liberty, approves regulations on guns even when they cannot possibly have a significant effect on homicide rates, and endorsed Barack Obama. The future of the Republican party may be unclear at the moment, but surely this isn’t it.

• Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor of Virginia, continues to insist that he will serve out his term after first admitting and then denying that he appeared in a photo of a white man in blackface and a man in a KKK costume that graced his medical-school-yearbook page. He will devote his remaining time to racial reconciliation, he says. He has reportedly been reading left-wing tracts on race, and says his controversy highlights “ongoing inequities to access to things like education, health care, mortgages, capital, entre­pre­neur­ship.” It doesn’t, of course, but the meaning is clear enough: Most Virginians have never worn blackface, but they can all pay higher taxes to expiate Ralph Northam’s sins.

• Representative Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, wants to be perfectly clear about something: She doesn’t hate Jews on a case-by-case basis but only despises Jews corporately in the form of the Jewish state. On the matter of Israel, she checks each of Natan Sharansky’s 3-D boxes: delegitimization, demonization, and double standards. She also has a penchant for engaging in Protocols of the Elders of Zion–style libel and conspiracy theories regarding Jews and in particular Jewish Americans, whom she accuses of bribing Congress to act in Israel’s interests. Nefarious Jews, she has claimed in the past, have “hypnotized” the world in order to further the Jewish state’s wicked agenda. To which she added: “May Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” Like fellow freshman Representative Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.), who accuses Jewish Americans of having dual loyalties, she apparently falls naturally into the darkly conspiratorial Jew-hating mode of political thought, though she finds herself obliged to apologize for it from time to time. Anti-Semitism is ascendant on the left: Repre­sentative Tlaib recently was discovered to have written a column for Final Call, the newspaper published by Jew-hating weirdo par excellence Louis Farrakhan. He remains a favorite among such progressive leaders as Women’s March organizer Linda Sarsour. But Sarsour is not a member of the House of Representatives, although if she were she would fit right in with the Democratic caucus.

• Omar had a nutty first month in Congress. One of the things she did was tear into Elliott Abrams as a war criminal. Abrams is the State Department’s special representative for Venezuela. During the Reagan administration, he held foreign-policy posts concerning human rights and Latin America. Omar peddled the old leftist line — remember the Christic Institute? remember CISPES? — that the Reagan administration enabled right-wing death squads in Central America. In truth, the Reaganites steered Central America toward a democratic path and away from both right-wing militias and left-wing totalitarians. In 1988, Reagan was able to say, “The growth of democracy has become one of the most powerful political movements of our age. In Latin America in the 1970s, only a third of the population lived under democratic government; today over 90 percent does.” Ilhan Omar should learn this, and much else.

• If you would like to see the Green New Deal in miniature, turn your eyes to California, where ill-advised plans for a high-speed train connecting Los Angeles with San Francisco have been abandoned after tens of billions of dollars were wasted. A round-trip flight between the cities takes 90 minutes and can be had for as little as $149, so the importance of a bullet train as a means of conveyance was always mysterious. But it was never about travel: It was to be a symbol of high-tech, green progressivism instantiated through big, expensive infrastructure projects. And so it is. Newly elected Democratic governor Gavin Newsom, noting that the project had never been on schedule and already had doubled in price to $77 billion and rising, announced that the plan was to be abandoned. Hilariously, he says he intends to finish the first stage of the project, meaning that California will have spent billions of dollars on a high-speed train connecting Bakersfield to Merced — by 2027, in the unlikely event this happens on schedule.

• The Senate is set to vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill that would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive in the course of attempted abortions. Republicans in the House and Senate are pushing the legislation in the wake of Virginia governor Ralph Northam’s apparent endorsement of letting infants die, at least in some circumstances. Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.), the bill’s sponsor, asked for unanimous consent on the measure in early February but was blocked by Senate Democrats, who say the legislation is anti-abortion and, given existing homicide laws, redundant. Neither of these claims is accurate. Federal law does not do much to protect infants born alive in abortions, and Democrats are worried that if it did it would undermine the logic of unlimited abortion rights. So it would. In voting on this legislation, Democrats must choose between incoherence and infanticide.

• Numerous media outlets lit up in February with stories about taxpayers’ receiving smaller refunds than they did last year, the ludicrous implication being that the recent tax reform had hurt them. Think tanks across the political spectrum are unanimous in finding that the overwhelming majority of Americans will see a tax cut. As for the refunds, it is not clear that they will be smaller, on average, when tax season ends. If they are, it will mean only that tax withholding has become more accurate. A large refund means that a taxpayer has been sending too much money to Washington over the course of a year. Smaller refunds would be a cause for celebration in a financially literate country, something that much of our press is helping ensure we do not become.

• American birth rates hit a 30-year low. While popular explanations for the trend often posit that Americans want fewer children than in the past, surveys of women have suggested for five decades that they want more children than they have. As economist Lyman Stone points out in a recent paper for the American Enterprise Institute, what’s really behind the collapse is that Americans spend a lower and lower proportion of their fertile years married. Children and marriage are not as tightly connected as they used to be, and more’s the pity, but the link is still there. A society that ignores it is undermining its future.

• Amazon canceled its plans to site a new co-headquarters in Queens after local politicians objected to its wages and to the tax breaks the city and state were planning to give the company. Huge, successful companies such as Amazon increasingly want to be located in places with a lot of ambitious and highly schooled potential workers. But as the Queens debacle showed, those places need and therefore want those companies less. Amazon erred. So did the politicians. Targeted tax breaks have a poor track record at spurring development for cities and states, which are better off creating a welcoming climate for business across the board. As with the breaking off of many engagements, this one was probably for the best.

• Ryan Morgan is a quiet 17-year-old from West Bend, Wis., who likes the Green Bay Packers and hanging out with his girlfriend and aspires to work at the local water-utility plant after he graduates. Esquire featured him on the cover of its March issue under the cover line “An American Boy: What it’s like to grow up white, middle class, and male in the era of social media, school shootings, toxic masculinity, #MeToo, and a divided country.” The cover story shed some interesting light on this question. So too did the reaction to it. Outrage erupted on Twitter and spilled over onto editorial pages. Critics (who by and large had not read the piece) complained that it was published during black-history month, an obvious affront to blacks; that it presented a member of a privileged class as a victim; that it gave an undeserved “platform” to a white male, a breed from which we’ve heard enough. Ryan Morgan no doubt got the message: Sit down and shut up, because of who you are.

• In November, President Trump was asked who should be held accountable for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist. He answered, “Maybe the world should be held accountable, because the world is a vicious place.” But the world did not kill Khashoggi, individuals did — and someone ordered them to do it. In October, a bipartisan group of senators triggered the Global Magnitsky Act, giving the president 120 days to investigate who killed Khashoggi and what the consequences should be. The deadline has expired, with no credible response. There’s a line between being realistic about the Saudis and participating in a cover-up, and the administration doesn’t seem to be mindful of it.

• The U.S. is trying to deliver humanitarian aid to Venezuela. Nicolás Maduro is blocking it. C-17s carrying hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of food and supplies have landed in Cúcuta, a Colombian city on the border, but Maduro had the military close the road between the two countries. Millions of Venezuelans have fled the country thanks to the lack of food, while those who remain struggle to fend off starvation. What stands in the way of relief are a few shipping containers, and Maduro’s stubborn grip on power.

• U.S. officials have been warning European countries that allowing Huawei, the Chinese telecom company, to do business uninhibited could mean a downgrade in relations. A U.K. intelligence agency found, however, that it poses only a “manageable” national-security risk, according to a report in the Financial Times. The U.S. has it right: Last month a Huawei employee in Poland was arrested for espionage, and any data gathered by Huawei could easily become the property of Beijing thanks to a suite of recently passed Chinese laws. New Zealand and Australia have already banned Huawei from building their 5G networks, and Canada is seriously considering it. Time to listen to the former colonies.

• Raise a glass to Igor Lipsits. He is an economics professor in Moscow. His textbook was recently banned from Russian schools. A panel asked him to add lines that would “promote love for the Motherland.” Lipsits declined. “I’ve become unused to writing such things” since the fall of the Soviet Union, he said, “and I’m not keen to revive my skills at windbaggery.” He also said, “My conception of patriotism was formed way back in my youth. And it assumes work toward the development of the country and its people, and not praise toward those who are ruling it at the present moment. . . . I can’t change myself — I’m too old now for such ideological somersaults.” An honorable man is a valuable thing in any country.

• In December, Time magazine named a group of journalists its collective “Person of the Year.” Some of these journalists had been murdered; some had been imprisoned; and one was still at large, so to speak. That journalist was Maria Ressa, a Filipina who co-founded a news website called “Rappler.” It has been a thorn in the side of Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines’ strongman, and a boastful killer of journalists. His government has not killed Ressa, but it has arrested her, on trumped-up charges of cyber libel and tax evasion. Fame — in the form of Time-magazine covers, for example — is not a guarantee against murder. But it does help. May Ressa and her brave colleagues keep up their important work.

• The actor Jussie Smollett’s description of his alleged assault in the small hours of January 29 in Chicago was what P. G. Wodehouse would have called a rummy affair. Smollett, a gay black actor-singer who appears on the television show Empire, said two men suddenly jumped him shouting racist and anti-gay slurs, beat him (lightly, it seemed), and put a rope around his neck, then ran away as suddenly as they had appeared. In his initial account to police, Smollett left out a crucial detail that he or his representatives later supplied to the celebrity-gossip site TMZ: The men had shouted, “This is MAGA country!” as they carried out their fell scheme. Reasonable people had many questions about this supposed attack, which Smollett later attributed to his outspoken opposition to President Trump. Why didn’t he call the police on the cell phone he had in his possession? Why did he keep the rope around his neck for 40 minutes? Why did two men bother to attack him if they weren’t going to inflict serious injury or rob him? How did the two Trump-loving attackers know that their ideological foe would be in that place at that time, anyway? Sensible observers were anything but shocked when, on February 16, after an exhaustive investigation, police sources told CNN and several other news outlets they believed the attack had been staged with the aid of two brothers from Nigeria who were friends of Smollett and had accepted some $3,500 in advance payment. The same sources said they could prove that the brothers had purchased the rope. The previously voluble Smollett lawyered up and declined repeated police invitations to clarify matters in a follow-up interview. Hate-crime hoaxes do considerable damage to America’s social and cultural fabric and tie up police resources better spent on other matters. Should Smollett be found guilty of perpetrating a hoax, may he receive punishment in keeping with a serious offense.

• “Mr. McCarrick” is how the New York Times refers to him now. Pope Francis has laicized, or defrocked, Theodore McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C. After the Arch­diocese of New York deemed credible an allegation that McCarrick had sexually abused a minor in the 1970s, the Vatican removed him from public ministry last summer, and he resigned from the College of Cardinals a few weeks later. McCarrick’s reputation for sexually harassing seminarians was longstanding in the hierarchy. His case is a dreary illustration of separate but related concerns — sexual crimes under the law, and a range of sexual sins under Church teaching — that weigh on the faithful as bishops from around the world convene in Rome to discuss sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. Although by all accounts the incidence of abuse has plummeted since the turn of the century, the business of coming clean about past scandals remains unfinished. McCarrick has become an emblem of the crisis. Expect more examples to emerge in the years ahead.

• The Southern Baptist Convention has now had its Me Too moment. A comprehensive Houston Chronicle and San Antonio Express-News investigation found that hundreds of Baptist leaders and volunteers committed acts of sexual misconduct against roughly 700 victims. Misconduct included heinous acts of rape and child molestation. The allegations are deeply disturbing but, sadly, not surprising. There was never any reason to believe that sex scandals would be predominantly confined to the Catholic Church, and there was never any reason to believe that any church is free of evil people. It’s the church’s responsibility, however, to understand that fact and respond with alacrity to allegations of abuse. On that count, all too many Baptist churches failed. In response to the report, Baptist leaders showed entirely appropriate sadness and humility. Actions matter more than words, however, and every church must take very seriously the possibility that even trusted leaders and congregants can commit terrible acts of abuse.

• At long last, the Mars rover known as Opportunity has sent its final report back to Earth. After 15 years, it succumbed to a dust storm that kept it from charging its batteries with the sun’s rays. Since landing in 2003, it had roamed the red planet’s surface, sending home data; most notably, along with its partner, Spirit (d. 2010), it had conclusively established the onetime presence of water, which raises the tantalizing possibility of life on Mars. In the half century since Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon, space travel has come to seem routine, but the fact that Opportunity survived 15 years (more than 50 times its expected lifespan) in the harsh and unforgiving Martian environment, without even an oil change, shows that the can-do spirit of the lunar-landing program is still going strong.

• A Florida couple (we can tell you’re interested already) locked their keys inside their SUV at a shopping center. Their baby was also locked inside, which left the couple frantic but at a loss for what to do. Then a crew of work-release convicts, laboring nearby in their striped uniforms, noticed what was happening and offered to lend their expertise at breaking into locked cars to help the worried pair. A wire coat-hanger was procured, the convicts set to work, and in a few minutes the parents and child were reunited. A happy ending for all — except the convicts, who had to go back to prison at the end of the day. We’re not sure whether demonstrating that you’ve kept up your car-theft skills while incarcerated is something that will impress the parole board, but in this case we think it should.

• What should you do when confronted by a mountain lion who seems ready to pounce like a Republican on a Democratic gaffe? You probably can’t outrun it, but the other options are not much better: One source unhelpfully advises you to “stand firm and make an effort to look larger,” and when that doesn’t work, “fight back using any weapon at hand.” A man named Travis Kauffman, running on a trail near Fort Collins, Colo., took this last bit of advice literally when he was attacked by a mountain lion (admittedly a juvenile one, but still) and strangled it with his bare hands. He suffered serious wounds to his face, limbs, and torso, requiring 16 stitches, but as the saying goes: You should have seen the other guy. Oh, and after polishing off the mountain lion, he ran three more miles before someone gave him a ride to the hospital. Parks officials emphasize that attacks by mountain lions are exceedingly rare, and with badass opponents like Kauffman, perhaps it’s no wonder.

• When we put our colleague Reihan Salam on the cover of National Review a couple of months ago, a few outcomes seemed likely: 1) he’d take up modeling on the side; 2) he’d go into seclusion to escape the attention of his adoring fans; 3) he’d become the president of a major think tank. We are de­lighted that — so far! — it’s option 3. We are absolutely thrilled that he’s becoming the president of the Manhattan Institute. This is a perfect match: Reihan cares deeply about public policy in general and urban policy in particular. Anyone who encounters him knows he’s brilliant and creative, with a matchless knack for identifying talent and a passion for developing it. He has been an immensely productive colleague and dear friend, and we look forward to fruitful collaborations to come.

• “I’m not paid to be a nice guy,” John Dingell said. “I’m paid to look after the public interest.” From his perch on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, he subpoenaed federal officials, investigated government fraud, and exposed it, although his critics complained that in his zeal he sometimes misfired and defamed the innocent. An old-school northern Democrat, Dingell represented a swathe of southeast Michigan, where the automotive industry appreciated his allergy to over-regulation. Labor unions counted him a reliable ally. On social issues he was moderately conservative earlier on. He tacked leftward later but in any case never showed much relish for culture wars. When he arrived in Congress in 1955, taking the seat his father had held for more than 20 years, he picked up Dingell Sr.’s baton and began making the case for national health insurance, decades ahead of his time. His wife, Debbie, has held the seat since his retirement in 2015. No one has served in the House longer than he did, just months shy of 60 years. A senior senior statesman, dead at 92. R.I.P.

• Lyndon LaRouche began crazy and died redundant. The perennial presidential candidate — he didn’t miss an election from 1976 to 2004, even when he was in prison — began his political career as a member of the Socialist Workers party but also ran for office as a Democrat and an independent. Early in his career he authored a book of socialist political theory (Dialectical Economics: An Introduction to Marxist Political Economy) and remained throughout his life committed to the notion of an impending “crisis of capitalism,” which he proposed to address with policies ranging from the familiar (he was a Glass-Steagall man to the end) to the eccentric. He believed that British interests were at the heart of most of America’s problems, and the world’s, too. He was a trafficker in conspiracy theories ranging from the vile (he was a Holocaust denier and lifelong anti-Semite) to the absurd (that the Queen of England is a kingpin in the global narcotics trade). He was a figure of fun and a target of derision, as were his cult-like followers distributing his pamphlets in airport terminals and other public places. But his life’s great themes are ascendant in left-wing politics in 2019: socialism, anti-Semitism, paranoia directed at international financial institutions, and, of course, the conspiratorial view of worldwide political and economic affairs. Dead at 96. R.I.P.

• Pleading with his manager to write him into the lineup, journeyman Duane Kuiper needled him: And what about that brawl you lost to Eddie Mathews in 1960? The manager smiled. “You had to deal with Frank that way,” Kuiper later re­marked. “He could not tolerate guys that weren’t tough.” No one disputed Frank Robinson’s toughness: After Mathews punched him out, Robinson came back in game two of the doubleheader and, ignoring his swollen eye, hit a home run and a double. He made a diving catch in the outfield to rob Mathews of a base hit. Robinson broke through with the Cincinnati Reds in 1956 and led the Baltimore Orioles to the world championship in 1966. When he hung up his spikes in 1976, he had amassed more awards than we can list here. In 1975 he became the first black manager in Major League Baseball, for the Cleveland Indians. A managerial and coaching career of decades followed, interspersed with stints in the Orioles’ front office and capped by service in various positions with MLB. No man in the history of the game had greater range. Number 20, dead at 83. R.I.P.

• The outsider theme loomed large for Patrick Caddell, the burly, unvarnished, often grumpy political guru and pollster whose wisdom was central to electing a one-term southern governor president in 1976. Years of consulting Democratic presidential hopefuls followed, but the party man came to believe his party — increasingly ruled by coastal elites, fixated on green extremism, intolerant of its former base — had hollowed out. He was also confident a populist volcano was set to erupt, and sought to prove it: His extensive 2015 “Candidate Smith” survey exposed enormous disaffection with both major parties and overwhelming support for independent political leadership. Few believed his analysis. Events quickly proved him right. Pat Caddell will be remembered by many for his analyzing on Fox: abrupt, a temper ever on the verge, but relentlessly perceptive. His passions were not limited to politics: He deeply loved his daughter and grandchildren, America, Americans. The patriot was felled by a massive stroke. Dead at 68. R.I.P.

• When the Giants left the Polo Grounds for San Francisco in the late 1950s, the passions of many New Yorkers followed them west, and so soon did a fan. Local boy Peter Magowan grew up in Manhattan, where he rooted for Willie Mays and his teammates. As a young executive, he found himself eventually near the Golden Gate (helping run Safeway Corporation — he was its CEO for 14 years), where he could once again root, root, root for the old/new home team. And then, in 1992, the Giants’ owners hinted of moving to Florida. Once being enough, Magowan assembled a posse of investors and bought the storied franchise to keep it in the City by the Bay (he served as managing general partner until 2008). Then he orchestrated the construction of a new stadium, one of Major League Baseball’s finest, built without any public funds, to replace windswept and rundown Candlestick Park. Recent years found the welcoming supporter of this magazine and National Review Institute, and other conservative causes, in a relentless battle with cancer. Of that he never complained. In January, Peter Magowan succumbed, age 76, his final missives to us still showing all the signs of a most happy warrior. R.I.P.

• When he was in college, Ray Price helped WFB research God and Man at Yale. Naturally, we like to think that this was the high point of Price’s career. In any event, he graduated from Yale in 1951, the year the book came out. Price was a moderate Republican, going so far as to choose Johnson over Goldwater in 1964. In the next presidential cycle, Nixon asked him to write speeches for him — which he did. In the White House, Price was part of a famous, formidable triumvirate of speechwriters: Price, Safire, and Buchanan. Price was known for the graceful, high-minded stuff. He was a Nixon loyalist, perhaps to a fault. In Nixon’s post-presidential years, Price helped him with several books. Ray Price was a thoughtful gent, and a patriotic one, caring deeply about the United States, democracy, and a free world. Dead at 88. R.I.P.

CLIMATE

The Same Old Deal

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was supposed to be the Democratic party’s fresh new face but has chosen to launch her congressional career with some of the worst ideas from the 1930s.

Her “Green New Deal” is less a substantive legislative agenda than a marketing campaign for a utopian enviro-socialist sensibility that already was outmoded back when Barack Obama was pushing it years ago, and when Thomas Friedman was pushing it before him, and when the Communist Party USA was pushing it before him. Van Jones, quondam Maoist adviser to President Obama, wrote a book on the subject, The Green Collar Economy, in which he made the case for conjoining “our two biggest problems,” which we are to take to be climate change and the fact that some people make a lot more money than others. His program, which is now Ocasio-Cortez’s, will be familiar to any student of the history of socialism: a takeover of the “commanding heights” of the economy in the service of a romantic political agenda.

True to the socialist creed she professes, Representative Ocasio-Cortez calls for a series of ten-year plans aimed at putting the entirety of the U.S. economy under political discipline: The government will decide how goods are produced and how they will get to market, how automobiles and airplanes function, how agriculture is conducted. The 29-year-old congresswoman, who has no relevant experience, presumes to tell farmers and autoworkers how to do their jobs while in a state of pristine ignorance about what that work actually involves.

Setting aside the unpleasant history of socialist attempts to forcibly reorganize agriculture, there is much that is familiar — and wrongheaded — in this iteration of the Green New Deal, though we do appreciate its honesty in promising to look after the financial interests of “those unwilling to work.” That phrase appeared in a support document released by Ocasio-Cortez’s office — by mistake, she now says. But she may as well tell the truth about her program: It contains promises that no serious environmentalist believes to be practical (or likely even possible), such as cutting carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2030; giving every American a government-guaranteed job “with a family-sustaining wage, family and medical leave, vacations, and retirement security”; ending the use of fossil fuels in electricity generation while simultaneously eliminating nuclear energy, the most environmentally friendly source of such power; overhauling all manufacturing; retrofitting every building in the United States with . . . something; building a new electrical grid; replacing all the cars and trucks on the road; and much more.

Paying for that? A question for lesser minds, apparently.

One of the great weaknesses of progressive thought at the moment is the philosophy of “everything is everything,” the inane insistence that, e.g., climate change and abortion rights are intrinsically linked, that carbon dioxide emissions are a racial-justice question, etc. It is an affectation that reveals deficient thinking. There are things that need to be done to protect the environment, and there are things that need to be done in the interests of the poor and the marginally employed. Reforming the welfare system is a project probably best undertaken independently of any ten-year plans involving fine-tuning the methane-producing digestive systems of America’s livestock.

IMMIGRATION

Trump’s End Run

President Trump may be right in his legal analysis of his declaration of emergency — lose, lose, then win, maybe.

He’ll certainly be blocked by the lower courts and then have some chance to prevail in the Supreme Court, which may well be reluctant to adjudicate a conflict between the two branches of government or to second-guess the commander-in-chief’s determination about what constitutes an emergency or spending for a military purpose. (He will also access other pots of money that don’t require a declaration of emergency, and here he may be on much firmer ground legally.)

We oppose the president’s decision to declare an emergency and repurpose billions of dollars of defense spending to the border, purportedly to support the military, not because we are confident it will be ultimately blocked by the courts, but regardless of whether it will ultimately be blocked by the courts. Even if the president technically has this authority, using it explicitly to bypass the congressional spending power is an abuse of it.

The laws that the president will use were clearly written with some dire national-security event in mind that would make it impossible for the president to go to Congress with the necessary dispatch. We believe there is a crisis at the border, but obviously nothing of this nature, as witnessed by the years-long attempt by the president to get Congress to fund his border wall, including the latest drawn-out political confrontation and negotiation. The president isn’t acting unilaterally because he can’t go to Congress, but because he has done so and he did not fully get what he wanted.

There is much angst about the precedent that Trump is creating. We share it, even if it is rich coming from Democrats who didn’t raise any objection to Barack Obama’s “pen and phone” governance. Obama rewrote our immigration laws on his own to impose his unilateral amnesties. At least Trump has colorable statutory authority for his move; Obama had none.

Ultimately, if Congress wants to reassert its prerogatives, it can’t leave statutes on the table that can easily be exploited by the executive, and it must object to executive overreach even when that overreach suits its partisan purposes. Harry Reid didn’t care when Obama went around Congress, and it pains us to say that Mitch McConnell, ordinarily the Senate’s most rigorous institutionalist, is now publicly following Reid’s example.

This is no way to run a railroad, or to preserve what are supposed to be the guardrails around our constitutional structure.

OBITUARY

Jeffrey Hart, R.I.P.

Was there a better teacher? Most of Jeff Hart’s colleagues had not matriculated at Dartmouth, where he taught 18th-century English and his beloved moderns, Fitzgerald and Hemingway. But we all learned from him, about these subjects and so much else, via his articles, his reviews, and the flow of his casual talk. Learned, witty, spiced at times with an eyewitness touch (his story of W. H. Auden dropping his three-by-five cards before a lecture at Dartmouth, and being too many sheets to the wind to reorder them, was priceless: Auden made some interesting points, Jeff’s colleagues said, but wasn’t he a bit — disjointed?). Jeff also knew everything about tennis — he had played Don Budge — and college sports.

Like all great teachers, he was a great encourager of others. The conservative movement is filled with his protégés — Paul Gigot, Peter Robinson, James Panero, Laura Ingraham, Dinesh D’Souza. But he took an interest in all who came through NR’s doors, however fleetingly. We were always welcome speaking guests at Dartmouth, and houseguests of his.

At NR he was WFB’s indispensable right hand, ready to put together a magazine or run an editorial conference on the not-infrequent occasions when No. 1 had some other unbreakable engagement. Sparks could fly — Jeff was a bonny fighter, and his editorial prose showed it — but he guaranteed that the wheels would spin.

Ideologically, Jeff was a fan of Richard Nixon and his attempts to broaden the Republican and conservative coalitions along what Nixon called “new majority lines.” Watergate derailed that strategy, but Jeff was always alert for opportunities to resurrect it. Checking the boxes on intellectual litmus tests was never his thing.

It is only fair to him to say that he became disaffected from many of his former commitments during the tenure of George W. Bush. Part of it was cultural: Old Ivy League loyalties die hard, and though W. went to Yale, his Texas-Evangelical manners turned Jeff off. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars also struck him as costly debacles.

Jeff would no doubt have recalled a witticism of one of his favorite Tories, Dr. Johnson: When a butcher tells you that his heart bleeds for his country, he has in fact no uneasy feeling. Cynical? Perhaps — but also realistic, about men, politics, and the vanity of presuming that one can figure everything out.

What Jeff’s friends may remember most is his laugh. He laughed at your jokes, and he laughed at his own — in such a way, always, that you were welcomed to join in. Our thoughts go to his family, and his many, many former students. Dead at 88, R.I.P.",The Week,National Review,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/03/11/the-week-24/

Sign-up at the bottom of the page to get it delivered straight to your inbox.

If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau‘s recent comments on Jody Wilson-Raybould and SNC-Lavalin were an attempt to insulate himself against the unfolding scandal — at one press conference last week Trudeau repeatedly presented himself as outside of any political-pressure loop (“[she had] an obligation to raise that with me. No one, including Jody, did that” … “her responsibility [was] to let me know” … “she said nothing of that to me” … “should be coming to me” etc. etc. etc.) — Gerald Butts‘s self-throw under the bus on Monday seems intended to cement the wall around Trudeau. It is not at all certain to work.

Butts, who served as principal secretary since Trudeau won in 2015, denied he or anyone in the PMO pressured then-attorney general Wilson-Raybould to go easy on SNC-Lavalin in a criminal investigation, but resigned nevertheless. (Canadian Press)

From Butts’s letter:

Any accusation that I or the staff put pressure on the Attorney general is simply not true. Canadians are rightly proud of their public institutions. They should be, because they work. But the fact is that this accusation exists. It cannot and should not take one moment away from the vital work the Prime Minister and his office is doing for all Canadians. My reputation is my responsibility and that is for me to defend. It is in the best interests of the office and its important work for me to step away. (Maclean’s)

Butts’s letter suggests more revelations are to come, and that whatever conversations Wilson-Raybould and he had about SNC-Lavalin, they’ll be hard to explain, writes Stephen Maher:

In his resignation letter, Butts wrote that “I categorically deny the accusation that I or anyone else in [Trudeau’s] office pressured Ms. Wilson-Raybould. We honoured the unique role of the Attorney General.” It seems likely that Wilson-Raybould will eventually give a different version of her conversation with Butts. We don’t know when that will happen, what she will say or how voters, ethics commissioners or other lawful authorities will weigh the different stories, but the implications could hardly be more serious, since political actors are not supposed to interfere in prosecutions, no matter how many lobbyists a company hires, or how many engineers it employs in, ahem, vote-rich Quebec. (Maclean’s)

Having cut off his right hand, Trudeau will now have to find out if he can get by without Butts, writes Paul Wells:

This Thursday we’ll be eight months from a federal election. Gerry Butts hasn’t been far from Justin Trudeau’s side at any time since Trudeau entered public life. The first time I ever heard Butts’ name, it was from a mutual acquaintance who assumed Butts had written Justin Trudeau’s famous speech for Pierre Trudeau’s funeral 18 years ago. He did or he didn’t, but what matters is that they were inseparable even then. I first took the notion of a Trudeau candidacy for the Liberal leadership seriously when, at a conference in 2012, I heard Butts taking it seriously. Trudeau could probably work without Butts. But even Liberals who have been hoping for such an outcome, over the last year, have assumed Trudeau doesn’t think he can work without Butts. And now he has to find out. In a crisis, in an election year. The timing isn’t great. (Maclean’s)

At any number of turns in this saga, the Trudeau PMO could have made clear and direct statements that would have killed the SNC-Lavalin story dead. Instead, all Trudeau and the PMO have offered up is sloppy misdirection and anonymous hit jobs. And that, writes Andrew MacDougall, is a pretty good indicator that the allegations of political pressure were true: “How can I make that claim? How about we put ourselves in the Trudeau PMO’s shoes to review all the ways the office has been giving credence to the SNC-Lavalin story. Hint: it’s not what they say, it’s what they’re not saying.” (Maclean’s)

The NDP plan to table a motion today calling on the government to launch a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair, while Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer argues the Senate should open its own investigation. (CTV, Globe and Mail)

Credibility gap: That Trudeau isn’t winning anyone over to his side with the changing narratives was confirmed in a poll last week by Public Square Research. Of the 43 per cent surveyed who are following the SNC-Lavalin saga, nearly three-quarters say Wilson-Raybould has the most credibility. Only 27 per cent said that of Trudeau. (Maclean’s)

Maybe Trudeau could clear all this up if he’d only say exactly what went down between him and Wilson-Raybould. Ah, but to do so would break “cabinet confidentiality” Trudeau said last week. However Yan Campagnolo, a University of Ottawa law professor and expert on cabinet secrecy, notes, cabinet confidentiality in no way restricts Trudeau from revealing details around Wilson-Raybould’s exit: “There’s no limit on the discretion of a government to disclose its own cabinet confidences. A government can always agree to lift the veil of secrecy,” he says. “The Prime Minister is basically deciding what to reveal and what not to reveal, as is his prerogative. As the master of the cabinet, the Prime Minister would have discretion to say more if he were so inclined.” (Maclean’s)

Were it not for the SNC-Wilson-Raybould saga, a lot more attention would probably be going to the pro-pipeline convoy of hundreds of vehicles about to descend on Parliament Hill today. A counter protest is also planned by an Indigenous group. (CBC News)

In case you missed it Friday, Allen Abel parsed Donald Trump, builder of great walls and greater delusions, as the president desperately tried to justify building his “emergency” wall along the border with Mexico:

The good news from Trump’s perspective was that his declaration could accrue as much as US$8 billion for the building and barbed-wiring of a fence designed to repel repugnant (i.e., brown-skinned) desperados and their dying infant children from the Pacific strand to the Texas tidewater by re-routing monies already budgeted for drug interdiction and military construction projects elsewhere on this tired, warming globe. The bad news for Trump was that, when the wall is completed, the Democratic Party still will be on his side of it.

What does Canada’s ambassador to the U.S. make of the emergency wall, not to mention the steel tariffs, the tenuous state of the CUSMA deal and how Canada was caught up in the Meng Wanzhou case?

160,Empty,2019-02-22T17:50:21Z,The packed room erupted into applause when I introduced the by-election candidates. It was standing room only.,"The packed room erupted into applause when I introduced the by-election candidates. It was standing room only. Friends of Canadian Broadcasting had brought the four parties together on the topic: 'Can Canada survive Facebook?' But it didn't feel like that was the top thing on people's minds that night in early February.

Looking out from the podium, I saw a sea of Canadians showing up for a by-election and making their voices heard. Moments before, I'd met the four candidates in a private room at the Delta Hotel and Casino where they all sat around a banquet table nursing glasses of water as they waited for the event to begin. They greeted each other graciously. Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson is the candidate for the People's Party of Canada, a far-right populist party led by Maxime Bernier. Jagmeet Singh is the leader of the NDP contending with Conservative Jay Shin and Liberal Richard Lee. Jagmeet Singh was the last to come in and when I said hello, he corrected my pronunciation of his name — it's pronounced ""Jug-meet,"" he told me.

This is Canada, I thought as I observed them, thinking, of course, of the mania and polarization south of the border — stuff some of my Canadian friends tell me just can't happen here. I felt privileged to be shaking hands with the first person of colour to lead a federal party, the savvy, highly educated Conservative candidate, the seasoned Liberal candidate, and the People's Party of Canada candidate who smiled warmly as she said hello. It all felt very civil.

And so, I started the evening as moderator of the Burnaby South all-candidate's debate with an observation. ""It's so great to see democracy in action!"" I meant it: I love grassroots politics. I grew up working in political campaigns that brought all kinds of people from different backgrounds and values together to work for one person, one goal. I respond to the headiness of elections, the hope and potential they bring to make a better world. That better world that never seems to come, but always might this time be in reach.

Anyway, since I moved to Canada in 2001, I often insert somewhere in speeches, a little self-deprecating joke. I haven't ever been able to kick my distinct Southern accent. I figure my Tennessee twang confuses people when I am being introduced as the founder and editor in chief of Canada’s National Observer so I say, 'you may notice from my accent that I'm not a native Canadian. And since moving here in 2001, I've been learning how to be a Canadian. Learning to apologize.' Then, I apologize for something very American that I really don’t like. In the early days of being here, I apologized for George W. Bush. Then came Obama and the joke no longer worked for me. Then came Trump.

I'd just watched the State of the Union address the night before the by-election debate. So, I tried my little joke with the preamble about having learned to apologize, then: ""Trump gave the State of the Union last night… (Pause) I'd just like to say, 'I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.'""

The room erupted. Some booed at the name ""Trump"" (NDP, Liberals, Conservatives?), but many more were booing at the fact that I was joking about Trump (People's Party of Canada?). Loudly. Very loudly. A big wave of boos.

So much that I burst out laughing. Hey, I've never been booed!

And this crowd was going for it.

Standing on the stage it was like a wave coming at me.



Freshly booed. Looking at this photograph as I write this piece, I see nervousness and surprise in my laughter, but also, delight at the energy of the crowd whether they loved me or hated me. Hey, they were ENGAGED. But as the evening went on, I felt like maybe I was watching a surge of alt-right populism that wasn't very funny. Photo by Michael Ruffolo

""Well, this is going to be an interactive evening,"" I said.

After thoughts

I wish I could have taken notes on the policies and positions the candidates discussed. I remember being impressed by the reflective responses of Singh, Lee and Shin. I remember thinking Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson's answers were sometimes shocking, sometimes down to earth. At moments, she sounded a lot like Donald Trump, to her supporters' delight and cheers. She was true to her self-description: ""Tired of political correctness! Freedom is our greatest gift. TV host, author, speaker. Stand with courage or sink with cowardice."" Why am I talking more about her than the other candidates? Because she was colourful and creative. Following prepared notes, she surprised, deconstructed, and seemed determined to undermine the status quo. The other candidates provided a calm foil that absorbed the shocks, while she kept the fire burning in her supporters.

She made all the other candidates look extremely moderate. Jagmeet Singh held his own very well, never losing his cool, as the waves of populism surged and subsided through the night. The other candidates kept their cool admirably.

It was my first live experience with the People's Party's brand of populism, and I'm guessing we will see the same scenario replay in riding after riding across Canada. Last night, the final all-candidates debate took place in Burnaby South, and tensions apparently continued to climb. I wasn’t there, but according to Burnaby Now’s excellent report, audience members yelled insults at candidates and each other, yelling 'Shame on you!' over immigration and security. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh and PPC candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson clashed on immigration, with Thompson bringing up the 2017 murder of a 13-year-old girl by a Syrian refugee, while Singh denounced ""coded language"" used to smear minorities. A Liberal supporter stood up from the crowd and heatedly accused Thompson of racism, sparking a shouting match with other audience members. Some of NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s answers were cut off by aggressive jeers from the crowd, Kelvin Gawley reported. The riding has a diverse population, but the debate showed intense polarization among people from all political stripes.

The polarization and heated rhetoric from Burnaby South offers a striking warning for Canada. Canada's top civil servant commented that he fears ""someone is going to be shot"" during the upcoming federal election campaign. Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick lamented the ""vomitorium of social media"" and worried that the reputations of honourable people who have served their country were ""being besmirched and dragged through the market square."" Across Canada, nonetheless, candidates are preparing to enter this treacherous arena. At stake is which party will set the tone for Canadian values for the next 4 years.

Get ready for it. The election is coming to a riding near you.

162,Empty,2019-02-21T20:43:19Z,"No stranger to Vancouver, Shad spent several years on the West Coast earning a masters degree from SFU. He returns for a show on Thursday, Feb. 21 at Fortune Sound Club as part of his current tour. The post Shad brings new war stories to Vancouver for a night…","With Hip-Hop Evolution, Shad and his documentary crew circle back to the origins of rap. First screened as part of the 2016 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival and then picked up by HBO Canada and Netflix, the award-winning series traces the underground roots of hip-hop and its expansion into mainstream culture.

The first episode explores the birth of hip-hop on Aug. 11, 1973 at 1520 Sedgwick Ave., in the Bronx, New York City, where Clive Campbell (soon-to-be DJ Kool Herc) provided the music and MC’ed a back-to-school birthday party for his little sister Cindy. Girls got in for 25 cents. It cost the guys double. The party started at 9 p.m. Goofing around, Coke La Rock (who wasn’t yet Coke La Rock) picked up a mic and started “rapping” over his friend Clive’s funky, endless breaks.

From there everything fans out in the documentary series and other rap pioneers are brought into the story including Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five, Fab Five Freddy, Marley Marl, Afrika Bambaataa, Kool Moe Dee, Kurtis Blow, Doug E. Fresh, Whodini, Warp 9, DJ Hollywood, Spoonie Gee, The Sugarhill Gang and Russell Simmons.

Some of the interviewees became rich through their involvement with hip-hop while others never left the hood.

The second instalment in the series (which dropped Oct. 18, 2018 on Netflix) expands on the foundation story adding interviews with the likes of Public Enemy, Beastie Boys, N.W.A, Ice-T, Rakim, Big Daddy Kane and LL Cool J.

While Shad’s been working on Hip-Hop Evolution off and on for several years he’s not been neglecting his own music. A Short Story About A War, an ambitious concept album, came out in October of last year on Secret City Records.

No stranger to Vancouver, the Canadian rapper, whose full name is Shadrach Kabango, spent several years on the West Coast earning a masters degree in liberal studies from Simon Fraser University. He returns for a show on Thursday, Feb. 21 at Fortune Sound Club as part of his current tour.

He spoke to the North Shore News from the road (somewhere in Wisconsin) about working on Hip-Hop Evolution and the conceptual framework behind his new album.

North Shore News: In your Peabody Award acceptance speech you thanked HBO Canada and Netflix for supporting your ‘insanely inefficient process’ of putting everything together for the Hip-Hop Evolution series. What does the process involve?

Shad: It’s a challenging series to make because really the pioneers are the ones that tell the story. I’m there sitting with them but it’s them telling their story. It depends on the schedules of our guests but it’s worked out. Especially that first season. We got the most important pioneers: Herc and Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash and others.

What kind of research was done for the series?

We had a research team and probably the hardest part was the writing, by Rodrigo Bascunan, because it’s a difficult story to tell. Once hip-hop expanded beyond the Bronx and New York City it spread pretty quickly so to try and find a coherent way of talking about that expansion and growth and evolution of hip hop without being reductive or getting into myth-making too much is a challenging task. It required a lot of research and then really good writing (to bring it all together).

Herc was ground zero – he and others were inventing hip-hop music. They were pulling in influences from everywhere. It didn’t exist before them.

Exactly. Herc gave hip-hop the esthetic and the fundamental features like looping sections of music. He played a lot of James Brown, Latin percussion and a lot of flavours – that’s the essential element but then people like Grandmaster Flash very quickly perfected some of his techniques and expanded on them. Once you get outside New York you see hip-hop combining with different local flavours and really starting to grow into what we recognize now.

There were local scenes and then at some point mainstream players saw what was happening and got involved. Who were some of those people?

Most famously, Sylvia Robinson and Sugarhill Records. “Rappers Delight” is really the song that introduced most people to hip-hop. I think it sold something like 20 million copies, one of the biggest selling 12-inch records of all time. That’s 1979. After that you probably want to talk about Def Jam – Russell Simmons, Rick Rubin – they signed Run DMC, they signed Public Enemy, they signed the Beastie Boys. LL Cool J. That’s the first great hip-hop label, even to this day it’s hip-hop royalty.

When do you come into the picture? Who were your influences growing up?

In high school I was listening to Common, Lauryn Hill, Outkast – artists like that. That’s mid to late ’90s. Those are my biggest influences. They took music to another level for me at that time, as a 15, 16-year-old I didn’t know there were artists that were that soulful and that personal. They had that kind of depth.

In your new album there’s a strong jazz component.

My introduction to jazz was through those artists. Hearing artists like Nas, or Common, sample jazz. A Tribe Called Quest, as well. My introduction to jazz was through hip-hop.

Your new album wraps the tracks into a conceptual framework. What’s the basis for the storyline?

It started in Vancouver, actually. Something between a story and an image just occurred to me, I guess, as I was thinking through a lot of the tensions that I was seeing while living in Vancouver. This was in 2014, and as you know Vancouver is very unequal, and I think that’s where the story came into my mind. This picture of a desert world and this war, and the different factions fighting and their different rationales for participating in violence. There is one character I call The Fool that didn’t seem to believe in any of it.

I didn’t think at that time to make an album based on that story, it was just something that occurred to me and something that I was seeing everywhere in kind of a lens through which I was seeing the world. A year or two ago when it was time to work on a new album I thought, ‘let me try and make this story come to life,’ because it was just something that stayed with me. It feels real.

When did you record A Short Story About A War?

I made the album while we were doing a lot of filming for Hip-Hop Evolution. It was a two weeks on, two weeks off, kind of thing. I would be in the studio for two weeks and then on the road for two weeks. I think that helped the process. I find when I’m making music it’s nice to zoom in and zoom out, pretty intensely and then be able to pull back and get some perspective. Listen to what I’ve been working on and not get lost in the details.

Does zooming out also feed into the record?

That’s a good question. I think that it does. The story occurred to me while I was living in Vancouver but then I started to see it everywhere and that keeps feeding into the story. I was getting new understanding and layers of stuff as I was able to think about it more. I think it did feed into the process.

You’re bilingual. Does French factor into the creation of your own music?

Pretty much all my influences in hip-hop are English and that’s the language I work in the most. I rap mainly in English because that’s the language that I can really play with and bend the most.

You create content as a musician but also go behind the scenes and document the music with your series. That double duty seems like a rare combination of roles.

Most artists are at least amateur historians because we are fans and that leads you to be a deep listener. A lot of artists I know are kind of amateur music historians. My friends that are DJs are really deep with their knowledge of music. It feels natural to me. I am into making music as a fan. I’m not trained as a musician. I’ve learned everything I know by listening to the music.

This week on the program, we’re going to continue our exploration of the U.S.-China relationship, which we began last week with our investigation into the history of tensions between the U.S. and Chinese navies in and around the South China Sea.

This week we turn our attention to the future. Specifically the how the Chinese Communist Party views its future. Because the more we spoke with analysts and observers about the South China Sea, the more we heard we ought to look not only at that troubled body of water you can spot on a map — but also to the fundamental differences in how China’s leadership views the world, how it views competition with the United States and its allies, and perhaps most importantly, how Chinese leaders view power, control and history.

This episode is broken up into three chapters (find a transcript below):

Staying in power (at the 1:24 mark); Revising history (19:57); Some thoughts about how to move forward (37:53).

Like last week, our guests include Samantha Hoffman of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute; Elsa Kania of the Center for a New American Security; Greg Poling of the Center for Strategic and International Studies; Andrew Wilson of the U.S. Naval War College (not speaking on behalf of the Navy or the Defense Department); and Pamela Crossley of Dartmouth University.

A transcription of this week’s episode follows:

We’re going to continue our exploration of the U.S.-China relationship — which we began last week with our investigation into the history of tensions between the U.S. and Chinese navies in and around the South China Sea.

This week, we turn our attention to the future. Specifically the how the Chinese Communist Party views its future. Because the more I spoke with analysts and observers about the South China Sea, the more I heard we ought to look not only at that troubled body of water you can spot on a map — but also to the fundamental differences in how China’s leadership views the world, how it views competition with the United States and its allies, and perhaps most importantly, how Chinese leaders view power, control and history.

It’s a story of what would seem to be fundamentally different perspectives, approaches and values. Of underappreciated journeys from our vantage point here in the West, and problematic historic legacies for Beijing.

It’s also a story of aging populations, disruptive technologies, and multiple elements of national power that are easy to take for granted from afar — and perhaps even more easily misunderstood.

This episode’s title: The Chinese Communist Party’s vision and the future of Chinese history. Let’s begin.

Chapter one: Staying in power.

On this very week in 1950, the leaders of the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China announced to the world that the two Communist countries had each others’ back. The leaders of the Soviet Union and China — Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong, respectively — had just signed a mutual defense and assistance treaty. The announcement triggered immediate concern in Washington about the spread of Communism worldwide, especially in Korea and Vietnam.

But the Sino-Soviet chuminess would not last forever. By 1965, a year after China tested its first nuclear weapon, Mao turned on Moscow and accused it of allying with Washington against China and his so-called Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

That movement by Mao to, in his view, purify and strengthen Communist ideology in China — by enslaving, torturing and sometimes killing dissidents and people who weren’t really into the Communist personality cult of Mao — that hyper-controlling movement is believed by historians today to have caused the deaths of at least a million and a half people across China.

But China in 2019 is of course dramatically different in many, many ways. It has incredible economic power, perhaps most importantly today. Millions of the country’s 1.4 billion people have risen out of poverty since the death of Mao in 1976 and the decades after China’s gradual integration into what’s become a global economy.

One thing unchanged in all this: the Communist Party remains in power, it remains the country’s decision-makers across all of China today.

The thing that’s changing about that, according to scholars and experts we spoke with: some of those 20th century control tactics appear to be returning. You may have heard of the so-called social credit system that just launched across China?

Here’s Dr. Samantha Hoffman, an analyst in Chinese security and politics with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

Hoffman: “There’s a concept that a lot of what the Party’s doing right now is based on is called social management. But it’s ultimately about the Party’s political control. So it’s a process that is both co-opting people and coercing people to participate, in the Party’s language, in their own management so that they uphold the Party’s political power. It’s a process that’s aimed at Party state security. And Party state security — I say that instead of national security. Because you aren’t talking about domestic security versus foreign security. You’re talking about both. Both the Party’s internal security managing itself, and the Party managing its power. And so really it’s a complex idea. But it really dates back to the Mao era.”

Watson: “60s, 70s?”

Hoffman: “Even further back. It’s an idea in the Mao era — Mao called this the ‘mass line.’ And it’s the idea of essentially taking the, in his jargon, taking the scattered and unsystematic idea of the masses, and then the Party reforming them and then feeding it back to the masses. It’s Leninist. It boils down to this idea of people and Party itself participating in their own management. And getting people to do what the Party wants in order for the Party to stay in power. The way this worked really in the Mao era was you’re talking about ideological mobilization. That that no longer worked after the Cultural Revolution, the beginning of the reform era. So then it becomes how do we make this process work, but no longer relying only on ideological mobilization? So then that’s where technology comes in. And so technology — anywhere from aspects of the surveillance state to something like a social credit system — are all doing these same things, they’re augmenting those processes. And so what you get today is not fundamentally new, but it’s terrifying because it’s adding a layer that makes the process of data collection more efficient, the potential for integration of data to be more effective, and the potential for that to impact every aspect of your life, whether or not you’re in China also if you’re a Chinese citizen living overseas — you know it makes all of those processes more effective than they’ve ever been in the past, even though those processes existed before.”

Wilson: “China is, while it has embraced capitalism and some elements of the free market, it is not a free society. It is a deeply illiberal and authoritarian system. So whereas our military can think about the away games, almost everything that the PLA thinks about is domestic. Another thing that I think is notable about the history of the PLA that everyone should know is that it’s a party military; it is not a national military like the United States Army, Navy and Air Force. They take an oath to the Chinese Communist Party, not to the constitution. And while our military officers are completely comfortable thinking about our military being an instrument of policy, they tend not to think of it as an overtly political thing. And the Chinese military, or the PLA, is almost exclusively a political thing. So that’s something that distinguishes it. And that’s just sort of foundational to its history and to its nature now. And if anything, the reforms that Xi Jinping has been pushing through has been an effort both to streamline the command and control apparatus to bring much-needed reforms to try to deal with some of the mind-boggling corruption within the institution, primarily it’s about making sure that the military does the Party’s bidding, and does the bidding of the general secretary first and foremost. Unfortunately that also means it’s geared towards doing the bidding of this particular general secretary but that’s another story. So yeah, to understand it’s a Party military first and foremost is I think it’s absolutely crucial.”

You may remember in our last episode we spoke to Elsa Kania, with the Technology and National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. She, too, is worried about what could come from the intersection of technology and state control from Chinese Communist Party leaders today.

Kania: “As Chinese tech companies are intimately involved in the development of these technologies and often making a lot of money off of close collaborations with the Chinese government on public security and policing including in places like Xinjiang. It’s a tragic situation and one in which the repression often happens through very low tech and old-fashioned means even of literally incarcerating seemingly hundreds of thousands, if not by some estimates over a million people in camps; but there’s also a high tech dimension including pervasive facial recognition, even the use of biometrics So I think the ways in which Xinjiang can be used as a laboratory of sorts it’s I think a dark view of what the future of AI could be in the hands of governments with very authoritarian tendencies. And what’s concerning in particular is that I don’t think this will stop in Xinjiang.”

Indeed, it already appears to have extended well beyond Xinjiang, as Hoffman notes.

Hoffman: “The issue with something like social credit, for instance, is that overseas Chinese are going to be given a unified social credit code, which means that although overseas Chinese have always never been outside of the reach of the party, by having a code and then having that information potentially attached to a record about them become more automated, it makes it easier to make people think that everything that they’re doing even when they’re outside of China is affecting their lives in China. And that already happens; you can read a lot of articles about that happening to Uighurs right now. Uighurs who think that they’ve escaped still have to be careful, particularly if they have family in China. So the processes aren’t new. The technology makes them more efficient. Another issue is companies. So we saw this social credit used for political means last year with airlines. United Airlines and I think it was 32 other airlines were given letters that said. I think the letters came out, I’m gonna get my dates wrong, but something around February was the first notification last year. And I think April was the warning that said if you don’t change your websites to say that Taiwan is essentially a part of China—”

Watson:“I remember this now.”

Hoffman: “And then I think the White House released a statement at the time, ‘Orwellian nonsense.’ That might be what you remember. And if you don’t change the way that you’re referring to it on your websites, then you would be considered seriously dishonest for not following this order that we’ve issued. And because of that, that record of your serious dishonesty would be recorded on your civil aviation credit record. And that civil aviation credit record would be attached to your business license and your right to operate in China. And then that credit record would be linked to Credit China and several other credit websites if they didn’t follow through with making these changes. And in the end, all of the airlines did have to make the changes. And the U.S. airlines they tried and a couple of other airlines tried to see if they could make a China-specific website, but that wasn’t the goal. The Party’s goal — the Party said, ‘No, that’s not okay. That doesn’t solve the problem. You have to change your websites.’ And what does that do for Taiwan? Well, that creates more ambiguity about Taiwan’s status over time. For the companies, it’s not that having a political demand about Taiwan is necessarily new; but the way that it’s attached to the right to operate and attached to things they’re doing far outside of China — because these are international websites for global clients — that’s something different that the technology’s doing. And then that’s changing over time the way people perceive Taiwan and Taiwan’s status, which actually the CCP’s been fairly effective with over the years.”

And all that is just one element of a term that’s been showing up in lot more discussions about China today. That word is “techno-authoritarianism,” a reference to surveillance technology that may be in a lot more places than you thought. Beyond the detention of Uighurs in Xinjiang, for example.

Here’s Hoffman again.

Hoffman: “It’s a pretty good term. I think I prefer to refer to what the Chinese Communist Party is doing as technology-enhanced or technology-augmented authoritarianism — because you’re talking about the processes the Chinese Communist Party has been engaged in for decades being augmented through technology.”

Kania: “So for instance the Sharp Eyes Program to expand facial recognition and surveillance, a number of different initiatives at the local level, including in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, where the presence of these sorts of surveillance capabilities is starting to become ever more pervasive.

Watson: “Are some of these already making their way outside of China’s borders and to other states, other customers?”

Kania: “Absolutely, and I think this is where the China model, so to speak, may have concerning implications worldwide insofar as Chinese tech companies are actively exporting these same technologies. Police in Malaysia, for instance, have started using glasses for facial recognition. There’s been a strategic partnership between a company called CloudWalk and the government in Zimbabwe focused on facial recognition, which coincidentally also provides the company with access to data, which is helpful for AI development. Because diversity of data does matter for an application like facial recognition.”

Hoffman: “And so one of the things that I cite in a report that I did for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute back in June of last year, June 2018, is how smart cities technology being used actually in Central Asia for Belt and Road initiative projects is used to collect data. And then that data is, in theory, supposed to be sent back to China for analysis to improve the Party’s situational awareness. But they talk about these issues — if you go through and read the documents — what officials are saying, they’re talking about this being used to improve China’s discourse power in a very political sense. So it’s again it’s about the Party’s political security. It’s also about economic development — normal things that you would collect data for that you would try to improve your awareness. But then that same exact data that’s used to inform—”

Watson: “Dual use.”

Hoffman: “Yeah. Dual use to inform, say, a rail project or a port project or something like that would also be used to inform political decision-making because they talk about, for instance, using data from Confucius Institutes. Or data collected using automatic translation technologies to improve their understanding of Turkic languages and then understanding the political risk in the region in order to be able to shape how people think about what the CCP is doing. And in a sense, that could not always be bad; but like all things with the Party, everything’s about political security.”

Another consideration if current trends continue?

Wilson: “A new Asian regional order would be fundamentally illiberal, would be counter to our values, but also to the values of many of the countries in the region that have you know fully embraced the liberal international order. So I think a region that China saw that as exclusively its own would not be good for the world and would not be good for that region. So that’s a significant downside.”

You might ask why Chinese leaders are so keen on surveillance technology, quantum research and artificial intelligence? Some credit current leader Xi Jinping and his so-called “Made in China 2025” economic push. Here’s Kania again.

Kania: “Actually inspired by Germany’s ‘Industry 4.0,’ so the idea is not all that unique. But essentially the objective it articulates is for China to become a manufacturing superpower and to move up the value chain in terms of manufacturing, including through a focus on intelligent manufacturing — robotics, electric vehicles. There’s also been launch, under the National Science and Technology Innovation Plan, of 15 different megaprojects, or major projects, prioritized for advancements by 2030. This also includes things like China’s Deep Space Station, quantum computing and communications, And achieve an advantage at a time when the U.S. has not yet established dominance in these fields. So things like robotics, supercomputing, artificial intelligence and autonomy, biotechnology as well. These are all fields where China is heavily investing often to the magnitude of billions or tens of billions, And this could be characterized as a, almost a brute-force approach, often pouring massive amounts of resources into fields that are seen as strategically important. This may not always be very efficient; but in some cases, it could prove effective nonetheless.”

Watson: “Kind of like our Manhattan Project, maybe?”

Kania: “Yeah, so I think the Manhattan Project is not a bad analogy. But in many respects China does seem to have a number of these — quantum computing among them given the National Laboratory that’s under construction. And a lot of this could be caricatured as a purely state-driven model and one that’s doomed to fail, as did the Soviet Union’s approach to planning and industrial policy. I think there are aspects of China’s approach to initiatives like China’s ‘Made in China 2025’ that are problematic and unlikely to succeed in their entirety; but there also may be some successes given concurrent mobilization of talent and the active participation of tech companies that have often emerged as global leaders in these fields in their own right.”

And China’s enthusiasm for facial recognition, AI and emerging technology that could complement those two? That really seemed to have gotten a boost in just the past three years, according to Kania.

Kania: “The PLA’s apparent level of enthusiasm about AI can be traced in part back to Alpha Go in the Spring of 2016, which was not just notable because it involved an AI solving the game of Go — by some accounts 10 to 15 years before anyone thought that was possible — it was also seemingly an indication that in a game that is, in a sense, a wargame, or at least involves complex tactics and strategizing, that they are not too dissimilar from war. And AI could develop tactics that humans never envisioned in [the] human history of playing the game. So one of the lessons the PLA seem to have drawn from that is that applying AI to command decision-making. But increasingly today, the PLA seems to be more actively exploring these options — improving their own training and testing of concepts, for instance using AI to better simulate a blue force — their equivalent of red team, blue being us. So there have actually been a couple wargaming tournaments organized by the Chinese military, including their National Defense University, that have used an AI system for wargaming. And I think we’ll expect to see more developments on that front and also, of course, given that the PLA is a military that lacks combat experience in its recent history, they’re trying to learn without fighting, in a sense.”

And the potential for a fight is the concern that runs beneath all that we’ve been talking about with these episodes on the South China Sea and a rising China.

Which leads us to chapter two.

Revising History

How does China view its rise and some of the things that could maybe get in the way of that rise? Here’s Greg Poling from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Poling: “For the better part of the last century, Chinese education — patriotic education — certainly post-Tiananmen has focused on the idea that China was taken advantage of by the Western powers and that the great project of the Chinese nation now is to right those wrongs. Part of that is the perception that imperial powers picked apart the Chinese nation, carving off chunks of territory, establishing special concessions with extra-legal rights and et cetera — Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau. You know the return of Hong Kong and Macau was a big victory for the CCP. The South China Sea has been shoehorned into that narrative. Now it doesn’t matter when we’re talking about Chinese motivators, it really doesn’t matter that China never administered the South China Sea. That if you look at Qing dynasty maps and documents, its clear that the Qing dynasty considered Hainan [island] to be the southern end of China. That doesn’t matter. What matters is that it’s now become part of the narrative. And the historical narrative matters much more than the actual history.”

That’s something I heard more and more of as I spoke to experts and U.S. military personnel about their perception of the U.S.-China relationship.

One prime example from the historical record: the legendary tale of 15th-century Chinese Adm. Zheng He. It’s an almost unbelievable story of Chinese naval power and really of unprecedented Chinese influence across the world. It also happened to take place as China transitioned from one epic empire — the Ming — to another, the Qing, right around the time these legendary voyages returned back to the so-called Middle Kingdom.

Wilson: “Adm. Zheng He. It’s a fascinating story if only for the audacity of what the Ming dynasty at the time — sort of the early 1400s — was trying to pull off. But the analogy has become very popular in China…”

Poling: “So Zheng He was a prominent admiral of the Ming court.* The colorful part of the story was that he was a Muslim, a eunuch, a favorite of some in the court, and not so much of others and eventually kind of fell to court intrigue, as all good Ming dynasty stories end. But he organized a series of what have come to be known as treasure voyages, or tribute voyages where he would put together these massive fleets — massive by the standard of the time anyway — sail through southeast Asia, south Asia, all the way to east Africa, you know, flying the flag so to speak. Showing off Ming dynasty goods, and collecting tribute in turn to you know the Middle Kingdom. So he completes the voyages and was largely the high-water mark for kind of China going out in the world.”

Wilson: “And the idea’s that in China in the early 1400s had the greatest navy on earth. It had the medieval equivalent of aircraft carriers. And yet it didn’t use those aircraft carriers, it didn’t use these great treasure ships to engage in gunboat diplomacy. Adm. Zheng sailed into the Western oceans, through the South China Sea, into the Indian Ocean as far away as the east coast of Africa, merely to spread wealth, to spread treasure — gifts from the Ming emperor. It was peaceful, it was about building a community of nations that would share and trade with each other and exchange gifts. And it was all — this is the parable for China’s peaceful rise. That China does not seek to act like imperial powers of old. Because, ‘See, we could have. We had the greatest navy on the earth. We were the richest country on the planet. We had the biggest military on the planet. And yet we didn’t dictate to others. Therefore a rising China, a China with a new navy in the 21st century will act like you know the Ming dynasty did of old.’ So that’s the parable.”

Crossley: “One of the tasks he was commissioned with was to collect back taxes from Chinese who had settled through the island parts of southeast Asia. The Zheng He voyages were not voyages of exploration. They were for purposes of commerce in general, going around promoting trade with Ming China. But they were also accompanied by this contingent of marines. And when necessary, they would get forceful. And so the idea that this was a voyage of friendship and that Zheng He was just going around delivering messages of love and good will from the Ming emperor, there was a little bit of that in these statements he would present. But in general, the point here was commerce and when possible recouping revenue from Chinese who had strayed outside the borders of the country.”

Poling: “After that, the Ming dynasty becomes embroiled in invasion from the north. The Qing dynasty is largely isolationist, inward-facing. I mean Chinese merchants were forbidden from trading with the outside world. The only people still operating in the South China Sea or the East China Sea from China were fisherman. That didn’t really change until the 20th century. I mean that really didn’t change until the late 20th century, to be clear. In early nationalist China as well as under Communist China, the navy was you know a riverine force and could operate within sight of the coast and that was about it. I mean the RoC, the Republic of China, in 1946 the vessels that it used to land in the Paracels and at what is now Itu Aba in the Spratlys were U.S. Navy ships on loan to them. There was no Chinese navy. So Zheng He has now been — as with other things in Chinese history — kind of molded and shoehorned into this modern Communist narrative of retaking lost territories. And so part of that is saying that basically because Zheng He sailed through the South China Sea, the South China Sea was Chinese. Now how that makes sense, I don’t know. Zheng He sailed through the Indian Ocean and they don’t consider the Indian Ocean to be Chinese.”

Wilson: “That’s the story that gets told by my Chinese friends when Adm. Zheng He comes up. And I hold my tongue for a while. And then I counter with, ‘Well no, that’s not quite what was going on.’ There was a fair bit of gunboat diplomacy employed by Adm. Zheng He. True, they weren’t going off looking to colonize the wider world. But it was still an effort to insert the Chinese military into the maritime world in a very, very aggressive way. It was a classic example of imperial overreach. And I don’t think it’s a model worth emulating.”

Watson: “Well tell me, there were no voyages after that, right? Granted there were seven in about three decades.”

Wilson: “There were seven by that — under the command of that one admiral. There was actually a bunch of other — there wasn’t just the one treasure fleet. And even the treasure fleet was composed of several sort of sub-fleets. But yeah, that wasn’t the only thing that the Chinese navy was doing on the ocean seas at that time. But it is true that after those voyages, that set of voyages ended in the 1430s, that the Chinese state did not retain that kind of overwhelming focus on the oceans. Although it did maintain a significant ability to project power in its immediate maritime environment. But the problem is that for the folks looking at Chinese maritime history, everything is eclipsed by Zheng He.”

Poling: “Let’s say that I want to be as sympathetic as I can to the Chinese narrative — maybe Zheng He, even though it’s not written down anywhere, maybe he actually did stop in the Paracels or Scarborough or Spratlys, who knows, took on supplies and fresh water even though there’s very little of either of those in those locations. It wouldn’t matter. The fact that you saw something doesn’t make it yours. The fact that you put it on a map doesn’t make it yours. I mean by that logic, all of Eurasia would belong to Mongolia right now. Canada would be part of Norway. The fact that you spotted something and put it on a map is irrelevant in international law.”

So what of this whole effort to appropriate Zheng He for the Chinese Communist Party’s ends? Pamela Crossley, historian of Chinese history at Dartmouth University, says this is just one extension of Xi Jinping’s efforts to rewrite the past — an effort she refers to as Xi’s history factory.

Crossley: “I’m seeing it as one ‘history factory’ controlled by the Party through this one thing that’s called the Party History Office. And it connects directly to institutions like Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences is enormous and it covers a whole lot of disciplines. And many times, parts of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences don’t know what the other parts are doing. But there are units within it that work with history departments all over China. There’s a small of Chinese historians who are involved in these campaigns against Western historians. But I think the visibility of these campaigns puts pressure on historians generally across China.”

And this new history push has pretty direct links to what the CCP has accomplished in the South China Sea, Crossley says.

Crossley: “It’s connected [to the South China Sea] in this way: the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has sponsored this idea that you can argue the legitimacy of territorial claims on the basis of history. And this is really very unusual. I think this is — I wouldn’t say it’s unique to China, but it’s definitely unusual. And the idea that you promote is that if at any point in the past some state, this is probably gonna be an empire based in China, could make territorial claims to some part of the land or sea, those are legitimately under the governance or maybe just under the hegemony of the People’s Republic of China. And so the Party has frequently invoked these historical arguments about Ming claims to the South China Sea as the foundation of its claims to have a legitimate right to dominate the South China Sea today. If you were to go back to the Ming, which is what the PRC historians are often referring to, Ming was actually very clear about the fact that they didn’t claim anything off of the mainland of China. They made a very clear distinction. They would even tolerate foreign adventurers or mercantilists like the Portuguese, coming in, staying on little islands offshore. It was just made very clear by Ming: Don’t come onto the mainland. They observed this very clearly. It’s not because Ming society as a whole was not engaged with the sea. But China did not have a navy. China did not make territorial claims across the sea. And even when Chinese left China and they went to Taiwan or they went to southeast Asia, Indonesia, the Philippines, it was rare for the Ming to make any claim on them. Those Zheng He voyages are actually one of the exceptions because Zheng He was commissioned to try to collect back taxes. That is really the exception that proves the rule: Ming was not interested in making territorial claims across the sea. Well I think there is fear — is it fear? It may be fear — of this history of conquest that’s associated with the Qing empire. Xi is a bit different from earlier leaders of China in the way that he uses history because he wants to focus so intensely on the history of the Qing empire. This is complicated because Qing vastly enlarged its territories in comparison to those of the Ming before it, and the enlargement was due to conquest. This is the part that Xi doesn’t want to be incorporated into the story. He wants Qing to just get big just by unexplained means — it suddenly becomes big.”

So why does this screw things up for Xi and CCP leaders?

Crossley: “The thought is that separatism, whether as a political movement or just as a kind of cultural condition on the part of the non-Chinese residents of Mongolia or Xinjiang or Tibet, that this is gonna be incited, right, if they have to focus on the history of Qing as a history of conquest. Now really simply speaking in real history, the way Qing gained dominance over Tibet, for instance, is really different from the way that Qing gained dominance over Xinjiang. Probably you could say both are a form of conquest; but they’re not the same form. What Xi is afraid of is narrating these as conquests in any form.”

Crossley: “Xi is conducting these culture wars in many different theaters. So in this case, I think this particular argument about Qing history is really directed towards the disciplining — let’s put it that way — of historians in China. But it’s part of a much larger campaign that includes this whole idea of Chinese what people call soft power, cultural suasion. And a lot of those are directly applied the United States and Europe and it’s just part of this much larger sort of campaign on Xi’s part.”

Poling: “Yeah look, all nations engage in historical revisionism to some degree, right? Countries tell their own stories about themselves.* They develop their own historical narratives; it helps bind the body politik together. The problem is when it steps over into this kind of blatant historical amnesia that you see in modern day China, that then bleeds into modern day events, right, where it’s impossible to negotiate territorial and maritime disputes because you’re operating on a different plane of reality than everybody else because you’ve been taught since the first grade this fairy tale about the way you know, one, you ever administered these islands that otherwise you’d never heard of, and two, that somehow they were stolen from you. And that spills out into all areas of history in China. And it is made worse by the echo chamber that is the public education system in China, the Communist Party’s control of the media, there is no real independent historical research that goes on, and so you know if you want to get a clear-eyed view of Chinese history you have to go outside of mainland China, which is simply bizarre.”

Wilson: “On the flip side, I think a China that is comfortable in its skin — and just China in general given the size of its economy, it’s historical, its geography, its historical place in the region — should be a major player, if not the major player in its home region. So I don’t have a problem with China sort of fulfilling its national destiny in that sense, but if its feels its national destiny has to be [or] run counter to our ideas of how a free international system works would be bad.”

Poling: “Obviously the Trump administration is an aberration in U.S. foreign policy — the transactional nature of the diplomacy, the de-emphasis of rules and norms and values. And I think those are equally important; so we talk about democracy promotion and human rights, and of course the administration has downplayed that. But you know one of the underpinnings of U.S. national security has also been, over the last almost century, the creation of a rules-based system so that we don’t have great power competition as the order of the day. This administration seems perfectly happy to go back to a might-makes-right, you know, pre-World War II way of doing foreign policy. That is a gross aberration from the way that every administration — democratic and republican since at least FDR — has viewed U.S. national security. The lodestar of U.S. national security regardless of all the other differences has always been that we are safer if we operate in a system of rules and alliances that help smooth out the kind of rough and tumble world of great power politics. And that’s why despite all of the conflagations of the last century, there has been no third World War. There has been no great power conflict. And that people both in the U.S. and around the world are statistically far less likely to die in conflict today than at any time in human history. All of that is to say that while I think this administration is a gross aberration, I do not necessarily think that they mark a change in fundamental U.S. interests, or that the next administration whether democratic or republican won’t drag us back to a more rational way of doing foreign policy. I just don’t think that American politics will sustain a transactional foreign policy very long. Our national narrative, in so much as we tell ourselves one, is about being the shining city on the hill. And both the idea of international rules and the idea of human rights and democracy promotion are fundamental to that.”

Chapter Three: Some thoughts about how to move forward.

Amid all this talk of what separates U.S. and Chinese foreign policy, it can be easy to lose sight of each other’s humanity, and the things that make us all quite similar. Here’s Crossley with some common feedback from her years as a Chinese historian.

Crossley: “Yes, Americans tend to think that Chinese are not like Americans. There’s always this extreme — glamorize them on the one side, or demonize them on the other. It’s always ‘them, them, them.’ And people who are advising on policy have to come in claiming that they’ve got all kinds of keys to understanding China. Really, when you look at history, you look at even recent policy — given exactly the same conditions that the Chinese are working under anybody would make the kind of decisions the Chinese make and vice versa. So I think this idea of kind of alterizing, right? The Chinese are thinking, ‘Oh, they’re so wonderful,’ or ‘They’re so terrible.’ No. They’re just normal. And they pursue whatever opportunities arise and if you don’t like them pursuing those opportunities, they have to find a way to close them off. It’s like anybody else in the world.”

Dr. Samantha Hoffman’s advice?

Hoffman: “Set an example is one good way of starting, but you know we are doing also a lot of things right. And maybe we need to be more confident in what we’re doing right.”

Watson: “What are some of those things, do you think?”Hoffman: “I mean honestly I think the [U.S.] National Defense Strategy and I think that they identify the problem better than they have in the past. And I mean I guess this has been a problem in China policy for a number of decades now and it’s good that we’re recognizing it… when you talk about a so-called ‘China threat,’ you aren’t talking about the U.S. being afraid of China’s rise, you aren’t talking about Chinese people; you’re talking very specifically about the Party and what it does — and its abuse of Chinese culture and the Chinese people, as well. You know the CCP tries to define what Chinese culture is; they have an entire aspect of their state security strategy is focused on cultural security… You know the CCP trying to claim that the PRC is China, and those are things that we need to — it’s hard because it’s very theoretical, but they’re important things to think about.”

Watson: “It’s an abstraction, but it’s deeply impactful.”

Hoffman: “And language is important. You know for years in places like the UN, the CCP is able to sort of slowly insert definitions about concepts of sovereignty and it’s, you know, it’s incredibly complex and I don’t think anybody has a good answer for how to deal with the problem. One of them is to recognize that maybe what we’ve done so far hasn’t been enough.”

And what about challenges down the road — things like concern over what some have taken to calling China’s “population bomb”?

Watson:“Are you thinking that crisis is pretty serious then?”

Wilson: “Oh yeah, it’s very serious.* The Chinese will accept this too, that with a lot of these issues that they’re victims of their own success. That they are a victim of the success of the one-child policy. Not even ending the one-child policy is going to fix the fact that the Chinese population is not replacing itself at a sustainable rate, that China is going to start getting old and getting old very quickly. Whereas China currently is 20 percent of the global population? I think it might actually be 22 percent. So it’s hard for my students to hear every time you wanna say China, every tenth time, substitute one-fifth of humanity. Just plug that in wherever, I think that’ll give you some idea. You know they’re currently about 20 percent of humanity; by the end of the century they’re probably going to be about 10 percent of humanity. In some ways that’s good because not having a population settle down from 1.4 billion now to say 1 billion is gonna soften the blow environmentally on China on an already-ravaged environment there. Are there more resources to go around? Yes. But in terms of y’know in terms of the foreseeable future, it’s going to be an aging society where more and more is gonna fall on a smaller group of working age adults to care for an older population — a population that’s going to be living longer. Populations that live longer tend to be expensive. And yeah, that’s gonna divert resources. And the Chinese understand that they have to kind of capitalize on this unique moment where they have this y’know huge economy, a productive working class, a pretty good age ratio — for now — to set themselves up for success to meet the challenges of the future. So they have the type of resources they need to sustain — to have their military keep growing at the pace it’s been growing in the last couple of decades… uh I think that’s unlikely, yeah.”

Poling: “There is a broader desire in Beijing that as China rises, the international order, the international community, international law of post-World War II will have to be changed at least in Asia to be able to accomodate Beijing. And that spans you know multiple areas of contestation with the U.S., whether its economics or the rules that govern cyber, or the rules that govern our security presence in Asia — or the rules that govern the maritime commons. The U.S. is going to need to decide which of those rules it is willing to help change to accommodate reasonable, understandable Chinese demands for a system that, in some cases, it didn’t help, right? And where it’s going to have to draw a line and say, ‘No, here and no farther.’ The South China Sea is, I think, in that latter bucket. One: Because it undercuts fundamental U.S. interests that have been there since basically the founding days of the republic on maritime commons, freedom of navigation. Our first expeditionary military operation was [U.S. President Thomas] Jefferson against the Barbary pirates” during the first few years of the 19th century. “It is maritime trade and demands for openness in maritime Asia that sent us across the Pacific in the first place. Two: It cuts fundamentally at our presence in Asia if we are not gonna be there for an ally, then sooner or later all the allies are gonna decide that we’re not worth bolstering. And three: The Chinese did write the rules. They can complain about the Bretton Woods arrangements, they can complain about the Treaty of San Francisco; they can’t complain about UNCLOS. They were at the table. The only thing that’s changed is that now they have a bigger navy and have decided the rules don’t work for them anymore.”

(click to see clearly) The F/A-18 Hornet is the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet‘s predecessor, with the first models introduced in the late 1970s as a spinoff of the USAF’s YF-17 lightweight fighter competitor. Hornets are currently flown by the US Marine Corps as their front-line fighter, by the US Navy as a second-tier fighter behind its larger F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets, and by 7 international customers: Australia, Canada, Finland, Kuwait, Malaysia, Spain, and Switzerland. The USA’s aircraft were expected to have a service life of 20 years, but that was based on 100 carrier landings per year. The US Navy and Marines have been rather busy during the Hornets’ service life, and so the planes are wearing out faster. This is forcing the USA to take a number of steps in order to keep their Hornets airworthy: replacing center barrel sections, re-opening production lines, and more. Some of these efforts will also be offered to allied air forces, who have their own refurbishment and upgrade programs.

F/A-18 History

Some of the parts procured under Boeing’s contracts will be produced for allied military services who fly the F/A-18. The Hornet was a McDonnell-Douglas aircraft, so contracts will generally be to that Boeing subsidiary in St Louis, MO, unless otherwise noted.

Note that “center barrel sections” refer to the middle chunk of the plane where the wings joint the body. As one might guess, replacing them is a somewhat involved process, and is also very helpful in extending the airframe’s fatigue-hour limits.

There are some gaps in this article’s coverage. National MRO (Maintenance, Repair, & Optimization) initiatives don’t get comprehensive coverage beyond the multi-fleet central contracts announced in the USA, though some coverage and links are present. There’s also a thin line at times between upgrades required to remain survivable and hence useful in national fleets, and airframe life-extension efforts. In theory, they’re different, but in practice they’re often linked. As such, leaving all upgrades out would do readers a disservice, so they occasionally appear when there’s a connection. Again, however, lists of upgrades are not comprehensive.

Note that Hornet fighters use different radars. Raytheon’s APG-65 is installed aboard USN and USMC F/A-18C/D Hornets (both radar types), and the USMC’s AV-8B Harrier II Plus V/STOL fighters. Abroad, it serves in AV-8Bs operated by Spain and Italy, in Spain’s “EF-18A/Bs” and Kuwait’s F/A-18C/Ds, and in German and Greek F-4 Phantom strike fighters.

Raytheon’s APG-73 serves some of the USA’s F/A-18C/D Hornet fleet, and the USN’s F/A-18E/F Block I Super Hornet (APG-73) fighters. It’s also found in Hornets flown by Australia (F/A-18AM/BM), Canada (CF-18AM/BM), Finland (F/A-18C/D), Malaysia (F/A-18D), and Switzerland (F/A-18C/D).

Tests are reportedly going well for active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars to be retrofit to the A, B, C and D F/A-18 models.

2014 – 2019

February 20/19: From Australia to Canada Two Australian F/A-18A Hornets arrived in Canada on Saturday. The two Hornets are the first of up to 25 aircraft that will be sold to Canada along with spares and support equipment. The Canadian government acquired the 30-year old jets in order of filling a capability gap affecting the Royal Canadian Airforce’s ability to simultaneously meet NORAD and NATO obligations. Originally, Canada had intended to supplement its fleet of 85 Boeing CF(F/A)-18 A/B fighters with 18 new Boeing F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets. This plan was cancelled in favor of the Australian Hornets when Boeing accused Canada’s Bombardier of receiving unfair subsidies from Ottawa. Before the aircraft can be integrated into the Canadian fleet of CF-188 Hornets, they will undergo several modifications in Mirabel, Quebec. They have to be brought to the same operational configuration as the Canadian CF-188 Hornets. This means cockpit and communications upgrades, a night vision imaging system, a sniper targeting pod, landing gear modifications, a new ejection seat as well as the Air Force paint scheme.

June 21/16: Pressure is mounting on the Pentagon to approve the sale of F/A-18 Super Hornets to Kuwait though US Navy Secretary Ray Mabus has warned that his service will have to pay more to buy the F/A-18 due to cost increases. According to Mabus, Boeing needs more orders so that it can keep producing the fighter at an economical rate as the 16 slated for Fiscal year 2017 are not enough to ensure optimum production. Kuwait has been waiting over a year for approval for 28 fighters in a deal estimated to cost $3 billion.

June 7/16: Canada looks set to procure an interim fleet of Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets to fill a capability gap as it procrastinates on how to proceed with its new fighter competition. The Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau promised during the election campaign not to buy the F-35 to replace its aging CF-18s; but the government has been struggling with how to fulfill that promise, for fear any attempt to exclude the stealth fighter from a competition will result in a multi-billion-dollar lawsuit, according to one senior Defence Department official.

May 12/16: Software updates for the FA-18 and EA-18G have been validated by the US Navy after a series of flight tests between April 18-29. The first set of software: 27C, is designed for use in F/A-18A-D Hornets; H12 is for F/A-18F Super Hornets and EA-18G Growlers. Testing took place at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division-managed Point Mugu Sea Range which contains 36,000 square miles of controlled sea and airspace, allowing for testing in a real-world environment.

May 4/16: Boeing has announced that they expect orders of F-15 and F/A-18 fighters to keep production rolling into the 2020s. While the last order of F-15s by Saudi Arabia will be completed by 2019, it is expected that the US Navy will purchase more F/A-18s while export orders of the F-15 will continue to partner nations. The company has recently been implementing a series of cost cutting measures to boost productivity in the wake of losing out on the recent bomber program for the USAF to Northrop Grumman.

December 18/15: It looks like a very merry Christmas for Lockheed Martin and Boeing, as they came out as the major winners in the announced $1.15 trillion spending bill announced on Wednesday. Funding will see eleven more F-35 Lightning IIs than requested by President Obama in February. The F-35 program will see $1.33 billion additional procurement money as production of the fighters will be ramped up. The F/A-18 production line will also be extended, with seven more EA-18G Growlers and five F/A-18E/F Super Hornets planned.

July 24/15: Boeing is committing to keep its F-18 production line open in response to new and forecast orders from both the US and international customers. The company was worried that insufficient orders for new Super Hornet and Growler aircraft would fail to materialize and keep the production line economically viable. Boeing considered slowing the production rate in March, to extend the time available for more orders to come through the door. Recent orders from the US Navy and Kuwait have bolstered the company’s confidence in keeping the production line open.

Nov 4/14: Support. Boeing in Jacksonville, FL receives a $25.3 million indefinite-delivery/ indefinite-quantity contract modification for depot-level F/A-18A-D service life extension and remanufacturing activities, including associated maintenance support and sustainment capabilities.

Work will be performed in Jacksonville, FL (91.7%), and St. Louis, MO (8.3%), and is expected to be completed in September 2015. Funds will be obligated on individual delivery orders as they are issued. US Navy NAVAIR in Patuxent River, MD manages the contract (N00019-14-D-0001).

Nov 3/14: Support. Boeing in St. Louis, MO receives a $7.3 million cost-plus-fixed-fee, indefinite-delivery/ indefinite-quantity contract modification, exercising an option for post-production program management, logistics, and engineering services in support of F/A-18 A-F aircraft operated by Switzerland ($2.3M / 31.6%); Finland ($1.7M / 22.9%); Malaysia ($1.1M / 15.8%); Kuwait ($1.0M / 13.7%); Australia ($510,103 / 7%); Canada ($356,677 / 4.9%); and Spain ($298,498 / 4.1%). All funds are committed immediately.

Work will be performed in St. Louis, MO, and is expected to be complete in December 2015. US Navy NAVAIR in Patuxent River, MD (N00019-14-D-0012).

Nov 3/14: USMC Plan. The USMC’s Aviation Plan to 2030 outlines a future in which Hornets will remain in the fleet until 2030, instead of 2025. The main reason? The USMC believes it would be about $1 billion cheaper to retire the AV-8B Harrier fleet 5 years earlier and extend the Hornets 5 years later, based on 2 independent cost/benefit analyses. En route to this future, all West Coast MEUs will have F-35Bs instead of AV-8Bs by the end of FY 2019.

For the Hornet fleet, the Center Barrel Replacement Plus (CBR+) program has already extended the lives of 200 aircraft. A High Flight Hour inspection process is in progress, and a SLEP program will take place in parallel to extend the lives of about 150 hand-picked F/A-18C/Ds to 10,000 flight hours. Unfortunately:

“The USMC F/A-18A-D community is enduring a sustained shortage in excess of 40 aircraft fleet wide due to “Out Of Reporting” (OOR) maintenance. The USMC currently has eleven active squadrons and one reserve squadron that deploy with a full complement of aircraft, but the community is forced to absorb the shortfall during pre-deployment training due to a degraded Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI). HQMC AVN is resetting the force by temporarily reducing squadron Flight Line Entitlement (FLE) to 10 aircraft to preserve future combat readiness while meeting today’s current operational requirements. Scalable squadron detachment models are being developed to meet the operational requirement without deploying excess assets, and Marine Corps Aviation is adding a detachment capability to each non-TAI VMFA. Forecasted improvements in aircraft availability will enable USMC F/A-18s to achieve 12 PMAI squadrons beginning in FY 17.”

Meanwhile, a set of fleet upgrades will continue to improve the platform. 2015 will see advanced LITENING G4 surveillance and targeting pods add air-to-air IRST capability, and the addition of the longer-range AIM-120D air-to-air missile with its 2-way datalink and new seeker radar. 2017-18 will add upgraded cockpit displays, AIM-9X short-range air-to-air missiles, and the 70mm APKWS laser-guided rocket. By 2019, APKWS will be able to use the 13.7 pound M822 tri-mode penetrating/ blast/ incendiary warhead. Instead of just 1 AGM-65 Maverick per hardpoint, the Hornet fleet will have 7 anti-armor weapons that can defeat many armored personnel carriers, and all lesser vehicles. Sources: USMC, Marine Aviation Plan 2015 [PDF].

May 18/14: Switzerland. Unsurprisingly, a tepid and convictionless defense of the JAS-39E Gripen NG fighter deal results in a referendum loss, with projections showing about a 53.4% no vote. The only surprise is that the margin was this narrow, indicating a winnable vote. Compare and contrast with the September 2013 referendum, which resulted in the Swiss keeping conscription. Or the government’s success in the referendum that ratified their F/A-18 Hornet buy.

While some governments in Europe will re-run referendums until they get the result they like, the Swiss aren’t like that. The TTE fighter buy is history, but the F-5E/F fleet will still retire, placing more emphasis on their fleet of 30+ Hornets. Switzerland will need to supplement that fleet with French and Italian cooperation for basic airspace protection. Sources: Swissinfo, “Swiss Reject $3.5 Billion Gripen Purchase in Blow to Saab” | Deutsche Welle, “Swiss referendum turns down minimum wage and new fighter jets” | Reuters, “Swiss voters narrowly block deal to buy Saab fighter jets: projection”.

Feb 28/14: Australia. Australia has changed and extended its F404 engine support contract with GE International Inc., to the tune of 4 years and A$ 230 million. This is also good news for local sub-contractor TAE, creating continued employment for 90 people in Williamtown, NSW, and Ipswich, Queensland.

When Australia signed their long-term F404 support contract in 2008, the RAAF’s F/A-18AM/BM fleet was scheduled to begin drawdown in July 2015, and leave service by June 2018. Delays to the F-35 program have forced an interim RAAF buy of 24 F/A-18F Super Hornet Block IIs, and will soon add 12 related EA-18G Growlers. It’s also forcing longer service from the “Classic Hornet” fleet, which won’t leave service until 2022. The new fighters are an obvious cost of the F-35 program, but so are forced extensions like this one. Sources: Australia DoD, “Minister for Defence – Jobs remain in Australia under Hornet contract”.

Nov 15/12: USN Life Extension. The US GAO publishes GAO-13-51, “Better Cost Estimates Needed for Extending the Service Life of Selected F-16s and F/A-18s.” The lateness of the F-35, and high flight-hour usage over Iraq and Afghanistan, are making it hard to keep fighter numbers up. Current USAF plans involve $2.61 billion to upgrade at least 300 of 1,020 F-16s to fly another 2,000 hours (est. 6-8 years) each, add more advanced radars, etc. The USN would spend about $2.19 billion to keep 150 of 624 F/A-18A-D Hornet fighters flying for another 1,400 flight hours (est. 5 years) each, alongside a separate buy of 41 more F/A-18E/F Super Hornets.

The alternative is a more expensive approach that would buy new F-16s or Super Hornets. They would cost much more, but last 4x-5x as long. The problem is that the cost of new planes is known, but costs of fixing existing aircraft to cover for additional F-35 delays or add new capabilities aren’t as clear. F-16 upgrades could rise to 650 planes, and F/A-18 Hornet life extension could rise to 280 planes, with the possibility of added capability upgrades.

The US Navy’s 2011 plan for its Hornet fleet would take place over FY 2013-2017. The planes to be upgraded would be specially chosen, presumably for low wear and structural integrity. They would also be individually evaluated for capability enhancements, but those aren’t in the $2.19 billion budget. Current estimates involve another $1.76 million per Hornet for capability upgrades, and an average of $5.64 million more if the Hornets need structural life extension and obsolescence replacement. That gives us a figure of between $2.19 – $3.3 billion if 150 Hornets are upgraded ($14.6 – $22 million per plane), and the upper ends of that figure offer poorer long-term value for money than buying a new Super Hornet in the mid-$60 million range.

If costs are linear, the total for a 280 plane program would be between $4.09 – 6.16 billion, but costs are often not linear. Hence the GAO’s recommendation to do a full sensitivity analysis, so decision makers can fully understand the range of Navy costs between $2.19 – $6.16 billion.

Sept 28/12: Aging in Australia. The Australian reports that the RAAF has been ordered to scale back its usage of its modernized F/A-18AM/BM Hornets, in order to keep them viable until F-35 begin arriving in the early 2020s. Aging is taking a serious toll, and 62/71 fighters had “structure fatigue above that expected for the airframe hours.”

Meanwhile, annual maintenance costs for Australia’s Hornet fleet were A$118 million in 2001, A$ 170 million in 2012, and is expected to be A$ 214 million by 2018. The ANAO sees costs continuing to climb, and says that keeping the fleet flying beyond 2020 could require more structural modifications program and capability upgrades, as well as more frequent inspections. Maintenance for Australia’s new F/A-18F Super Hornets is a separate effort, and does not affect their conclusions.

Sept 27/12: An unfinalized $33 million contract line item number against delivery order under a previously awarded contract for various quantities of new consumable parts to support the F/A-18 aircraft. Work will be performed in St. Louis, MO, and the contract will run until Dec 30/15.

Feb 28/11: USN Life Extension. A Gannett Navy Times article details the efforts underway to keep the US Navy’s fleet of F/A-18 A-D Hornet fighters in service, until some of them can be replaced by F-35B/C jets.

The USN’s F/A-18 program manager, Capt. Mark Darrah, is quoted as saying that the Hornet fleet is averaging about 330 flight-hours per year, which means they’re consistently about 30% above planned usage. Many have now exceeded even their extended usage figure of 8,000 flight hours. Fortunately, their accident rate remains low.

Carrier Air Wing 7 commander Capt. Roy Kelley adds that the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fleet is also burning through airframe hours, with 73 of the fleet’s 418 aircraft already over 3,000 hours – wich is about half-way through their safe design lifetimes.

The Navy hopes to extend its Hornet airframes to 10,000 safe flight hours, up from the easier target of 8,600. Each plane costs about $15 million when put through the deep inspections and refurbishment program. It’s accompanied by detailed record-keeping, and a constant juggling act among the squadrons. Darrah says that NAVAIR/NAF’s quarterly modification review “literally makes the decisions every quarter on, bureau number by bureau number, what aircraft will be assigned to what units,” based heavily on flight hour and maintenance issues. Once on the carrier, that juggling continues. Networking has made flight data files compilable and accessible across the fleet, allowing for remote analysis by expert teams, and letting squadrons pick less demanding missions for high-hours airframes, in order to even out wear and tear.

Feb 25/11: A $10.8 million order for the US Navy’s F/A-18 A-D Navy aircrew common ejection seat retrofit: 24 multipurpose display indicators; 12 horizontal situation displays; and 37 install kits (AFC-430, AFC-493, and AYC-1363).

Work will be performed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (57%); St. Louis, MO (24%); Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada (3%); Grand Rapids, MI (2%); Sylmar, CA (1%); Tempe, AR (1%); El Paso, TX (1%); El Segundo, CA (1%); and various locations throughout the United States (10%); and is expected to be complete in February 2013. All contract funds will expire at the end of the current fiscal year, on Sept 30/11 (N00019-11-G-0001).

Jan 6/11: USN Life Extension. As part of a plan detailing $150 billion in service cuts and funding shifts over the next 5 years, Defense Secretary Robert Gates states that he is placing the Marine Corps’ F-35B on the equivalent of a 2-year probation, extends the F-35 program’s development phase again to 2016, and cuts production of all models over the 2012-2016 time period.

In response, the Navy will add 41 Super Hornets, and perform service life extension work on another 150 F/A-18 A-D Hornets.

Dec 30/10: FIRST. Boeing in St. Louis, MO receives a $69.1 million delivery order under the F/A-18 Integrated Readiness Support Team (FIRST) Program for continued support of F/A-18 A-D Hornet, F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet, and EA-18G Growler fleets of the U.S. Navy ($64.6M/ 93.6%); and the governments of Australia ($1.7M/ 2.5%), Canada ($513,996; 0.7%), Spain ($513,996/ 0.7%), Finland ($513,966/ 0.7%), Switzerland ($513,996; 0.7%), Kuwait ($513,996/ 0.7%), and Malaysia ($256,998/ 0.4%).

Under FIRST, which began in 2001, Boeing manages and forecasts spares and repairs, oversees spares inventories, makes supportability improvements within the budget in order to meet its availability targets, and handles obsolescence management and technology insertion. Like the British “contracting for availability” agreements, the objective is to improve fleet support and aircraft readiness while reducing costs. Boeing will be rewarded for having the aircraft meet in-service readiness targets, rather than getting paid for spare parts or hours worked.

Work will be performed in St. Louis, MO (70%); El Segundo, CA (15%); Oklahoma City, OK (6%); Bethpage, NY (5%); and San Diego, CA (4%); and is expected to be complete in December 2011. US Naval Air Systems Command in Patuxent River, MD manages this contract (N00383-06-D-001J).

Sept 24/08: Switzerland. The Swiss House of Representatives rejects the PA08 program, dealing a political blow to defence minister Samuel Schmid, and a program blow to F/A-18 modernization. Switzerland’s Senate will vote on it again in December 2008.

The problem is Swiss party politics. While the left-wing Greens and Social-Democrats are reliably opposed to such measures, the right-wing People’s Party (SVP) has threatened to veto and block all new arms expenditures. Samuel Schmid’s personal break with the SVP appears to be paying negative dividends; without SVP support, the centre-right Radicals and Christian Democrats lack the required votes.

Sept 4/08: Australia. Australia has initially decide to replace 49 center barrel sections in its Hornet fleet, and has already begun the process. In parallel, however, it also ran a full scale fatigue testing program for removed center barrel sections, courtesy of Australia’s DSTO, QinetiQ-Aerostructures, and Fortburn. The Hon. Warren Snowdon MP, Australia’s Minister for Defence Science and Personnel under Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon, announced that in light of this testing:

“…the actual life of the Hornet centre barrels is 10%, or 2 years, greater than originally certified… These findings are thanks to Australia’s internationally recognised world-leading expertise in testing and managing ageing aircraft, and is the result of decades of experience developing this capability.”

In response, Australia’s center barrel replacement program may drop from 49 aircraft to 10, a move that would save up to A$ 400 million (currently about $330 million) and leave more aircraft available for missions.

The “center barrel” is the crucial center part of the aircraft fuselage that supports the wings and landing gear. This part is may be replaced for crash damage, or just because of the continual hard landing damage sustained by aircraft in the “controlled crashes” of carrier landings.

Dec 21/05: Northrop Grumman Corp. Air Combat Systems in El Segundo, CA received a $5.9 million firm-fixed-price contract for 37 shipsets of Center Barrel Replacement Plus (CBR+) loose parts in support of the Service Life Extension Program for the U.S. Navy F/A-18A/B/C/D aircraft. Work will be performed in El Segundo, CA and is expected to be complete in October 2008. This contract was not competitively procured by the Naval Air Systems Command in Patuxent River, MD (N00019-06-C-0080).

The non-profit Confucius Institute has been operating in 28 New Brunswick schools, with more than 5,441 students taking part in 2016, according to the organization's website.

It is largely funded by the Chinese government and was introduced to New Brunswick in 2008, when Shawn Graham was the Liberal premier.

At the time, the New Brunswick government said the mandate was to teach and promote Chinese language and culture.

Dominic Cardy said the programs give a ""one-dimensional"" view of China. 0:54

But Cardy said it's clear to him the program's real mandate is to present a ""one-dimensional"" view of China and to influence students to only perceive the country in a positive light.



""Their job is to create a friendly, cheerful, face for a government that is responsible for more deaths than nearly any other in the history of our species,"" Cardy said Thursday.

""And I don't think in an education system that is supposed to be the vehicle that transmits our values to the next generation that showing that we're open to a government that behaves that way is appropriate.""

The program hosts teachers from China who have taught Mandarin, history and a variety of cultural practices, including calligraphy and arts in different classes across the province. The 28 anglophone schools include elementary schools and high schools in Fredericton, Oromocto, Bathurst, Saint John, Moncton, Dieppe, Rexton and Richibucto.

According to the Confucius Institute of New Brunswick's website, 5,441 New Brunswick students took part in the program in 2016. (Confucius Institute of New Brunswick website)

Cardy said he has already issued the Confucius Institute a letter of intent to discontinue the program. He hopes to have it gone by June.

He has also already informed Premier Blaine Higgs, as well as cabinet members, of his intent to remove the institute. Cardy is now reviewing the contract between the province and the Confucius Institute so he can terminate it.

""It's something that has concerned me. Not because of any feelings of dislike towards anyone in China, in fact quite the opposite. My concern is we have an institute whose job it is to put a very one-dimensional perspective of China into our schools

The organization has classrooms in 28 anglophone schools, including Fredericton, Moncton, Bathurst, and Saint John. (Confucius Institute of New Brunswick website)

Cardy says he's recently received five complaints from students who attended the Confucius Institute programs. Each told of topics in Chinese history that were off-limits to discussion.

""One of them tried to discuss Taiwan's recognition and the professor told him he was forbidden from having this discussion,"" said Cardy.

CBC News has requested a copy of the letters, as well as a copy of the letter of intent sent to the Confucius Institute.

CBC News and Radio-Canada also made several attempts to contact the Confucius Institute of New Brunswick. No email or phone calls were returned.

History of controversy

The move by Cardy to remove the Confucius Institute from schools follows similar moves in other jurisdictions. In 2014 the Toronto District School Board voted to remove the institute from their schoolsfollowing protests. McMaster University and the University of Manitoba have also removed the Confucius Institute from their campuses over freedom of education concerns.

Educators haven't been the only people to sound the alarm about the Confucius Institute. Seven years ago, CSIS issued warnings about the program. The agency suspected Confucius Institutes are used as spy satellite offices by China, according to a veteran Canadian operative.

Michel-Juneau Katsuya, a former CSIS Asia-Pacific bureau chief, compared the Confucius Institute to a 'Trojan horse.' (CBC)

In 2012, Michel-Juneau Katsuya , a former CSIS Asia-Pacific bureau chief, compared the Confucius Institute to a ""Trojan horse."" He said the programs were used by the Chinese government ""to carry out intelligence and spying activities.""

Defending the program

When Graham brought in the Confucius Institute, his government said it would also be a resource for companies wanting to do business in China.

Despite the criticism now, Graham said the program shouldn't be canned so quickly.

""To abandon the program today, simply by three or four students saying they weren't allowed to talk about Chinese politics, I think the better route would have been to undertake a review of the program,"" said Graham.

Former premier Shawn Graham says the current government should review the Chinese cultural program before kicking it out. (Gilles Landry/Radio-Canada)

""Make sure the rules are being followed,"" he said. ""Then you can make a better determination as a government how you want to send your first signal to that country.""

Graham now owns a consulting business, G&R Holdings, where he works with several Chinese businesses to increase trade between China and Canada's East Coast.

""Does China matter, or does China not matter?"" he asked.

""Today, the government of New Brunswick has to do business with China, so we have to be prudent and cautious during these heightened diplomatic times that show we want to respect human rights, and the federal government must continue to push for that.""",Education minister pulling plug on Chinese education program in schools,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/education-mnister-pulling-plug-confucius-institute-new-brunswick-1.5028098

Ed Hood takes a look at the man from Lessines' life and career, and what his contemporaries in the peloton thought of him. There was so much more to Claudy than that crash in Ronse.Claude Criquielion World championThe death of Claude Criquielion was announced to me in a simple text message from my English friend, Ian Whitehead who lives in Gent; ‘Claudy has died.’During the night of 15/16 February 2015, Criquielion suffered a stroke and was hospitalised in critical condition; he died at 9:00 am on 18 February 2015 in the hospital in Aalst, Belgium of a severe brain haemorrhage.Amstel Gold 1987It’s unfortunate that the mental image most people have of one of the most talented riders of a generation of great riders is of a shattered, disconsolate Criquielion dragging his bike across the line on foot at the end of the 1988 World Professional Road Race Championships in Ronse, Belgium after clashing with Steve Bauer of Canada in the closing metres when the usually smiling man from Lessines looked to be en route to his second World Professional Road Race Championship.Claude and Sean at the WorldsNot so for me, I was fortunate enough to be road side with my friend Dave Chapman for the 75 kilometre Sarrebourg to Strasbourg time trial stage 8 of the 1985 Tour de France where Hinault demolished the best riders in the world by more than two minutes and tore the yellow jersey from the back of Denmark’s Kim Andersen. I have two over riding memories of that day; the demonic look in Hinault’s eye as he hurtled past me, just inches away, through the funnel of over-excited fans.And how Claude Criquielion looked as he rode the course as part of his pre-race preparation. He passed us three times that day, once in the race - where he finished in 14th spot - and twice prior to the race on his warm-up, once behind the team car and once ‘en seule.’ With the distance of the time test being a massive 75km he wouldn’t have ridden the whole course twice but would have been familiarising himself with the technical second part of the parcours.Criquielion on the cobblesHis legs were bare but oiled; the colour of teak – with his dark skin and jet black hair he always had a magnificent tan – which made his long sleeved Hitachi world champion’s top seem impossibly white, almost as if illuminated from within. His ‘Oppy’ cap was perched on that thick black hair in the casual manner that only the coolest guys can achieve and his position on the bike was relaxed, perfect, at one with the machine. He looked a million dollars, even if you had no idea about cycling or the rainbow jersey you’d take one look at this man and think, ‘wow!’He had that aura that only the very best do.Belgian champIt was 1977 when he first served notice of his talent with a stage win in the Tour de l’Avenir, then, as now one of the world’s main proving grounds for amateurs with big dreams. The following year he was second in the GP Faber in Luxembourg behind Etienne de Wilde but ahead of Fons de Wolf – all three would leave their mark on world cycling. He was also top ten on GC in the l’Avenir and GP Tell in Switzerland.Climbing Montjuich for a rainbow jerseyHis neo-pro year in ’79 for Kas was nothing short of sensational with a top ten finish in le Tour and overall wins in the Setmana Catalana and Escalada a Montjuich. For season 1980 he was back to Belgium and Splendor-Admiral with stage wins in Tirreno-Adriatico, le Dauphine and an excellent third on GC in the Vuelta which would be his best ever Grand Tour result. That year also saw him 13th in le Tour.If ’81 was less spectacular there was still a top ten finish in le Tour and a win in the GP Paul Borremans in the colours of Wickes-Splendor. The name on the jersey was the same for ’82 and there was a win in the tough Brabantse Pijl. It was Splendor-Euroshop for ’83 and ‘only’ a top 20 placing in le Tour but victory in the Clásica San Sebastián.Criquielion with Thierry MarieThe ’84 season with Splendor was his greatest; another top ten in le Tour, another win in the Escalada and victory in the GP Merckx – with the latter two seeing the rainbow jersey upon his back after his magnificent win in the Worlds on the brutal Montjuich circuit in Barcelona. In 1985 he continued to build his credentials as a ‘man of the Classics’ in the colours of Hitachi-Splendor with a win in Flèche Wallone – and a top 20 spot in le Tour. In ’86, still in the same livery, he took two beautiful overall stage race wins – the Midi Libre and Tour of Romandie.Stephen Roche and Criquielion clashed many times in Flèche and LiegeClassics and shorter stage races were his forte; his brilliant ninth in le Tour as a neo-pro was a curse in disguise, creating a huge expectation and pressure from the Belgian public and media for a Grand Tour win which was never going to happen given that his talents lay elsewhere. If his ‘Belgian Legend’ status was in doubt up until this point he made sure there it was cast in stone in ’87, winning le Samyn and the Tour of Flanders for Hitachi – and there was an 11th spot in le Tour.Winning De RondeFor ’88 there were Bosal exhaust systems sharing the maillot with Hitachi but Claudy just kept on winning – with the Midi Libre going his way and another top 20 in le Tour. In ’89, still with Hitachi, he added another Flèche Wallone to his glittering palmarès but fared poorly in le Tour in 36th spot. The Lotto jersey for ’90 may have been less chic than he was used to but he soon swapped it for the Belgian National Champions jersey which he wore to yet another top ten Tour finish.Always a good performer at the Tour de FranceHis final season was ’91, still with Lotto; and no one will ever accuse Claude Criquielion of having ridden the dreaded ‘one season too many’ - only the brilliant Italian Moreno Argentin was able to best the Belgian in the Flèche Wallone and again in Liege-Bastogne-Liege.His palmarès display Criquielion’s extraordinary talent and versatility but are only a fraction of a career which saw 64 professional wins and dozens of podium finishes.Ronse'88But no obituary for Claudy can ignore the events in Ronse in the late summer of 1988 for which most remember him. Ace photographer John Pierce was there and remembers it like this;“There were three of them clear; Fondriest, Bauer and Criq as they entered the finale but Fondriest was way too far back and was set for third, Criquielion went for the long sprint to one side and had the legs because it was uphill and his morale was sky high with it being in Belgium; Bauer instead of sprinting ahead, shot sideways - as if to get on Criq's wheel - but hit him broadside with his arm under Criq's ribs - Criq went airborne, right off the ground, bike and all.”Worlds'88 finaléBauer was disqualified and Fondriest won; Criquielion took the affair to court on the grounds that Bauer’s actions were deliberate and had cost the Belgian a fortune in lost earnings. He lost the case; it’s up to you to form your opinion on the crash which you can see here:Criquielion with son MathieuCriquielion hung up his wheels in 1991, but stayed involved with cycling and became directeur sportif of the Lotto-Adecco team from 2000 to 2004. His son, Mathieu Criquielion, turned professional for the Landbouwkrediet-Colnago team in 2005; Claude Criquielion became the team's manager.From 2006 until his death Criquielion was an alderman in his home town of Lessines for the liberal Reformist Movement which is a conservative/liberal French-speaking political party in Belgium.Claudy and Patrick LevefereOur friend Ivan who’s fluent in Flemish and has followed the Belgian race scene for some 40 years has kindly translated a few of the tributes being paid to Criquielion in Belgium.Freddy Maertens, Johan Museeuw and Carlo Bomans all spoke warmly of Claudy; seemingly he was a really nice guy, easy going, always up for a laugh, Freddy thought he was a great rider and Museeuw said he learned a lot about training from him as a young rider.Meanwhile his friend and former rival; a very emotional Eddy Planckaert said Criquielion was an amiable man, pleasant to be around, helpful to others, a real family man, happiest at home with his wife and children, in some ways too easy going a character for the sport of cycling, he would be a super star with his palmarès today, it’s sad that he was so underrated and people only wanted to talk about Ronse 1988, while his victory at Barcelona in 1984 was magnificent and overlooked as a result of Ronse.Class actAccording to Planckaert, Criquielion never got over the Ronse incident and carried the anguish of it to his grave; Planckaert said that after he beat Steve Bauer for Paris-Roubaix in 1990 Criquielion later told him he was happy that he had beaten Bauer.Criquielion, Thurau and MoserVeteran, highly respected Belgian cycling journalist and pundit, Mark Vanlombeek said that Criquielion’s unsuccessful legal action against Bauer after Ronse affected him hugely; especially the judge's ruling that Bauer had not deviated from his line in the sprint, but that the barriers narrowed towards the line causing CC to crash, a ridiculous ruling according to Vanlombeek.A few journalist from the Belgian Sporza Agency asked Planckaert, Vanlombeek and former Tour green jersey winner, Frank Hoste if Criquielion could be compared to any rider today, only Hoste suggested a rider - Phil Gilbert.Ivan thinks that's a fair comparison, even if we find it difficult to compare across generations.Hoste also compared Criquielion to Hinault and Fignon in the way he rode, always aggressive, always attacking, never a calculator, Hoste was super-impressed by Criquielion’s Ronde win, he said Criquielion wasn't good on the approach to the climbs in that he started them too far down but always got back to the front over the top - he did that all day and then left everyone for dead on the Muur to win Belgium’s biggest race.Claude Criquielion, born Lessines, January 11 1957, died Aalst February 18 2015; supreme stylist, Ronde winner and World Champion may you rest in peace.Claude Criquielion's funeral in 2015It was November 2005 when Ed Hood first penned a piece for PEZ, on US legend Mike Neel .

This raises concerns that a foreign adversary may be intending to weaponise, or strategically release documents, with an eye towards altering the 2019 election outcome.

Read more: A state actor has targeted Australian political parties – but that shouldn't surprise us

While the hacking of party and parliamentary systems is normally a covert activity, influence operations are necessarily noisy and public in order to reach citizens – even if efforts are made to obscure their origins.

If a state actor has designs to weaponise materials recently hacked, we will likely see them seek to inflame religious and ethnic differences, as well as embarrass the major parties in an effort to drive votes to minor parties.

If this comes to pass, there are four things Australians should look for.

1. Strategic interest for a foreign government to intervene

If the major parties have roughly the same policy position in relation to a foreign country, a foreign state would have little incentive to intervene, for example, in favour of Labor against the Coalition.

They may, however, attempt to amplify social divisions between the parties as a way of reducing the ability of Australians to work together after the election.

They may also try to drive down the already low levels of support for democracy and politicians in Australia to further undermine Australian democracy.

Finally, they may also try to drive the vote away from the major parties to minor parties which might be more favourable to their agenda.

This could be achieved by strategically releasing hacked materials which embarrass the major parties or their candidates, moving voters away from those parties and towards minor parties. These stories will likely be distributed first on social media platforms and later amplified by foreign and domestic broadcast media.

It is no secret that Russia and China seek a weakening of the Five Eyes security relationship between Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. If weakened, that would undermine the alliance structure which has helped prevent major wars for the last 70 years.

2. Disproportionate attention by foreign media to a local campaign

In the US, although Tulsi Gabbard’s polling numbers rank her near the bottom of declared and anticipated candidates for the Democratic nomination, she has received significant attention from Russia’s overt or “white” propaganda outlets, Sputnik and RT (formerly Russia Today).

The suspected reason for this attention is that some of her foreign policy positions on the Middle East are consistent with Russian interests in the region.

In Australia, we might find greater attention than normal directed at One Nation or Fraser Anning – as well as the strategic promotion of Green candidates in certain places to push political discussion further right and further left at the same time.

3. Promoted posts on Facebook and other social media platforms

Research into the 2016 US election found widespread violations of election law. The vast majority of promoted ads on Facebook during the election campaign were from groups which failed to file with the Federal Election Commission and some of this unregistered content came from Russia.

Ads placed by Russia’s Internet Research Agency, which is under indictment by the Mueller investigation, ended up disproportionately in the newsfeeds of Facebook users in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – two of the three states that looked like a lock for Clinton until the very end of the campaign.

What makes Facebook and many other social media platforms particularly of concern is the ability to use data to target ads using geographic and interest categories. One can imagine that if a foreign government were armed with voting data hacked from the parties, this process would be all the more effective.

Seats in Australia which might be targeted include seats like Swan (considered a marginal seat with competition against the Liberals on both the left and the right) and the seats of conservative politicians on GetUp’s “hitlist” – such as Tony Abbott’s and Peter Dutton’s seats of Warringah and Dickson.

4. Focus on identity manipulation, rather than fake news

The term “fake news” suffers from conceptual ambiguities – it means different things to different people. “Fake news” has been used not just as a form of classification to describe material which “mimics news media content in form but not in organisational process or intent” but also used to describe satire and even as an epithet used to dismiss disagreeable claims of a factual nature.

Studies of propaganda show that information need not be factually false to effectively manipulate target audiences.

The best propaganda uses claims which are factually true, placing them into a different context which can be used to manipulate audiences or by amplifying negative aspects of a group, policy or politician, without placing that information in a wider context.

For example, to amplify concerns about immigrants, one might highlight the immigrant background of someone convicted of a crime, irrespective of the overall propensity for immigrants to commit crimes compared to native born Australians.

This creates what communication scholars call a “representative anecdote” through which people come to understand and think about a topic with which they are otherwise unfamiliar. While immigrants may or may not be more likely to commit crimes than other Australians, the reporting creates that association.

Among the ways foreign influence operations function is through the politicisation of identities. Previous research has found evidence of efforts to heighten ethnic and racial differences through Chinese language WeChat official accounts operating in Australia as well as through Russian trolling efforts which have targeted Australia. This is the same pattern followed by Russia during the 2016 US election.

Liberal democracies are designed to handle conflicts over interests through negotiation and compromise. Identities, however, are less amenable to compromise. These efforts may not be “fake news” but they are effective in undermining the capacity of a democratic nation to mobilise its people in pursuit of common goals.

The Russian playbook

No country is immune from the risk of foreign influence operations. While historically these operations might have involved the creation of false documents and on the ground operations in target countries, today materials can be sourced, faked, and disseminated from the relative security of the perpetrating country. They may include both authentic and faked documents – making it hard for a campaign to charge that certain documents are faked without affirming the validity of others.

Most importantly, in a digitally connected world, these operations can scale up quickly and reach substantially larger populations than previously possible.

While the Russian interference in the 2016 US election has received considerable attention, Russia is not the only perpetrator and the US is not the only target.

But the Russians created a playbook which other countries can readily draw upon and adapt. The question remains as to who that might be in an Australian context.",We've been hacked – so will the data be weaponised to influence election 2019?

168,Empty,2019-02-22T16:56:34Z,"This is too innocuous for the Americans, too wholesome for Latin America, too complicated for the Swiss and Scandinavians","The SNC-Lavalin affair is the quintessential Canadian controversy. It is alleged by unnamed sources that the former justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, was pressured to order her officials to assess fines rather than prosecute executives for financial crimes in the matter of SNC-Lavalin’s methods in seeking certain construction contracts in Libya, not a country where the Better Business Bureau rules commerce with an iron fist. At a later date, Ms. Wilson-Raybould consented to be moved to the position of associate minister of national defence and minister of veterans’ affairs, generally considered a demotion. When rumours circulated in the media about the propriety of allowing the company to pay fines rather than prosecute some of its executives, the prime minister defended the government, denied the rumours, and stated that the minister’s continued presence in the government was proof that the rumours were unfounded. The minister then resigned, but has since attended a full caucus meeting and had a calming effect on the Liberal MPs. She has said nothing publicly because of the delicacy of lawyer/client privilege opposite the prime minister, who has declined to waive the privilege. This is, in fact, bunk. The prime minister was not the client of the minister of justice in the SNC-Lavalin affair, and the prime minister doesn’t have any standing to waive anything on this subject, and his invocation of cabinet secrecy is twaddle, especially after the subject was aired before the entire Liberal caucus.

This is Canada, the land of Dudley Do-Right, and before him, of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald singing Rose-Marie in the Rockies

All government spokespeople deny any official misconduct or impropriety but the principal secretary and chief strategist of the regime, Gerald Butts, resigned, with the novel explanation that although nothing inappropriate had occurred, he thought the air should be cleared, so he walked the plank. This is the point at which this supposed scandal becomes uniquely Canadian. A minister belatedly resigns but informally continues to attend cabinet and expatiate on this issue and the government reinforces its protestations of absolute innocence of wrongdoing by the prime minister accepting the abrupt resignation of the most influential non-elected person in the government (and he also had a great deal more influence than almost all the elected ministers and MP’s).

I invite any reader to cite another country where a minister would consent to be shuffled down, maintain a complete silence while her father, an indigenous leader, has conducted an entertaining non-stop press conference denouncing the “white man’s justice,” although he has clearly gamed the system pretty well for himself, and the head of the prime minister’s office and closest collaborator of the prime minister resigns while proclaiming that nothing improper has been done and that he is only sacrificing himself to satiate the false accusers. This is too innocuous for the Americans and major European countries, too wholesome for Latin America, too complicated for the Swiss and Scandinavians, too discrete for Australia, and small potatoes for the Japanese. This is Canada, the land of Dudley Do-Right, and before him, of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald singing Rose-Marie in the Rockies. The story line of this scandal is absurd, but in its way, magnificently Canadian.

In so far as the aroma of scandal has arisen and been maintained at all, it is largely by the usual remarks about shabby Quebec business ethics and large companies being protected from the consequences of their misdeeds by their size and the political influence of their principals. Sales incentives of one kind and another are not confined to Quebec and it is often difficult to distinguish legitimate concessions to make a deal from outright bribes. In this case, the allegation of $48 million in bribes and $130 million fraudulently received is impressive in its quantum and does raise at least one eyebrow. But it is unjust and unseemly for media and public opinion to leap to the conclusion that a fine rather than an expensive criminal trial of uncertain outcome is craven and corrupt truckling to the fatcat chums of the Liberal party.

Everybody, especially in such a woolly state of affairs as this, deserves a presumption of absence of guilt

Such an event would not be unprecedented, but it should not be presumed. The theory being bandied about that SNC-Lavalin is being spared because prosecution would bankrupt it is spurious. Companies have to disgorge funds sometimes but they don’t commit crimes; people do, and everybody, especially in such a woolly state of affairs as this, deserves a presumption of absence of guilt. And if executives are fairly judged to have committed crimes, they face the sentences but the company continues in the hands of people with better judgment and ethics. SNC-Lavalin has had its ups and downs, but it is a legitimate Canadian international business success story and should not be summarily castigated as financially and ethically bankrupt on allegations as flimsy and unsourced as these. Nor, as a country, should we be in the business of trying to drive a large and successful company into the hands of the receiver. The receivers are a bigger gang of crooks than any corrupt executives in this country going back to the CPR scandal of 1873. The entire bankruptcy system of this country is an outrage and Wilson-Raybould should have done something about that when she had the chance.

Gerry Butts will be missed by this government. I disagree with many of his policy ideas, especially his irrational faith in renewable energy — both its efficacy and the need for it. He largely carries the can for the McGuinty-Wynne negative Economic Miracle in Ontario that almost bankrupted this splendid jurisdiction. And I assume he has had some hand in the unmitigated pipeline and indigenous peoples policy disasters as well. But he is a capable man and something of a likeable scoundrel, a continuator, to a degree, of the cynical and often humorous competence of the men who performed in comparable roles for former Liberal prime ministers King, St. Laurent, Pearson, and Pierre Trudeau: Jack Pickersgill and Jim Coutts.

It will be hard for the government to spin this one other than damagingly, and whatever Gerry’s policy shortcomings, he is an astute political tactician, taking his cue from David Axelrod and even Sol Alinsky, far from the most wholesome American political influences. Nothing less than an ingenious hard-baller could have kept the ramshackle McGuinty roadshow going at Queen’s Park as long as he did. There is another interpretation of events. Gerry Butts’ political virtuosity presumably remains available to the Liberals this election year. If the government makes it, he can earn and receive much of the credit, because it will certainly not be swept back in on its record. If it is reversed at the polls, he will not be burned on the funeral pyre, and will be able to mount another Mephistophelean effort with Justin’s successor, or even, as Jack Pickersgill did, and Jim Coutts almost did, make the jump to elected politics himself.

If Gerry Butts’ political career ends here, it will be an absurd anti-climax, unless there is a lot more to this than meets even the inquisitive eye. This is a strange, hardly believable, crisis, and it’s hard to see where it’s going. Whatever happens, the country’s sense of humour is unlikely to be disserved.

The idea that he would cling to his job would seem grubby,"A day or so after my arrival at Queen’s Park to cover the Ontario legislature for the National Post, a bearded, rangy, 30-something beanpole of a man unfolded himself on the ratty old office couch.

That was my introduction to Gerald Butts. It was 2003, he was the principal secretary to the leader of the Opposition, Dalton McGuinty, and his office was kitty corner to mine.

He spent most of his day spinning the reporters of the Queen’s Park press gallery like tops. The architect of McGuinty’s victorious platform, he made sure the leader of the Opposition’s office was moved to the point farthest away from the press gallery, after taking power.

Butts still spins the small band of journalists on Parliament Hill he talks to regularly.

He and I don’t often agree and I like to think I have developed a journalistic white blood cell count that makes me immune to his progressive bacillus.

But he is very persuasive — one of the three smartest people I have dealt with in Canadian politics (the others being Stephen Harper and former Bank of Canada governor David Dodge).

He and I don’t often agree and I like to think I have developed a journalistic white blood cell count that makes me immune to his progressive bacillus

In 16 years, I have never had occasion to think he lied to me, so I am obliged to take at face value his statement that he has done nothing wrong, and that he quit as Justin Trudeau’s principal secretary on Monday because he doesn’t want to be a distraction for a government fighting to retain its credibility against the background of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Yet it is a curious decision. In the vacuum of information around the SNC case, there was nothing that made Butts’s position untenable.

There probably didn’t need to be, given his extreme sensitivity to criticism.

The suggestion that he has done anything untoward will have stung him. The idea that he would cling to his job would seem grubby.

I asked him recently about rumours that he might run for the Liberals in his native Cape Breton. “Not now, not there, not anywhere, not ever,” he said. “I have been around enough successful politicians to know what it takes and I ain’t got it.”

He’s right. The proud son of a Cape Breton coal miner, he’s too thin-skinned. And probably too honest.

In his resignation statement, he said he categorically denies the accusation that he or anyone else in the Prime Minister’s Office pressured former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to assist SNC-Lavalin in being considered for a deferred prosecution agreement.

Is it possible Trudeau asked for his resignation? This is the man the prime minster called his “best friend and closest adviser” in his autobiography.

One cabinet minister said he’s never seen a relationship like theirs. “Nobody talks to the prime minister, everybody has to go through Gerry. When Jean Chrétien calls for Justin, he gets a call back from Gerry. Even Justin thinks it was Gerry who got him elected,” he said.

It is possible that Trudeau asked Butts to go because there is evidence he pushed too hard on the attorney general. It would certainly allow him to say he’d already cleaned house, were the evidence to emerge.

It is feasible that Trudeau was feeling the heat from caucus over his cabal of powerful, unelected advisers and decided to throw a man overboard. There will have been many voices whispering in his ear that Butts had become a liability.

All these things are possible — just hard to imagine.

The prime minister talked about their “continued friendship,” as he thanked Butts for his advice and “devotion.”

Trudeau can be as ruthless as a rattlesnake, if it fits his electoral calculus — just ask the Senate Liberal caucus. But unless Butts is completely compromised, firing him seems a bad career move. Trudeau has leaned on him for advice since they met at McGill University.

On the available evidence, it seems likely that someone suggested to Wilson-Raybould that the government would like her to consider a plea agreement with SNC. Butts denies it was him or anyone else in the PMO.

Yet it also seems highly likely that Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to be minister of veterans affairs last month because she had not taken a decision that would have played particularly well for the Liberals in Quebec — that is, taking the SNC case away from the director of public prosecutions and striking a remediation deal that would help protect the corporate integrity of a major employer in the province.

Butts said his relationship with Wilson-Raybould has “always been defined by mutual respect, candour and an honest desire to work together.” But he also prides himself on the big picture — and to realize the goals he has set on climate change and elsewhere, the Liberals need to be re-elected. That would be greatly aided by an SNC deal in Quebec, which probably explains Wilson-Raybould’s demotion and her replacement with a Quebec MP, David Lametti.

Both he and Trudeau are intensely ideological, which reflects as a chauvinism bordering on smugness for their chosen causes

Taking a step back, Butts’s resignation is a milestone in the life of this government.

He has become a figure almost as contentious as Trudeau himself.

Butts Derangement Syndrome imagines a Svengali, a Cyrano de Bergerac, a Rasputin-type figure, who holds mesmeric sway over Trudeau and uses his influence for sinister purpose.

In reality, the relationship is more inter-dependent than that — Butts has the deeper policy roots but Trudeau has his own convictions on gender, the environment and the role of the federal government. His role is to be the front man. “I’ll figure out a way to get it across to people,” Trudeau once told the Globe and Mail. But it is usually the policy arc that Butts has developed that the prime minister is selling.

He has had remarkable leverage over Liberal policy since he helped organize a three-day retreat at Mont Tremblant, Que., in 2012 to discuss the prospect of Trudeau running for leader. Butts felt the party had lost touch with regular people, and even at that early stage was working on the narrative of “the middle class and those working hard to join it.”

As his resignation note made clear, his other driving motivation was climate change policy, as befits a former head of the World Wildlife Fund Canada. “Our kids and grandkids will judge us on one issue above all others,” he said in his statement.

Better than anyone, Butts likely realized there needed to be a scapegoat, even if his departure is unlikely to kill the SNC story

Both he and Trudeau are intensely ideological, which reflects as a chauvinism bordering on smugness for their chosen causes, and a disregard comparable to disdain for those who disagree. That dismissal of all opposition as unworthy has created divisions in the country that have acted as a barrier to getting things done. One senior Liberal MP said the government has done good things but the constant push on “values” shifted the government’s focus from the aspirational voter to the identity voter.

Butts, fairly or unfairly, has been a lightning rod for criticism inside the Liberal movement.

The senior Liberal suggested there might have been a “riot” at caucus this Wednesday, had Butts not quit.

As one person who has known him for 20 years put it, Butts “wears his passion on his sleeves” and that comes with consequences in terms of popularity. “It’s a vulnerable position — it’s hard to have that job and not upset people,” he said.

Better than anyone, Butts likely realized there needed to be a scapegoat, even if his departure is unlikely to kill the SNC story.

A number of Liberals will quietly cheer Butts’s departure, viewing him as an obstruction to them taking their rightful seat around the cabinet table.

Yet his departure is likely to mean many more of them will be seeking alternative employment this fall than might otherwise have been the case.

170,Empty,2019-02-21T14:30:02Z,"Prime Minister Scott Morrison recently said both the Australian Parliament and its major political parties were hacked by a ""sophisticated state actor.""","Credit: CC0 Public Domain Prime Minister Scott Morrison recently said both the Australian Parliament and its major political parties were hacked by a ""sophisticated state actor.""

This raises concerns that a foreign adversary may be intending to weaponise, or strategically release documents, with an eye towards altering the 2019 election outcome.

While the hacking of party and parliamentary systems is normally a covert activity, influence operations are necessarily noisy and public in order to reach citizens – even if efforts are made to obscure their origins.

If a state actor has designs to weaponise materials recently hacked, we will likely see them seek to inflame religious and ethnic differences, as well as embarrass the major parties in an effort to drive votes to minor parties.

If this comes to pass, there are four things Australians should look for.

1. Strategic interest for a foreign government to intervene

If the major parties have roughly the same policy position in relation to a foreign country, a foreign state would have little incentive to intervene, for example, in favour of Labor against the Coalition.

They may, however, attempt to amplify social divisions between the parties as a way of reducing the ability of Australians to work together after the election.

They may also try to drive down the already low levels of support for democracy and politicians in Australia to further undermine Australian democracy.

Finally, they may also try to drive the vote away from the major parties to minor parties which might be more favourable to their agenda.

This could be achieved by strategically releasing hacked materials which embarrass the major parties or their candidates, moving voters away from those parties and towards minor parties. These stories will likely be distributed first on social media platforms and later amplified by foreign and domestic broadcast media.

It is no secret that Russia and China seek a weakening of the Five Eyes security relationship between Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. If weakened, that would undermine the alliance structure which has helped prevent major wars for the last 70 years.

2. Disproportionate attention by foreign media to a local campaign

In the US, although Tulsi Gabbard's polling numbers rank her near the bottom of declared and anticipated candidates for the Democratic nomination, she has received significant attention from Russia's overt or ""white"" propaganda outlets, Sputnik and RT (formerly Russia Today).

The suspected reason for this attention is that some of her foreign policy positions on the Middle East are consistent with Russian interests in the region.

In Australia, we might find greater attention than normal directed at One Nation or Fraser Anning – as well as the strategic promotion of Green candidates in certain places to push political discussion further right and further left at the same time.

3. Promoted posts on Facebook and other social media platforms

Research into the 2016 US election found widespread violations of election law. The vast majority of promoted ads on Facebook during the election campaign were from groups which failed to file with the Federal Election Commission and some of this unregistered content came from Russia.

Ads placed by Russia's Internet Research Agency, which is under indictment by the Mueller investigation, ended up disproportionately in the newsfeeds of Facebook users in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – two of the three states that looked like a lock for Clinton until the very end of the campaign.

What makes Facebook and many other social media platforms particularly of concern is the ability to use data to target ads using geographic and interest categories. One can imagine that if a foreign government were armed with voting data hacked from the parties, this process would be all the more effective.

Seats in Australia which might be targeted include seats like Swan (considered a marginal seat with competition against the Liberals on both the left and the right) and the seats of conservative politicians on GetUp's ""hitlist"" – such as Tony Abbott's and Peter Dutton's seats of Warringah and Dickson.

4. Focus on identity manipulation, rather than fake news

The term ""fake news"" suffers from conceptual ambiguities – it means different things to different people. ""Fake news"" has been used not just as a form of classification to describe material which ""mimics news media content in form but not in organisational process or intent"" but also used to describe satire and even as an epithet used to dismiss disagreeable claims of a factual nature.

Studies of propaganda show that information need not be factually false to effectively manipulate target audiences.

The best propaganda uses claims which are factually true, placing them into a different context which can be used to manipulate audiences or by amplifying negative aspects of a group, policy or politician, without placing that information in a wider context.

For example, to amplify concerns about immigrants, one might highlight the immigrant background of someone convicted of a crime, irrespective of the overall propensity for immigrants to commit crimes compared to native born Australians.

This creates what communication scholars call a ""representative anecdote"" through which people come to understand and think about a topic with which they are otherwise unfamiliar. While immigrants may or may not be more likely to commit crimes than other Australians, the reporting creates that association.

Among the ways foreign influence operations function is through the politicisation of identities. Previous research has found evidence of efforts to heighten ethnic and racial differences through Chinese language WeChat official accounts operating in Australia as well as through Russian trolling efforts which have targeted Australia. This is the same pattern followed by Russia during the 2016 US election.

Liberal democracies are designed to handle conflicts over interests through negotiation and compromise. Identities, however, are less amenable to compromise. These efforts may not be ""fake news"" but they are effective in undermining the capacity of a democratic nation to mobilise its people in pursuit of common goals.

The Russian playbook

No country is immune from the risk of foreign influence operations. While historically these operations might have involved the creation of false documents and on the ground operations in target countries, today materials can be sourced, faked, and disseminated from the relative security of the perpetrating country. They may include both authentic and faked documents – making it hard for a campaign to charge that certain documents are faked without affirming the validity of others.

Most importantly, in a digitally connected world, these operations can scale up quickly and reach substantially larger populations than previously possible.

While the Russian interference in the 2016 US election has received considerable attention, Russia is not the only perpetrator and the US is not the only target.

But the Russians created a playbook which other countries can readily draw upon and adapt. The question remains as to who that might be in an Australian context.

171,Empty,2019-02-19T02:55:30Z,"Many believe Trudeau would never have entered politics if not for Butts, and might not have succeeded in winning Canada’s highest office without his support","When Gerald Butts resigned as Justin Trudeau’s closest and most important adviser Monday, quitting the job that made him the most powerful man in Ottawa other than the prime minister, he offered an official (and somewhat lengthy) explanation.

“The Prime Minister of Canada’s Office is much larger and more important than any of its staff,” he said. It was “in the best interests of the office and its important work for me to step away.”

He noted he has been accused by “anonymous sources” of having put pressure on former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould over SNC-Lavalin’s efforts to escape prosecution on corruption charges. He categorically denied the allegations: “Any accusation that I or the staff put pressure on the attorney general is simply not true.”

Which raises the most intriguing aspect of Butts’s departure. He is, it has been widely reported, one of the prime minister’s closest friends. They’ve been pals since university days at McGill. A lot of people believe Trudeau would never have entered politics if not for Butts, and might not have succeeded in winning Canada’s highest office without his support and advice.

And yet he’s quitting, not over some egregiously misappropriate decision or action, but over something he, Trudeau and the Liberal party insist never happened. Butts not only dismissed the suggestion he acted inappropriately, but maintained the opposite.

From my perspective, our relationship has always been defined by mutual respect, candour and an honest desire to work together.

“We honoured the unique role of the attorney general. At all times, I and those around me acted with integrity and a singular focus on the best interests of all Canadians.” Not only that, but he thought his relationship with Wilson-Raybould was fine. “From my perspective, our relationship has always been defined by mutual respect, candour and an honest desire to work together.”

That echoes Trudeau’s own assessment of the situation, which he admitted had left him perplexed. He said he was “surprised and disappointed” by her resignation. In no way did he put pressure on her to act against her will. If she felt otherwise, she should have come to him with her complaint. “The government of Canada did its job and to the clear public standards expected of it,” Trudeau maintained. “If anyone felt differently, they had an obligation to raise that with me. No one, including Jody, did that.”

All of which raises a very curious question. If Butts did absolutely nothing wrong; if neither he, the prime minister nor anyone else acted improperly in any manner; if this whole thing is, in essence, a figment of the imagination of Jody Wilson-Raybould, why is Butts stepping down and leaving the prime minister flailing for a solution to the worst crisis he’s faced since becoming prime minister?

Wilson-Raybould, remember, hasn’t said a word about the expanding disaster. When demoted from one of cabinet’s top posts, she kept her mouth closed about the reason, though she was clearly unhappy. There was no indication she planned to quit the new, lesser post as veterans affairs minister until Trudeau more or less forced her hand, suggesting that her continued presence in cabinet indicated she was OK with the way things were working out.

All the allegations, as Butts attested, have been anonymous whispers. There has been a growing growl of dissent among admirers of the former minister, and near-universal agreement in the media that the prime minister has badly mishandled the situation, alienating women and Indigenous Canadians, some of the voter demographics he’s worked hardest to please. But from the individual at the centre of it all, we still have yet to hear directly. Wilson-Raybould says she is getting legal advice on what she can say. Meanwhile, people close to her say she still plans to seek re-election in October, and as a Liberal.

Given the absence of anything resembling a smoking gun, it would seem sensible, therefore, to wait and hear what she has to say before breaking up the partnership that largely put the Liberals in power. The question of why Butts isn’t doing that, and why Trudeau agreed with his decision, remains dangling over the whole odd affair even as Butts packs his bags.

It usually takes governments several mandates to stumble into the sort of trouble the Liberals are in. Usually it comes from age, exhaustion and the accumulation of political baggage. Jean Chretien won three majorities before the sponsorship scandal caught up to him, and he had retired before voters eventually removed his successor from office. Stephen Harper was prime minister for nine years before voters decided a change was in order. Trudeau has been in power for just three-quarters of a mandate, and the Lavalin controversy is just the latest in a string of serious missteps. A determined optimist might note that Lavalin has at least diverted attention from the furor over the detention of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, but it’s difficult to see much comfort arising from that fact.

Meng continues to await a Canadian judge’s ruling on whether to extradite her to the U.S., a decision seemingly certain to spark a new eruption from either China or the U.S., the two forces between which Ottawa is being squeezed. That will be followed by a decision on whether to exclude Huawei from Canadian 5G networks, which, again, will upset either Washington or Beijing. Meanwhile, the independence of the director of public prosecutions has been raised in yet another case with potent political implications: Kathleen Roussel’s office issued a statement denying it was directed by the Privy Council Office in the prosecution of Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, who asserts he was railroaded by allegations involving a $668 million naval supply ship, and is due in court in August, just as federal election campaigning picks up speed.

It’s a daunting tally of challenges the Liberals face as they gear up for the election that’s just eight months away. And Trudeau must now confront it without the man rightly or wrongly considered his Svengali. All over something the prime minister and his friend insist never happened.

Even for Canada, it’s a strange sort of scandal.

172,Empty,2019-02-19T14:28:49Z,The three-term Independent senator is the 10th candidate to join the most diverse Democratic Party field in U.S. history,"Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders announced he will run again for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential race. The three-term Independent senator is the 10th candidate to join the most diverse Democratic Party field in U.S. history. That's very different from four years ago, when the 77-year-old Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley were Hillary Clinton's only Democratic challengers.

Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks with John Dickerson on ""CBS This Morning"" on Tuesday, Feb. 19, 2019. CBS News

Only on ""CBS This Morning,"" John Dickerson spoke to Sanders about taking another shot at the presidency, and why he believes this campaign will succeed:

JOHN DICKERSON: So Senator Sanders, you're gonna run for president?

BERNIE SANDERS: I am going to run for president, that's correct.

JOHN DICKERSON: What's gonna be different this time?

BERNIE SANDERS: We're gonna win. We are gonna also launch what I think is unprecedented-- in modern American history, and that is a grassroots movement, John, which will have at least one million people from every state in this country-- coming together to not only defeat Donald Trump, not only to win the Democratic nomination-- but also to lay the groundwork for transforming the economic and political life of this country. That's what's different.

JOHN DICKERSON: And that's your theory, which is that without the-- without the groundswell, without the grassroots you can't change the politics in Washington--

BERNIE SANDERS: That's exactly right. Look John, we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all, and the reason for that is the power of the insurance companies. We pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. That's the pa-- power of the pharmaceutical-- industry. We have a corrupt political system in which billionaires can contribute unlimited sums of money. That's the power of the top 1% and the billionaire class, and on and on it goes. So somebody could come before you and say, ""Look, I wanna do A and I wanna do B,"" and that's fine. But at the end of the day, the only way that real change takes place is when millions of people stand up, fight back, and say, ""Enough is enough. We're gonna have a government that works for all of us, not just the few.""

JOHN DICKERSON: This time you're running in a field with a lot more Democrats. How has the field changed since the last time you ran--

BERNIE SANDERS: Well, obviously it's a different campaign. Last time it was just Secretary Clinton, and now it will have who knows, ten, 15, 20 candidates.

JOHN DICKERSON: Doesn't that make it harder?

BERNIE SANDERS: In some ways it does. In some ways it makes it easier. When you're running against one person you know you gotta have 51% of the votes. Now who knows what you need, 30, 35%. But bottom line for me is I think-- it is absolutely imperative that Donald Trump-- be defeated, because I think it is unacceptable and un-American, to be frank with you, that we have a president who is a pathological liar. And it gives me no pleasure to say that, but it's true.

BERNIE SANDERS: We have a president who is a racist, who is a sexist, who is a xenophobe, who is doing what no president in our lifetimes has come close to do doing, and that is trying to divide us up. What presidents-- even conservative presidents, liberal presidents, they understand their function is to bring our people together. This guy is trying to divide us up. That has got to end.

JOHN DICKERSON: But all of your opponents will say, ""We've gotta get Donald Trump outta the White House."" That's not your distinguishing characteristic. So--

BERNIE SANDERS: That is not my distinguishing characteristic. I think what I am very proud of in-- in a sense, this campaign, John, is a continuation of what we did in 2016. You will recall-- you may recall that in 2016 many of the ideas that I talked about-- Medicare for all, raising the minimum wage-- to $15 an hour-- making public colleges and universities tuition-free-- spending at least $1 trillion and rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure-- criminal justice reform-- all of those ideas people would say, ""Oh Bernie, they're so radical.

BERNIE SANDERS: ""They are extreme. The American people just won't accept those ideas."" Well, you know what's happened in over three years? All of those ideas and many more are now part of the political mainstream-- and a majority of the American people now support 'em. So what this campaign is about is understanding that three years ago we began the political revolution. Now it's time to complete that revolution and to take those-- that vision and implement it into reality.

JOHN DICKERSON: So you're saying the party came your way?

BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I don't wanna say that. I think most people would say that.

JOHN DICKERSON: Is that your argument then against your competitors, which is, ""I was Medicare for all before Medicare for all was cool?""

BERNIE SANDERS: (LAUGH) I guess that's one way of looking at it. But it-- it's-- no. N-- I know many of the people, certainly the senators who are running, and without exception I am fond of them. They are, in some cases, my friends. I think maybe the-- the s-- what distinguishes-- this campaign from the others-- is not only that these are issues that, in fact, we did raise and-- and had to take on enormous opposition-- as we did. But also that what I understand from the bottom of my heart, that real change in this country will never come about unless there is struggle, unless millions of people stand up-- and fight for that change. We have three people in America today who own more wealth than the bottom half of the American-- society.

BERNIE SANDERS: We are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all. We pay the highest prices for prescription drugs, we have a dysfunctional-- child care system. We have a president who doesn't even acknowledge the reality of climate change, let alone take on the fossil fuel industry. Real change, John, is not gonna come when somebody gets to the White House and say, ""Oh gee, members of Congress, I think you should, you know, take on the hundreds of millions of dollars spent by the pharmaceutical company, do the right thing."" That's not how it's gonna happen. It happens when people stand up and fight back. That's the way that real change has always happened in this country.

JOHN DICKERSON: You used to talk about a revolution. That's what you're talking about here?

BERNIE SANDERS: That's right. In other words, w-- once again, it's not gonna happen inside the beltway. The only way that Congress and the White House is gonna move is when millions of people really do stand up and say, ""Enough is enough. We want a government--"" not just rhetoric; this is reality-- ""a government that works for all of us, not just wealthy campaign contributors.""

JOHN DICKERSON: You used to day-- or you-- you-- you once--

BERNIE SANDERS: Oh, this is dangerous. You're quoting me to myself. (LAUGH) All right. What did I say?

JOHN DICKERSON: You told Bob Schiefer-- you said, ""I think it's fair to-- to-- to say that I'm, perhaps, the most progressive member of the United States Senate."" That's the last time you ran. Is that still true?

BERNIE SANDERS: Yeah, I think so.

JOHN DICKERSON: Let's talk about one of those-- well lemme ask you this: Is the size of the-- the-- or is the revolutionary nature of each individual policy prescription you make, whether it's on climate change or health care-- is the size and boldness of it-- a signal of how serious you are? Because some of your competitors will be saying, ""Well, let's have Medicare for all but let's not do as much as Bernie Sanders wants."" Does that mean they're not as serious as you?

BERNIE SANDERS: I don't wanna-- look, these are my friends, these are good and serious people. So I'm not here to criticize my opponents, and I hope that the campaign that will take place-- within the Democratic-- primary pa-- process will be one on issues and not personal attacks. I think all that I'm saying here is that what I understand from the bottom of my heart is that at a time when, for example, the drug companies make billions and billions of dollars in profits, that they themselves will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to prevent a Medicare for all, you gotta take 'em on. So does-- do many members of Congress say, ""We oughta lower drug prices?"" Almost everybody recognizes that. But the-- you cannot make those changes unless there is a movement of people who make the Congress and the president an offer they cannot refuse.

JOHN DICKERSON: Here's why I ask: There is a debate in the Democratic party which you know so well, about whether your proposals are just too big for the system of government at it exists right now. They're just too large. You talk about a revolution, but other candidates are saying, ""We need a more-- yes-- increase the number of people who are covered by health care, yes, it's a right. But we can't go all the way to what Bernie Sanders is suggesting--""

BERNIE SANDERS: John, we are sitting here in Burlington, Vermont, my hometown. Get on your-- get in your car, go 50 miles north and you'll be in Quebec, Canada. Now, somehow or another in Canada, for a number of decades they have provided quality care to all people without out-of-pocket expenses. You go in for cancer therapy, you don't take out your wallet. And they do it for about 50% per capita of the cost that we spend.

BERNIE SANDERS: Now, if our friends in Canada can do it, if our friends in the U.K. can do it in a different way, if our friends in Scandinavia can provide quality health care to all of their people as a right for far less cost than we spend, you tell me why we can't do it. And I will tell you the answer. So I'm not gonna give you the opportunity; I'm gonna give you the answer. And that is, it is not a health care issue, it is a political issue, it's an economic issue, it's the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies. And I'm prepared to take them on.

JOHN DICKERSON: Lemme ask you a policy question and a political question about Medicare for all. When you go to Canada still two-thirds of the people who have the health care in Canada have some form of private help with that insurance. Your Medicare for all plan, as I understand it, has no private element to it.

BERNIE SANDERS: Well, if you want-- you know-- in Canada and what I want, is to cover all of the basic health care needs. If people want cosmetic surgery, fine, they can go to a private-- insurance. The other thing that we do which has not been talked about enough is I'm a strong defender of Medicare as it currently exists. But Medicare today does not cover-- dental care, it does not cover eyeglasses, it does not cover hearing aids. And that is something that many seniors our concerned about. Our legislation will provide that coverage.

JOHN DICKERSON: Well, but lemme ask you, on your Medicare for all you-- have talked about the fact that polls show 70% are in favor of Medicare for all. But that number drops to 37% if somebody hears private insurance is going to go away, which is what your--

BERNIE SANDERS: Well--

JOHN DICKERSON: --which is what your plan offers. So I guess my question is, you're offering something that the polling shows people can get very spooked very quickly about.

BERNIE SANDERS: No. Yeah, but that's because we're gonna be taking on the insurance companies and the drug companies who are gonna spend a whole lotta money distorting what we believe in. For example, they're gonna say people, ""You're gonna lose your current health insurance (UNINTEL) employment."" Yeah, but you're gonna have the same exact doctor, you're gonna have more freedom of choice under our proposal than you have under the current proposals. So there's a lotta misinformation that's going around on this issue. The bottom line is the average middle class family will save money-- will spend less money on health care, will have more choice, and have broader coverage than is currently the case.

JOHN DICKERSON: So the other b-- the other challenge to your m-- to your health care plan will be cost. People-- you can explain it to them but there w-- people will say, ""My goodness, there's no way this is-- everybody's gonna get covered and there gonna are gonna be--""

BERNIE SANDERS: But John, this has--

JOHN DICKERSON: --you know, some of the estimates that come out--

BERNIE SANDERS: No, I need you and the media to help us explain--

JOHN DICKERSON: --trillions of dollars--

BERNIE SANDERS: --the truth. We spend twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians, all right? And the reason is we waste an enormous amount of money in administration and in an incredibly dysfunctional and complicated system. Our proposal will cost the American people less than the current dysfunctional system. There are some estimates, by the way, that over the next ten years the current system, if not changed, could run up to $50 trillion.

BERNIE SANDERS: Now, here's where the dishonesty comes in. All right, people say, ""Bernie Sanders wants to raise your taxes."" What they forget to tell ya is that Bernie Sanders is gonna do away with all of your private health-- private health insurance premiums. You're a family of four, John. The average family now is paying $28,000 a year for health insurance. That's gonna end. No more out-of-pocket expenses, no more deductibles. The cost of prescription drugs is gonna go down. We expand the kinds of coverage available for senior citizens. It's a good deal.

JOHN DICKERSON: But that transition, which is essentially transitioning from private premiums you pay now into some federal system-- just that alone is a massive transformation of the-- of-- of the federal system, which just that part of it is-- I mean, you're asking pe--

BERNIE SANDERS: Let's not go l-- let's not go all that crazy. Currently we have Medicare, right, for the elderly. Guess what? Medicare's probably the most popular health insurance program in America. We have Medicaid. That's a pretty popular program. We have the... Veterans Administration, which if you talk to veterans, is a pretty popular program. We are already spending a whole lotta money on public health programs. So all we are doing is taking a popular program that most seniors are very proud of, Medicare, and we're expanding it over a four-year period to all of our people.

JOHN DICKERSON: What happens to the 180 million people in the private insurance market now?

BERNIE SANDERS: They will continue to be able to go to the doctors they want, the hospitals they want. The color of their insurance card will change.

JOHN DICKERSON: And they will no longer be private; it'll be a public system?

BERNIE SANDERS: It'll be Medicare.

JOHN DICKERSON: Right. So y-- I mean, you're adding 180 million people to Medicare, so that'll take a little doing.

BERNIE SANDERS: Look, back in 1965, I think, Medicare was established and everybody said, ""Oh my God, it's impossible. This is communism, this is taking away everybody's freedom."" Today Medicare is a very popular program, Medicaid is a popular program. Yeah, so it's gonna take an effort. But I think-- two points, John, on this issue. Number one, we as Americans have gotta ask ourselves, ""How come every other major country guarantees health care to all people at far lower costs per capita than we do?""

BERNIE SANDERS: That's number one. Number two, fundamental question, ""Is health care a human right or is it not?"" If you have the money, your kid is sick, you can get great health care. You don't have the money, your kid is sick. You're in trouble. Or you may go bankrupt after you come out of an expensive-- hospital procedure. We can do better as a nation.

JOHN DICKERSON: Quick question about the politics of this. The Democratic party just benefited from a revolutionary response at the ballot box, and winning 40 seats in the House. In the Senate the Democrats didn't do as well because of the structure of the way it works.

BERNIE SANDERS: We had a lotta seats, you know, that we had to defend.

JOHN DICKERSON: Of course. But that's part of the structure of the way politics works. My question to you is, you talk about a revolution. You just had a revolution in 2018 essentially, and it was unable to get past the structural system in the Senate--

BERNIE SANDERS: All right, John-- John, revolutions do not happen overnight. One of the revolutions that I am very proud of-- it's not just that many of the ideas that we brought forth in 2016 are now supported by a strong majority of the American people, it's that we are getting more people, ordinary people, young people participating in the political process. And I think the future of the Democratic party, frankly, is bringing young people-- black, and white, and Latino, and Native American, and Asian-American into the political process. And I'm very proud (and we're gonna build on this) that in the last campaign-- you know, we lost. We got 46% of the pledged delegates. But we won more votes from young people than Clinton and Trump did combined.

JOHN DICKERSON: Does your success hurt in the marketplace of ideas? Which is to say, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez can talk about a Green New Deal and is getting a lotta coverage for that, but that shrinks the amount of time that people are maybe paying attention to Bernie Sanders or some other idea. Does it change the marketplace of ideas--

BERNIE SANDERS: Quite the contrary, quite the contrary. The fact that we have more voices out there talking, in this case, about the existential threat to our country and the world, which is what climate change is, and the absolute need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy-- and by the way, when we do that we create millions of good-paying jobs. And we are gonna pay attention to our brothers and sisters in the fossil fuel industry who will be hurt by this transition; we are not gonna leave them on the side of the road.

JOHN DICKERSON: You were supportive of the fact that Amazon pulled out of New York City, that it-- that that deal did not go through.

BERNIE SANDERS: I was, and-- but I was also supportive-- (LAUGH) and-- and maybe at the lead-- of telling Amazon, owned by the wealthiest person in the world, that they cannot continue to pay their employees $9 or $10 or $11 an hour; they have to raise the minimum wage-- their minimum wage to 11 bucks an hour, which as you'll recall-- happened. We did that with Disney-- as well. What you have-- and with a company like Amazon is-- a very profitable company owned by the wealthiest guy in the world, who among other things we recently learned paid zero federal taxes. So you're a worker out there, you're makin' 40,000 or 50,000 bucks a year. You pay more in taxes than Amazon did, that made billions of dollars in profit. And what I did not like about what they did to New York-- that's New York's decision, not mine.

BERNIE SANDERS: But I don't like a powerful company kinda playing off one state or one city against another. ""All right, you're-- Los Angeles. What are you gonna give me? You're New York City. What are you gonna give me? How much corporate welfare are you gonna give me? Because I have some jobs."" I don't think that's a good way to do business in America.

JOHN DICKERSON: Are corporate tax rates gonna go up under Bernie Sanders?

BERNIE SANDERS: Absolutely.

JOHN DICKERSON: How high?

BERNIE SANDERS: Now, I can't give you-- yeah, that's something we gotta think about. But let's deal with this-- I will tell you this very frankly, John: I worry very much that in our country-- you ain't gonna hear anyone else tell you this. You're not gonna hear it on CBS too much, so-- is that this country is moving toward an oligarchic form of society, and that means that we have a small number of billionaires-- Jeff Bezos being one-- who have enormous economic and political power.

BERNIE SANDERS: And that's why I've introduced a very progressive estate tax to deal with that issue. But at a time when we have so many social needs-- when we have children in this country who are going hungry, when we have veterans who are sleeping on the street, when we have to combat climate change, you know what? Yeah, we are gonna ask the billionaires and the wealthiest people to start paying their fair share of the-- taxes. No apologies on my part.

JOHN DICKERSON: What's your opinion of capitalism these days?

BERNIE SANDERS: Wha-- pardon me?

JOHN DICKERSON: What's your opinion of capitalism at these-- at its--

BERNIE SANDERS: Look, I think-- what we see-- in this country and around the world is a lotta great entrepreneurs who come up with some great ideas and some great products. But I think what is happening is some of these folks-- we-- have a system which allows these people to accumulate huge amounts of-- income and wealth. So when I talk about democratic socialism you're not talkin' about the government running the local grocery store or anything else like that. What we are saying is that in America-- and by the way, Franklin Delano Roosevelt talked about this way back in the 1940s, that people are entitled not only to certain constitutional political rights, they are entitled to economic rights.

BERNIE SANDERS: So if somebody wants to call me-- a radical, okay, here it is: I believe that people are inherently entitled to health care. I believe people are entitled to get the best education they can. I believe that people are entitled to live in a clean environment. People are entitled to have decent-paying jobs. That's what I believe.

JOHN DICKERSON: The president mentioned socialism in his State of the Union Address.

BERNIE SANDERS: Yeah, I heard that.

JOHN DICKERSON: What's he going after there?

BERNIE SANDERS: Oh look, he's gonna appeal-- he's gonna lie-- he's gonna say, ""Bernie Sanders wants-- the United States to become Venezuela."" Bernie Sanders does not wanna have the United States become the horrific-- economic situation that unfortunately exists in Venezuela right now. What Bernie Sanders wants is to learn from countries around the world. Bernie Sanders wants to learn from Finland in terms of why they have the highest-quality public educational system in the world, learn from s-- Sweden and Denmark why they have virtually free child care and high quality free-- health care for their people, why other countries are doing a better job in dealing with income and wealth inequality than we are. So you got a president who is a demagogue, a president who is leading us in an authoritarian direction. I would hope that the American people don't believe too much of what he says.

JOHN DICKERSON: Democrats, you know this well, come to you and say, ""You're not a Democrat. Why are you running in the Democratic primary?""

BERNIE SANDERS: Well, first of all, I am a member of the Democratic leadership. I've been in the Democratic caucus. I am part of the leadership of the Senate. I have been-- part of the Democratic-- caucus in the House for 16 years. And I'll-- I'll-- I will say this-- in terms of that-- so-- and I have knocked my brains out, running around the country to help Democrats win-- the House, to help governors win-- Democratic governors win their seats.

BERNIE SANDERS: But this is what I will also say-- if you look at polling in this country what you find is that a whole lotta people are dissatisfied with both the Democratic and Republican parties. Usually the Republicans come out lowest, Democrats-- and more and more people are seeing themselves as independents. So if-- if the Democratic party is gonna do well in the future I think they have to reach out to those Independents, including, by the way, a lot of young people, a lotta people of color, and bring them into the Democratic party. And I think I'm in a good position to do that.

JOHN DICKERSON: The revolution you're talking about, does it require making a moral case about wealth in America? In other words, not just that it shouldn't be concentrated, but that the people who are concentrated with that wealth are-- are bad people--

BERNIE SANDERS: No.

JOHN DICKERSON: That's part of what the-- fueled the uprising in the Gilded Age against-- concentrated wealth--

BERNIE SANDERS: It's not-- look, I-- I wouldn't use it that way. I mean, there are some bad people who are poor, there are bad people who are rich, there are bad people who are middle class, there are bad people who are black, and white, and Latino, everything else. I don't-- I don't look at it that way. What I look at it is-- is we have created a system which is basically out of control. And that system is that you have billionaire corporations-- billion-- corporations like Amazon that make billions in profit, don't pay a nickel in taxes. You have three people who own more wealth than the bottom half of American society. That is the issue. It's not those three people; it is that we have allowed that to take place. So I got-- we got veteran sleeping out on the street, we have kids who can't afford to go to college, you got 30 million people who have no health care, and then you got three people who own more wealth than the bottom half of America. That is wrong. That's morally wrong, in my view. That is bad economics.

JOHN DICKERSON: The system in Washington that you're familiar with, even though you're tryin' to run a revolution from the outside, is it possible to have bipartisan, ""Let's reason together--"" in Washington? Or do you need to do things like get rid of the filibuster, to break through some of the systemic things that block both Republicans and Democrats?

BERNIE SANDERS: No, I'm not crazy about getting rid of the filibuster. But I-- I think the problem is people often talk about the lack of-- comity-- and the anger. The real issue is that you have in Washington a system which is dominated-- by wealthy campaign contributors. Who in their right mind-- so you go out, do a poll, all right?

BERNIE SANDERS: Here's a suggestion. CBS: do a poll. Do you think it is a good idea to give $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top 1% and private corporations, and then cut social security, Medicare, and Medicaid? That's the Republican agenda. What percentage of the American people support that-- 5%, 10%? Nobody. And yet that's what happens. Why? Because billionaires and wealthy campaign contr-- contributors significantly control what goes on in Washington.

BERNIE SANDERS: And that is why, among many other things, we have to overturn Citizens United, we have to do away with this horrible voter suppression. Every American, regardless of your political view, should be outraged that you have governors and attorney generals in this country tryin' to keep people from voting because of their color or because of their economic status. Outrageous.

JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about a theory that Howard Schultz-- Howard Schultz has now said he would not run as an Independent if the Democrats moder-- nominated a moderate--

BERNIE SANDERS: Oh, isn't that nice. But you raise a good thing. (CLAP) Why is Howard Schultz on every television station in this country? Why are you quoting Howard Schultz? Because he's a billionaire, right? There are a lotta people I know personally who work hard for a living, who make $40,000, $50,000 a year who know a lot more about politics than, in all due respect, does Mr. Schultz. But because we have a corrupt political system anybody who is a billionaire who can throw a lot of TV ads on television suddenly becomes very, very credible. So what Mr. Schultz-- what is he, blackmailing the Democratic party? If you don't nominate Bernie Sanders he's not gonna run? Well, I don't think we should succumb to that kinda blackmail.

JOHN DICKERSON: The other reason-- is that he represents an argument that some people make, which is, ""If you're worried about Donald Trump, the Democratic party to win voters in various parts of the country needs to pick somebody who is not so radical."" That's also what his theory represents--

BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I think his deeper theory is, ""Hey, I'm a billionaire. Leave me alone. And-- let me make as much as money as I can without paying my fair share of taxes, and let me continue to have undue political influence."" Which you are quoting me. Here is a billionaire-- no one's ever heard of this guy, or not many people have. He's a billionaire and he's thinkin' of running for president, suddenly he's a very famous guy. That's-- that is a problem with our political system.

JOHN DICKERSON: You'll be 79 when you're inaugurated.

BERNIE SANDERS: Yes.

JOHN DICKERSON: That's old, by the standards of presidents.

BERNIE SANDERS: Yes. (UNINTEL)--

JOHN DICKERSON: Should people be concerned about that?

BERNIE SANDERS: I think-- you know, when we look at-- at people w-- whether they're old or they're young, you gotta look at the totality of-- of the person. I'm sure you have bumped into people who are 90 who do great work, (CLAP) you have bumped into people who are 45 or 50 you gotta wake up 'cause they're falling asleep all of the time. I have been blessed, thank God-- I'm gonna knock-- (KNOCKING) this is wood, I'm gonna knock on it-- with-- with good health and with good energy. I was a cross-country runner, a long distance runner when I was a kid and I've been runnin' hard-- in a sense-- since then.

BERNIE SANDERS: So you know, I think as a nation, as we try to-- stand up and-- and oppose all forms of discrimination, whether it is racism, or sexism, or homophobia, or Islamophobia, whatever it may be, I think we gotta take a hard look at ageism as well-- as well. Judge a person on, you know, whether you like them, whether their ideas make sense, whether you think they can do the job. I-- I think that's how we should look-- at p-- at-- at-- at people running for office-- not just on one criteria, about age.

JOHN DICKERSON: We're out of time, but I got a couple more questions for ya. There has been talk b-- Andrew McCabe was the deputy-- director of the F.B.I. He has a book out, he talked about the 25th amendment with respect to this president. You're thinking of being president. Is it wise for the institution of the presidency to have-- have kind of informal talk about the 25th amendment? A lotta progressives like the idea. Is that good and healthy for presidents--

BERNIE SANDERS: Look, Trump has-- you know, look, all that I will-- I will answer that question by saying this: There are right now a number of investigations, most significantly the Mueller investigation-- looking, in this case, whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Yeah, I think it's a little bit-- preliminary to be giving you answers before we see the results of those investigations.

JOHN DICKERSON: But should be-- people be talking about the 25th amendment?

BERNIE SANDERS: Again-- I don't talk about it.

JOHN DICKERSON: Foreign policy. You wanted America out of a lot of the wars that it was engaged in. Donald Trump wants that too. You said about North Korea that it was-- that it was a good-- first step-- to deesc-- a positive step to deescalate tensions. It would seem like Donald Trump's foreign policy is in sync with your view--

BERNIE SANDERS: No, it's not, in-- in this sense. Trump has gone-- it appears, has gone out of his way to antagonize our long-term allies. I mean, to insult our Canadian neighbors, to insult Germany-- the United Kingdom, France is, you know, almost incomprehensible. On the other hand-- I have called for-- you're absolutely right. I-- I think-- the idea that we are gonna withdraw troops-- from-- Syria or from Afghanistan-- is-- is the right thing, but it has to be done not through a tweet.

BERNIE SANDERS: This is not easy stuff. You can't turn your backs on your allies, you can't leave people in danger. So the idea of getting out of wars that we have been in for a very long time is good, but it has got to be done in the right way. It has to be done with our allies, not through t-- tweets.

JOHN DICKERSON: Last question: There were charges in your last campaign that women felt-- there was discrimination against them, that there was sexism. You met with some of those former staffers. What did you learn?

BERNIE SANDERS: I learned that was true. And-- it-- it-- it breaks my heart. And-- you know, our campaign kind of exploded; we went from a few people to a lotta people. And I will be very honest-- in telling you that t-- in retrospect, some of the people that were hired should not have been hired and some women went through experiences that they should not have. But lemme also say this-- in my 2018 campaign for reelection to the United States Senate from Vermont and in this campaign for president, we are going to have the strongest protocols-- to protect women and anybody else against-- any form of harassment. We are gonna be training every employee who works for us-- and we're gonna give people who feel that they've been harassed the opportunity to talk to people outside of the campaign. So this has been an issue that has upset me-- and we're gonna rectify it in this campaign.

JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Senator Sanders, thank you.

173,Empty,2019-02-21T21:49:52Z,Premier Blaine Higgs says he may have crossed a partisan line with comments he made during a taxpayer-funded trip to Saskatchewan to promote pipelines and the energy sector.,"Premier Blaine Higgs says he may have crossed a partisan line with comments he made during a taxpayer-funded trip to Saskatchewan to promote pipelines and the energy sector.

Higgs estimates that the government spent about $5,000 to fly him and a staffer to the province last weekend to attend a rally in the town of Moosomin, where he endorsed federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer as a future prime minister.

The event was one stop on a cross-country trek by a caravan of oil industry supporters and activists who argue the federal Liberal government isn't supporting Western Canada's energy sector.

""We can't seem to get it across to the federal government, but we have a future prime minister here who's going to get it across to the federal government,"" Higgs said at the podium, gesturing at Scheer.

Higgs spoke to support the caravan and to talk up his desire to revive the cancelled Energy East pipeline.

But his endorsement of Scheer appears at odds with the practice that government-funded trips not be overtly partisan.

""I guess that's a valid point,"" Higgs told reporters Thursday when asked about the comment. ""Should I be doing that or not? I've generally said what I believe in and what I think is going to get results.

He added: ""I'll probably keep doing that and I'll be governed by what I feel is right for the province and what's necessary to move our country forward. Maybe I'll cross the edge a time or two. It's possible.""

Opposition critics

Liberal MLA Roger Melanson said Higgs should not have been promoting Scheer ahead of the federal election during a trip funded by taxpayers.

""There's a really fine line between going to Saskatchewan and wanting to promote pipelines, and going to Saskatchewan with all the Conservative leadership of the country,"" he said.

Liberal MLA Roger Melanson says taxpayers should not have to pay for trips that are 'perceived as partisan.' (CBC)

""I don't think taxpayers should pay for any trips that are perceived as partisan for the Conservative party of New Brunswick or even of Canada.""

Green Leader David Coon said the premier's partisan remark is at odds with the image he has tried to cultivate.

""He says he's not a politician, and politics gets in the way of progress. … but at the same time he's very committed to working with [Conservative premiers] for a pipeline that goes against climate change action.""

Rally speech

Higgs spoke for about six minutes at the rally in Moosomin, talking about his knowledge of the energy sector gained during three decades at Irving Oil and his desire to see more Canadian oil refined at the company's Saint John refinery.

He also mentioned former potash mineworkers he'd met who had moved to Saskatchewan for work and told the crowd he'd be visiting one of his daughters who now lives in Moose Jaw.

The convoy left Red Deer, Alta., on Feb. 14, bound for Ottawa. It was billed as a pro-oil sector caravan, organized by opponents of a federal bill that would overhaul the federal approval process for major energy projects.

Some participants have also adopted anti-immigration rhetoric, something Higgs said Thursday he wanted no part of.

""I'm certainly not in that camp,"" he said. ""That's not the reason I was there at all. We're not supporting any of that activity. Our focus was purely on the energy sector.""

Moosomin was chosen as the location of the rally because it was where a major lateral line would have fed crude oil from Manitoba and the United States into the main Energy East line.

Green Party Leader David Coon says endorsing Andrew Scheer on a taxpayer-funded trip is at odds with the image Higgs has tried to cultivate. (James West/Canadian Press)

Melanson said if Higgs wants to promote the revival of Energy East, he should be travelling to Quebec, where opposition to the project remains strong. Higgs said he plans to do that.

TransCanada Corp. cancelled its Energy East application to the National Energy Board in 2017, citing new environmental criteria the board planned to apply to the project.

Former pipeline executives and economists say the business case for the project is now dead, though Higgs continues to talk about finding a way to revive it.

TransCanada is now applying for approval to ship larger volumes of natural gas from Alberta to Eastern Canada. That would use up much of the excess pipeline capacity it would have converted to ship crude oil as part of Energy East.

Given that Energy East was cancelled, ""I don't blame them a bit,"" Higgs said Thursday. ""I would be doing exactly the same thing.""

But he said if New Brunswick can develop its own shale gas industry, something he's encouraging, that could once again free up capacity on TransCanada's line for oil shipments.

The Liberals officially support Energy East but Melanson said that with TransCanada moving on to other projects, Higgs's lobbying may be futile.

""We can't stop the premier from trying to promote it, but at the end of the day we'll need to have a private-sector proponent that wants to invest the dollars for this pipeline to be built, and today we don't,"" he said.",Higgs admits he may have crossed line promoting Scheer on taxpayers' money,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/higgs-partisanship-andrew-scheer-tax-funded-1.5028522

Conservatives’ scandals are like ‘we used orphans to build napalm to dump on Algonquin Park’ but every Liberal scandal is like ‘to understand the depth of wrongdoing, first understand the role of the Deputy Minister of Fisheries.’” So said a @matttomic on social media, expressing the deflated expectations of Canadians hoping for a hot political story — Canada became a division of Lockheed Martin in 2011 and no one noticed! Misogynist Jason Kenney’s real name is Janice! — to give them a break from the Trump news onslaught that began in 2016 and is eating their ears.

Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick waits to appear before the Justice Committee meeting in Ottawa on Thursday. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

The SNC-Lavalin matter already sounded like puff pastry when it first appeared and now it is a crumb, a particle. The allegation was that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his staff were concerned less about legal niceties than about huge job losses should SNC-Lavalin be prosecuted over dodgy money in Libya — is there any other kind? — and perhaps lose 10 years of federal contracts. Out of concern for the public good, they may have mentioned this to the justice minister/attorney-general, who can decide, if she chooses, to defer corporate prosecutions. This whole matter is down to whether they talked to her forcefully or gently. Did they hint or did they hammer? Who knows? More importantly, who cares?

She should have foreseen the catastrophe of grovelling to the Americans by arresting Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in B.C. to help them pressure China. She did not. So it was even more important for her to consult the PMO.

This is not a scandal. It is not even an anecdote. It is the Ottawa equivalent of the Daily Mail’s claim of a national backlash against Meghan’s New York baby shower. It does not exist. Which brings me to the man who explained why it didn’t exist. He is Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant, who owned the room at the justice committee. He spoke without hesitancy, with clarity and candour, about a danger sensed by many Canadians.

Article Continued Below

“I worry about my country right now, I’m deeply concerned about my country right now and its politics and where it’s headed. I worry about foreign interference in the upcoming election and we’re working hard on that. I worry about the rising tide of incitements to violence, when people use terms like ‘treason’ and ‘traitor’ in open discourse. Those are the words that lead to assassination. I’m worried that someone is going to be shot in this country this year during the political campaign.” I too have worried about Trudeau’s town halls being a danger to him. I’d worry about Conservative leader Andrew Scheer’s if he had any. Scheer always looks like a man who has just put eyedrops in and is in that blinking transitory state. Pleasant enough, he is easily led into traps laid by the extreme far-right. Why else would he have appeared with the racist yellow vests on Parliament Hill? Wernick, who has served under many prime ministers, abhorred yellow-vest-style remarks by a Saskatchewan senator that would “incite people to drive trucks over people, after what happened in Toronto last summer” simply because they were Liberal. “I worry about the trolling from the vomitorium of social media entering the open media arena,” he said. We do too. Wernick said he most worries about Canadians “losing faith in the institutions of governance in this country” and doubting that Canada is still, as Chrystia Freeland has put it, a rule-of-law country. He then crisply explained the SNC-Lavalin matter. The rule of law is safe, he concluded. The discussions were appropriate and ethical. There is no two-tiered justice. Deferred prosecution agreements can be rationally applied. In other words, there is no there there. I agree. The SNC-Lavalin matter was a media creation in an election year, possibly done inadvertently to gin things up. It became a sly collective patchwork of insinuation. And now that Wernick has explained the complex role of the Deputy Minister of Fisheries, we Canadians can see that it just doesn’t hold up.

TOP STORIES

Partisan politics

New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs called Federal Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer 'future prime minister' at a pro-oil industry rally in Moosomin, Sask. (CBC)

New Brunswick taxpayers paid $5,000 to fly Premier Blaine Higgs and a staffer to Saskatchewan last week to promote pipelines and the energy sector. But during the trip, the premier attended a rally where he endorsed federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer as a future prime minister.

As Jacques Poitras reports, Higgs's comments appear at odds with the convention that government-funded trips not be overtly partisan.

""Should I be doing that or not? I've generally said what I believe in and what I think is going to get results,"" Higgs said.

Opposition MLAs criticized the partisan display.

""I don't think taxpayers should pay for any trips that are perceived as partisan for the Conservative party of New Brunswick or even of Canada,"" said Liberal MLA Roger Melanson.

Speaking of pipelines, TransCanada Corp., the company behind the abandoned Energy East proposal, is asking federal regulators for permission to ship natural gas from Western Canada through existing pipelines to Eastern markets, including Atlantic Canada.

Mystery drones

Residents in the Bear Island area say drones have been flying low over their homes. (Submitted)

It's a bird. It's a drone. It's a student from the flight college?

People who live in the Bear Island and Lake George area were alarmed by the presence of what was thought to be large drones flying close to their homes for months. The mystery UFOs — they were literally unidentified flying objects — would appear at night, hover low and circle houses and vehicles, residents said.

The machines raised concerns for privacy and questions about enforcing regulations on operating drones.

Well, with the help of the Mounties, we may have gotten to the bottom of the case. They were planes. RCMP confirmed that on at least one occasion the drone was actually a small plane from a flight school.

But not everyone is convinced.

Cannabis Corner

The government announced Brian Harriman's resignation on Friday. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC)

This week in cannabis-related news:

Brian Harriman, CEO and president of NB Liquor and Cannabis NB, has resigned from his post to take the job as chief operating officer of Sundial Growers, a privately held cannabis producer in Calgary.

His resignation comes amid low cannabis sales, employee layoffs, store closures and supply shortages just months after legalization.

In Saint John, the president of Crosby's Molasses announced he's starting a cannabis edibles business. James Crosby says the company, EYG Consumables, has applied for a licence with Health Canada and purchased a property in the McAllister Industrial Park.

Legalized edibles are expected to hit retail shelves later this year.

In St. Stephen, the owner of a proposed aquaponics farm shifted his vision from farming fish and ""leafy green produce"" to, well, another, more potent kind of leafy green produce. Tanner Stewart will use his system to grow cannabis while farming tilapia.

""You're creating an ecosystem essentially,"" Stewart said.

""It's plants and animals living together in an ecosystem providing what they need to each other.""

Climate emergency

Edmundston Mayor Cyrille Simard says the city's declaration of a climate emergency won't just be a symbolic move, but affect policy and long-term planning decisions. (CBC)

What do Vancouver, Halifax and Edmundston have in common? Besides producing celebrities (#RochVoisineForever), the cities have declared a climate emergency.

Mayor Cyrille Simard said the declaration, which calls for accelerating the shift to greener forms of energy, reflects the impact climate change is already having on the community.

""We see the impact on the ground, we see the cost of that,"" he said, pointing to torrential rains, flooding that's worse and more frequent, and invasive species.

He hopes other municipalities will follow.

The flood zone

Flooding along Route 105 near Jemseg, a community southeast of Fredericton in 2018. (Philip Drost/CBC)

The spring freshet is just around the corner, and officials, communities and now an insolvency trustee are urging folks to be prepared for another potentially disastrous flood.

In Jemseg, a group of volunteers will be hosting an all-day workshop to discuss ways to prepare for future flooding. The workshop, which starts at 8:30 a.m. Saturday at the Jemseg Lions Centre, will give residents the chance to recognize vulnerable areas of their communities and start thinking up solutions and prepare for another flood event.

The area was devastated last spring when the St. John River and Grand Lake swelled to historic levels.

Are you a waterfront resident? Be sure to read the handy financial advice offered by Kristi Neilsen, a Saint John-based licensed insolvency trustee.

Neilsen touches on creating a financial cushion, insurance providers and tips to ensure you're protected if a flood comes.

In Nauwigewauk, the province is moving ahead with plans to raise the only road onto Darlings Island — a road that's often flooded during the spring freshet.

But, as Connell Smith reports, in December the province purchased a home for $295,000 that was built on the flood-prone road three years earlier with approval from the province.

The cost of cancer

Marilyn Steele before her cancer diagnosis. (Submitted by Lesley Steele)

On Dec. 7, Marilyn Steele was told she could die of a rare cancer in three months. Her doctor said surgery wasn't an option in New Brunswick or Nova Scotia, so the Nashwaak Bridge woman headed to Florida to undergo the procedure.

She accumulated $144,000 in medical bills, and now her family faces the prospect of selling their house.

""We're not rich people,"" she said. ""We're both retired on a small pension. And the only asset that we have is our home. And it's a very modest three-bedroom bungalow in the country.""

A spirited musher

Remy Leduc won the Challenge of the North Award for his performance in his first Yukon Quest race. (Akkada Kennel Facebook page, Yukon Quest/Whitney McLaren)

New Brunswick's Remy Leduc may not have won the renowned Yukon Quest, a 1,000-mile dog-sledding race from Whitehorse to Alaska; he was just happy to cross the finish the line.

His efforts during his first Quest earned him the Challenge of the North Award, which is given to the musher who best exemplifies the spirit of the race.

He's already planning for next year's race.

Its efforts have led to a scandal that’s led to the resignation of a government minister and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s most trusted aide.

The main door to the Office of the Prime Minister and Privy Council office is seen in Ottawa, Monday, Feb.18, 2019. The legal tool at the heart of the scandal that erupted in the Prime Minister's Office was far more unassuming last year on its way into Canadian law. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

The Montreal-based engineering firm faces legal trouble over allegations it paid millions of dollars in bribes to get government business in Libya, which would be a crime under Canadian law. But last fall the prosecutor’s office declined to send SNC-Lavalin an invitation to negotiate, which means the criminal case against the company will proceed. If it’s convicted, the company faces the possibility of a multi-year ban from bidding on public contracts — a key part of its business. Here are some questions and answers on Canada’s remediation agreements:

Article Continued Below

What are remediation agreements for? The Criminal Code says a remediation agreement aims to denounce a company’s wrongdoing, hold it accountable with penalties, force it to respect the law by putting in place corrective measures and encourage voluntary disclosure of illegal activities. A primary goal is to limit the damage to individuals, such as a company’s employees, who had nothing to do with the offence — while punishing those involved in the wrongdoing. The agreements would help corporations avoid a criminal conviction that could lead to a ban of up to a decade from bidding on public contracts, including lucrative infrastructure projects. How did Canada get them? Other countries have similar regimes. They include the United States, where the deals are called “deferred prosecution agreements,” or DPAs. The Liberal government held public consultations on the idea in the fall of 2017 and, in its 2018 budget, it said it intended to introduce legislation to allow remediation agreements soon. The budget, however, offered few details. Months later, the proposed amendment was quietly included in the government’s 582-page budget legislation. The move came as a surprise to MPs — including at least one Liberal. A few members of the all-party parliamentary committee studying the bill last May expressed concerns. They said they were first made aware of the push to create DPAs only after it was brought to their attention by a Justice Department official as part of her testimony. The remediation agreement regime received royal assent last June.

What does a company have to do to be eligible to negotiate an agreement? The prosecutor can invite a company that has allegedly committed an offence into a negotiation if the case meets a number of conditions. First of all, they can only be applied to economic crimes, like bribery or fraud. They cannot be used in a situation where there’s been serious bodily harm or death, or in cases that resulted in injury to national security or national defence. The agreements also can’t be used in cases where the offence is connected to a criminal or terrorist organization. The prosecutor must also believe there’s a reasonable possibility the firm will be convicted and that the case is in the public’s interest. Finally, the attorney general must consent to the negotiation.

Article Continued Below

What are some of the potential benefits of DPAs? Anita Anand, a law professor at University of Toronto, said she believes they can be useful legal tools to address corporate misdeeds while taking into account the needs of shareholders, employees and creditors “It is wholly unfair to punish these many stakeholders because of the bad behaviour of a few individuals,” Anand wrote in an email. “In other words, a few bad apples should not spoil the bunch.” Instead, she said, once wrongdoers have been identified, removed and sanctioned then corporations should be dealt with under the same approach taken in other areas of criminal law — with rehabilitation as one of the goals of punishment Jennifer Quaid, an assistant professor of law at the University of Ottawa, said Canadian firms lobbied for a deferred-prosecution regime for competitive reasons because the United States and other jurisdictions had them. The argument, she said, is that Canadian companies, if barred from public contracts, would be put at a disadvantage compared to American multinationals that avoided convictions with settlements. Quaid also noted remediation can be a positive for prosecutors, especially because economic crimes are hard to investigate and prosecute. What are some of the potential down sides? Mike Koehler, an associate professor of law at Southern Illinois University, said DPAs should not be a way for prosecutors to avoid difficult cases. “It shouldn’t be easy to convict anybody,” he said. Koehler, who believes Canada should have never adopted remediation agreements, argued that they’ve had little success as a deterrent in the United States. “Looking to the U.S. example, if these were achieving deterrence, why do we have so many repeat corporate offenders?” he said. Patricia Adams, executive director of the Probe International think-tank and watchdog, said DPAs allow prosecutors to make decisions behind closed doors about whether a company should be prosecuted or not, which robs the judicial system of transparency. “What they essentially do is they turn the prosecutor into the prosecutor, the judge and the jury,” said Adams. “Because of that they are undermining the rule of law — they are essentially political instruments.” Quaid, at the University of Ottawa, said the criticisms include the perception that remediation can seem like an “automatic pass” for companies and that they’re designed for larger firms that employ lots of people, and not so much for smaller players. “At the end of the day, this is accepting a reality that when big players with significant economic impact in a region get in trouble there are a lot of collateral consequences and sometimes we may decide that collectively preventing those collateral consequences is going to trump the normal response,” she said. “A lot of people don’t like that kind of messy, less-than-perfect justice, but that’s the reality that we have to live with.”",DPAs: Meet the legal tool central to the Prime Minister’s Office controversy,Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/02/19/dpas-meet-the-legal-tool-central-to-the-prime-ministers-office-controversy.html

Gerald Butts, Trudeau's principal secretary and long-time friend, announced he would be resigning due to a scandal that has rocked the Trudeau government. The departure instantly provided more fuel to the political turmoil that has engulfed the prime minister's office ever since a report in the Globe and Mail this month about the prosecution of Quebec engineering company SNC-Lavalin on corruption charges. The newspaper report quoted anonymous sources who alleged that Trudeau's office had pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the criminal case against the company, which employs thousands of people across the country.

The Conservatives pounced on the news that Butts, a key member of the prime minister's inner circle, was leaving, less than a week after the resignation of Wilson-Raybould as minister of veterans affairs.

""The latest resignation shows a gov't in chaos as Trudeau desperately tries to cover up this scandal,"" Conservative Party of Canada Leader Andrew Scheer wrote on Twitter, a few hours after the news broke. ""Canadians are rightly concerned about the allegations of political interference in a criminal prosecution. Trudeau needs to stop hiding behind other people and come clean.""

Other MPs, such as Calgary-area MP Michelle Rempel, piled on with their own attacks, while making light of the situation.

And in a video that appeared to have been filmed outside in a residential neighbourhood, an excited Ottawa-area MP Pierre Poilievre invited people to sign a petition calling on the prime minister to waive attorney-client privilege to allow Wilson-Raybould to speak about what she knew about the situation.

""This is a massive new development,"" Poilievre said. ""Gerald Butts has been the entire brain power behind Justin Trudeau and it was all of his brain power and authority that directed Justin to win the last election and over the last several years as prime minister. He would not be leaving the job if this were not extremely serious.""

Manitoba Conservative MP Candice Bergen also suggested that the government was ""in chaos.""

Butts is a long-time political strategist, who also served as chief executive officer of conservation group WWF-Canada prior to joining Trudeau in his bid to win the leadership of the Liberal party and the 2015 election. Butts also made a point of ending his resignation statement by stressing the importance of taking action on climate change since it will be the most important issue from today that future generations will judge us on.

Jenni Byrne, also an ex-senior advisor to Harper who later served briefly as an advisor to Ontario Premier Doug Ford, also offered praise for Butts.

""Playing at the highest level in politics isn’t always easy,"" Byrne wrote on Twitter. ""Partisanship and politics aside (Gerald Butts) has had tremendous success at numerous levels. I’m happy to call him a friend and wish him & his family good luck in whatever comes next.""

SNC-Lavalin has been aggressively lobbying all politicians to push for a plea bargain that would allow it to avoid a criminal conviction that would result in it being banned from bidding on federal government contracts for a decade. This lobbying has included private meetings over the past year with Tory Leader Scheer and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, as well as meetings with officials from the prime minister's office.

Curiously, the Conservatives aren't saying whether they would have said ""no"" to a deal with SNC-Lavalin if they were the ones in government. Instead, Scheer's deputy leader, Toronto-area MP Lisa Raitt, is suggesting that they'd be more transparent about any decision to help the company avoid a criminal conviction.

""You have to have the debate at cabinet and if a deal were to be made it would be made and the Canadian public would know what the deal was instead of trying to use the office of the prosecutor to do it through the back door,"" Raitt told CBC's Wendy Mesley in an interview that was broadcast on Sunday.

Meantime, Singh, the NDP leader, has joined Green Leader Elizabeth May in calling for a public inquiry to get to the bottom of the scandal.

Scheer said in a statement that his party would continue to press for a ""thorough and public investigation"" by the House of Commons justice committee and that all other options remain on the table to get answers.

Maxime Bernier, who was previously in the Conservative caucus and a minister in Harper's cabinet before forming his own political movement called the People's Party of Canada, said that ""crony capitalism"" is the real problem. He also said in a tweet that the Tories would have done the same thing as Trudeau's Liberals, but ""more openly.""

I’m here at your kind invitation to discuss China, how bad our relations with it may get, and how the contest we’ve initiated with China is likely to play out. Let me take a minute or two to set the context for this discussion.

Five hundred years ago this month, Hernán Cortés began the European annihilation of the Mayan, Aztec, and other indigenous civilizations in the Western Hemisphere. Six months later, in August 1519, Magellan [Fernão de Magalhães] launched his circumnavigation of the globe. For five centuries thereafter, a series of Western powers – Portugal, Spain, Holland, Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and, finally, the United States – overturned preexisting regional orders as they imposed their own on the world. That era has now come to an end.

In the final phases of the age of Western dominance, we Americans made and enforced the rules. We were empowered to do so in two phases. First, around 1880, the United States became the world’s largest economy. Then, in 1945, having liberated Western Europe from Germany and overthrown Japanese hegemony in East Asia, Americans achieved primacy in both the Atlantic and Pacific. Almost immediately, the Soviet Union and its then-apparently-faithful Asian companion, Communist China, challenged our new sphere of influence. In response, we placed our defeated enemies (Germany, Italy, Japan), our wartime allies, and most countries previously occupied by our enemies under American protection. With our help, these countries – which we called “allies” – soon returned to wealth and power but remained our protectorates. Now other countries, like China and India, are rising to challenge our global supremacy.

President Trump has raised the very pertinent question: Should states with the formidable capabilities longstanding American “allies” now have still be partial wards of the U.S. taxpayer? In terms of our own security, are they assets or liabilities? Another way of putting this is to ask: Do our Cold War allies and their neighbors now face credible threats that they cannot handle by themselves? Do these threats also menace vital US interests? And do they therefore justify US military presences and security guarantees that put American lives at risk? These are questions that discomfit our military-industrial complex and invite severe ankle-biting by what some have called “the Blob” – the partisans of the warfare state now entrenched in Washington. They are serious questions that deserve serious debate. We Americans are not considering them.

Instead, we have finessed debate by designating both Russia and China as adversaries that must be countered at every turn. This has many political and economic advantages. It is a cure for enemy deprivation syndrome – that queasy feeling our military-industrial complex gets when our enemies disorient us by irresponsibly defaulting on their contest with us and disappearing, as the Soviet Union did three decades ago. China and Russia are also technologically formidable foes that can justify American R&D and procurement of the expensive, high-tech weapons systems. Sadly, low intensity conflict with scruffy “terrorist” guerrillas can’t quite do this.

No one in the United States now seems prepared to defend either China or Russia against the charge that they, not we, are responsible for our current national dysfunction and malaise. After all, we’re the best, Russia’s a rogue, and China’s an unfair competitor. Our patriotism is admirable, theirs is malign.

It must have been the Russians who overcame our better judgment and made us vote against Hillary Clinton and for Donald Trump. Who other than China could have caused our companies to outsource work to places with cheap labor, instead of upgrading equipment and retraining their workers to meet foreign competition? A pox on all foreigners, not just Mexican rapists, European rip-off artists, Japanese free riders, Russian trolls, immigrants from “shithole” countries, and Chinese cyber burglars. Why worry about how to boost our own competitiveness when we can cripple the competitiveness of others?

Today our government is trying to break apart Sino-American interdependence, weaken China, and prevent it from overtaking us in wealth, competence, and influence. We have slapped tariffs on it, barred investment from it, charged it with pilfering intellectual property, arrested its corporate executives, blocked tech transfers to it, restricted what its students can study here, banned its cultural outreach to our universities, and threatened to bar its students from entering them. We are aggressively patrolling the waters and air spaces off its coasts and islands. Whether China deserves to be treated this way or not, we are leaving it little reason to want to cooperate with us.

Our sudden hostility to China reflects a consensus – at least within the Washington Beltway – that we need to wrestle China to the ground and pin it there. But what are the chances we can do that? What are the consequences of attempting it? Where are we now headed with China?

Realism is out of fashion in Washington even if it’s alive and well elsewhere in America. It should give us pause that our new enemy of choice is a very different, larger, and more dynamic country than any we have unbefriended before. China had a couple of bad centuries. But forty years ago, the Chinese Communist Party and government began to evolve what turned out to be a successful model of economic development that blended state capitalism with free enterprise. This unleashed the entrepreneurial talents of the Chinese people. The results have been staggering. Per capita income in China today is twenty-five times what it was in 1978. Back then, well over 90 percent of Chinese lived in poverty, as defined by the World Bank. Today, less than two percent do. China’s GDP is now sixty times bigger than it was forty years ago.

China is no longer isolated, poor, or irrelevant to affairs distant from it. It is a society with capabilities that rival and are beginning to overtake our own. China faces many challenges, but its people are resilient, resourceful, and optimistic that the lives of their descendants will be vastly better than their own – this at a time that we Americans are unprecedentedly pessimistic about our own country’s present and future condition.

Despite increasingly problematic policies, the Chinese economy is still growing almost three times faster than ours. By some measures, it is already one-third larger. China’s manufacturing sector accounts for over one fourth of global industrial production and is one-and-a-half times bigger than that of the United States. China’s ability to defend itself and its periphery against foreign attack is now formidable despite its spending less than two percent of GDP on its military. If pressed to do so, China could spend as much on defense as we do – and that’s a lot: almost $1.2 trillion when you add up all the military spending that is hidden like Easter eggs all over non-Defense Department budgets.

China is slightly larger than the United States – 6.3 percent of the world’s landmass vs. 6.1 percent for the US But there are 1.4 billion Chinese, with only one-third the arable land and one-fourth the water we Americans have. If we had the same ratio of population to agricultural resources that the Chinese do, there would be almost 4 billion Americans – about 600 million of them over sixty-five – most of them probably planning to retire in Florida.

I suspect that, if there were that many people crammed into the United States, Americans would have a much lower tolerance for social disorder and a different attitude toward family planning than we now do. We’d also be more worried about the prospects for individual security and survival. Sixty years ago, perhaps 30 million Chinese died in a man-made famine known as the “Great Leap Forward.” Chinese are acutely aware that they have narrow margins for error. This makes them naturally risk averse and, in most respects, a more predictable actor in foreign affairs than we now are.

Until we suddenly launched a trade war last year, China was our fastest growing export market. It is, after all, the largest consumer of a vast array of commodities and products. China consumes 59 percent of the world’s cement, 47 percent of its aluminum, 56 percent of its nickel, 50 percent of its coal, 50 percent of its copper and steel, 27 percent of its gold, 14 per cent of its oil, 31 percent of its rice, 47 percent of its pork, 23 percent of its corn, and 33 percent of its cotton. It consumes about one-fourth of the world’s energy. It provides one-third of the global market for semiconductors. Its companies’ demand for these has been growing around 16 percent annually. Microchips have become China’s largest single import – around $110 billion this year. China has been the main market for US chips, one of the few products of industry we Americans still monopolize.

By slapping tariffs, quotas, and export bans on China, the United States is throwing these markets away as well as raising prices and reducing choices for American consumers. Food security has been an obsession for every Chinese state over the course of the last 2,500 years. No responsible leader in China is again going to commit his or her country to long-term dependence on the US for its feed-grain, wheat, corn, cotton, pork, or fresh fruit supply. Erratic behavior in business makes one the supplier of last resort. Whatever the short-term outcome of the trade war we launched against it, in future China is going to look elsewhere for critical imports.

No “wall” is in prospect on the US-Mexican border, but the United States is surrounding itself with a moat full of protectionist measures aimed at denying China not just sales in the US market, but opportunities to invest its rising wealth in US industry, agriculture, and services. This is in part a response to a real but far from unprecedented problem. In the 19th century, encouraged by Alexander Hamilton and others, Americans pioneered the art of technology theft from Britain and other more advanced manufacturing economies. As the 20th century began and we became a net exporter of innovation ourselves, we renounced intellectual property crime. Japan and Taiwan then took over our role. When Japan got rich, it too retired. Taiwan moved its pirate industries across the Strait to the China mainland.

China took up the by-now, well-established practice of upgrading its industrial base by lifting technology from wherever it could. But, like the US and Japan in earlier days, China is now itself becoming an exporter not just of capital but advanced, innovative technology. With a lot of competition among its own enterprises and an increasing share of the world’s intellectual property, Chinese companies have become very concerned to secure their innovations from pilferage. This has made them responsive to our pressure on them to clean up their act. In their own interest, they are almost certain to do so whether we make a deal with them or not. Like the proverbial generals, we may be fighting the last war, not the one to come.

The end of the 21st century’s second decade is a remarkably inauspicious moment for us to be severing ties with scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians – so-called STEM workers – in China. Technology advances through collaboration, not the sequestration of knowledge. In the United States, we graduate about 650,000 scientists and engineers annually, over one third of whom are foreigners. (In some disciplines, like engineering and computer science, foreign students account for about half of new US degrees.) Almost one third of all foreign students here are from China. On its own, China now graduates 1.8 million scientists, engineers, and mathematicians annually. It is about to overtake us in the number of doctorates it confers in these fields.

Already about one-fourth of the world’s STEM workers are Chinese. This Chinese intellectual workforce is eight times larger than ours and growing six times as fast. By 2025, China is expected to have more technologically skilled workers than all members of the OECD combined. (The OECD is not a trivial grouping. It consists of the world’s most advanced economies: the United States, Canada and Mexico, all non-Russian-speaking Europe, Australia, Israel, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, and Turkey.) By severing ties with the Chinese, we Americans are isolating ourselves from the largest population of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in the world.

The United States has always been a major importer of foreign brainpower. Since 2000, thirty-nine percent of our Nobel Prize winners have been immigrants. A great many of our technology companies were started by immigrants or are now managed by them. Asian immigrants, mainly from China (including Taiwan), India, and Korea, make up about 17 percent of our current STEM workforce. In large part as a result of the less welcoming atmosphere in our country today, less than half of Chinese graduates from our universities now join the US workforce. Most are going home to work or start companies in China rather than here. China is now home to 36 percent of the world’s “unicorns” – startup companies valued at more than $1 billion.

Some estimates are that the United States is already one million short of the STEM workforce our economy requires to sustain our competitiveness. Tightening restrictions on foreign students and workers as we are now doing undercuts our ability to fill this gap. We are reducing our openness to foreign science and technology at precisely the moment that other countries – not just China but nations like India and Korea – are pulling even with us, Europe, and Japan, or charging ahead. China has begun to outspend us on research and development, especially in the basic sciences, where breakthroughs in human knowledge that lead to new technologies occur.

Our strategy is not aimed at upping our own performance but at hamstringing China’s. This is more likely to induce intellectual constipation here than in China. The Chinese are not going to oblige us by ceasing to educate their young people, halting their progress, or severing their science and technology relationships with other countries. Nor will most other countries join us in shunning them. We Americans, not the Chinese, are the most likely to be weakened and impoverished by our growing xenophobia and nativism. Others, not Americans, will leverage China’s advancing prosperity and brainpower to their advantage.

At root, of course, our concern about China’s increasing technological prowess is about the balance of military power between us. Since World War II, Americans have become accustomed to being the privileged custodians of the global commons, setting the rules and calling the shots in all the world’s oceans, including the Western Pacific. We gained our primacy there nearly seventy-five years ago when we defeated Japan and filled the resulting power vacuum in its former imperial domain.

But Japan is back as a major power even if it has preferred to pretend otherwise. South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, and others in East Asia have become powerful, independent states that bow to no foreign power. There is no vacuum in Asia for either the United States or China to fill.

No country in Asia can ignore the power that China’s huge and growing economy confers on it. None could achieve a decisive victory in a war with China. But none is prepared to enlist in our campaign against China or China’s backlash against the United States. None wants to choose between us. As uneasy as China’s neighbors may be in the face of its economic and military ascendancy, they all know they must accommodate it.

For over half of the last millennium, all or part of China fell prey to a remarkable range of foreign invaders – Qiang, Jurchens, Mongols, Manchus, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, British, French, Russians, Austro-Hungarians, Germans, Americans, and Japanese. Often, China was ruled by foreigners or dominated by them. The most recent set of invasions was from the South and East China Seas. It should surprise no one that Chinese are determined to defend the approaches to their coasts or that, to this end, they are developing what the Pentagon calls “anti-access, area denial” or A2/AD capabilities.

The Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s rapidly strengthening capabilities have become a formidable impediment to anyone planning to mount an attack on China or on shipping approaching or leaving Chinese ports. The United States has repeatedly declared that we see China’s new ability to control its periphery as a threat to us. The Chinese take this, our plan to “pivot” much of our military to their frontiers, and our aggressive patrols of their defenses as ipso facto evidence of US preparation for war with them. The United States and China are caught in a classic “security dilemma,” in which each side’s defensive moves are seen as threats by the other.

The contest between our determination to defend our continuing military primacy in the Indo-Pacific and China’s imperative of keeping potentially hostile armed forces like ours at bay is clearest in the South China Sea. Though long claimed by both China and Vietnam and fished in by the Philippines, this was traditionally a no-man’s land – part of the regional commons where fishermen from all the littoral countries felt free to ply their trade. But, in the late 1970s and early ‘80s, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam seized most of the land features in the Spratly Islands in an effort to secure its seabed resources for themselves. A decade later, China took the few rocks and reefs that were left. It has since turned these into islands with secure harbors, garrisoned them, and built airfields on them.

The US and PLA Navies are now engaged in escalating games of chicken around these artificial islands as well as along the coasts of the China mainland. Both navies are highly professional. The danger of an accident is therefore low, but the risk of miscalculation is high. Should actual combat between our armed forces occur, it could rapidly widen.

In the East China Sea, the United States has pledged to back Japan’s claims to the Senkaku (or Diaoyu) islands. These are barren rocks about one hundred miles east-north-east of Taiwan and two hundred and fifty miles west of Okinawa. Chinese in both Taiwan and the mainland claim them as part of Taiwan. Armed Japanese and Chinese coast guards began patrolling them a decade ago.. At least for now, both seem determined to manage their differences prudently. Neither wants a war. Still, there is a decided risk that we Americans might be dragged into a bloody encounter between Chinese and Japanese nationalism.

But the greatest danger of a Sino-American war is Taiwan. Taiwan is a former Chinese province that was recovered from its Japanese occupiers by Nationalist China at the end of World War II. In 1949, having been defeated everywhere else in China, Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalist forces retreated to it.

The universal expectation at the time was that the People’s Liberation Army would cross the Taiwan Strait and unify China by finishing off Chiang and the Nationalists. But, when the Korean War broke out, the United States intervened to prevent its widening through a PLA invasion of Taiwan or a Nationalist attempt to retake the China mainland. We Americans thus suspended but did not end the Chinese civil war. To this day, we remain committed to preventing war in the Taiwan Strait. To this end, we continue to sell weapons to the island. China sees this as hostile interference in a quarrel among Chinese in which foreigners should not involve themselves.

Behind its US shield, over the course of seventy years, Taiwan emerged as a prosperous democratic Chinese society with decidedly mixed feelings about whether it should be part of China. The island is now ruled by a political party that is deterred from declaring independence from China only by its realization that this would trigger a violent resumption of the Chinese civil war that would almost certainly destroy Taiwan and its democracy.

Chinese on the mainland see their country’s continued division as an artifact of US policy. While they have pledged to try to resolve their differences with Taiwan peacefully, they remain determined to erase the humiliation that the continued foreign-supported separation of Taiwan from the rest of China represents. War is not imminent, but it is an ever-present danger, with the potential to produce a nuclear exchange between China and the United States.

Taiwan illustrates the dangers of managing disputes by relying exclusively on deterrence to the exclusion of diplomacy. Deterrence can inhibit the outbreak of war, but it does nothing to resolve its underlying causes. In the case of Taiwan, the United States lacks a diplomatic strategy to encourage the parties to the dispute to address and resolve their differences. In default of a strategy, we are now doubling down on our politico-military support of Taiwan. But if Beijing loses confidence in the possibility of a peaceful reconciliation with the Taiwan authorities, it will be increasingly tempted to use force. This is precisely the trend at present. We have no plan to deal with that trend other than to prepare ourselves for combat.

China enjoys widening military superiority over Taiwan. Many judge that it could already defeat an effort by us to defend Taiwan. The PLA need not invade Taiwan to devastate it. Taiwan would be the main loser in any conflict whether the US supported it or not.

A Sino-American war over Taiwan could quickly escalate to the nuclear level. China has a policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons but it could deliver a devastating counterstrike on the US homeland if we attacked it. There is very little substantive contact between the US and Chinese militaries, and there are no mechanisms for escalation control in place. It is not clear how either side could fend off domestic pressures for escalation if we come to blows, as we may. Instead of exploring means of establishing and managing a strategic balance with China, we are withdrawing from the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in part to enable us to deploy nuclear weapons closer to China.

For better or ill, the admirably liberal Chinese society on Taiwan cannot assure its security or prosperity without reaching some sort of accommodation with the much larger, authoritarian Chinese society on the other side of the Strait. Sooner or later, Taiwan will have to negotiate a durable modus vivendi with the mainland. Current US policies help Taiwan avoid hard choices even as the balance of power shifts against it. We are inadvertently helping Taiwan set itself up for a Chinese offer it will be unable to refuse. Meanwhile, US-China relations are increasingly hostile politically, economically, and militarily.

What we face with China is not a new Cold War but a contest unlike any we have ever experienced in our 230 years as a constitutional democracy. China is fully integrated into the global economy. George Kennan’s grand strategy of containment was based on the correct judgment that, if isolated for long enough, the defects in the autarkic Soviet system would cause it to fail. China cannot be isolated, and its economy is currently outperforming ours.

The Soviet Union was an overly militarized state that collapsed under the burden of excessive defense spending. China has kept the proportion of its GDP devoted to its military at or below the level of our European “allies,” whom we accuse of spending too little on their defense. The Soviet Union controlled satellite countries and sought to impose its ideology on others, including us. The Chinese have no satellites and are notorious for not caring at all how foreigners govern ourselves.

Our competition with China is primarily economic. It will not be decided by who has the more appealing ideology, the most aircraft carriers, or the greatest stash of nuclear weapons, but by who delivers the best economic performance and by which country’s statecraft is soundest.

Are we ready for such a contest? Let’s look at the bright side. Maybe it will challenge us to get our act together. Let’s hope so.

It doesn’t seem to matter which political party controls the House or Senate. Congress still can’t pass a budget or otherwise set national priorities. When it’s not shut down, our government runs on credit rollovers. Our debt is out of control. So far this century, we’ve committed almost $6 trillion to wars we don’t know how to end. Meanwhile, we’ve deferred about $4 trillion in maintenance of our rapidly deteriorating physical infrastructure. We are disinvesting in our human endowment, cutting funding for our universities and scientific research. Our government is bleeding talent. This is not our finest hour.

And, if allies are assets rather than liabilities, the willingness of our security partners abroad to follow us is more uncertain than at any point since we became an active world power seven decades ago. We are withdrawing from international agreements and institutions, not seeking to shape them to our advantage or crafting new ones. Instead of asking our allies to do more to defend themselves, we are asking them to pay us to defend them. Our Senate can no longer bring itself to consider, let alone ratify treaties – even those we ourselves originally proposed. In short, we are not leading the world as we once did. We’re not part of the solution to transnational problems like global warming or arms control. Instead, we are becoming active obstructionists of solutions to pressing global problems.

The social mobility that once made equality of opportunity a reality in our country has ebbed away. Our wealthy are getting richer; those less fortunate are not. We have the highest percentage of our population imprisoned of any country in the world. That superlative aside, on many other measures of international excellence, we have complacently fallen to levels of mediocrity. Our students are thirty-eighth in math proficiency and twenty-fourth in science. We rank forty-second in life expectancy, forty-fifth in press freedoms, nineteenth in respect for the rule of law, and seventeenth in quality of life. Need I go on?

There’s a lot to fix at home before we can be sure we have what it takes to go abroad in search of dragons to destroy. There is a real danger that we have taken on more than we can handle. China is guilty of malpractice in several aspects of its trade policies. We are right to demand that it correct these. Experience strongly suggests that, if we work with others of like mind in organizations like the World Trade Organization to persuade China to do so, we can move China in desirable directions. An across-the-board assault on China of the sort we have just mounted is not only likely to fail, it entails risks we have not adequately considered. These risks include armed combat with a nuclear power. And China is getting relatively stronger, not weaker, even as our inept handling of foreign affairs increasingly marginalizes the United States in areas of human endeavor we have traditionally dominated.

We have given inadequate thought to how to leverage China’s rise to our advantage. Trying to tear China down will not succeed. Neither will it cure our self-induced debilitation as a nation.

We have launched a comprehensive competition with China for which we are not ready. We cannot afford to learn this the hard way. Whatever we do about China, we have to get our act together and do it now.

Crowley on Thursday was named honorary co-chairman of Pass USMCA, a coalition of business, trade and advocacy groups promoting swift passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement.

The coalition was launched earlier this month by President Trump’s former deputy chief of staff, Rick Dearborn.

Dearborn told The Hill that the coalition approached Crowley to join the effort and is focusing on getting Democrats on board with the president's trade agreement.

“I think that’s the smart focus,” Dearborn told The Hill. “There’s a lot of fresh new faces in the Democratic caucus [and we will be] providing them really good information, answering their questions, and ultimately I’m hopeful that they can see clear to be supportive of the deal.

""In the end, I think it will pass,” he predicted.

Trump signed the deal in November, setting off a six-month deadline for Congress to approve the pact.

“He is someone that knows how to actually build bridges and work to get things done. I’m a conservative Republican, he’s a much more liberal Democrat, but I think we can both agree, along with Gov. Locke, that this trade deal’s extremely important, its passage swiftly is really critical.”

Gary Locke, the former Democratic governor of Washington and a onetime ambassador to China, is also an honorary co-chairman.

The coalition has 12 members so far, including the Household and Commercial Products Association, the International Association of Drilling Contractors, PhRMA, the Washington Council on International Trade, the Canadian American Business Council and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council.

There are other coalitions working to get the deal passed, and Dearborn said what makes Pass USMCA unique is “we have no conditions,"" calling their sole focus ""the quick and clean passage of USMCA.”

“I think our members feel that what was accomplished in these negotiations with Canada and Mexico was really significant and really, really good for American businesses, workers and our economy,” he said.

Dearborn announced his departure from the White House in December 2017, finally resigning in March 2018.

Here are five things to know about who he is and what his role has been.

Founded in friendship

Butts and Trudeau are not just colleagues, they are very close friends. They met at McGill University in the early 1990s and their friendship was so close that Butts helped craft Trudeau's memorable eulogy for his father, former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, in 2000. That was the public speech that produced a push for Trudeau, then a teacher in British Columbia, to follow his father into politics. In his book, Common Ground, Trudeau wrote that when he began to think about running for the Liberal leadership in 2012, Butts was the first person he approached for advice. Butts was a critical part of both Trudeau's leadership campaign and the Liberals' 2015 election campaign. Trudeau has described Butts and Katie Telford, his chief of staff, as ""the core of my inner circle.""

From different worlds, united

Butts and Trudeau were both born in 1971 but grew up in very different circles. Trudeau was the son of a prime minister whose childhood included a security detail and handshakes with world leaders. Butts was the youngest son of a Glace Bay, N.S., coal miner and a nurse, who nonetheless grew up to have at least one link to Liberal politics. His aunt, Peggy Butts, a nun and social activist who is said to have been one of the biggest influences on how he views the world, was appointed to the Senate by Jean Chretien in 1997.

Deja-vu all over again

The 2015 campaign was not the first in which Butts helped steer a Liberal leader into government. Butts's first foray into politics came with the Ontario Liberals, where he was a policy adviser to then-leader Dalton McGuinty. He was one of the architects of the 2003 Liberal platform that propelled McGuinty into the premier's office and Butts would be his principal secretary for five years.

McGuinty's agenda has many similarities to Trudeau's, such as phasing out coal power, expanding renewable energy, and increasing social spending.

Prime Minister Butts

Butts has been unusually visible for a senior political staffer. He did not shy away from talking to journalists — in fact he seemed to relish doing so — but always ""on background."" His presence on social media, however, was public and constant, as he used Twitter to spin government policy, challenge government critics and even get into sparring matches with the leaders of provincial parties and governments.

This visibility began in his McGuinty days, with the Ontario Tories in 2003 putting out an entire press release attacking him as an ""anonymous, unelected, backroom spin doctor"" who was the ""real leader of the Liberal Party of Ontario.""

This visibility, and his influence and power within Trudeau's office, were not always met happily by Liberal MPs, some of whom secretly referred to him as ""PM Butts.""

It's the environment, stupid

Butts's influence is felt in every area of government policy and Trudeau would not make any big policy decisions without the input of both Butts and Telford. But the area Butts holds dearest is the environment. Environment policies were a central theme in McGuinty's government during the Butts era, and again with the Trudeau Liberals. In between the two governments, Butts was the CEO of the World Wildlife Fund in Canada, a position he held until the Trudeau Liberal leadership campaign came calling.

In his resignation statement Butts even made a pitch for action to halt climate change: ""Our kids and grandkids will judge us on one issue above all others,"" he said. ""That issue is climate change. I hope the response to it becomes the collective, non-partisan, urgent effort that science clearly says is required. I hope that happens soon.""","Five things you should know about Gerald Butts, following his resignation",Nationalobserver.com,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/02/18/news/five-things-you-should-know-about-gerald-butts-following-his-resignation
187,Empty,2019-02-19T01:00:22Z,"When he swept into office back in 2015, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised supporters of a Liberal Party reinvigorated by a decade of conservative rule that he would bring about ""real change"" - both in Ottawa, and for a Liberal Party marred by al…","When he swept into office back in 2015, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised supporters of a Liberal Party reinvigorated by a decade of conservative rule that he would bring about ""real change"" - both in Ottawa, and for a Liberal Party marred by allegations of corruption.

So far, he has largely failed at both, cozying up to the country's energy industry while masking his maintenance of the pro-business status quo with legalized marijuana and a ""progressive"" agenda that has included banning misgendering and hiring the first cabinet in Canada's history with an equal number of men and women.

Yet as Canada's leader braces for what promises to be a bruising reelection campaign ahead of a vote in October, his office has been marred by a blossoming scandal surrounding reports that it pressured the former attorney general into dropping years-old corruption charges against Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin, a Canadian construction company with close ties to Trudeau's party.

In a sign that this scandal won't easily disappear, no matter how many times Trudeau stands in front of a gaggle of reporters and breezily denies the allegations, one of his closest aids resigned on Monday over allegations that he or his staff pressured the former AG, who was abruptly demoted last month.

The aide, Principal Secretary Gerald Butts, denied the allegations, and said he was resigning to avoid distracting Trudeau from the hard work ahead. It's unclear whether he will have any role on the Trudeau campaign. He is considered the second most influential official in Trudeau's government after Chief of Staff Katie Telford.

Principal Secretary Gerald Butts issued a statement Monday, during a long weekend in much of Canada, announcing his resignation in order to prevent the issue from distracting “from the vital work the Prime Minister and his office is doing for all Canadians.” A report this month by the Globe and Mail newspaper raised allegations the prime minister’s office pressured Trudeau’s former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to settle fraud and corruption charges against construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. The controversy escalated last week after Wilson-Raybould, who had been moved into a new ministry recently, quit cabinet. In his statement, Butts said he “categorically” denied the allegation that he or any of his staff pressured her. ""My reputation is my responsibility and that is for me to defend,"" Butts said in the statement. ""It is in the best interests of the office and its important work for me to step away.""

In his statement to the Globe and Mail, Butts said he and Trudeau's office ""honored the role"" of the attorney general.

“I categorically deny the accusation that I or anyone else in this office pressured Ms. Wilson-Raybould,” Mr. Butts said in a statement on Monday. “We honoured the unique role of the Attorney General. At all times, I and those around me acted with integrity and a singular focus on the best interests of all Canadians.” A Globe and Mail story on Feb. 7 said Ms. Wilson-Raybould came under pressure from the Prime Minister’s Office to instruct prosecutors to offer SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution deal when she was justice minister and attorney-general.

Trudeau also tweeted the full statement:

Gerald Butts served this government - and our country - with integrity, sage advice and devotion. I want to thank him for his service and continued friendship. Please read his statement today: pic.twitter.com/VIaEHJMMe4 — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) February 18, 2019

He also said his decision to resign shouldn't detract from Trudeau's work. Trudeau has said that he spoke with the former AG, Jody Wilson-Raybould, in September about the SNC-Lavalin Group scandal, but claims he told her at the time that it was ""her decision to make.""

But some of the government's maneuvering that - incidentally or not - helped clear the way for the charges to be dropped would suggest that Trudeau may have been actively pushing for such a resolution. For example, Trudeau's government successfully changed a law to allow for a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin. And many observers were surprised when Wilson-Raybould was demoted during a seemingly arbitrary reshuffle. She has since resigned and hired attorneys to advise her about what she can and cannot say about the affair.

Trudeau acknowledged last week that his government had discussed the issue of a resolution to the charges in an effort to avoid job losses at the company, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada.

But the timing of the firing is difficult to ignore. And as the scandal widens, many are beginning to wonder if Trudeau will even make it to October.",Justin Trudeau's Government In Turmoil After Top Aide Resigns Over Corruption Allegations,Zerohedge.com,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-02-18/justin-trudeaus-government-turmoil-after-top-aide-resigns-over-corruption

“After four days of cross-country driving, the convoy mustered in Arnprior, Ontario, just outside the capital but got off to a late start Tuesday morning,” The Canadian Press reported. “With police escorts, its trucks, buses, and cars hit downtown Ottawa after the morning rush hour, disrupting the city only slightly.”

But once they got where they were going, “scores of semis, pickups, and other vehicles occupied several blocks of the street in front of Parliament as about 150 people gathered in knee-deep snow on the Hill for speeches by organizers and a handful of conservative lawmakers,” CP adds. “About 30 police officers stood between the convoy members and a counter-protest that gathered nearby, focused on Indigenous causes.”

“We’re fighting for you. We’re standing with you,” Scheer told the protesters. “It is time that Canada has a prime minister that is proud of our energy sector,” he added.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's spokesperson Cameron Ahmad responded on Twitter, saying that Scheer ""had the opportunity to denounce the anti-immigrant & alt-right elements attempting to co-opt the movement he so proudly endorses"" but that he instead ""posed next to a billboard calling for the Prime Minister to be 'tried for treason.'""

“You’re not asking for handouts, you’re not asking for any privileges, you’re just asking for being sure that this country will be able to build pipelines. That’s important not only for you, that’s important for all Canadians,” said People’s Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier.

Goldy distinguished herself after Indigenous counter-protesters booed and name-called her when she attempted to speak from the back of a truck. “If you don’t like our country, leave it,” she said, according to a report by Vice News.

Yesterday, Scheer had the opportunity to denounce the anti-immigrant & alt-right elements attempting to co-opt the movement he so proudly endorses.

Saskatchewan Conservative Senator David Tkachuk, appointed to the Red Chamber in 1993 by then-prime minister Brian Mulroney, urged the truckers to “roll over every Liberal left in the country.” He told HuffPost that “people aren’t driving all the way across the country to have lunch with their neighbours. They’re driving across the country because they’re worried about losing their home and educating their children. And that’s why they came here.”

“Pro or anti #pipeline no one should ever encourage a crowd to run over their political opponents. Senator David Tkachuk did just this today at the #UnitedWeRoll rally. Shameful behavior,” tweeted University of Ottawa energy culture specialist Patrick McCurdy in response.

“Half a dozen Conservative MPs and senators blasted the Liberals’ carbon tax and reiterated their support for the oil and gas sector,” CP reported. “They left out another of the convoy organizers’ complaints: that Canada signed a non-binding United Nations agreement on migration in December.”

Ontario's Progressive Conservative government got in early with a plug for pipelines and has been silent since the message got muddied.

Premier Doug Ford welcomed the convoy to Ontario with a tweet on Feb. 16 that said ""I support your call to build the pipeline and stop the job-killing carbon tax"" and another with a video of Ford shot at Toronto's annual automotive show.

United we roll! Stop the carbon tax and let’s get those pipelines built! #UnitedWeRoll pic.twitter.com/sYXtMVv7rn — Doug Ford (@fordnation) February 15, 2019

Stephen Lecce, Ford's parliamentary assistant and the province's minister for infrastructure, shot his own video to welcome the convoy to Ontario and tell the UCP MLA for Fort McMurray that Ontario had relinquished its veto right over pipeline approvals.

Neither Ford, nor Lecce spoke either in favour or against the immigration and race issues raised by the people in the convoy.

Natural Resources Minister and Edmonton-area MP Amarjeet Sohi was quick to point out the overlapping issues that continue to connect the convoy with a wider brew of racist and white nationalist causes—a problem that earlier forced fossil industry interests to abandon the organizing effort.

“It’s very unfortunate that the convoy that is here today, that their message has drifted away from pipelines to issues that are not relevant to the discussion on pipelines,” he said. “We will continue to focus on the real issues that matter to Albertans, which is building the pipeline capacity that is so much necessary for us to get our resources to global markets.”

This was the same tune Alberta's government was whistling in response to the convoy’s mixed messages. “What I know is that Albertans, not only in that convoy but Albertans across this province for at least two or three years now, have been doing a tremendous case reaching out to Canadians across the country making the strong case for why pipelines matter,” Premier Rachel Notley told reporters in response to a question from National Observer.

But “what I have said all along though is that we cannot stand with those that are delivering additional messages that are divisive and quite frankly not ones that we agree with.”

Along with pro-pipeline slogans, some of the messages displayed on protest signs or on the vehicles seeking to block traffic were calls for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to be tried for treason, claims that carbon dioxide emissions are not causing climate change, calls for tougher voter identification and against a United Nations agreement on migration.

The broader context for the protest could be seen on a placard on at least one of the trucks, which declared NO to “UN/globalism, carbon tax, tanker ban, dirty foreign oil, open borders” and YES to “Charge Trudeau with treason, Energy East, yes to pipe lines, look after veterans, photo ID & Canadian citizenship to vote.”

CBC said convoy organizer Glen Carritt, who owns an oilfield fire and safety company in Innisfail, Alberta, had to rebrand the convoy to try and get out from under the controversy. “Carritt originally referred to his group as the “yellow vest convoy” but renamed it United We Roll after it was linked to extremist elements,” the national broadcaster reported. Even so, “one of the group’s other organizers, Jason Corbeil, was forced to distance the group from a Sault. Ste. Marie, Ontario yellow vest group that had boasted online about being part of the convoy. A blog run by one of that group’s organizers includes calls for specific politicians to be executed, refers to immigrants as ‘sub-human’, and argues women don’t belong in politics.”

Carritt had tried to tamp down that message in an earlier interview with CP. “The core message is we need immediate action for our pipelines to get in the ground, to get to tidewater and to the rest of Canada,” he said.

But on Parliament Hill, one of the first speeches came from Saskatoon Yellow Vest organizer Mark Friesen, who talked about “federal policies as the results of agreements with the United Nations to implement its sustainable development agenda,” CP reported.

“You cut the head of the snake off, we get our country back, all of it, including pipelines built, including dumping the carbon tax, including getting rid of the migrant pact,” Friesen said.

Canadian Anti-Hate Network Executive Director Evan Balgord “expressed frustration with how the convoy’s more extreme elements have been overlooked by politicians and in media coverage,” VICE News reported.

“How many examples do I have to provide of overt racism and death threats?” he asked. “How many examples do I have to provide of the organizers of the goddamn convoy expressing support for hate groups before people will get it?”

“This convoy is a Yellow Vests Canada convoy, and any well-meaning pro-pipeline individuals involved are in fact legitimizing and breathing oxygen into the broader Yellow Vests Canada movement, which spreads hate, conspiracy theories, and death threats targeting Muslims, politicians, and other Canadians,” Balgord added in a CBC interview.

“A movement may try to distance itself and claim a project they think is innocent, but when you scratch the surface you realize it’s a vehicle of hate,” agreed McMaster University professor Ameil Joseph, who specializes in race theory, immigration, and mental health. He called Yellow Vests “a re-visioned white nationalist, white supremacist movement.”

Carritt and other organizers stressed the convoy was intended as a peaceful protest, open to anyone who was committed to non-violence. But “several of the organizers have expressed support online for anti-Muslim hate groups, like Soldiers of Odin, the 3-percenters, and several others,” Vice reported, citing Balgord. “The head of the Canadian Combat Coalition, an anti-Muslim hate group, was welcomed as part of the convoy.” And Yellow Vests Canada, with more than 110,000 members on Facebook, “has become notorious for hateful rhetoric about immigrants, and especially Muslims.”

“Since December, members have posted conspiracy theories about Muslims to the Facebook page, and refer to them using derogatory terms,” the HuffPost report added. “There is a post calling for Liberal MP Iqra Khalid to be deported, another saying ‘euro-Canadians’ should advocate for their ‘ethnic interests.’ Last month Facebook began removing comments from the page after Global News reported members were making death threats against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.”

Balgord said he doubted Scheer is unaware of the extremist views the convoy is fostering.

Scheer’s office didn't respond to a request for comment from National Observer.

“Your [political leader] doesn’t endorse a thing without a staffer looking at it. If they looked at this movement for even 10 minutes on social media, they would’ve found a death threat directed towards Trudeau, they would’ve found examples of overt racism,” said Balgord. “It’s that prevalent.”

Mia Rabson and Joan Bryden, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be pressured Monday to testify at a House of Commons committee looking into allegations the prime minister and his staff pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop a criminal prosecution of Montreal-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The Conservative party will introduce a motion arguing that since Trudeau keeps saying the Commons justice committee is well placed to investigate the allegations, he should have no problem showing up there himself to answer questions about his role in the matter.

The motion will ask all MPs to vote to call Trudeau before the committee for at least two hours, by March 15.

Motions in the House of Commons are not binding and regardless of the outcome, the committee itself would still have to decide whether to invite Trudeau. Besides that, MPs, including the prime minister, cannot be forced to appear before committees.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said Friday the committee has already heard from the clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick, that ""Justin Trudeau had his fingerprints all over this.""

Wernick told the committee Thursday that no improper pressure was applied to Wilson-Raybould, who quit the cabinet last week, and that Trudeau's staff have conducted themselves with ""the highest standards of integrity.""

He said that Trudeau was worried a prosecution might result in SNC-Lavalin's moving its operations overseas or closing up shop, hurting innocent employees, shareholders, pensioners, third-party suppliers and communities in which the company operates. Wernick said he told Wilson-Raybould about those concerns during a conversation in December but that his intention was to provide ""context,"" not pressure.

He also said the prime minister assured Wilson-Raybould at every opportunity that a decision on whether to halt the prosecution was hers alone.

Trudeau said Wernick's words should carry weight with Canadians.

""The clerk of the privy council, Michael Wernick, is an extraordinary public servant who has served this country and continues to serve this country under governments of different political stripes, with integrity and brilliance,"" said Trudeau. ""He is someone we need to heed very carefully when he chooses to express himself publicly and I'm sure everyone is taking a careful look at his words yesterday.""

But Scheer said Wernick's testimony laid bare just how many times Trudeau, members of his political staff, and Wernick spoke to Wilson-Raybould in an attempt to change her mind and allow SNC-Lavalin to enter into a remediation agreement rather than go on trial for fraud and bribery related to the firm's work in Libya.

Scheer dismissed Wernick's assertion that those conversations were within bounds.

""It's all well and good for someone who is trying to defend his own actions and defend the actions of the government to come to that conclusion,"" said Scheer.

Some opposition MPs and pundits have suggested Wernick crossed into partisanship by defending the government. Scheer wouldn't go that far but he did seem surprised by what Wernick said.

""I had certainly not seen a performance like that in the past,"" said Scheer.

Trudeau's government has been rocked by the anonymous allegations that Wilson-Raybould was under pressure from the Prime Minister's Office to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin -- a kind of plea bargain that would force the company to pay restitution but would spare it a criminal conviction that could cripple it by barring it from bidding on government contracts for up to 10 years.

Also on Friday, SNC-Lavalin chief executive Neil Bruce lashed out over the pummelling the company is taking from politicians.

""Frankly, we've had enough of all that, and we're just going to vigorously defend ourselves in court, and that's our strategy,"" he said.

Bruce said the Public Prosecution Service of Canada can still invite SNC-Lavalin to negotiate a remediation agreement and the company would be willing to do so.

""But frankly, it doesn't look like that today,"" he said.

Trudeau was not as eager to heed Wernick's opinion on solicitor-client privilege, the principle Wilson-Raybould has repeatedly cited to refuse comment on the allegations that she was improperly pressured. The clerk told the committee he doesn't think solicitor-client privilege applies in this instance and it's up to Wilson-Raybould to choose how much she wants to say on the matter when she appears before the committee next week.

Trudeau said he is still receiving advice on whether to waive the bond of secrecy between lawyer and client because there are potential consequences for two ongoing court cases against the company.

Scheer accused Trudeau of ""cherry picking"" which parts of Wernick's testimony he wants to listen to.

Trudeau is seeking advice on the privilege matter from David Lametti, whom he appointed justice minister and attorney general in an early January cabinet shuffle in which he moved Wilson-Raybould to the veterans-affairs post.

Under opposition demands Friday to explain why solicitor-client privilege has not been waived, Lametti told the Commons it's an exceptionally complex issue but he's doing his ""level best"" to find a way ""such that the former attorney general can, in fact, speak.""

Preliminary results showed Jagmeet Singh won a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia.

Singh captured just under 40 percent of the vote.

A practicing Sikh, Singh made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau’s chances become.

“This staves off all the talk that Singh would have to quit ... at least for the moment he is vindicated,” said Richard Johnston, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia.

Johnston said in a phone interview that Singh would still need to overcome unhappiness with his leadership.

Singh, 40, a former legislator in the province of Ontario, had no experience in federal politics when he took over from former leader Thomas Mulcair.

He has clashed openly with senior members of parliament on a number of issues. A quarter of the 44 NDP legislators who won seats in the 2015 election have either already quit or announced they are not running again in October.

And in a further sign of challenges ahead, in another special election on Monday, the NDP lost the Montreal seat Mulcair had held to the Liberals.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News last week put the Liberals at 34 percent public support and the right-leaning official opposition Conservatives at 35 percent. The NDP was far behind at 17 percent.

The Liberals are stumbling amid allegations that officials in Trudeau’s office leaned on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help a major construction company avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The struggling head of Canada's left-leaning New Democrats, an opposition party that competes with the Liberals of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, will try to win a parliamentary seat on Monday amid speculation he could be ousted if he loses.

Jagmeet Singh, a practicing Sikh, made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau's chances become.

Singh is contesting a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia. Results should become available at around 11 p.m. Eastern (0400 GMT Tuesday).

Singh, 40, a former legislator in the province of Ontario, had no experience in federal politics when he took over from former leader Thomas Mulcair.

He has clashed openly with senior members of parliament on a number of issues. A quarter of the 44 NDP legislators who won seats in the 2015 election have either already quit or announced they are not running again in October.

In unusually frank remarks, Mulcair said last month that ""it would be extremely difficult for Mr. Singh to stick around"" if he lost on Monday.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News last week put the Liberals at 34 percent public support and the right-leaning official opposition Conservatives at 35 percent. The NDP was far behind at 17 percent.

The Liberals are stumbling amid allegations that officials in Trudeau's office leaned on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help a major construction company avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges.

Both Craft and her husband are major supporters of President Donald Trump.

The pick gives the former Republican commentator Max Boot major concerns that the Trump administration will once again become a laughingstock on the world stage.

Writing in the Washington Post, Boot points out that historically that position was filled by the major statesmen of their time — major historical figures including Henry Cabot Lodge and Adlai Stevenson. He notes that the President’s first pick, Nikki Haley, was a continuation of that legacy. “She was a former governor who has been talked about as a possible presidential contender, and she acquitted herself admirably at the United Nations,” Boot writes.

Her initial replacement, Heather Nauert, did not have an equally relevant resume. Nauert had previously worked at Fox News.

Craft is even more problematic, argues Boot.

“Kelly Knight Craft was chosen to be U.S. ambassador to Canada, and now to the United Nations, because she and her third husband, the billionaire coal baron Joe Craft, are mega MAGA-donors,” he writes.

“According to The Post, they gave ‘about $1.5 million to GOP candidates in 2016, including $270,800 to Trump’s campaign committee or his joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee.'”

He observes that Craft appears to be politically connected to the Trumps and the Republican leadership. She previously served as ambassador to Canada.

“Perhaps just as important from this president’s perspective, they are also ‘repeat, high-paying customers at Trump’s hotel in Washington.’ Craft’s other recommendation is that, as a Kentucky native, she is a supporter of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and is said to be friends with McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.”

“If confirmed, Craft will arrive at the United Nations as a laughingstock — just like her boss,” writes Boot, who left the Republican Party due to their embrace of President Donald Trump.

WHITE HOUSE PALACE INTRIGUE -- “Officials Play Down Appearance of Rift Between Trump and Lighthizer on Trade,” by WSJ’s Bob Davis: “U.S. trade officials are looking to knock down speculation of a split on China policy between President Trump and his lead trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, following a testy exchange between the two in the Oval Office Friday.

“The incident occurred in front of reporters Friday afternoon, as the president and cabinet officials met with China’s top trade envoy, Vice Premier Liu He, to announce that talks aimed at settling the U.S.-China trade dispute were making progress and would be extended through the weekend.

“Mr. Trump appeared to upbraid Mr. Lighthizer, who said he was negotiating memorandums of understanding with China. The MOUs cover a half-dozen subjects including agriculture, currency policy and technology transfer. ‘An MOU is a contract,’ Mr. Lighthizer said, turning to reporters. ‘A memorandum of understanding is a binding agreement between two people. And that’s what we’re talking about.’ That provoked what many saw as a rebuke from the president.” WSJ

-- WAPO’S DAVID NAKAMURA: “‘No rush’: Trump redefines success ahead of second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un”: “Days ahead of his second summit with Kim Jong Un, President Trump is redefining success in his bid to force North Korea to relinquish its nuclear program, tamping down public expectations amid evidence that Pyongyang has done little to curb its weapons production. Trump is hopeful that his bilateral meetings with Kim this week in Hanoi will re-create the international media spectacle of their historic first summit in Singapore last summer — and perhaps distract from mounting domestic political turmoil.

“But wide gaps remain between U.S. and North Korean negotiators, who have yet to agree on a basic definition of what ‘denuclearization’ means to both sides, according to U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks. Senior Trump aides have privately expressed skepticism over the prospects that a deal can be reached to significantly advance the largely symbolic agreement announced in Singapore.

“Some fear that Trump could feel pressure to make a major concession to Kim during face-to-face talks, including a one-on-one session, in hopes of securing a reciprocal commitment he can herald as a political victory.

“In recent days, Trump has sought to create the conditions to declare the summit a success regardless of the outcome. Having once demanded that the North give up its weapons quickly, Trump said last week he is in ‘no rush’ as long as the regime maintains a testing moratorium on nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles that has been in place since November 2017. ‘I have no pressing timetable,’ he said, adding that he expects his meeting with Kim in Hanoi won’t be their last.” WaPo

THE INVESTIGATIONS -- “Paul Manafort a ‘hardened’ and ‘bold’ criminal, Mueller prosecutors tell judge,” by WaPo’s Rachel Weiner: “Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is a ‘hardened’ criminal who ‘repeatedly and brazenly violated the law,’ prosecutors told a Washington federal judge. But in the filing submitted Friday and made partially public Saturday, they recommended no specific punishment for those crimes, saying that is the practice of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, whose office brought the case. Prosecutors noted that federal guidelines call for a sentence of 17 to 22 years, although under Manafort’s guilty plea in his D.C. case, the maximum he faces behind bars is 10.

“The special counsel team said it may ask for Judge Amy Berman Jackson to impose a sentence that runs after any prison time Manafort is given for related crimes in Virginia federal court. ‘Manafort chose repeatedly and knowingly to violate the law’” prosecutors said, from ‘garden-variety crimes such as tax fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice, and bank fraud’ to ‘more esoteric laws’ involving foreign lobbying. He lied, they noted, ‘to tax preparers, bookkeepers, banks, the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice National Security Division, the FBI, the Special Counsel’s Office, the grand jury, his own legal counsel, Members of Congress, and members of the executive branch of the United States government.’” WaPo ...

HOW ABOUT THAT … “In Latest Shift, Trump Agrees to Leave 400 Troops in Syria,” by NYT’s Mark Landler and Helene Cooper: “First, President Trump was going to pull all 2,000 American troops out of Syria immediately. Then he was going to slow down the withdrawal. Then he was going to leave troops in neighboring Iraq. Now, in the latest about-face, Mr. Trump has agreed to leave about 400 troops in Syria — 200 in a multinational force in the northeastern part of the country and another 200 at a small outpost in the southeast, where they will seek to counter Iran’s influence throughout the country.

“His decision to commit what one senior administration official described on Friday as a ‘couple hundred troops’ to the multinational force, operating south of the Turkish border, came after European allies refused to send troops if the United States would not. Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, pressed the president to make the decision on Thursday, this official said, amid signs that the Pentagon’s negotiations to put together a stabilization and monitoring force were foundering on European resistance.” NYT

US presidents have bombed or invaded places like Grenada, Panama, Iraq and Sudan to distract from domestic scandals or to gain a quick boost in popularity. But, do Canadian politicians also pursue regime change abroad to be cheered on by the dominant media as decisive leaders?

In a discussion on regime change in Venezuela after last Monday’s “Lima Group” meeting in Ottawa, Conservative foreign affairs critic Erin O’Toole praised Canadian policy but added that the Liberals used the meeting of countries opposed to Nicolas Maduro’s government to drown out criticism of their foreign policy. O’Toole claimed the “Lima Group” meeting was “put together quite quickly and I think there are some politics behind that with some of the foreign affairs challenges the Trudeau government has been having in recent months.” In other words, O’Toole believes the Liberals organized a gathering that concluded with a call for the military to oust Venezuela’s elected president to appear like effective international players.

Understood within the broader corporate and geopolitical context, O’Toole’s assessment appears reasonable. After being criticized for its China policy, the Liberals have been widely praised for their regime change efforts in Venezuela. In a sign of media cheerleading, CTV News host Don Martin began his post “Lima Group” interview with foreign minister Chrystia Freeland by stating “the Lima summit has wrapped and the object of regime change is staying put for the time being” and then he asked her “is [Venezuelan President Nicolas] Maduro any step closer to being kicked out of office as a result of this meeting today?” Later in the interview Martin applauded the “Lima Group’s” bid “to put the economic pincers around it [Venezuela’s economy] and choking it off from international transactions.”

In recent days Ben Rowswell, a former Canadian ambassador in Caracas, has been widely quoted praising the Liberals’ leadership on Venezuela. “It’s clear that the international community is paying attention to what Canada has to say about human rights and democracy,” Rowswell was quoted as saying in an article titled “Trudeau’s Venezuela diplomacy is a bright spot amid China furor”.

Rowswell heads the Canadian International Council, which seeks to “integrate business leaders with the best researchers and public policy leaders”, according to its billionaire financier Jim Balsillie. Long an influential voice on foreign policy, CIC hosted the above-mentioned forum with O’Toole that also included the Liberal’s junior foreign minister Andrew Leslie and NDP foreign affairs critic Hélène Laverdière. CIC’s post “Lima Group” meeting forum was co-sponsored with the Canadian Council of the Americas, which is led by Kinross, Kinross, ScotiaBank, KPMG and SNC Lavalin. On the day of the “Lima Group” meeting CCA head Ken Frankel published an op-ed in the Globe and Mail headlined “Venezuela crisis will be a true test of Canada’s leadership in the hemisphere.” Frankel told CPAC he was “always supportive of Canadian leadership in the Hemisphere” and “the Venezuela situation has presented … a perfect opportunity for the Trudeau government to showcase the principles of its foreign policy.”

At the CCA/CIC forum Laverdière made it clear there’s little official political opposition to Ottawa’s regime change efforts. The NDP’s foreign critic agreed with Canada’s recognition of Juan Guaidó as president of Venezuela, as she did on Twitter, at a press scrum and on CPAC during the day of the “Lima Group” meeting in Ottawa. (Amidst criticism from NDP activists, party leader Jagmeet Singh later equivocated on explicitly recognizing Guaidó.)

With the NDP, Conservatives, CIC, CCA, most media, etc. supporting regime change in Venezuela, there is little downside for the Liberals to push an issue they believe boosts their international brand. To get a sense of their brashness, the day of the “Lima Group” meeting the iconic CN Tower in Toronto was lit up with the colours of the Venezuelan flag. A tweet from Global Affairs Canada explained, “As the sun sets on today’s historic Lima Group meeting, Venezuela’s colours shine bright on Canada’s CN Tower to show our support for the people of Venezuela and their fight for democracy.”

The Liberals drive for regime change in Venezuela to mask other foreign-policy problem is reminiscent of Stephen Harper’s push to bomb Libya. Facing criticism for weakening Canada’s moral reputation and failing to win a seat on the UN Security Council, a Canadian general oversaw NATO’s war, seven CF-18s participated in bombing runs and two Royal Canadian Navy vessels patrolled Libya’s coast.

The mission, which began six weeks before the 2011 federal election, may have helped the Conservatives win a majority government. At the time Postmedia published a story titled “Libya ‘photo op’ gives Harper advantage: experts” and Toronto Star columnist Thomas Walkom published a commentary titled “Libyan war could be a winner for Harper”. He wrote: “War fits with the Conservative storyline of Harper as a strong, decisive leader. War against a notorious villain contradicts opposition charges of Conservative moral bankruptcy. The inevitable media stories of brave Canadian pilots and grateful Libyan rebels can only distract attention from the Conservative government’s real failings.”

Similar to Venezuela today, the regime change effort in Libya was unanimously endorsed in Parliament (three months into the bombing campaign Green Party MP Elizabeth May voted against a second resolution endorsing a continuation of the war). “It’s appropriate for Canada to be a part of this effort to try to stop Gadhafi from attacking his citizens as he has been threatening to do,’’ said NDP leader Jack Layton. After Moammar Gaddafi was savagely killed six months later, NDP interim leader Nycole Turmel released a statement noting, “the future of Libya now belongs to all Libyans. Our troops have done a wonderful job in Libya over the past few months.”

Emboldened by the opposition parties, the Conservatives organized a nationally televised post-war celebration for Canada’s “military heroes”, which included flyovers from a dozen military aircraft. Calling it “a day of honour”, Prime Minister Stephen Harper told the 300 military personnel brought in from four bases: “We are celebrating a great military success.”

Today Libya is, of course, a disaster. It is still divided into various warring factions and hundreds of militias operate in the country of six million.

But who in Canada ever paid a political price for the destruction of that country and resulting destabilization of much of the Sahel region of Africa?

A similar scenario could develop in Venezuela. Canadian politicians’ push for the military to remove the president could easily slide into civil war and pave the way to a foreign invasion that leads to a humanitarian calamity. If that happened, Canadian politicians, as in Libya, would simply wash their hands of the intervention.

195,Empty,2019-02-20T01:52:46Z,Corbella: Bigotry against western Canada keeps on rollin' by jaundiced commentators Calgary Herald The bigotry against Western Canada just keeps on rollin'.How else to describe the commentary on Twitter and in some other media coverage in Ottawa on...,"The bigotry against Western Canada just keeps on rollin’.

How else to describe the commentary on Twitter and in some other media coverage in Ottawa on Tuesday over the United We Roll convoy of some 200 trucks filled with people from across Canada protesting against federal government policies that harm Canada’s resource sector — particularly oil and gas.

Perhaps the best example of that virulent prejudice comes from Tabatha Southey, a columnist with Maclean’s, who wrote:

“Guys, they’re not ‘rolling into’ Ottawa. They drove there, on roads people drive on and that doesn’t oblige you to mythologize this thing to their liking. This is not Furiosa and Mad Max storming the Citadel. It’s more National Lampoon’s White Nationalist Vacation.”

“They’re not ‘rolling into’ Ottawa.” Huh? Well, they’re not bloody well flying. Last I looked, wheels on trucks go round and round and a succinct word for that is “rolling.” It’s hardly mythologizing to say so.

To call this convoy — that started in Red Deer on Valentine’s Day — “white nationalist” is nothing short of grotesque. Sure, these are not — for the most part — the folk Southey would invite to a swanky cocktail party in the halls of central Canadian power. But they are hard-working, taxpaying citizens doing their best to raise more of the same, and who are concerned mostly about what’s happening to Canada’s oil and gas sector, how it is attacked not just from outside Canada but from within their own federal government.

Might there be a white supremacist in the midst of them? It’s possible, just like it’s possible that some might attend those swanky cocktail parties, too.

Obviously, I wasn’t able to talk to every single person involved in this convoy, but I spoke to a good dozen or so in Red Deer — including a good number of yellow vesters — as it prepared to take off for Ottawa and I certainly didn’t meet any. And I actively tried to find some.

After all, one of the issues mentioned on the convoy’s Facebook page included opposition to the United Nations Global Compact For Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. Canada signed onto the migration compact in December and some people are concerned it will affect Canada’s sovereignty over its borders. There are some pretty ugly comments online over this compact. That doesn’t mean all opposition about it is illegitimate. That there is an issue with Canada’s southern border is also evident. That many Canadians — in fact a majority according to a January Ipsos poll — are unhappy with “irregular” migrants just walking over our border and jumping the queue into Canada, is not necessarily a sign of racism.

Ipsos CEO Darrell Bricker says Canadians seem to be more concerned than ever before about the process by which immigrants are admitted to Canada.

“In Canada, the focus doesn’t seem to be on the immigrants themselves, more about the process of how someone gets into the country,” Bricker said in a previous media comment.

It is too bad that yellow vesters are the majority of this convoy. It’s also unfortunate that immigration was brought into this protest at all. It de-legitimizes much of what they are saying about the need for pipelines and preventing potentially disastrous legislation.

On CBC TV’s Power & Politics, the reporter who was invited to the show to talk about the rally on Parliament Hill following an almost five-day, 3,200-kilometre drive didn’t even mention the carbon tax, or Bills C-69 or C-48, which are the main causes of concern and reason behind this convoy. It’s troubling and, again, so very bigoted.

But for the folk on the convoy, they clearly aren’t watching CBC or following anti-convoy trolls on Twitter.

Convoy manager Glen Carritt said everyone was completely “overwhelmed by the support they received from across Canada.

“We really learned from being on the road that Canada wants to be united and support the oil and gas sector,” said Carritt, who was reached in Ottawa shortly after the convoy moved off of Parliament Hill.

“Right from the time we left Red Deer, then to Saskatchewan, Manitoba and then when we drove into Ontario, the crowds of people on overpasses holding signs or along the roads it was just unbelievable,” said the Innisfail town councillor and owner/operator of OP Fire and Safety — which provides medical and fire services to oilfields across all of Western Canada.

What does he think about media comments that the United We Roll convoy is white supremacist or racist?

“Those people have to drive on the convoy with us and meet us and all the people we saw on the road and that would change their mind,” said Carritt, 53, who has two grown children and two grandkids.

He says convoy participants were delighted that federal Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer and several other MPs took the time to address the convoy.

Does he think the message about the importance of Canada’s oil and gas industry to the well-being of the country was muddied and discredited by members bringing up the UN migration compact?

“We welcomed everyone to join this movement who isn’t hateful or racist and who wanted to draw attention to the damaging actions of the federal government against an industry that is hurting and that the entire country relies upon for its well-being,” said Carritt. “That’s just some people who want to change the narrative. The real narrative is this convoy has done more to reunite Canada than anything that’s happened in recent history and I think people are holding on to hope that we might get some change in our government.”

That’s perhaps an overly rosy view that Carritt has from his windshield reflecting off of his fire-engine-red truck.

It’s more accurate than the jaundiced one being spouted by cynical commentators.

""Listen, we stand together united as a country,"" Lethbridge MP Rachael Harder told the crowd. ""This is about developing an energy industry that keeps us alive and gives us a place on the world stage.""

It was also about other things. Members of the convoy, which left Red Deer, Alta., on Feb. 14, expressed a wide variety of demands. Primary among them were scrapping the federal carbon tax and two bills that overhaul environmental assessments of energy projects and ban oil tankers from the northern coast of British Columbia.

Another equally prominent complaint is that Canada signed a non-binding United Nations agreement on migration in December, supposedly surrendering its immigration policies to foreigners.

Mark Friesen, a convoy organizer from Saskatoon, spoke for a second time Wednesday, attacking so-called ""global governance"" and saying policies down to the municipal level were the results of agreements with the United Nations to implement its sustainable development agenda.

Friesen, like many of the convoy participants, is affiliated with the populist ""yellow-vest"" movement, which critics have accused of being racist and anti-immigrant. Other organizers said that yellow-vest members were welcome but the convoy was not a yellow-vest action.

In the order they appear: Edmonton’s Dana Flick who drove to Ottawa with the convoy, Harold Stewart from Vittoria, Ontario, and United We Roll Convoy head organizer Glen Carritt explain what they believe the protest has achieved. 1:54

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, finance critic Pierre Poilievre, several other Tories, and People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier also addressed the demonstration Tuesday, all sticking to their support of oil and gas pipelines and the energy industry and staying away from talk about the United Nations, immigration and the idea that appeared on some protest placards that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should be arrested for treason.

When the convoy left Alberta, it claimed more than 150 vehicles and about that many people gathered on Parliament's lawn Tuesday. By Wednesday, an assortment of about 40 semis, pickups and cars occupied several blocks in front of Parliament and 50 or so people listened to the final speeches.","Shrunken protest convoy leaves Ottawa after second day, enjoying Tory support",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/smaller-convoy-protest-leaves-ottawa-1.5027385

Updated

The US-China trade war, arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, and the world's first genetically edited baby were among the top 10 most censored topics on WeChat in 2018, newly published research has revealed.

Key points: WeChat has a keyword filter that censors sensitive information before it's published

Censored topics reflect Chinese leader's priority to maintain social stability, experts say

There have also been reports of censorship in private conversation on the platform

WeChatscope, a research project at the University of Hong Kong's Journalism and Media Studies Centre, investigated the scope of topics censored on China's most popular social media platform by tracking more than 4,000 public accounts covering daily news throughout last year.

By the end of 2018, the team found that about 11,000 of the 1.04 million articles reviewed as part of the project had been removed by China's censorship regime.

The list of the 10 most controversial topics also included the high-profile Fan Bingbing tax fraud scandal, which led to the actress's disappearance, as well as the Chinese rabies vaccine scandal in July last year where manufacturer Changsheng Biotechnology was found to have fabricated records.

WeChat, like the majority of Chinese social media platforms, has a keyword filter that automatically censors sensitive information before it's published. This means well-known politically sensitive topics such as the Tiananmen Square massacre or the Xinjiang re-education camps never even make it through to publication.

The data collected by the researchers, however, is novel in that it involved topics and keywords on subjects that made it through to publication but were then pulled or censored.

The researchers said the findings showed the range of censored topics had ""expanded from domestic policies and social unrest to less politically sensitive topics, in what seems to be an effort to support China's international political image as a 'great power'"".

Florian Schneider, director of the Leiden Asia Centre in Netherlands and author of China's Digital Nationalism, told the ABC that anything that challenged the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) mandate or ability to govern the country was seen as ""dangerous"".

""Any suggestions that something might be amiss in Chinese society is highly sensitive, because it raises the question: why are the leaders not creating the social progress they've promised?"" Dr Schneider said.

""Then there is the fact that the party sees itself as the moral leadership of society, which means that it carefully monitors any potential 'unhealthy' content, which means values and norms that run counter to party doctrine.""

'This content has been deleted by the publisher'

In addition to looking at the scope of topics censored, the university research team also analysed the range of official explanations given to authors and readers for the removal of a post.

The most common reason out of four typical ones identified was: ""This content has been deleted by the publisher.""

""Self-censorship is a common practice among internet users in China as online speech can easily bring them trouble,"" the report said.

""Posts that cite unofficial sources of information can easily be charged with spreading rumours if they are re-posted more than 500 times.

""Users will often remove their own posts if they receive warning from senior colleagues or employers.""

The three other reasons were that the content violated related laws and regulations, the account was blocked, or that the content had been reported by multiple people.

Dr Schneider said many of the top censored topics of 2018 followed a long-established pattern of Chinese censorship, including hot-button issues that are pervasive in Chinese society such as health scandals and fraud cases.

""[These] remind citizens that society is by no means as 'stable' as the Chinese leadership claims,"" he said.

""You also see an example of how the CCP tries to curb topics that might inspire collective action, especially collective action that might challenge the status quo.""

He said the #MeToo movement — including the sexual harassment allegations against a Peking University professor — fell into this category.

Meanwhile, topics such as the US-China trade war and US sanctions against Chinese company ZTE may suggest that the country's economy might be in trouble.

Last year, US President Donald Trump imposed import tariffs on $US200 billion worth of Chinese imports and threatened more, prompting a retaliation from China with tariffs of its own on the US.

""Since the CCP has tied much of its legitimacy to the promise of increased prosperity and welfare, such an economic downturn might raise questions about the party's ability to deliver on its promise"", Dr Schneider said.

'Chinese Government scrambles to counter the narrative'

As controversial topics are censored, Titus Chen, associate professor at the National Sun Yat-Sen University's Institute of Political Science, told the ABC the Chinese Government simultaneously carried out ""cyber propaganda operations"" to counter the narrative.

""[As posts are pulled] the Chinese Government scrambles to flood the internet with official, sanitised versions of stories touching on the same topics in order to shape and lead online public opinion,"" he said.

""Authors and distributors of online critical or anti-regime information may, as a number of cases have shown, be subject to not only online censorship but offline criminal repressions.

""In particular, censorship, when employed along with cyber propaganda operations, can create a national echo chamber in which only pro-Beijing contents can be found.""

While the research focused on public accounts, there have also been reports of censorship in private conversations on the platform, which is said to have more than 1 billion active users.

Last year, an ABC journalist struggled to receive a picture of the Chinese President from an interviewee because the Chinese app repeatedly blocked it.

While Tencent, the founder of WeChat, is a private company, it is required to follow domestic laws.

Dr Schneider said the Chinese state had cleverly outsourced much of its censorship activities to private actors, who self-censor based on murky rules and regulations, and always worried that a transgression might cost them their media licence.

""Large corporations like Tencent, Sina, or Baidu are bound to have close contacts to CCP cadres, if their managers are not party members themselves, and this assures that they have a general sense of the topical areas the party finds sensitive at any given moment,"" he said.

""However, the fact that the guidelines are fairly unclear creates strong pressures to over-censor.

""Private companies are often more conservative in their judgement because they feel the need to play it safe in order to continue operating a lucrative business in China.""

The ABC has approached Tencent for comment but they did not respond at the time of publication.

Instead of purchasing rail cars, the government as part of its crude-by-rail strategy will buy rail service from Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway to ship crude oil to international markets, including the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Initial estimates last November called for 7,000 rail cars, but the province decided only 4,400 would be required after talks with the railway companies found more efficient rail routes to move the 120,000 barrels of oil per day, the original goal set by the government.

Along with curtailment measures, Notley said this plan is an interim solution to help curb the oil price differential, reiterating that pipelines to tidewater is the only long-term option.

“The investment … and the elevation of the amount of crude going by rail comes as a result of successive federal governments failing to get the appropriate regulatory regime in place so that we can build new pipelines,” Notley said.

Looking at the Trans Mountain pipeline, Notley said she is still “cautiously optimistic” that construction will resume in the fall. But the province is “not happy” with the silence from the federal government for an interim plan.

“There comes a time when … debating the number of angels on a pin with the federal government is not of value. Moving forward to protect Albertans is,” she said.

The Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission (APMC) is currently negotiating market destinations, off-loading sites and purchase agreements with crude oil producers. The province expects anticipated revenues of around $5.9 billion throughout the three-year program from commercial oil sales and increased royalty revenue. With an expected investment of $3.7 billion into the program, the government is forecasting a profit of $2.2 billion.

Trains carrying oil are expected on the track by next July, transporting about 20,000 barrels a day, and then reach full capacity within a year.

The added rail shipments are projected to narrow the oil price gap by up to US$4 per barrel from the beginning of 2020 to late 2021. Notley said the plan wouldn’t impact agricultural products being moved out of the province and the government was assured there would be enough capacity for both.

Industry response

The national lobby group for Canada’s oil industry called the move Tuesday a “positive decision.”

“We absolutely support any effort to support market access particularly in the short term,” said Ben Brunnen, vice-president, oilsands and fiscal operation with the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

This is one step closer to removing the need for curtailment, which Brunnen said is the ultimate goal.

Calgary-based oil company Cenovus Energy Inc. said in a statement the increased rail capacity is encouraging and on its own has already entered into a three-year agreement with major rail companies to transport about 100,000 barrels per day along the U.S. Gulf Coast.

‘Fiscal train wreck’

United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney called the plan a “fiscal train wreck” and took issue with the $3.7-billion price tag during the election campaign period.

“The government should not be encumbering a prospective future government or taxpayers with multibillion-dollar decisions,” he told reporters. “They had nearly four years to do this before now.”

If elected, Kenney said the UCP would review every contract signed by the current government during the legal campaign period — that came into effect Feb. 1 — to ensure they complied with public interest and value for taxpayers.

“If we believe that we can cancel contracts and save billions of tax dollars we will do so,” he said in response to whether the UCP will look to end the crude-by-rail plan. “It exposes taxpayers to serious risk by a government trying to spend like drunken sailors when they’re probably on their way out the door.”

199,Empty,2019-02-24T15:27:18Z,"Historically, successful Black Canadian politicians have operated as quiet leaders and shy elitists.","In 1971, the Yale professor Robin Winks wrote that Black Canadians wanted “nothing more than to be accepted as quiet Canadians.”

In The Blacks in Canada, Winks claimed that Black Canadians were “unlikely to organize militant, noisy, pushy protests.” He considered Daniel Hill, the first full-time director of the Ontario Human Rights Commission in 1962, to be an exemplary model of quiet leadership.

Hill returned the compliment by praising Winks’ history of Blacks in Canada as a powerful tool in his campaigns against serious discrimination in housing, education and employment. Hill’s study of human rights in Canada for the Canadian Labour Congress in 1977 also denounced “aspiring leaders” in militant organizations who did not propose what he considered to be constructive action.

Yet whereas Winks was a rather unabashed elitist who had little time for “simple minds,” Hill translated the work he gleaned from “obscure historical journals” into popular histories. He would work closely with his friend Alan Borovoy, the longtime general counsel for the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, who defined his anti-racist campaigns against “ineffectual intellectuals with no concept of action.”

Hill and Borovoy may be described as Canadian “shy elitists.” They were uncomfortable with anything that they considered too elitist or radical for Canadian tastes. Yet they also encouraged the public to celebrate and defer to prominent, “respectable” figures in elite institutions.

Since we have not ended our dependence on shy elitism, there remains an understandable interest in celebrating Black men and women who have achieved recognition from the Canadian state.

Canada Post

However, we also need to recognize that Black Canadians are not problems when they do not conform to the model of a quiet leader. They are people who confront the problem of shy elitism in Canada.

Consider some of the challenges faced by the politician, social worker, human rights advocate and academic Rosemary Brown.

Introducing Rosemary Brown

Rosemary Brown moved to Canada in 1951 from Jamaica to study social work at McGill University. She became the first Black woman elected to a provincial legislature in Canada in 1972 and the first Black person to run for leadership of a federal political party in 1975.

(CP PHOTO/Ryan Remiorz)

Featured in a profile in the Toronto Star on Jan. 9, 1973, Brown was introduced as a “McGill University graduate, wife of Vancouver psychiatrist and mother of two.” Aside from the sexism of highlighting her marital and parental status, such descriptive remarks reminded Canadian readers that Brown was educated at McGill, an institution known for training young people to become the next generation of quiet Canadian leaders.

In other words, Brown was portrayed as a solid, respectable member of the middle class who defied North American stereotypes of Black cultural pathology and single mothers raising children outside of nuclear families.

Brown responded to these media profiles by pointing to her upbringing in Jamaica in the 1930s and ‘40s. Unlike Blacks in Canada in the 1960s and '70s, she could claim that she grew up in an environment in which the “governor was Black, judges were Black, the police were Black, anyone who was anyone was Black.”

Exoticizing Rosemary Brown

In the British Columbia legislature, politicians like Pat Jordan, the conservative-populist Social Credit Party MLA, asked why Brown did not move back to Jamaica to solve its problems of “slave labour and poverty.”

Media profiles questioned Brown’s socialist credentials by pointing to her comfortable upbringing and privileged status in Jamaica. Stories in The Vancouver Sun highlighted her expensive home in the fashionable Point Grey area and her Parisian wardrobe. Chatelaine magazine depicted Brown as “deliciously minority and yet so chic.”

Brown’s dismissal of these sneers about radical chic did not go unnoticed by Canadian commentators. Journalist Allan Fotheringham identified a certain haughtiness in Brown’s public demeanour. Bob Hunter, the public intellectual, eco-theorist and founder of Greenpeace, said that Brown had to pass through hoops that were understandably frustrating to someone with her intelligence and potential to become Canada’s “Philosopher Queen.”

Domesticating Rosemary Brown

In her autobiography, Brown conceded that she increasingly felt the need to communicate her message in the “safest, most acceptable and bland” terms to the Canadian voter.

(CP PHOTO/Tom Hanson)

This did not mean that she shied away from controversial issues. It did mean, however, that her campaign to become the federal leader of Canada’s left-leaning New Democratic Party would repeat Canadian platitudes. It was claimed, for example, that the candidacy of a Jamaican-born feminist offered voters an opportunity to live up to Canada’s claim to be a multicultural “nation of immigrants.”

Brown also stressed that responsible, quiet human rights organizations had “more lasting impact on the quality of life” of Black Canadians than more prominent or newsworthy radical organizations.

Although she would not win the NDP leadership, Brown would emerge from the contest with a national profile as a dynamic speaker who could convey the realities of racism and sexism in a manner that was palatable to “ordinary, fair-minded Canadians.”

Brown was increasingly portrayed in the media as a responsible Canadian who encouraged minorities and women to achieve major social change by working inside formal institutions.

Unsettling shy elitism

Brown upheld the legacy of Daniel Hill as chief commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Agency between 1993 and 1996. She also became an Officer in the Order of Canada in 1996 after she lamented the failure of academics and critical theorists to do anything that might appear “commercialized, common or ordinary.”

Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose?

To unsettle the system of shy elitism in Canada, we need to contest oversimplified solutions to the so-called problem of Blackness in Canada.

201,Empty,2019-02-23T14:49:14Z,All-in-one ETF portfolios make investing easier and cheaper than ever [Globe & Mail],"In many aspects of our lives, we embrace convenience. We buy prepared meals instead of assembling and cooking the ingredients ourselves. We shop in malls rather than driving to four or five individual stores. We recognize our time is valuable and our mental bandwidth is limited, so we look for very good solutions, not perfect ones.

Except when it comes to investing. It’s the one area where simple, excellent options are available, yet too many people resist them because they’re too, well, simple. Here’s hoping a recent trend in the ETF marketplace will help investors overcome that tendency.

In the past year or so, all three of Canada’s largest exchange-traded-fund providers have launched products that allow investors to own a complete portfolio with just one trade. Each includes a mix of global stocks and bonds, so anyone with a brokerage account can get extremely broad diversification with minimal maintenance and rock-bottom costs.

Story continues below advertisement

Vanguard Canada was the first ETF provider to launch one-ticket solutions just over a year ago, and iShares followed in December. Earlier this month, BMO joined the party with its own family of all-in-one portfolios.

Let’s look at a typical example: the Vanguard Balanced ETF Portfolio (VBAL). Like its counterparts, it’s a “fund of funds” built using seven underlying ETFs. There are three for fixed income: one each for Canadian, the United States, and global bonds. Then there are four equity components: Canadian, U.S., international developed and emerging markets. Vanguard has estimated that the portfolio offers exposure to about 94 per cent of the world’s public markets.

VBAL has a long-term target of 40-per-cent bonds and 60-per-cent stocks, which is the traditional split for a balanced portfolio. But there are other options for people with different risk profiles, ranging from just 20-per-cent stocks in the Vanguard Conservative Income ETF Portfolio (VCIP) to 80-per-cent stocks in the aggressive Vanguard Growth ETF Portfolio (VGRO). All the funds have the same components, just in different proportions.

The iShares and BMO families are very similar. They vary in their specific holdings, but they all include a target allocation of Canadian and non-Canadian bonds, plus an equity mix with one-quarter to one-third domestic stocks, with the remainder split between the U.S. and overseas markets. In all, we’re talking about thousands of stocks and bonds from around the world, which is all the diversification anyone needs.

Moreover, as markets move in different directions and at different rates, the ETFs will be rebalanced so they maintain those long-term targets. This feature makes them virtually maintenance-free, and it puts some competitive heat on robo-advisers, the online services that charge about 0.50 per cent and advertise automatic rebalancing as one of their key benefits.

And the price tag for this elegant portfolio? The management fees range from 0.18 per cent to 0.22 per cent, which is about 90-per-cent cheaper than traditional balanced mutual funds. On a $100,000 portfolio, the monthly cost is a little more than you’re paying for Netflix.

The good news is that these all-in-one ETF portfolios have been embraced by many do-it-yourself investors: VGRO, for example, has attracted more than $570-million in assets in barely a year. But there has been resistance, too. I’ve heard from many investors who are concerned the funds are not optimized for tax-efficiency, or that you could reduce your fees even further by buying the underlying holdings individually. But how many honestly believe they can build and maintain a better portfolio? In the real world – where people are busy with work and family, and would rather watch the hockey game than fiddle with a spreadsheet – no one manages their portfolio optimally.

Story continues below advertisement

Others dismiss these funds as cookie-cutter solutions, or argue that they’re only appropriate for very small accounts or unsophisticated investors. What nonsense. I’ve reviewed a lot of portfolios over the years, with six- and seven-figure balances, many of which were designed by people who manage money for a living. Almost none of them were more thoughtfully structured than what Vanguard, iShares and BMO have packed into a single ETF.

Are these products right for everyone? Certainly not. Are they perfect? No, but neither is any other option. And here’s the thing: You don’t need an optimal portfolio, you just need an excellent one. No one has ever failed to meet their financial goals because they had exposure to only 94 per cent of the world’s stock and bond markets, or because they failed to keep their investing costs lower than 0.18 per cent. Countless millions have failed by trying to do better.

Eating well and staying in shape takes a lot of effort: It’s much easier to flop on the couch and order pizza. Learning to speak Gaelic, playing the trombone, nurturing a romantic relationship – these take a lot of work. But successful investing is the opposite: You usually thrive by doing less, not more. With the appearance of these all-in-one ETFs, building an extremely well-diversified portfolio has never been easier or cheaper. The only problem that lingers is the one in the mirror.

202,Empty,2019-02-19T10:00:48Z,"Meet the British politician who says he is tackling Mark Zuckerberg's ""pattern of avoiding scrutiny"" over disinformation and fake news.","On a cold November day in London, a demonstrator wearing a large papier-mâché mask of Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg stood outside the U.K. parliament in silent protest, holding up a sign emblazoned with two words: “Where’s Mark?”

That question was on the lips of many lawmakers in London that day. More than 20 politicians from nine countries, including Ireland and Canada, had gathered in Westminster. All were worried about Facebook’s role in the spread of disinformation, and all were upset that Zuckerberg had spurned three official invitations for questioning. While the lawmakers couldn’t force Zuckerberg to attend, they laid out an empty chair to represent the missing CEO — and British parliamentary aides ensured photos were sent out to the world’s media.

The stunt was devised by Damian Collins, the leader of a U.K. parliamentary investigation into disinformation and “fake news.” The scope of that investigation ranges from Russian election interference to the changing landscape of traditional media, and from Brexit to Trump via Cambridge Analytica.

On Monday, Collins published the final report of that investigation, which proved to be a damning indictment of Facebook. The report accuses Facebook of “intentionally and knowingly” violating data privacy and competition laws; labels top executives “digital gangsters;” and calls for urgent action to regulate social media and investigate Facebook’s alleged lawbreaking. The culmination of 18 months of careful evidence-gathering, the scathing report now makes the U.K. one of the loudest voices calling for legal constraints on Facebook’s power.

“We need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people,” Collins said in a statement Monday morning. “The age of inadequate self-regulation must come to an end.” In its response to the report, Facebook said it is open to “meaningful regulation.”

Collins launched his probe in early 2017, just months after the U.K. voted to leave the E.U. and Donald Trump was elected U.S. President. At the time, the spread of “fake news” was just starting to become a broader topic of interest, and Collins was curious to understand more about how disinformation spreads on social media.

The investigation proceeded quietly for the first few months, but rocketed to global prominence in March 2018, when the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. Collins and his colleagues questioned the whistleblower Christopher Wylie for nearly four hours that same month, in what became the most-streamed select committee hearing in the history of the U.K. parliament.

Collins says the Cambridge Analytica development helped put the issue in the spotlight. It made the general public realize “that content is targeted at people in ways they don’t often see or understand,” he told TIME in an interview in his office in January, ahead of the report’s publication. “The ethics of that, and the mechanism for doing that, became a really important part of the inquiry as well.”

As a lawmaker, Collins doesn’t hold the same legal powers of subpoena that, say, Special Counsel Robert Mueller does. But faced with what he calls Facebook’s “pattern of avoiding scrutiny,” including avoiding questioning and giving misleading answers, he has used the full scope of powers available to him in an unusual fashion.

“Damian Collins is starting to use the muscle of parliament in a way that hasn’t been in decades,” Charlie Angus, a Canadian lawmaker who came to London to be part of that international panel in November, tells TIME. “The system is very much based on a gentleman’s code: you assume that if you come before a parliamentary committee of course you’re going to tell the truth. But we were dealing with players that didn’t seem to feel that those rules applied to them.”

Speaking to TIME in September, Wylie quipped that Collins was his favorite lawmaker from Prime Minister Theresa May’s ruling Conservative Party, which elsewhere has pushed restrictive policies including a digital surveillance law.

“Damian is the only politician who has gone out of his way to learn about all of this,” Wylie said. “He’s gotten textbooks, he’s played with Facebook’s ad systems, he’s made things.”

In Collins’ office in parliament, overflowing bookshelves point to that curiosity. On a coffee table, a book about the art and science of video games sits among a stack of others, spanning Ancient Greek art to British political history.

That scope is necessary when it comes to understanding what future historians might refer to as the “data wars,” a term used regularly by Angus, the Canadian lawmaker. Facebook’s influence is international, requiring an understanding of global politics; its impact on the human brain is being studied by psychologists and neuroscientists; the laws that regulate it are the remit of legal specialists; and understanding the infrastructure behind it requires a grounding in computer programming and the history of the Internet.

In November, Collins took his most unprecedented step yet. After receiving a tip-off that Ted Kramer, a U.S. businessman engaged in an ongoing court case with Facebook, was in the U.K. on a business trip, Collins sent a parliamentary serjeant-at-arms (an officer who wears a sword in parliament) to Kramer’s hotel room. The officer escorted Kramer to Collins’ office, where Collins demanded he hand over internal Facebook documents from a Dropbox folder on his phone. According to a court filing, Kramer “panicked” after being told he could be fined or imprisoned, and handed over confidential documents — including emails sent by Zuckerberg.

Those documents had been sealed by a California judge. But Collins argued that his jurisdiction as a U.K. lawmaker meant that his actions — first seizing the documents, then publishing a selection of them in December — were totally legal.

“There was significant public interest in the release of this information,” Collins tells TIME. “These documents really expose some very important information around the way Facebook made user data available to other companies. The way they exercise their commercial power.”

Together with New York Times reports published in December, the documents painted a picture of Facebook failing to fully implement a stricter set of privacy rules when they came up against lucrative deals Facebook had with other companies.

In 2013, Cambridge Analytica obtained the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users, through a quiz app that scraped the personal information of not only the people who played it, but their friends too. In 2014 Facebook implemented stricter privacy rules, preventing apps from accessing the data of a user’s friends. Facebook said these rules would prevent a Cambridge Analytica-style breach happening again.

But the emails released by Collins, along with the Times reports, show how Facebook allowed business partners, including Microsoft, Netflix and Spotify, to continue to access that “friends data,” as insiders call it, after the 2014 changes. (Such data can include users’ friends lists, page likes, access to private messages, and more.)

And in other emails made public by Collins, Zuckerberg is shown acting in ways that Collins says could run foul of antitrust law. In one email from 2013, Zuckerberg personally authorizes staff to cut off the access of Vine, a competitor, to Facebook data.

“Twitter launched Vine today, which lets you shoot multiple short video segments to make one single, 6-second video,” a Facebook executive wrote to Zuckerberg. “Unless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API [Facebook data] access today.”

“Yup, go for it,” Zuckerberg replied.

Collins suggests that decision was instrumental in Vine eventually being shut down in 2016, in the face of strong competition from Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, and Snapchat. “Three or four words just closed a business,” Collins tells TIME. “Rather like the Roman Emperor. Thumb up or thumb down.”

While Facebook isn’t legally required to provide its data to anybody, selectively cutting out competitors could fall foul of E.U. competition law. “The decision to turn off Vine[’s access] seems to be done simply because it looked like a commercial rival,” says Collins.

Zuckerberg, in a statement posted to his personal Facebook page, said the emails were taken out of context, adding: “We’ve never sold anyone’s data.”

On that point, Collins is unequivocal. The emails he released, he says, show that “some companies continued to have privileged access” to Facebook data on users and their friends. “If you make money by giving people special access to data that no one else gets to have, what’s the difference between that and selling it?”

While we’re waiting for Team Trump to make America great again, it’s useful to know what a not-great country such as Sweden offers its citizens. As Shakespeare observed, comparisons are odorous, but things smell good there. Ad Policy

Not even the conservative Swedish parties and the far-right anti-immigrant party, which together won 205 seats in the September 2018 parliamentary elections (out of 349), would dare disparage the Swedish welfare system. According to Frida Stranne, a senior lecturer in political science at Halmstad University, the right “doesn’t question its merits. Rather, the conservative and neoliberal parties debate the number of days parents can stay home with newborns or sick children, or the percent of their salary they’ll get while away from work. But the benefits are still very high.”

Let’s first set the record straight. Although American conservatives frequently claim that Sweden is socialist or even communist, it’s not. Private businesses are very much alive and well. Think Ikea, H&M, and Ericsson electronics (respectively, 300,000, 114,000, and 55,000 employees worldwide in 2018); Volvo and Electrolux (the world’s second-largest home-appliance manufacturer); and a huge arms industry.

Second, comparisons with the United States—which right-wing commentators insist are inappropriate—are quite sensible, since the cost of living in Sweden’s major cities is close to what it is in America’s big cities. Related Article After I Lived in Norway, America Felt Backward. Here’s Why. Ann Jones

True, Sweden’s population is not big: just 10 million people and 225,000 reindeer. But its benefits are. Warning: The list is so fantastic, it may seem like fake news.

§ Family Care: Day-care and preschool programs are almost free, with fees based on family income: If parents are unemployed, child care is totally free. So too are the first 15 hours a week for children aged 3 to 6 in all families—regardless of their income. Fees for other families are on a sliding scale, with a ceiling of $157 a month—about 10 percent of the actual cost. Most Swedes place their children in public programs (though private and cooperative ones are available). And parents get a $136-per-month stipend for a child under 16, another $152 a month for a second child, and $198 for a third (2018 figures).

In the United States in 2016, the average cost for one week in a child-care center was $196. After-school sitters cost on average $214 for 15 hours a week ($14 an hour), and a nanny costs $555. Current Issue View our current issue

Swedish pregnant women get free and subsidized prenatal care and parents get 480 days of paid leave when a child is born or adopted, which they can share (240 days each). (Sweden was the first country to offer fathers paid parental leave, in 1974.) For the first three months of a baby’s life, fathers may take another 10 days (on top of the 480). For 390 days of the total, parents get nearly 80 percent of their pay (the cap is $3,259 a month, or $105 a day), while the remaining 90 days are paid at a flat rate. Parents with twins get another half-year. Also, the 480 days can be used until a child is 8. Parents can also reduce their normal work hours by up to 25 percent until their child is 8—but they’re paid only for the time they work.

Parents get about 80 percent of their salaries when they stay home with a sick child (up to age 12). They can take this temporary leave up to 120 days a year.

In the United States, only California, New Jersey, and New York have laws giving employees four to 10 weeks of paid leave when they have a child—at 55–70 percent of their salaries. Two others recently passed laws: Washington State will give 12 paid weeks, starting in 2020, at up to 90 percent of a worker’s salary; Washington, DC, will give eight weeks at a partial salary—but only for those working in the private sector.

§ Education: Kindergarten through high school is free, as are school lunches. Undergraduate college/university tuition is also free. If students need money for books, food, and housing, they get nearly no-interest loans (at 0.13 percent); thus, when they graduate, they often have zero debt (yes, you read this correctly), particularly if they live with parents while in school. Postgraduate education, such as medical and law school, is also free. Not surprisingly, doctors and lawyers don’t need to make huge salaries to repay mountains of debt.

Speaking of which: In the United States, where colleges and universities are not free, the average debt for a four-year graduate in 2018 is $29,800. For law-school graduates, average debt that year was between $90,000 and $120,000, and those completing medical school in 2018 owed an average of $197,000.

Swedish undergraduates aged 16–20 also get $136 monthly stipends during the school year. If their families are low-income, they may get more.

§ Medical Care: Medical and hospital care are basically free until age 20. After then, doctor visits cost Swedes $10 to $32, or up to $38 for specialists. After people meet a $119 annual deductible, all care is free. Moreover, medicine is free after a $239 yearly deductible. Drugs are the same price at all pharmacies, so people needn’t shop around for the best price.

Swedes do pay out of pocket for eyeglasses. Dental care is free for children up to age 19, but not for adults.

§ Unemployment Benefits: Swedes get unemployment benefits from two sources. The government gives $40 a day ($198 a week) for up to 300 days if people worked 40-hour weeks before they became jobless (or less, if they worked fewer hours). And if they have a child under 18, the benefit may continue for another 150 days. However, to be eligible, they must be looking for work and willing to take a job for at least three hours a day.

The second source of unemployment benefits is the union insurance plan (nearly 70 percent of Swedes belong to unions), to which both employees and employers contribute. The plans provide 80 percent of Swedes’ wages/salaries for the first 200 days they’re out of work and 70 percent for the next 100. The cap is almost $100 a day for the first 100 days and $83 for the next 200 days.

When they are sick and unable to work, Swedes get paid leave (except for the first day off from work) for about 80 percent of their normal pay, up to $84 (2018 figures) a day.

In the United States, no federal law mandates paid sick days, but nine states and the District of Columbia require employers to give three-to-seven days a year, based on the size of the business. In the other 41 states, employers are not required to cover any sick days.

§ Pensions: Although these used to be higher, they’re still substantial, based on earnings. According to Mikael Törnwall, an author and journalist who writes on economic issues at Svenska Dagbladet, a Stockholm daily, “If people had low-paying jobs, they won’t get much. But it’s still enough to get by and not be homeless. Besides a modest pension, low-income elderly or disabled Swedes also get a housing allowance.”

Pensions are covered by the government or union/employer plans. If Swedes have low-paying jobs (under $40,000 a year), the government and employers pay into the plans, but the employees don’t contribute. If they have middle- and higher-income jobs, they must contribute, along with their employers.

The plans are for private- and public-sector jobs. Törnwall says that private companies “offer better pensions, to compete for better employees.”

§ Transportation Perks: Government subsidies vary. For example, people pushing baby strollers or carriages in some cities (such as Stockholm) ride for free on the buses. In others (such as Gothenburg), retired Swedes pay nothing, except during rush hours.

§ Housing Subsidies: Local governments subsidize low-income and elderly Swedes’ rental housing and also help them find it. The amount is based on their income and the local cost of living.

In large cities like Stockholm, affordable housing is hard to find—whether to buy or rent (for which the wait is long). Thus Swedes now live farther outside the central cities and tend to buy their houses/apartments.

§ Wages: Sweden doesn’t have a minimum wage. Instead, unions and employers negotiate wages/salaries. This is particularly important for low-income workers: A cashier at a Swedish McDonald’s earns $15 an hour (compared to $8.90 in the United States). Törnwall says very few Swedes earn less than $10 an hour. The average annual salary is $45,000.

Since most middle- and upper-income Swedes join unions, this means still more benefits: For example, members get larger pensions if they make small (about $10 a month) contributions to a union’s insurance fund. Union agreements even affect Swedes who negotiate their own salaries, since employers use them as benchmarks.

Salaries for some occupations—say, engineering—depend on the level of education. If you’re a top engineer, Törnwall says, you’ll earn more in the United States, but you won’t have the benefits Swedes enjoy.

The US federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, which hasn’t been raised since 2009. However, as of February 2019, 29 states, including DC, had adopted higher minimum wages, from $7.50 in New Mexico to $15 in California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Washington, DC, which will take effect in the early/mid-2020s.

Prison wages are higher in Sweden too: Inmates earn $1.40 an hour for participating in activities such as mental-health therapy, sports, and on-site jobs—and can contribute to their families’ income. In the United States, low-skilled prisoners, such as those who mop floors, earn 14–63 cents an hour ($20–88 a month), while higher-skilled inmates, such as plumbers or mechanics, earn $2–9 a day (up to about $200 a month) for work inside the prison. Prisoners serving as firefighters in California’s recent fires earned $1 a day.

§ Income Equality: Although Sweden is one of the world’s most equal societies, the gap between rich and poor has grown in the past 30 years. Still, based on the Gini coefficient (which measures income inequality, with zero meaning perfect equality), Sweden scored a 29 in 2015, while the United States scored 41.

Noting that the country’s capitalist system finances a big welfare state, Törnwall says the public accepts this because “Swedes don’t approve of enormous income differences and they want everyone to have a reasonable standard of living.”

Törnwall, who lived several years in the United States, says, “Americans value individual freedom, while Swedes value economic safety. Also, Americans believe people should have equal opportunities and if they don’t make it, society isn’t obliged to help. But in Sweden, everyone is expected to help by contributing to the system.” He adds that this isn’t based on “a sense of solidarity.” Rather, “it’s because I know if something happens to me, I’ll be secure because the government will help me.”

And, despite the country’s high benefits and wages—which many American conservatives claim strangle competition—the World Economic Forum rated Sweden as the ninth-most-competitive economy worldwide in 2018, beating other European countries like France, Spain, and Denmark.

While there aren’t as many Swedish billionaires as American, there are plenty: In 2018, Sweden had 32 and the United States had 585 (more than any country in the world). But Sweden actually has more per capita: 3.1 per million, compared with 1.7 per million in the United States.

§ Taxes: The obvious question is: How can Sweden afford such benefits? The obvious answer: Through relatively high taxes. So how much do Swedes fork over?

Swedes pay income tax to both national and local governments. In fact, in 2017 Sweden had the highest top marginal tax rate among OECD countries, followed by Denmark, Japan, Greece, France, and Canada. In all these countries, the top rate is over 50 percent. And according to the Confederation of Swedish Enterprises, over 1.4 million wealthy Swedes (about 14 percent of the public) pay 51–56 percent, when local and national taxes are combined. And because Swedes are earning very well, the number in this bracket grew by 360,000 since 2014. Swedes earning under $53,700 a year (2017 numbers) pay no national tax; if they earn more, the salaries/wages from $53,700 up to $78,000 are taxed at 20 percent, and income over that is taxed at 25 percent.

Swedes don’t pay property tax. But income taxes to counties and municipalities are higher than the national ones (though Swedes earning less than $20,000 pay none). Rates vary, depending on where one lives, but the average is about 11 percent to the former and 21 percent to the latter. Together, they total about 32 percent of income.

In Sweden, long-term capital gains are taxed at 30 percent, while in the United States they’re taxed at 0-15-20 percent. Swedish businesses’ payroll taxes come to about 31 percent of employees’ salaries. The government uses these funds to cover pensions, along with unemployment, sick leave, widow survival, work injury, and parental-leave benefits.

If you’re wondering why Swedish businesses don’t successfully lobby government for tax cuts and lower regulations, the answer is interesting. At present, the government contributes more than 80 percent of political parties’ operating costs, with the rest coming from membership fees. Törnwall explains that “while there are no limitations on how much organizations can donate, it’s just not a Swedish tradition or problem—yet.”

And despite relatively high taxes, Swedes aren’t exactly suffering. How can this be? According to political scientist Stranne, since the government picks up the tab for essentials, they have a lot left in their pockets. They enjoy four to seven weeks of vacation a year and drive late-model, high-end European cars (such as Mercedes, Volvo, and Audi), which cost about the same as in the United States, while gas costs about $6 a gallon.

Stranne says, “I feel rich, since I have a lot of money left to spend for my comfort, as do others. In 2017, 60 percent of Swedes vacationed, for a total of 11.7 million trips. Spain was the most popular destination, but over 300,000 went to Thailand.”

They also live longer than people in the United States; in 2018, life expectancy was 82 years, against 79 here.

While some Swedes grumble about their taxes, a 2017 OECD public opinion poll (based on Gallup/World Bank data) found that 50 percent trust their government, while the figure is only 30 percent for Americans. Worse, a 2014 CNN poll found that only 13 percent of Americans thought the federal government would “do what is right at least most of the time.” And 10 percent said they “never trust the government to do what is right.”

Stranne says, “We don’t have to worry about how we’ll pay for insurance, medical bills, preschool programs, and our kids’ child care and education. This is how I define true freedom.

“When I visit the US, I hear people worrying about how they’ll pay for these things—even those with good incomes. You don’t hear this here. Swedes might complain about taxes, but it feels good not to have to depend on a relative’s or friend’s goodwill when you need help.”",Even Conservatives Love Sweden’s Welfare State.

Ms. Notley, who faces a tough spring campaign for re-election in which management of the the energy industry will be a key issue, said the government will lease 4,400 rail cars that will ship 120,000 barrels of crude a day by next year. The first cars are expected to be in service by July, she said, and the province has signed contracts with Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway to transport the cars.

The crude-by-rail program is part of a series of measures designed to increase the price and market for Alberta oil, including production limits that took effect on Jan. 1. The government is also handing out billions in grants and loan guarantees to expand upgrading and refining.

“Rather than produce less, we have to find ways to move more,"" she said.

“While pipelines will always be the best, most efficient and most economical long-term solution, we must take action today to provide more relief to our energy workers and the families who rely on these good jobs across this province and this country.”

The Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission will purchase oil from producers and then market it. The commission has yet to sign any contracts, so it’s not yet clear where the oil will come from or where it will go, although most of it is expected to head to U.S. refineries.

Ms. Notley said the province expects to bring in $5.9-billion through oil sales, royalties and taxes, leaving net revenues of $2.2-billion. She said there is strong demand for Alberta oil and insisted the province will not only break even but make money.

“There’s absolutely no risk to finding markets for this product,"" she said.

Jason Kenney, leader of the Opposition United Conservative Party, condemned the announcement as irresponsible and said a UCP government would immediately review such contracts. He said oil producers were already increasing rail shipments before the the NDP government imposed production cuts.

“All the Premier’s announcement today does is to move risks and costs from the private sector onto the backs of taxpayers when we can least afford it,” Mr. Kenney said.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Kenney declined to say whether a UCP government would rip up the rail contracts, instead saying it would depend on the terms of those agreements and whether there would be penalties for cancelling them.

Crude rail shipments reached record levels last fall largely owing to pipeline constraints. But they have fallen since the beginning of the year as the province’s production cuts narrowed the price difference between Alberta oil and West Texas Intermediate down to roughly US$10 from more than US$50 last fall.

Several large producers have said the current price differential has made shipping by rail uneconomical, with Imperial Oil Ltd. saying it would not ship any crude by rail in February. CP and CN have each seen petroleum shipments drop by about a third since December, according to the companies’ latest weekly data.

The oil price differential was about US$13 as of Friday, according to the Petroleum Services Association of Canada, and Ms. Notley said the government expects the differential to continue to widen, which would make rail more profitable.

About three-quarters of the cars will meet increased safety specifications, known as DOT-117J, put in place after the Lac-Mégantic rail disaster in 2013 in Quebec. The remaining cars will be retrofitted to meet those standards.

A derailment in western Manitoba over the weekend, which saw an undetermined amount of oil spill, involved retrofitted cars.

The government also said CP and CN offered assurances that grain and other commodity shipments would not be displaced by the added crude rail traffic.

Ben Brunnen, vice-president of oil sands operations and fiscal policy for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said the industry group supports anything that will help get more crude to market.

“We’re not in an ideal situation,” he said. “We’re confronted with what we consider to be a failure in the market to increase our pipeline access. so the government stepped in on a short-term basis to alleviate the pressure.”","Alberta plans to lease 4400 rail cars to ship crude amid low oil prices, lack of new pipeline capacity - The Globe and Mail",The Globe And Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-alberta-plans-to-lease-4400-rail-cars-to-ship-crude-amid-low-oil/

All of the non-revenue financial measures we will discuss today are non-GAAP unless we state that the measure is a GAAP measure.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Instructure's CEO Dan Goldsmith.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Erin, and thank you everyone for joining us on our Q4 and full-year 2018 earnings call. At Instructure, our vision is to help people learn, develop and engage from their first day of school to their last day of work. 2018 has been an exciting and productive time for the company, and the business has performed well. At a high level, we grew full-year revenue 30% year over year, enhanced our operating structure and defined and launch our growth initiatives.

Our strategy is aligned around three key objectives: drive growth, both near and long term through clear and impactful initiatives; execute well to deliver both strong financial results and customer success; and get profitable through continued focus on operational excellence. Let me start with our focus on growth. Coming into 2019, we have six defined growth initiatives that will broaden our product offerings and meaningfully expand our TAM. Today, we will talk specifically about three of these.

Our first growth initiative will drive the connection between the academic and professional worlds, initially by launching an essential student success platform. The true value of education is realized only when students can leverage their academic experience and achievements to transition successfully into the workforce. Today, we've taken a great stride toward enabling that transition with our expected acquisition of Portfolium, a successful, longtime Canvas partner. Portfolium's vision is to help each person realize their full potential by connecting learning with opportunity through e-portfolios, program and course-level assessments, career pathways and by matching students to job opportunities.

Portfolium will join Instructure with a wealth of shared customers such as Virginia Tech, Santa Clara University and Swinburne University in Australia. This acquisition is a great match in vision and culture and represents our first major step into the student success market. And while Portfolium's current offerings provide an excellent solution, more importantly, they establish the first bridge between academia and the corporate world that aligns precisely with Instructure's vision. I am also pleased to share with you an early insight into our second growth initiative focused on analytics, data science and artificial intelligence.

The codename for this initiative is Dig, and this technology platform, combined with the most comprehensive SaaS database on the educational experience, uniquely positions us to deliver meaningful value to our customers. And from a growth perspective, Dig has the potential to double our TAM and education. We are already well on our way to completing our initial product validation tours and solidifying customer use cases. Dig demonstrates our commitment to continuous innovation in the education space, and I look forward to sharing additional details, including launch plans and progress, over the course of this year.

Now let's turn our attention to Bridge as our third growth initiative. We continue to establish and expand the category of employee engagement and development by broadening our offerings and establishing Bridge as an essential solution for all employees and companies across the globe. The changes in product positioning and strategy introduced in 2018 are already resonating in the market, and we see our customers sharing in our long-term vision around employee engagement and development. Looking forward, we are poised for strong execution this year.

We have strengthened the foundation for our Bridge go-to-market strategy with key strategic hires and continued investment in our platform. We are on track to release two new Bridge products in the coming months, which will further expand our TAM within the corporate space. We will formally launch these offerings at our Bridge conference in June, where business, HR and talent leaders from around the country will join us to learn about our vision for employee engagement and development. I would encourage all of you to attend.

With a strong vision, expanding suite and a solid go-to-market strategy, we are increasingly able to go after large enterprise opportunities, resulting in larger deals and cross-selling opportunities with Bridge. As excited as we are about these growth initiatives, we must also execute well by leveraging our existing product portfolio to deliver growth today. Let me spend a few minutes sharing our success across the globe with both Canvas and Bridge during the fourth quarter of 2018. Within the domestic higher education market, win rates remain high across the country, from UC San Diego to Wilmington University, to the Vermont State College system.

And we are excited to announce that Harvard Medical School selected Practice in support of their global training for clinical research programs. Looking at our international markets, we made significant headway in LatAm, winning deals throughout Peru, Mexico, Brazil and Ecuador, predominantly replacing Blackboard and Moodle. Most notably, Tec de Monterrey in Mexico selected Canvas for their 200,000 learners. Key leadership hires and a deep understanding of the international regions, has led us to this success, and we will continue this pattern for our international expansion.

In the APAC region, the prestigious University of Melbourne and the University of Technology Sydney replaced Blackboard with Canvas for their collective 80,000 learners. It is exciting to see Canvas being used by the four largest universities in Australia, and our expansion story in APAC region continues with Our Lady of Fatima University in the Philippines selecting Canvas for over 70,000 users. And in Europe, the world's leading provider of wine education, the Wine & Spirit Education Trust, will use Canvas to present a more modern and accessible LMS for their face-to-face programs consisting of 30,000 passionate wine and spirit professionals and enthusiasts. Turning to Bridge.

Our focus on large enterprise deals and vertical use cases delivered meaningful key wins in Q4. ETQ, a leading provider of quality and compliance management software, selected Bridge Learn to train there over 100,000 customers. Internationally, Deloitte España will be using Bridge Learn not only for internal employees but also to deliver cybersecurity training to their clients. In Canada, lululemon athletica selected Bridge Learn and Arc to assist them with employee training and development.

Sales enablement and customer service training are use cases where we have found particular success. And in Q4, we saw Henry Schein, a solutions company for healthcare professionals, select Bridge Learn in practice for these efforts. The Pacific Financial Group shows Bridge Learn in practice to help measure the effectiveness of live training for the 3,000 financial representatives and clients. And Regency Furniture selected Perform to assist sales managers and staff with their performance management needs.

Chewy, the online pet retailer, chose Bridge Learn for their customer success team of 10,000 employees. Additionally, a financial services company with more than 2 million clients and over $850 billion in assets under management, selected Practice for onboarding and development for their call center representatives. Looking forward to 2019 and beyond, Instructure is focus on strong execution against our plan for growth. I've talked about three of those growth initiatives today: bridging the GAAP between academia and corporate with student success; machine learning and A.I.

and education with Dig; and our Bridge expansion strategy. I look forward to updating you on our additional growth initiatives over the course of this year. If growth is one side of the strategic coin, the flip side is delivering operational excellence. Adding additional depth and knowledge to our executive team is important for Instructure as we focus on executing our 2019 plan.

We recently brought aboard Marta DeBellis as our chief marketing officer. Marta is an exceptional senior marketing executive with extensive global experience, including in-region roles in both Europe and in Asia. Most recently, Marta ran enterprise marketing for Adobe's digital experience business. Prior to Adobe, she spent time on the agency side with MRM McCann and held a variety of corporate, solutions and partner-marketing roles at Intel.

Her focus on driving growth across marketing disciplines will be a tremendous asset for Instructure. As we discuss last quarter, our focus on operational excellence continues. We have identified a number of cost-saving initiatives and implemented a number of efficiency measures across the organization. The results of those efforts are reflected not only in our strong Q4 year-over-year operating margin improvements but also in our achievement of total cash flow positive.

I will let Steve provide more detail in a moment. The near-term benefits of these efforts are meaningful. But even more importantly, they allow us to invest in both organic and inorganic growth. With a strong management team in place and a clear focus on growth and operational excellence, Instructure is well positioned for success in 2019 and beyond.

Now let me turn it over to Steve to take you through the financials.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Dan, and thanks everyone for joining us today. 2018 was a successful year for Instructure. Here are a few highlights. In addition to growing total 2018 revenue 30% year over year, we grew our recurring revenue base slightly faster, adding over $44 million.

Our international business expanded from 15% of revenue in 2017 to 19% in 2018. As Dan alluded to, we demonstrated significant leverage in our operating margin. And importantly, our cash position is quite strong. Let me provide some additional details on the quarter and year.

In Q4, total revenue and subscription revenue both grew 26% year over year to $56.3 million and $51 million respectively. For the full-year 2018, total revenue came in at the top end of our guidance at $209.5 million, of which $188.5 million was subscription revenue. Rolling 12-month billings at the end of Q4 was $228.6 million, up 22% from the fourth quarter of last year, also calculated on a rolling 12-month basis. For the remainder of my commentary, unless otherwise noted, I will discuss non-GAAP results; and all EPS numbers are on a per-commentary basis.

Gross margin in Q4 was 71.3%. And for the full year, gross margin was 72.2%. As we have noted before, we are approaching our long-term target of 75% gross margin and expect improvements to continue to moderate going forward. Total operating expense for the fourth quarter was $41.1 million, a 7% year-over-year increase as compared to revenue growth of 26% during the same period.

For the full year of 2018, total operating expense was $173.1 million, an increase of 20% over last year. As Dan mentioned earlier, our cost savings initiatives implemented in the second half of the year led to dramatic improvements in our operating margin, and we delivered over 1,200 basis points of year-over-year improvements in Q4. For the fourth quarter, we realized approximately $1.3 million in efficiencies as a direct result of these efforts. A few examples include: leveraging hiring in our new Budapest office, optimizing our investments in our facilities globally, streamlining our enterprise software spend and reducing third-party recruiting costs.

Operating loss for Q4 was $1 million, an impressive year-over-year improvement of $5.3 million. For the full-year 2018, operating loss improved over 700 basis points year over year to $21.9 million. GAAP net loss for Q4 was $7.6 million, an improvement of $0.10 per share year over year. GAAP net loss for 2018 was $43.5 million, representing a $0.20 per share improvement over the prior year.

In Q4, on a non-GAAP basis, we realized a small net loss of $300,000, which is a substantial improvement over the prior year. This is partly due to our cost savings initiatives as mentioned above, and is partly due to a change in compensation philosophy, which essentially aligns management's incentives with that of our stockholders. Specifically, during the quarter, all 2018 executive bonuses were given in stock as opposed to cash. This resulted in about a $1.8-million improvement in our non-GAAP net income.

For the full year, non-GAAP net loss was $20.7 million, a $0.36 per share improvement over last year. Turning to the balance sheet, I am particularly pleased to report that we achieved our goal of being total cash flow positive slightly in 2018. This is a very important milestone for Instructure. Our ending cash balance for 2018 was marginally higher than the balance at the end of 2017, after adjusting for our $110-million equity raised last year.

Our cost-savings initiatives, along with strong collections, resulted in a balance of $153 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. Free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $22.4 million. Backlog grew 19% year over year to $466 million at the beginning of 2019. This is comprised of $121 million of deferred revenue, which you can find on our year-end balance sheet; and $345 million of off balance sheet revenue under contract.

Additionally, our average contract length continues to be greater than three years. I'll end my remarks with a discussion around our expectations for the first-quarter and full-year 2019. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $56.9 million to $57.5 million, non-GAAP net loss of $5.6 million to $5 million, and non-GAAP net loss per common share of $0.16 to $0.14. For the full-year 2019, we expect revenue in the range of $256 million to $260 million.

We expect non-GAAP net loss of $23.5 million to $21.5 million, and a non-GAAP net loss per common share of $0.65 to $0.59. For calculating EPS, we expect our shares to be $35.5 million for the first quarter of 2019 and $36.1 million for the full year. Let me provide some context around these expectations. On the revenue side, our win rates for domestic Canvas remain best in class, and we continue to capture market share.

However, as we previously discussed, we see muted new bookings growth through the domestic LMS market. While we are quite optimistic about our longer-term opportunities for TAM expansion and strong revenue growth, Dig and Portfolium being two examples, it is appropriate to balance those expectations in the near term. These efforts require time and market, and therefore we are assuming minimal impact for 2019. Turning to the expense side.

With our focus on operational excellence during the second half of 2018, we've changed the mindset of our leadership team and the entire organization about how we approach the business and fund investments. A focus on disciplined investments for balancing profitable growth has been put in place and is reflected in the outlook we provided today. On the cash side, we have a strong cash position to support our important strategic objectives for both Canvas and Bridge. And looking forward to 2019, we anticipate being approximately free cash flow neutral for the full year.

In summary, we have a strong plan for execution with a focus on balancing growth and profitability. There's a great deal of hard work to do, but I'm confident that the investments we're making today will position Instructure well for strong growth and expansion in 2019 and beyond. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator, please go ahead with our first question.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Your first question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.

Unknown speaker

Hi guys, it's Bavin on for Brad. Congrats on the quarter. Can you just dive into just the synergy opportunities with Portfolium? How much overlap do you guys have with your current install base? And how many schools within the Canvas base don't have a solution like Portfolium?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

So thanks for joining. Let me talk to that. This is Dan Goldsmith. Portfolium is a pretty strategic initiative for us.

We've been contemplating and looking into student success market for some time now, and we've been talking about our vision from first day of school to last day of work. So the student success market and Portfolium specifically is a great first step to connecting the dots between those two worlds. Portfolium is still at the early stages. And so part of the acquisition is based upon their feedback that we've received from common customers and organizations out in the market, but there's still a huge opportunity moving forward to expand.

Portfolium works across a number of academic institutions, both Canvas customers and non-Canvas customers.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

So just to add a tiny bit more color to that. Portfolium has hundreds of clients, several of them overlap with ours; while we have thousands. So there is a lot of headroom for us in terms of going to our install base for folks who don't yet have Portfolium. And it gives us an opportunity to sell them the product.[Unknown speaker]That's helpful.

And then just any sense of financials for the deal? And does your guidance include Portfolium?

So the guidance does include Portfolium. We are not going to break it out. We don't have a history of doing that. And we can't really discuss any other details.

The deal has not yet closed. We believe that is eminent and once it closes, there will be a little bit more information that comes out.

Unknown speaker

Thank you very much guys.

Your next question comes from Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Brian Essex -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Hi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. Hey, Dan, I was wondering if you could give us a little update on Bridge, some of the initiatives that you've had particularly on the sales force side this year. And maybe as a housekeeping item, just where we stand in terms of contribution from Bridge, not just on revenue but on bookings as well, given that we've kind of targeted that 15% and 20% bookings from Bridge?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So, Brian, good to talk to you. So on Bridge, as you recall, we've talked to 2018 about getting ready for 2019 and laying a lot of the foundation for further growth and execution in 2019. We entered the year this year with clear objectives, clear goals for the year actually loaded within our own instance of our Bridge product with all the employees to see.

In terms of the scaling and growth of Bridge, we continue to scale our sales team, bringing in additional talent into the team. And that will continue through 2019 and beyond as we expand within the market. Execution with Bridge continues to be strong. Through fourth quarter, we're very pleased with how the pipeline has grown.

We're pleased with the size of the deals that are coming through the pipeline. But as we put emphasis on enterprise deals, we also see longer sales cycles as well. So we expect to see more and more uplift for Bridge as we move forward through this year and into 2020. But early indications are good.

As you recall, some of the things we talk about when monitoring Bridge are the significant and large deals. So significant being key marquee deals with large customers where we have a lot of opportunity to expand within those customers or large-sized deals. We look at win rates within Bridge as well, which continued to move in the right direction. And then we look at average number of customers per product, which helps indicate whether we're being successful with the Bridge suite story.

So let me turn over to Steve to talk a little more about sort of the financials.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, so one of the things that we did last year as we talked about Bridge relative to the total, we actually don't think that makes sense anymore so we're not going to give that comparison. Canvas globally is still moving very, very rapidly, and we have new initiatives like the Portfolium acquisition that will hopefully enhance that to some degree. And so it becomes unfair to Bridge to compare it to Canvas, and it's better to look at Bridge as stand-alone. But saying all that, we are still not in a position where we're ready to break Bridge out in any level of detail.

Brian Essex -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Got it. And then maybe, Dan, just to kind of touch on kind of go to market as a follow up. How are you in terms of feature parity, pricing parity with the competition? And what do you see the most I guess effective penetration rate in terms of deal size?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So, Brian, great question. There's sort of three ways to think about that and answer that question. First and foremost, recognize that we're going after the market as a suite of capabilities.

So we're not solely focused on the corporate LMS area and domain and market per se, although Bridge Learn obviously touches on that market. With Bridge Learn, Perform, with Practice, and then obviously we're working with early customers and beta customers in the market around the upcoming product releases, the Bridge suite story continues to get stronger and stronger. So in terms of just attractiveness within the market, we're seeing more and more multi-product sales with Bridge and we're happy with those results. And we're being very successful with our beta.

In terms of feature parity, we're strong and competitive, and we've seen wins across all of our competitors in the market around sort of the learning space. And we continue to see a lot of open white space where we're clearly differentiated with some of our innovative products like Practice. So it's a little hard to pin down on sort of feature parity. We have a lot of room to grow, and we're going to continue to invest in R&D.

But a lot of that investment will go toward that Bridge suite story more so than just feature parity.

Brian Essex -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Got it, that's helpful. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham. Your line is open.

Unknown speaker

Hey guys, this is Josh [Inaudible] for Scott. So how are you thinking about you partner strategy for Bridge in 2019? You've had a lot of success with your partner network with Canvas. Can you replicate this on the corporate side of the business? And what are some of the dynamics that might be different for those two?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

So good to talk to you. We're getting a little static on the line, so it's a little hard to hear. But in terms of our partner strategy for Bridge, we're on track with where I want to be at this stage within our partner strategy. Obviously, Canvas has a 10-year track record to fall upon and building of that partner network and education, and that's been a strong point for us solidifying within in the market.

With regards to Bridge, our strategy is to start with sort of leading thought leaders and analysts, and we're getting a lot of good coverage of thought leaders and analysts. And we're starting to work with various consultancies, large and small. Additionally, we're seeing more and more interest from technology partners as well with Bridge, and we're adding more and more over time. So we're still in the early stages of establishing that partner program.

But as we go through 2019, you'll see more and more partners added to the Bridge side of the house.

Unknown speaker

OK, great. And then just one follow-up question. You mentioned that international revenue is up 18% of revenue. What regions do you plan to make the greatest investments internationally in 2019?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

The question I think was where do we intend to make the greatest investments internationally?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Josh, could you go on mute please? Because there's a ton of static coming through? Sorry. [Inaudible] Josh?

Unknown speaker

Sorry. Is that better?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

No. Uh-oh.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

So apologies, we're having static on the line. But let me try and answer the question here around where investments are for international. So international, there's really sort of three prongs of our international approach. We have expansion with our edu market, with the the edu market the Canvas are sort of country by country.

And we continue to execute with a sort of common playbook across each of those markets and we're seeing success. I highlighted that success in the earlier remarks across LatAm. We're seeing similar success in Europe and Asia Pac as well. Embedded in that in international expansion, we're also starting to focus on some of the larger markets as well in terms of volume.

So you'll hear more of that moving forward as we continue to examine the new countries and markets on the edu side. Additionally with international, we will be focusing more and more with Bridge. We're making strategic hires with Bridge as well, and anticipate more growth with Bridge both in Europe, Asia Pac and LatAm. What is advantageous for us around Bridge is we can focus on some of the core markets like Australia or the U.K.

or Germany for example or France, and that will automatically take us into a number of multinational deals easily into other countries as well. So those are sort of three prongs to our strategy for international. And with the solid foundation and the new GM structure we introduced in 2018, we feel very ready for execution and we're already seeing results in our pipeline.

Operator

Your next question comes from Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Your line is open.

Brian Peterson -- Raymond James -- Analyst

Hi guys, and hopefully I'm not bringing as much static. I had to take some migraine medicine. So just wanted to start. The international success you had this quarter, probably a little bit better than I expected.

How many deals are there out there that can contribute kind of 50,000-plus type of students? And is that still an incremental opportunity for you guys over the next few years?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

So good to talk to you, Brian. So when we talk about international, there's still a lot of very sizable deals out there in the market. I assume you're alluding to the education side. There's still a lot of sizable deals out there.

So I wouldn't call it just incremental growth. I think it can be pretty monumental growth with some of those large deals. That being said, the market is pretty bifurcated into larger deals and in a number of smaller caps or smaller deals as well, herding cats and dogs out there in the market. The other dynamic that we're shifting this year as well is recognition that the international markets still focus a lot on the open source and the perceived freebie model as well with Moodle.

And so we've introduced a value engineering capability with maturity models and ROI models specifically to help advance our position and help our prospects and customers make the business case for switching over to Canvas. What's great about that is for the wins that we've had against Moodle, we get feedback constantly about the fact that from a total cost of ownership, Canvas is equal or even better than what many of these organizations typically experience with their legacy platforms. So large deals still out there, as well as a number of cats and dogs and smaller deals. The larger deals exist across all geographies, and we're selling with strategic intent through 2019 and beyond to capture those deals and accelerate the pipeline.

Brian Peterson -- Raymond James -- Analyst

Got it. And maybe just pivoting to the domestic higher ed segment for a bit. My checks have indicated that that kind of slowed in the back half of the year. I'm just curious, how should we think about the pipeline of opportunities in 2019?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

So I think we talked about that a little bit in the prepared remarks, that we expect a muted growth rate. I think we're looking at the year as somewhat consistent to last year. So if there's upside that would be great. But we're just assuming it's going to run about the same.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

One thing to bear in mind is we're not resting on our laurels with that either. We've talked about this previously. So we're working actively, we've made some strategic hires. And the types of dialogues we're having with institutions that wouldn't have engaged with us previously.

We're working very proactively. We're engaging in those dialogues, and we're creating business cases ideally to move organizations ahead of RFPs to move over to Canvas and create demand.

Brian Peterson -- Raymond James -- Analyst

Thanks guys.

Your next question comes from Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Your line is open.

Corey Greendale -- First Analysis -- Analysis

Hey, good afternoon. First, just a quick clarifying question. U.S. higher ed, when you say consistent, do you mean you expect flattish billings or flattish new billings?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

So, Corey, when we talk about that, we're talking about new business.

Corey Greendale -- First Analysis -- Analysis

OK, so it should still grow, the new business?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Oh, yeah, yeah! Oh, absolutely. No, there's definitely growth from a billings perspective. This is about new business.

Corey Greendale -- First Analysis -- Analysis

Yes, just wanted to clarify that. And then, Dan, the six growth initiatives, you mentioned three. I just want to be clear. The other three, you're just not discussing at all or you can kind of mention what they are but you're just not elaborating on this call?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

We're not elaborating right now, we're not discussing at this time. One of the areas that the leadership team worked on last year as we were getting ready for 2019 was sort of this concept of layering in growth initiatives. This was a fundamental strategy that I've employed in previous companies, is to make sure that we not only are doing the things near term to drive growth of the company, but we're laying the groundwork and planting the seeds for growth in the mid and long term as well. Obviously, as the the law of large numbers continues to create headwinds for large percentage growth rates, we need to consider elements for growth as early as possible.

So there's six growth initiatives, actually are spread out pretty nicely and layered in. Can be very beneficial from the strong position we are within education, as well as connectivity over to corporate and expansion in corporate as well. So over the next two quarters, I'll talk more about the remaining three growth initiatives. The reason why we're not talking about them now is they're more in the sort of incubation and start-up phase of things.

And so as we calibrate those markets and the growth potential of those initiatives and we lay the foundation for the team to execute that, we'll talk more specifically at what those are and what they can do for our business.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

But I can say that our guidance includes all the effect of all the growth initiatives that we believe will take place in 2019.

Corey Greendale -- First Analysis -- Analysis

Which I assume is primarily cost, not a revenue contribution?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

No, you should not assume that. In fact, two several things Dan talked about earlier were revenue generating. But that doesn't mean it will all happen in '19. These are medium to long-range plans, right? So they're not like one-hit wonders.

Corey Greendale -- First Analysis -- Analysis

I meant more the [Inaudible] we haven't heard about. I was assuming they won't be a big revenue contribution, but maybe that's wrong?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

We're not planning for those major revenue contributors this year, but it's still early in the process.

Corey Greendale -- First Analysis -- Analysis

And just one last one on the same topic. The Dig initiative. Potentially doubling TAM and education sounds like potentially a big deal. And I understand it's at a high level.

Is there any more you can say about what that looks like or what the product might look? Just anything.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, happy to do that. And actually this is not something that's new. We've been working on the scaffolding for Dig for well over a year now. I mentioned in the remarks that we already have product validation tours out there on the market.

We have instructors and students consuming outputs from some of the initial experiments with Dig. And we anticipate later this year obviously to make more announcements around specific products and offerings and how we bring them into the market. Dig ultimately is a platform first and foremost based upon machine learning and artificial intelligence. I believe that any multi-tenant SaaS company born in the cloud has the opportunity once they hit a certain market share.

And in fact it may even be incumbent upon those organizations to sort of partner with the industry and evolve that industry with new insights and predictive modeling using A.I. and ML. That's what Dig is at its heart. So we've established the core engine, the core platform.

Now it's a matter of scaling that engine and building application use cases. We already have a handful of use cases we're working with around student success for example where we have some predictive algorithms around students and courses even before they even step foot into the course and how we can advise and guide instructors to help drive improvements and success, as well as other algorithms that will help steer students to be more efficient in their studies and more up to speed with the things that they need to focus on to be successful through their academic experience and beyond.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

So just to add to that, Corey. One way to think about this is when you think about LMS, we're somewhat constrained on our pricing model because of legacy pricing that's been established for a couple of decades. When we think about things like Dig and the impact it could have on student retention, and knowing that the success rate of an entering freshman is about 50% to get to a graduation level, to finish with a bachelor's degree, and you think average tuitions are 40, 50 grand a year, when you start adding that up, what's the impact to a school to get the 50% to 55%? If we can help them do that with things like Dig, there's huge value. And since this is a relatively new market, we have an opportunity to price this more on value than on legacy.

So there's how you sort of get to a point where you could imagine 1 billion to whatever TAM associated with student retention.

Corey Greendale -- First Analysis -- Analysis

Great, that's very helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Terry Tillman with SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open.[Unknown speaker]Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. This is Eric [Unknown Speaker] for Terry. I wanted to ask you guys about your thoughts on the K-12 market.

In the past it's been a little bit more of a difficult market to penetrate given the unique dynamics there. But when we look into 2019 and your guidance, how do you think about the growth in the K-12 market and the availability of resources to go after that market?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

I'd say you're correct. I mean, K-12 is not as large of a market or opportunity for us as high ed for example, but it continues to be an important market where we are experiencing very high win rates. And we'll continue to hammer away at that market and move forward. We anticipate growth globally for K-12 this year, building on last year's momentum.

But I can't really say more than that.[Unknown speaker]OK. And on a similar topic on Gauge, you've talked about in the past that product readiness wasn't exactly correct when you first went to market. So can you just give an update on where the Gauge product stands in terms of product availability and readiness for the market?

Yes, so the AMS market continues to represent a significant opportunity for us, and we're getting very good reception. As we mentioned, we pulled back in 2018 after sort of going out in the market and recognizing that we had some gaps in the product. We entered 2019 with an upgraded version and enhanced version of Gauge that can capture a significant amount of the K-12 market. We started building a pipeline late in the 2018 year, and now we're in the middle of a variety of sales cycles.

So so far, indicators are green around our ability to grow. We've put in some conservative estimates around the contribution through the AMS market with Gauge this year as we continue to prove out the product. But that's a long-term play for us in that AMS market given the size and our penetration and K-12.[Unknown speaker]Great, thank you.

Your next question comes from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.

Brian Schwartz -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst

Yes, hi, thanks for taking my questions today. Dan, just wanted to ask you on the Bridge on the corporate side. As you're moving upmarket here with Bridge, are you making any changes or maybe no change to the type of sales rep that you're hiring for the Bridge group? Or really, the Bridge sales organization in general entering this year.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, Brian. So good to talk to you. So yes, we absolutely are. We've been upgrading the team there in a variety of ways.

And that actually started with the hiring of Mark Landwehr early in 2018, and it's continued with hiring a number of additional sales people and sales managers into that team. We now have two mid-market teams that are focusing on Bridge, and we continue to expand those teams where we had one last year. And we have an enterprise team that's growing very rapidly. So the talent that we're bringing in is talent that has deep experience in the software space and proven success or selling SaaS-based software across a variety of environments, as well as a number of members to the team that have experience specifically in sort of learning and employee development markets as well.

So we still have work to do there. There's still a number of hires that we'd like to make and we anticipate making within that this quarter and the next quarter. But we bring on new reps. They have domain experience both in software and relevant sort of functional domains, and they hit the ground running pretty quickly.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

One thing I would add to that is we're in a position now where we can actually recruit higher-caliber sales reps because we have more stuff on the truck to sell. And so when they think about, for example a year and a half ago with just learn, now it's a suite that's growing. And they look at that and say oh, I think I can hit my quota or meet my quota and make a lot of money here because you've got plenty of stuff to sell. So that has changed the game for us on the recruiting side in a positive way.

Brian Schwartz -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst

Thank you. And then, Steve, two real financial questions for you kind of separately. I apologize if you gave it already, if you gave the 4Q revenue retention metrics that came in above 100% again. And then the second financial question, just wanted to ask you about stock comp.

Really helpful all the commentary on the philosophy. I think we totally get it on that. My question I just wanted to ask you, how we should think about the trend, modeling out the trend on the stock comp. Should we think about it looking in the future more as a percentage of revenue closer to 2019 or 2018, or maybe somewhere in between? Thanks.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, sure. So first on the net revenue retention, we did not mention it but it is still over 100%. And we see that as an ongoing trend. For stock-based comp, I think you see in the tables in the press release that it's getting closer or maybe around 20% is what we're forecasting for 2019.

It's slightly elevated as a result of the way that the senior executive team was handled. Because instead of getting annual refresh grants, we got one effectively four-year grant. We won't get one in 2020 or 2021. And that's a sizable amount of money.

So that will help SBC moderate in 2020 and beyond. But it's probably -- I don't know, I haven't looked at a forecast but I would suspect going into 2020 and beyond it'll probably be somewhere between '18 and '19.

Brian Schwartz -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst

That's very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions this afternoon.

Your next question comes from Justin Furby with William Blair and Co. Your line is open.

Justin Furby -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

Great, thanks guys. Maybe just to start, Steve, on the guidance for this year. I think you're guiding for 19% growth in Q1 and closer to 22% for full year?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

22% to 24%, that's correct.

Justin Furby -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

I guesss I assume the acceleration in that guide, Steve, is just driven by the acquisition? Or is there something else when you think about that [Inaudible] Q1 versus the outer quarters?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

So it's not the acquisition. We're not going to give specifics about that, but that's nominal. First of all, our Q1 over Q1, we have a tough comp. And it comes from non-recurring.

Recurring is growing nicely Q1 over Q1, but non-recurring is essentially flat in our numbers. So that creates, because the high non-recurring from Q1 of last year, that creates a tough comp. But the growth initiatives that Dan talked about, which do not include Portfolium per se, are really the drivers of the full year looking a little bit better than Q1.

Justin Furby -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

Got it. Super helpful. And then I guess in terms of Bridge, is there a point when, Steve, you think you'll break that out in terms of a trigger point, whether it's 10% of revenue or whatever it is? And then can you give us an update on how much of your development spend today is being allocated toward Bridge? I think I had them, I had a couple of years ago. It was around a third of development, and my sense is it's probably higher now.

So just any update here would be helpful. Thanks.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, so I'm sorry, what was the first question again?

Justin Furby -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

Just that there's a trigger point where you think you'll break out --

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Oh yes, yes, yes. So yes there is. It's a qualitative trigger point, not a hard number trigger point. It's when we believe that the numbers are moving consistently in the same direction over a long enough period of time, and we believe that it's big enough where most of the volatility is removed.

We think that is the biggest issue with reporting numbers now. Because it's a relatively small base certainly compared to Canvas, that it will appear volatile and we would hate for people to think that one or two data points is a trend when in fact it may just be an anomaly of a particular quarter. So when we see stability is when we'll probably start reporting more detail. Regarding the R&D investment, we don't really break that out.

But what we can tell you qualitatively is while we are doing some incremental investments on the Canvas side, and Dig is a good example of that, the lion's share of the growth in R&D is going to Bridge.

Justin Furby -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

[Inaudible] and then if I could sneak one more in. I might have missed this, but I think you're moving away from talking about Bridge in terms of ACV mix. But can you just say how you did in 2018 versus your stated target of 15 to 20? Thanks.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. We didn't quite get there, but we got very, very close and it was effectively one deal that slipped into 2019.

Justin Furby -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

OK, got it. Thanks guys.

Your next question comes from Alex Paris with Barrington Research. Your line is open.

Chris Howe -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

This is Chris Howe sitting in for Alex. Good afternoon everyone.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Hey, how's it going?

Chris Howe -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

Good. A few topics here to cover. You had mentioned your wins against Moodle, the way you've highlighted value engineering, the total cost of ownership being equal or better. Can you perhaps add some additional color on what you're seeing when you go up against Moodle? Has there been a regression in their product versus yours? Or has it been just the advancement of your product versus yours? And Just what you're seeing in that pre environment competitive space.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Well, it's a great question. So it's still early days for us around value engineering. That's something that we initiated and started building at the end of 2018, and we're still in the progress as we're introducing that more solidly within the market. You'll see more of that as we come toward Instructure Con, which is in July this year in the U.S.

With regards to the product differentiation, I don't think it's as much -- I mean, we continue to advance our product, and that's natural for us to sort of innovate more efficiently and with greater investment into our Canvas products. So from a product differentiation perspective, it's very, very strong. I think that naturally happens with Moodle as well. We see not necessarily a regression in the product but some stagnation in terms of the product and their ability to compete on that front.

A lot of the organizations though, although the product functionality and capabilities are a meaningful data point in terms of a decision like this, there needs to be a compelling value case. So the financials need to work with them, which is much harder to unearth and unravel from an organization where you're not dealing with subscription fees in the same way. And an organization needs to be ready for change. And so some of those things take time.

Again, with the value-engineering initiative, that will help on both of those fronts. We continue to win over Moodle. There's a sales execution element to this as well. Again, moving internationally, and by the way the Moodle phenomenon is primarily international.

Part of it is us just continuing to penetrate market by market as well. The other dynamic with education is as we go into individual countries, there are sort of anchor customers, if you will, as we go into those countries that help more and more with preference selling. So when we do that in a market like Germany or Spain for example, then it will help other companies build confidence around their ability to move from Moodle to Canvas, for example.

Chris Howe -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

Thanks Dan, that's very helpful. And a little more topic. Staying on the international front, you've mentioned and highlighted the wins with Deloitte and Lulu. Should I think of this as gaps that were geographic-specific? Or is there the potential to expand these company opportunities across borders? And as it relates to your product extensions within Bridge Learn, how would you characterize where you are on the timeline as far as you mentioned the two new products coming this month? How many more could there be as far as the product design and what's been--

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

So let me address both questions. The first one was around sort of regional needs or gaps. It's absolutely not the case that that's local. And my experience, I've worked with multinational companies extensively over my career and these are healthy signs, where a global company will start in one particular region or function within their organization and use that almost as a pilot in a proof case.

So in fact, in many of the situations where we're starting in a particular pocket within a customer, we're already having dialogues almost in parallel as we start up those dialogues with those customers. So Deloitte with Deloitte España is a great first step. Deloitte is a global organization, but they're also a sort of franchise organization as well, so there are decision makers in different markets. But they tend to be strong references across Deloitte globally.

And then Lululemon obviously in Canada, we have the opportunity to expand as we work across their organization. And those are just two examples of customers in the Bridge side that we have global international expansion opportunities. When it comes to the Bridge product and product launches, first let me correct something. We will announce within the coming months, not the coming month, two new products.

And then we will formally launch those at our Bridge event here in the U.S. in June. The phase we're in right now with both of those products is sort of our beta phase. We have customers actively using those products out in the market, and it gives us a lot of good feedback.

That's a very healthy way for SaaS companies to introduce products so we can work out some of the kinks and we can flesh out our product roadmap moving forward, as well as our value proposition in the market and doing so in a way that is controlled and it makes it easier to sort of scale with confidence over time. So those will be announced within the next two or three months, and it will be formally launched in the June timeframe average. So stay tuned for that.

[Operator instructions] The next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.

Rishi Jaluria -- D.A. Davidson

Hey, hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Dan, let me start with the comment you made about seeing a little bit of a lengthening of sales cycles on the Bridge side with larger deals. Can you give a little bit more color on this? When you say larger deals, are you talking about targeting larger initial deployments, by seed, more modules, or just going after customers that are bigger in terms of the opportunity? And why are you seeing lengthening sales cycles? Is it because you're replacing more products? Is it just because it's a higher price tag you're going after? Some color there would be helpful. And then I have a follow up for Steve.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, so Rishi, good to talk to you. So really none of the above. Actually, the elongation of sales cycles is quite simple. We're working on opportunities with larger companies and larger deals.

And larger companies tend to take longer to do evaluations and make decisions. There's committees, there's approval processes, etc. that they need to work through. So there's nothing different about the product mix and the number of products being replaced.

It's just frankly the anatomy of larger companies making decisions. And that's not unique to us. I experienced that in all of my previous careers selling large deals, and we experience a similar dynamic here. If anything, the Bridge suite is creating a much more compelling story, and we're opening up opportunities.

The interesting factor is as we go to market, and we're seeing this a lot in Europe right now, and we tell the employee development engagement story, we're seeing a lot more tailwinds come into the sales cycle and driving sort of buyers' interest, starting from that position rather than starting from a corporate LMS position. So that also tells us that strategy is working. That does also contribute to the elongation of deals because the customers may not always be naturally looking for a change in the existing system they have.

Rishi Jaluria -- D.A. Davidson

Got it. And just alongside those larger deals, is that something given maybe a higher amount of complexity that we should expect to see a higher services attach rate than maybe we've seen with Bridge in the past?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. I don't think it will be misproportionate. But you'll see, yeah, you'll see higher services demand on those deals.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, I don't think you'll see that reflected in the financials in our recurring versus nonrecurring revenue breakout, just because there's so much volume and the mountain is very tall for what we have so far on recurring.

Rishi Jaluria -- D.A. Davidson

Got it, helpful. Thanks. And, Steve, just from a financial perspective, why did we see a decline in subscription gross margins in the quarter both sequentially and year over year? Was that driven by mix shift, geography? Or anything you could call out there?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

It was actually driven by something that was positive in the long run, which is how we account for discounts for Amazon Web Services. So there was an adjustment in the fourth quarter, that without that it would have been basically flat to prior quarters.

Rishi Jaluria -- D.A. Davidson

Got it, that's helpful. Thanks guys.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

OK.

Operator

And that's all the time that we have questions for today. I turn the call back to Dan Goldsmith, CEO, for any closing remarks.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank our passionate customers, our amazing partners and our dedicated and talented employees for contributing success in 2018. I'm super excited for our plans for growth in 2019 and look forward to updating all of you next quarter.

So thank you.

The #TellMe campaign launched Aug. 28, and within two weeks the Progressive Conservatives and the Liberals both promised to make sure that the information would be shared.

Within weeks, several provincial governments across Canada committed to reviewing or changing their reporting policies. Those provinces included British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia.

Radiologists say dense breast tissue can obscure cancers on a mammogram, but the majority of Canadian women are unlikely to be aware of the risk or their breast density.

An estimated 80,000 New Brunswick women have dense breasts, and 18,000 of them would fall into the ""highest density"" category, where the accuracy of a mammogram is about 50 per cent, according to studies.

Advocates say women should be given density information on their mammogram report to be able to seek additional, more effective screening.

""A lot of work has been going on behind the scenes before this, but I think that the commitments made by the leaders in New Brunswick really started something,"" Kaufield said.

Dear <a href=""https://twitter.com/BrianGallantNB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@BrianGallantNB</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/BlaineHiggs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@BlaineHiggs</a> NB women need to know their breast density so they can make informed healthcare decisions. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TellMe?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#TellMe</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisMoi?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#DisMoi</a> <a href=""https://t.co/dCRx5mfkwT"">https://t.co/dCRx5mfkwT</a> <a href=""https://t.co/uYw6z3HqX4"">pic.twitter.com/uYw6z3HqX4</a> —@kaufield

""I hope it grows and grows until all women across Canada are notified of their breast density, and I'm not going to give up in New Brunswick until that happens.""

The Progressive Conservative government intends to keep its promise, according to Health Minister Ted Flemming.

""It's a platform commitment made by Premier Blaine Higgs and we will follow through with it,"" Flemming said in a statement.

""From a policy point of view, we will consult with our stakeholders, such as the regional health authorities and the New Brunswick Medical Society, to work with us on this issue towards implementation.""

Those consultations began this winter, and Kaufield was one of the stakeholders meeting with the government.

She said the meeting was positive and she was pleased to hear the minister's support.

But the fight for Kaufield and other proponents of change is far from over.

After a fall full of good news, breast cancer and breast density advocates were dealt what they see as a major blow.

New task force guideline

In early January, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care updated its breast cancer guideline. Task force guidelines are peer-reviewed recommended best practices for primary-care providers, and they inform roughly 36,000 family doctors across the country.

The new breast cancer guideline, an update to the original published in 2011, falls short of the change Kaufield and others hoped for.

Describing breast density as an ""emerging risk factor,"" the task force ultimately didn't associate dense tissue with an increased risk of breast cancer, according to Dr. Ainsley Moore, the vice-chair.

Most women aren't routinely informed if they have dense breasts, but the condition can mean cancers are less likely to show up on mammograms. Kathy Kaufield, a cancer survivor and advocate, wants doctors to be mandated to tell women. 16:18

Moore, a clinical associate professor at McMaster University, said density is a risk factor but there are many risk factors for breast cancer, including early menstruation, alcohol intake, a sedentary lifestyle and a full-term pregnancy later in life.

""They're not considered risk factors that put women at a high risk for breast cancer and breast density is not associated with an increased risk of dying from breast cancer,"" Moore said.

""There are uncertainties here and there are subtleties here.""

Moore said there is ""instability"" in how radiologists define and diagnose dense breasts, and there isn't enough ""trustworthy"" data from randomized control trials to point to an effective screening strategy or suggest a woman's chances of survival are improved by screening one way or another.

Dense breast tissue can obscure cancer in a mammogram image. (Submitted by Dense Breasts Canada)

Dr. Paula Gordon, a breast radiologist and clinical professor at the University of British Columbia, said breast density is far from an emerging risk after decades of studies on the issue and into benefits of additional screening with an ultrasound or MRI.

Gordon, a medical adviser to the foundation Dense Breasts Canada, has said ultrasounds on women with dense breasts double the cancer detection rate over mammography.

She said the evidence used by the task force in forming its guideline is outdated and based on outdated technology. The task force only considers data from randomized control trials, she said, but there isn't a completed breast density trial.

There is a trial going on in Japan, Gordon said, but it could takes years, decades even, before it's finished.

Harms and benefits

The new guideline recommends women aged 50 to 74 undergo mammogram screening every two to three years. For women aged 40 to 49, it recommends against screening with mammography.

Moore said the updated guideline now encourages shared decision-making between patient and doctor if there's an interest in being screened.

""The task force isn't really telling women what to do here. It's providing the tools for women to make the choice best for them.""

Those recommendations are based on the balance of benefits (the probability of surviving breast cancer) and harms of screening (false positives and overdiagnosis).

False positive harm is the undue stress of something picked up by screening that's ultimately nothing or non-threatening. Overdiagnosis is finding indolent cancers that won't cause death but can lead to unnecessary and harmful treatment.

Gordon argued the harms, despite possible physical or emotional pain, do not outweigh the benefit of saving a life.

Gordon has been critical about how the task force operates with no oversight as an independent, arm's-length body from Health Canada and wants to see it restructured.","Breast density campaign helps spur change in province, ripples across Canada",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/breast-density-cancer-screening-report-task-force-guideline-1.5025143

I will now turn the call over to Jim Hoffman, President and CEO of Reliance.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year financial results with you today. 2018 was an incredible year for Reliance, full of significant financial and operational milestones. But more importantly, I'm happy to say, we improved our safety performance and I would like to say thank you to each of our 15,000 plus employees for making safety part of our culture.

In 2018, we achieved numerous earnings records invested in growth through both acquisitions and organic initiative and demonstrated our continued confidence in the strength of our business strategy and outlook by repurchasing a record $484.9 million of our common stock. Earlier this month, we celebrated Reliance's 80th anniversary. Reliance was founded in 1939 based on the core principles of providing outstanding service to our customers. We have grown tremendously in our 80-year history, made possible by our decade long course of expansion through organic growth and strategic acquisitions with emphasis on high margin, specialty products and value-added processing. Today, we are the largest metal service center country -- company in North America, servicing over 125,000 plus customers over 300 locations in 40 states and 13 countries outside of the US.

Despite tremendous growth of our business and footprint, our founding commitment to customer service remains unchanged and our many accomplishments would not be possible without our folks in the field, across the entire Reliance family of companies. We thank each of you, not only for the contributions you have made to our growth, profitability and quality of earnings, but for your unwavering daily commitments to delivering unparalleled customer service enhancing Reliance's safety culture and giving back to the communities in which you live.

I would also like to acknowledge Gregg Mollins, for his immense contributions to Reliance during his time as President and CEO, and throughout his 32-year tenure with the company. Gregg's influence is visible in our -- as our culture of customer service and caring for our employees, as well as our focus on gross profit margin, inventory management and organic growth that contributed to our record financial achievements in 2018. Thank you for all you've done Gregg. 2018 was marked by multiple quarters of record financial performance. We experienced improved pricing conditions healthy demand and excellent execution by our managers in the field. As a result, we generated record net sales of $11.53 billion, which -- when combined with our strong gross profit margin of 28.4% produced record gross profit dollars of $3.28 billion and record pre-tax income of $850.6 million.

Importantly, our pre-tax income increased 45.7% year-over-year on an 18.7% year-over-year increase in sales. Demonstrating the strength of our business model and disciplined strategy of focusing on higher margin business. Our full-year non-GAAP earnings of $8.94 per diluted share was also a new Reliance record and represents a year-over-year increase in 64.3%. Turning to the fourth quarter, while we experienced the normal seasonal decline of lower shipping volumes due to the customer shutdowns and vacation schedules, underlying demand remained healthy and we continue to experience positive demand conditions across end markets we serve.

As a result, our tons sold in the fourth quarter were down 5% from the third quarter of 2018 at the top end of our expected range of down 5% to 7%. Our outlook remains positive in 2019 with feedback on demand trends of our end markets, ranging from steady to strong. Overall metals processing was relatively steady in the fourth quarter with our average selling price per tons sold down 0.4% compared to the third quarter of 2018. Our fourth quarter pricing outlook of flat to up 1% factor in the potential for some price increases. Following the October announcement of a price increase for carbon flat-rolled products which did not hold.

Our average selling price in the fourth quarter increased 20.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by both solid demand and trade actions that supported multiple mill price increases throughout the first nine months of 2018. However, the absence of meaningful mill price increases in the fourth quarter pressured our gross profit margin from elevated levels in the first three quarters of 2018. In addition, we recorded LIFO expense of $106.8 million in the fourth quarter, significantly above our estimate of $55 million, which further impacted our gross profit margin along with the higher than expected tax rate reduced our earnings per diluted share. Karla will discuss the LIFO expense and tax rate in more detail, but in short, adjusting for our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.08 for the $0.55 higher than expected LIFO expense and the $0.10 higher than expected tax rate would have resulted in an earnings per share of $1.73 for the fourth quarter of 2018.

Turning to market conditions in our key end markets. Demand for automotive, which we service mainly through our toll processing operations in the U.S., and Mexico remains very strong. We continue to invest in facilities and value-added processing equipment to meet the increased robust demand for the services we provide, especially related to increased aluminum content in vehicles.

Aerospace also continues to perform well, with mill lead times extending and the backlog for orders remaining solid. We maintain our positive outlook in this market and continue to focus on growing our market share, both domestically and abroad. Demand in heavy industry, energy and non-residential construction was steady in the fourth quarter and we expect actively to remain at similar levels in 2019 as compared to 2018.

Finally, we have noticed in the reduction and demand in semiconductor market. That said, our long-term outlook remains positive and we expect slow improvement in demand as we progress through 2019. As for pricing, mill pricing for carbon steel products remains high levels in the fourth quarter following a number of increases in the first nine months of the year. Pricing for carbon products including plate, structural and tubing, where we have a significant presence were relatively stable during the quarter, though we did see some pressure on carbon flat-rolled price. We believe overall pricing for carbon steel products will remain stable to up in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, and we continue to monitor the recent price increases announced on hot-rolled coil.

Our sales into the aerospace market consist of heat-treated aluminum products, especially plate as well as specialty stainless steel and titanium products. Demand for heat-treated aluminum plate remains strong and the 5% to 7% price increase that became effective in January continues to hold. We saw significant strength in pricing for common alloy aluminum products throughout 2018 with continued increases in the fourth quarter. Demand for common alloy aluminum sheet remains strong and supply continues to be tight, which we expect to persist throughout 2019. Based on these trends, the recent $0.07 per pound price increase announced for March was fully supportive.

Demand for our stainless steel flat products continues to be solid. Our average selling price for stainless steel products in the fourth quarter was relatively steady following price increases announced by the mills during the third quarter. As a reminder, pricing for stainless steel products is impacted by nickel prices which remained challenge. Looking ahead, while lead times remain short and surcharges have been pressured, base prices have continued to hold.

Finally, alloy pricing remains relatively strong supported by positive demand trends in automotive and energy. Turning to capital allocation, our 2019 capital expenditure budget of $230 million is once again focused on strategic investments to drive organic growth. We will continue to invest in our facilities and innovative technology and equipment to support our customers need. Importantly, we continue to identify opportunities to expand our value-added processing capabilities, which positively contributed to our gross profit margin.

We are pleased with the robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities in the market, but we will remain selective in our M&A activity. Our November 2018 acquisition of All Metals Holding, LLC aligns with our strategy of acquiring well-run businesses that complement our diversification of products, service, geography and our value-added processing capabilities. All Metals specializes in toll processing and transportation and logistics services primarily for customers servicing the automotive, construction, appliance and other diverse end markets, strengthening our already solid position in these markets.

From a shareholders' return perspective, quarterly cash dividends and share repurchase remain core to our capital allocation philosophy. We paid regular quarterly dividends for 59 consecutive years and the 10% dividend increase announced today represents 26 increase since our 1994 IPO. Our record share repurchases in 2018 reflect the trust and confidence our board and management have in our strong consistent business strategy and outlook. And we will continue to be opportunistic in our approach to repurchases.

I am extremely proud of our 2018 financial results made possible by the excellent execution of our dedicated employees and supported by solid pricing and strong demand in the marketplace. Looking ahead, we remain confident about the demand environment in nearly all of the end markets we served, supporting our ability to maximize our earnings power and increase value for our stockholders. In closing, keeping our employees safe is our most important goal and while applaud our team for improving our safety performance through 2018, we must aim to continue to improve in 2019.

Thank you for your time and attention today. I will now turn the call over to Karla to review our fourth quarter 2018 financial results in more detail. Karla?

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Thanks Jim and good morning everyone. Our record sales of $11.53 billion in 2018, were up $1.81 billion from 2017 due to the healthy demand and improved pricing conditions that Jim discussed, as well as our focused pricing discipline and increased levels of value-added processing with 49% of our orders processed in 2018. Our tons sold were up 1% and our average selling price was up 17.9% increase in our average order size in 2018 to $2,130. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 were $2.81 billion, up $437.6 million or 18.4% from the fourth quarter of 2017. And while our tons sold decreased 1.6% year-over-year, our average stock price per tons sold rose 20.4%.

Our 2018 gross profit of $3.28 billion was a record and our gross profit margin of 28.4% was near the high end of our estimated sustainable range of 27% to 29% primarily due to the positive impact of increased metal pricing in 2018. However, the increased metal prices also negatively impacted our gross profit margin with our highest ever annual LIFO expense of $271.8 million or $2.81 earnings per diluted share compared to $30.7 million or $0.26 EPS in 2017.

Because LIFO is an annual calculation that we estimate during the year and record to actual at the end of each year and because our LIFO expense was $51.8 million higher than we had estimated at the end of the third quarter of 2018. Our LIFO expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $106.8 million or $1.13 earnings per share. This is significantly higher than estimated LIFO expense along with the lack of mill price increases in the fourth quarter of 2018, combined to reduce our gross profit margins to 25.2% and was higher than our LIFO expense of $77.5 million in the third quarter of 2018 and $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. When metal prices increase, our inventory costs increase and generate LIFO expense.

This results in lower gross profit during these periods that builds the LIFO reserve that will be reversed and generate LIFO income in future periods when metal prices decline and will positively benefit our gross profit margin and earnings during periods of declining prices. Our 2018 LIFO expense of $271.8 million, increased our LIFO reserve to $293.6 million as of December 31, 2018. Currently, we estimate that metal prices will be somewhat lower at December 31, 2019 then at December 31, 2018 with an estimated annual LIFO benefit or income of $50 million in 2019. As in prior years, we will update our expectations quarterly based upon our inventory costs and metal pricing trends.

As a percentage of net sales, our fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 18% down from 20.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and consistent with the third quarter of 2018. The reduction as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher selling prices in 2018, which increased our net sales. In addition, our SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 included a gain from the sale of non-core assets that reduced our expenses by $18.2 million.

Our record pre-tax income of $850.6 million in 2018 represents an increase of $266.8 million or 45.7% compared to 2017 due to our strong execution and a favorable pricing and demand environment. Pretax income in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $123.9 million. Our effective income tax rate was 24.5% in 2018 with our rate increasing to 29.5% in the fourth quarter as we adjusted certain deferred tax amounts to comply with recently issued interpretations of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our tax rate was a negative 6.4% in 2017 due to a one-time benefit of $207.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 attributable to the enactment of the new tax rules.

We currently expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 24.5%. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $85.6 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $1.22, which were reduced by $0.55 as a result of higher-than-expected LIFO expense and $0.10 from our higher tax rate that benefited by $0.20 from the sale of the non-core asset and $0.04 from our share repurchases in the quarter. For the full year, we had record net income of $633.7 million and record earnings per share of $8.75. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were also the highest in Reliance's history at $8.94, up $3.50 or 64.3% from $5.44 in 2017.

Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow, our record 2018 earnings resulted in strong cash flow from operations of $664.6 million despite higher working capital requirements, with $431.3 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2018. We used our cash flow to execute on our capital allocation priorities of investing in the growth of our business and returning value to our stockholders. In 2018, we invested a record $239.9 million in capital expenditures and paid $77.6 million to complete three acquisitions to further grow our business.

We also continued to execute on our stockholder return activities with a record share repurchases totaling $484.9 million and payment of $145.3 million in dividends to our stockholders. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased $4.55 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $77.77 per share for a total of $354.2 million. For the full year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased $6.07 million shares at an average cost of $79.94 per share. The pro forma annual effect of our total 2018 share repurchases is $0.77 earnings per diluted share. At December 31, 2018, our total debt outstanding was $2.21 billion resulting in a net debt to total capital ratio of 30.8%, our net debt to EBITDA multiple was 1.7 times. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had $533 million available on our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, providing us ample liquidity to continue executing all areas of our capital allocation strategy.

Turning to our outlook, we are optimistic with regard to business conditions in the first quarter of 2019 and we expect that demand in the first quarter will remain healthy. As a result, we estimate our tons sold will be at 6% to 8% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, which reflects the normal seasonal increase in shipping volumes compared to the fourth quarter. As Jim discussed, we anticipate price increases for many of our products, given recent announcements and solid pricing fundamentals supported by current demand, raw material costs and the effects of ongoing trade actions.

However, we expect our average selling price in the first quarter of 2019 will be flat to down 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. As many of these price increases are not effective for the full quarter and our average selling price trended downward during each month of the fourth quarter of 2018. As discussed earlier, we expect our inventory costs at December 31, 2019 to be lower than at the beginning of the year and therefore we currently estimate LIFO income of $12.5 million in the first quarter of 2019. We also anticipate a $0.17 benefit to our earnings in the first quarter of 2018 due to the lower number of total shares outstanding as a result of our 2018 repurchases.

As a result, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45 for the first quarter of 2019. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our financial and operational results in 2018, which were supported by a solid demand and pricing environment and outstanding execution by our employees. Our strong balance sheet provides us with the foundation to continue executing our growth and stockholder return activities. Our record repurchase of $484.9 million of our common stock in 2018 and the 10% increase in our quarterly dividend effective in the first quarter of 2019 together reflect the confidence that our Board and Management have in our business outlook and our ability to perform in the current healthy pricing and demand environment.

That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention, and at this time, we would like to open up the call to questions, operator?

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Great, thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Matthew Korn from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Matthew Korn -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Hey, good morning Jim, Karla. First off, congratulations on all the -- all the accomplishments during the year and it was a big year.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank Matt.

Matthew Korn -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Jim thanks. So I have like a micro question and then a macro question for you, in a way. We heard in the fourth quarter according to a lot of the steel mills, and they characterize the buyer strike, and they watched key prices to particularly decline, and that was on top of normal seasonality. And I'm looking at your expectations into 1Q19 is a little softer we expected, little bit below the double-digit growth we've been kind of used to in the last couple of years, going into the first quarter. Question there is, do you see any signs even given your optimism on the demand level that buyers for right now, are still holding out a little bit and going hand to mouth? Was it still the phenomenon that you're seeing.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah Matt. Our business really doesn't change that much. We just kind of pay attention to what our customers need. They seem to be positive. Orders are coming in like they always have. As far as the buyer strike, one of the mills guys said that maybe a try, we don't know. We don't, we don't see those kind of things, but it's -- there are, we were conservative by nature, that's just what we do, but we really just pay attention what our customers are telling us and that's reflected in the orders they give us on a day-to-day basis. But we're -- what we said in the script and our release, we're optimistic, and we think it's going to prove out.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

And I think Matt those comments were a little more directed as you indicated toward the flat-rolled side of the business, and remember carbon flat-roll is only about 15% of our total sales dollars. So we see that enforcement of business and we think some of the recent price increase announcements may help spur some of those folks to start buying again.

Matthew Korn -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it, appreciate that. And let me ask on, one more bigger picture question. In the wake of the higher steel prices that we've seen in flat loans, policy changes in the U.S., over this past year, there has been the number of mills expanding the capabilities, expanding the capacities. Many of these seemingly are in the regions where they feel underserved or whether as there is particular high growth potential. Do you see any kind of risk to your business from a broader steel mill reach or deeper availability of things like coated or painted or the types of processed steel, if these things really to come true?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

I don't, -- again we are -- we run the business day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month and we just again service our customers where they want to be serviced, we listen to them, all the capacity is coming online. We know all those folks. We're a big customer of all of them. They all have very smart people running those companies, that's what they see is good, good for them and that will be good for us. So I really don't see any risk coming on board to that, we actually our customer and their customer of ours, we do a lot of -- as you've probably realize that we do call processing for a lot of those folks and they are positive. And we like it when our domestic partners are profitable and busy. So we're -- we applaud their decisions, because they're all -- they make good decisions and we're going to be there for them and they will be there for us. So I don't see a big risk.

Matthew Korn -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it, appreciate it Jim. Congratulations again.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Our next question is from Martin Englert from Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Hi, good morning everyone.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Good morning.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Just wondering if you could touch on what you're seeing so far over the past month or so here with new order entries and maybe talk about what you believe could be driving lower year-on-year volumes more recently, as well as into 1Q here, which I think is implied by the guidance?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

If I understand your question promptly, again we -- it just changes daily. We run the company day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month. We can have a good day, and not so good days. There's really nothing that I can really pin point.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, I mean volumes were a little lighter, Q4'18 to '17, you know and I think the MSCI numbers for January came out, and they were down a little bit from January last year, but overall, even with the slight decrease, I mean, as Jim mentioned earlier, our customers are still optimistic. I think there's been a little uncertainty in the market from a pricing standpoint, and just general macro concerns out there, but as Jim indicated, I mean day-to-day our customers are busy, maybe not as busy as they were, maybe not buying as much as the year ago, but we're still on -- positive on demand, we're very -- the demand is supporting, helping pricing levels and we can do very well in this type of environment, even with demand down slightly.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And another thing to remember Martin, we have a really diverse group of customers going into a lot of different markets. And it's hard -- it's even difficult for us to look at our company as this massive company. We don't run it that way, we run it like we have many customers and many markets and they all do different things and one market is up, very few times in my 38-year career has every market been up at the same time and every market has been down at the same time. So we've got it -- as part of our strategy also obviously the companies we buy and the products we sell, we like to spread it out as much as we can. So we're a little less of the target when things -- things change dramatically in the market as -- part of our market could be up.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Okay, thanks. I appreciate all that detail there. Maybe, if you can just provide an update also on your tolling business there. You touched on this briefly in prepared remarks and kind of continued strength within automotive and I guess what you're seeing at the start of this year, expectations on volumes as the year progresses, and maybe just review some of the past and future growth initiatives that you've had there?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. We like that business. It's a good business for us. It continues to do well. We continue to invest, we've got nice company in Mexico with four locations and we've expanded that. We have a lead company in the U.S. that's extremely busy and as Karla mentioned our CapEx dollars, that they -- it's a capital-intensive business, and we continue to expand their offerings when the -- the number of units and the SARs report comes up, when it goes up or down, it's still at a really, really high number, which is good for us and over the last couple of years we picked up a lot of share, if you will, because of the exposed aluminum that happens to be going, and that's being designed into all kinds of different automobiles, particularly light trucks and what have you, SUVs, that's kind of our sweet spot. And again this one particular company has kind of one of a kind type equipment that we design and build ourselves and they've got a great relationship with -- in the market.

William K. Sales -- Executive Vice President, Operations

And we're also really excited about the new acquisition, All Metals. So that's going to add to the tolling part of our business.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

And in addition to All Metals, we also increased our ownership of the Acero Prime, our toll processing business in Mexico during the fourth quarter that we now have a 100% ownership of that. So, and we see growth opportunities for them as well and also just to point out our -- the number of tons sold that we report do not include any of our tolling tons and we have seen increases in the number of tons that we've sold both in the fourth quarter of '18 versus the fourth quarter of '17 and in January so far we're also up compared to last year. So because of the investments that we've made in the growth we continue to see us doing more there and picking up the market share primarily -- especially with the aluminum forces.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, another factor, remember, our customer base in that business, it really isn't the end user. It's the producers of the product, whether it be steel or aluminum. So that's kind of a unique relationship. We're their customer and they are our customer.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Thanks for all the detail there. I don't know if you'll touch on it at all, but are tolling volumes in excess of your reported volumes now.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yes, they are, and they have been for quite some time.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Okay, excellent. Thanks for all the color on that business there.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Sure.

Our next question is from Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Yeah, hey, good morning, guys. And happy 80th anniversary.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Thank you.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you.

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Okay, so I wanted to ask a little bit more. First, on the year-over-year question that Matt asked earlier, I get the sequential improvement, but are there any areas in particular that are performing worse year-over-year or better if you could just give a little bit more color? And if you could talk a little bit more while you're at it about your key carbon products specifically plate and beams.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, Timna, like I said in the remarks. The one market that's not doing real well right now but does have legs going forward is the semiconductor business, it's good business for us. It's a little slow right now, what we anticipate that getting better at some point and then the rest of the markets that we're doing are at good ones. They're at good levels, and levels and they've been better and they've been worse, and so we're OK and we like -- we kind of like where it is. We like where it's going as far as the -- Bill, do you want to say anything about aerospace or anything --?

William K. Sales -- Executive Vice President, Operations

Aerospace continued strength as we said, we really watch lead times backlog and build rates, all those are very positive and our outlook for aerospace continues to be very fast.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And Timna, what was your question on the plate and beams?

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Just a bit more color on those markets and non-res construction is big for you guys, within plate, beams and pipe, and I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color on those products in that market?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, those are good markets for us. The non-res is chugging along kind of, and we also -- as you all know, we also grow infrastructure spending in there and so we haven't seen that yet, we're all like the rest of Americans are waiting to see if we're going to fix all those bridges that are falling down. So we're hoping that that will come, but as far as the business that we're participating in, it continues to go on in a good direction. We'll see there were some filings and some suits filed on -- let you know, about the product coming in from China into Canada being stock -- semi producers and shipped back into the U.S, which is absolute cheating by the way, and we don't appreciate that no American really should appreciate that. However, that's happening and I don't know -- I have no idea what's that -- what's that findings will be or what the penalties will be, but certainly if that does happen, then we will have a more of a fair -- our fabricators, domestic fabricators will have a fair, more even playing field to participate in. So that could give us a nice little bump.

Plate -- plates are really good product for us, it's an unusual market to figure out what goes on. right now. I believe that plate pricing is, well, it's kind of just a little flat right now. And I -- with Korea being shut out for so long last year, there is an uptick -- the import is an uptick coming in, right now because they're -- they got shut out because of the quality. Now they're getting to catch up. That can't last long. So there may be a little down take in the pricing. I don't know, certainly the import pricing that we do see, it's not attractive. We're not participant but we get all of the offerings and this really not there to drag, I don't see what you can count on Reliance is not participating because we're still 95% huge fans for domestic partners. So we're going to continue to support them. So again, again kind of a boring answer because it continues to be just fine.

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Okay. And I'm surprised you guys didn't mentioned in a while. I know you guys were involved in that. I think, you mentioned tubing was part of the walls initial phases years ago and now that it looks like it might be getting under way, again, is that an opportunity for you?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

I know about as much as the wall -- about what's going to happen to more as you do, nobody knows. So all I know is that -- we sell metal and people talk metal going into that wall and we certainly will call on pieces and parts of that we have in the past. And if they decide to build some of it, I hope they call Reliance for their tubing in the flight that goes into it.

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Okay, fantastic. I could switch to Karla. I want to ask a couple of questions on cash flows and just what to expect for 2019. You should see a pretty big working capital release you had in this last couple of quarters. It sounds some pretty high days of inventory and then they kind of came down sharply by the end of the year. Any color you can give us on what kind of working capital release you might expect assuming kind of stable prices? And then on the buyback, is that a signal of more to come or will you capitalizing on a particularly weak market in Q4.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So, hi Timna, first off on the cash flows, we had a strong cash flows in 2018, $665 million for the year and that was, as you commented with higher working capital requirements, primarily from the cost -- the price standpoint of the metals. So, we anticipate given our guidance on LIFO and things that we would have a little relief, just from a price standpoint in 2019. And our inventories, we did end the year at a higher level than what our goal is inventories is still in decent shape, but a little higher than we prefer to see them. So, we do anticipate some relief from a quantity standpoint on the inventory this year. So, certainly we would anticipate being at a higher level than the $665 million of cash flow from our last year, what level, we are not really projecting or guiding toward that but certainly, we're expecting it to be stronger than in 2018.

From a buyback standpoint, we're consistent with the way we're approaching buybacks, being opportunistic and really looking at where the stock was trading in the fourth quarter, there was a lot of volatility. They gave us a lot of opportunity, we looked at buying back shares of Reliance is being the most low risk acquisition that we can make. So we needed to see our stock trading there, but we're pleased we were able to repurchase the shares at that level because we think it's very positive for our shareholders on a long-term basis. So we took advantage of that and we'll continue to look at opportunities as we move forward. I think, I saw some hints of comments that maybe we bought back more stock because we didn't see other opportunities but we continue to see opportunities for all of our capital allocation levers, as Jim mentioned in his comments. There are still acquisition opportunity out there, we expect to continue to execute on that as we move forward as we did last year.

Dividends, we just increase again in the first quarter of this year. So we're happy to do that for our shareholders and then we're continuing to invest in capital expenditures to grow the business, we're at our highest level last year and have a high budget for this year because we continue to see a lot of good opportunities to do more for our customers. So, we'll approach the share buybacks, the same way we have been doing.

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Okay. High quality (ph) problem. Thanks a lot guys.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Thanks.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Timna.

Our next question is from Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank. Please go head.

Chris Terry -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. Just two from me. Firstly, just to flesh out the capital management. Just a little bit further, basically in terms of buyback and dividend in total, you paid close to the net income of the company to 2018, understand you use buybacks opportunistically. Maybe you can just comment on the split of buybacks versus dividends and the -- the total amount that you willing to allocate. And the second question I had, it's probably for Karla as well. Just on the CapEx around the 230 level, 240 level over the last two years, a few years ago it used to be below the 200 level. Should we eventually expect that you glide down to that point or how do we think about forward CapEx. Thank you.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Hi, Chris. So first off on kind of the capital allocation and the split between buybacks and dividends. We did have a fairly high shareholder return cash amount out last year but as we commented, we think it was good execution on that. Dividends, we did not have a formal policy that -- what we try to do is make sure we're returning from a yield standpoint, kind of at or above markets levels for our best-in-class type of stock. We also don't want to make sure that our quarterly dividend rate is at a long-term sustainable level because we have never and do not want to in the future have to reduce or start paying a dividend. So that's kind of how we manage the dividend there as the company continues to grow, we're able to increase our dividend rate periodically which we have to continue to do going forward, but want to keep it at that sustainable level.

And then as we mentioned on the share buyback, it's really opportunistic. We look at where the stock's trading. We look at other opportunities and we'll execute with that. So we don't have a set target, we want the flexibility to be able to jump into the market, and we think it makes the most sense for us. And then on -- from a CapEx standpoint, you've seen our gross profit margin improve our sustainable range, which we think the sustainable part of that has really been due to the additional value-added processing that we're doing, and where we can provide more value to our customers. So we're able to get paid for that and so our people out in this field work very closely with their customers and we are always looking for opportunities of how can we do more for our existing customers and some prospective customers.

And so with the opportunities we've seen, we have been at higher levels of capital expenditures over the last few years, we've also taken advantage of some of the -- of our operations center in leased facilities. If there are good operations for our businesses we prefer to own those. So we've also bought out some of our leased properties and those indeed bigger ticket items for us, but again remember that we were doing in that $230 million, there are a lot of different CapEx items, there are 300 different -- 300 plus different operating locations out there and we're continuing to invest in all of them with equipment and facility upgrade.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, Chris, Karla is right. Our customers are asking us to do more and more. They are just -- they are -- whatever their business plan is, they seems to be shifting a bit and we're kind of known for being a value-added type of business and when they ask and that makes sense for us, we'll buy, technology certainly changes a lot of the equipment we buy. Saws and lasers and all the different things where we get into now are frankly better than they were X amount of years ago, they hold tighter tolerances, they are faster, they are safer, and when we see an opportunity like that we can -- like Karla said offer something different to our customer base and make money on it, then we're going to do it and we've got a lot of really bright operators out in the field. And when they ask, we listen.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

And to your longer term question Chris, I mean, I think coming back down to $200 million for an average longer term CapEx level is probably reasonable.

Chris Terry -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Okay, thanks. Thanks, Jim, thanks Karla, all makes sense. Appreciate it.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Chris.

(Operator Instructions) My next question is from Chris Olin from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.

Chris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst

Hey, good morning.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Good morning, Chris.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning, Chris.

Chris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst

Curious, given your view on kind of the short-term -- shorter-term order trends, was the business or any of the stores impacted by either weather in the fourth quarter, particularly on the construction markets? Or did you see any kind of abnormal order activity during the government shutdown that could've support the business?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Chris, we don't -- we never blame our business on the weather or on something and that we can't control. Because what happens is -- if they need the product or the part and they can't get it today or tomorrow because of weather or government shutdown or some, they're eventually going to need, it. So if we may -- the timing may move, sometimes the timing moves month-to-month or over a quarter, but eventually it comes back. So we don't -- we don't, the weather and the government shutdown, things like that we do not -- we don't control that, but all we can really control is that we can provide on an uninterrupted flow of really good product to our customer bases. So when they do open back up or when they're able to receive the material -- we'll get it to. So it could be delayed by a couple of days, sometimes a week, I don't know how bad the situation is, but we've been out that long time. So doesn't really change.

Chris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst

Okay, that's fair. And I guess my second question is, can you talk a little bit more about aerospace? I guess, specifically, I'm curious if you anticipate any type of negative impact on, say, the aluminum plate market given the news about Airbus canceling its A380 program, that's a pretty big consumer of material, just any risk of inventory management or something like that?

William K. Sales -- Executive Vice President, Operations

Hey Chris, this is Bill. We really don't -- if you look at the aerospace plate market right now on the supply side, it's extremely tight. And again, when we look at the future, and we look at where mill lead times are, backlogs and build rates, it's very positive. Long-term, I mean if you look at what will happen with the cancellation, our eventual cancellation of that plane that will take obviously some capacity or some need out of the market, but overall that's being built back with conversions to other planes. So I think, if we look at -- right now on the aerospace side, the outlook continues to be very positive. We've had tremendous strength in North America and maybe the rest of the world wasn't quite as strong. Now we're seeing the rest of the world improve a bit too. So all of that leads to a real positive outlook on the aerospace side.

Chris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst

Can I just ask what percentage of your business now is aerospace related?

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

On the sales dollar basis, it's probably around 12%.

Chris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst

Okay, great. Thank you.

Our next question is from Phil Gibbs from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Phil Gibbs -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Hey good morning.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Good morning, Phil.

Phil Gibbs -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Sometimes of a little bit more, maybe a little bit more color on the CapEx budget this year pretty healthy again has we noted a couple of times, but any big projects in particular, in that number. I know you talked about some of the value-added processes and a lot of your customers pulling you in those directions, which is a good problem to have, but any notable pieces in there?

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

I think, Phil, as I mentioned, we've got a couple of facilities where we are buying out the leases. So that takes up a chunk of the CapEx. We announced last year that we were expanding our aluminum toll process -- our toll processing business down in Kentucky to support a lot of the growth of aluminum down there. So that was a big item for last year carrying over into this year, it's really a lot of equipment and it's really spread out.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

They're all bigger clients. I mean, tube lasers are, $2 million plus. Flat lasers are well over $1 million. Those are, those are big ticket items. So we take them over a very seriously. So those that we have, I guess that we have -- we have a lot of big events that are -- that roll up into that large number. And if you would see as the front-out of our CapEx you'd be amazed how many line items are on that thing. But they all add up, and they're all expenses.

Phil Gibbs -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay. Then Karla your share count for the first quarter. Can you give us just exactly what that number is, I think you had pushed us some direction there?

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, so basically our actual shares outstanding at the end of 2018, we're at just over or just under $67 million shares and we generally have about a $1 million more shares that gets added to our diluted earnings per share. So right around 68-ish million shares.

Phil Gibbs -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay, that's helpful. And just want to say Greg if you're out there, I hope you're on the beach somewhere (ph).

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Our next question is from Tyler Kenyon from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.

Tyler Kenyon -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Hey good morning. Just wanted to touch on SG&A, a little bit. So we have seen some inflation labor transportation costs. Just curious if you can update on some of the inflationary pressures that you're seeing there, is that abating, getting worse and what appreciated? Thanks.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, so I think one thing on the SG&A, Tyler that we had commented on earlier in 2018 and as you've seen in -- our profitability levels, especially our pre-tax levels were up significantly in 2018 compared to prior years, and our compensation structure is very performance-based, not just here in our corporate office but also out in all of our management teams that are different operations. So, our elevated pre-tax income levels in '18, drove our compensation expense up because of that, which we think, it's kind of a good problem to have.

So, in '19 even though we expect continued high levels of profitability as a percent the margins and with some expectation that prices might come down a bit and not having the consistent mill increases that allow us to pop up our gross profit margin. We would expect some of that comp expense to potentially come down. We could get normal raises in 2019 as we normally do. So there is some inflation that you need to build in and I think the transportation costs, we did see a big ramp up last year, it's still a tight market out there for us to hire drivers and then also for our third-party carriers. But we're not expecting increases the rates that we had last year.

Tyler Kenyon -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Great. Yeah, thanks for all that color. So I guess the other, the last question I had was just on -- and I think you alluded to it earlier, but the M&A opportunities that you're seeing out there in -- at least, still aggressively pursuing that growth angle. Just curious, if you could provide us an update with -- what kind of opportunities you're seeing, right now. What are you seeing in terms of valuation and where would you be more positively disposed to in terms of expanding your reach from an end market or product category perspective?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, with the -- let's call it a target-rich environment. There's a lot of opportunities coming our way. We looked at lot of them last year. We pulled the trigger on -- how many, we did about three. But we don't change our kind of game plan when it comes to look at M&A, you have to -- you have to reach a certain point. We don't buy fixer-uppers. We like -- we only buy companies that are immediately accretive. They have to have the right people involved, they have to fit our culture. They have to good succession planning in place, and if you have those things and you make money and we like it. There's pretty good chance we'll talk to you and visit and see if we can't work something out so they're not there. Over the last couple of years this is my opinion.

I think that the tax reform kind of answered a lot of questions for these kind of family owned companies that are out there, that have been launched, they that want to sell because of the generational thing. Grandpa started the business, dad ran it, the kids don't want to be part of it and that's kind of companies it seems like we talked to a lot of I think. So there are more willing to engage with us and in kind of more willing to sell at reasonable price, sometimes people think their companies are off worth a lot more than we may think there were, but there's lot of out there. We stay busy. There's not a week doesn't come by that, Karla doesn't walk down the hall and hand me a several other than say, hey look, these guys. So it's busy.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

And I think on valuation, we have not changed the way we value companies that we try to look over a cycle and understand what we think the right normalized level of future earnings is for them and then we value the company based upon that. 2018 was a really good year for Reliance. It was also a good year for a lot of other companies out there, and we understand that. So, when we look at opportunities. We understand what happened in '18 and we believe we're still evaluating consistently and we hope that other potential buyers out there are sharp enough to also understand, that 2018 created some really strong earnings from our companies.

And then also Tyler, you asked about if there are any specific targets. You know, it really, other than the fact that what Jim mentioned about. We look for good companies. We do like kind of the higher margin specialty products and higher value add type companies but we look at every opportunity that's out there and determine if we think it's the right fit for Reliance or not.

Thanks Tyler.

Operator

Our next question is from Martin Englert from Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Thanks. Just one quick follow-up on Aerospace Aluminium heat-treated plate. Can you talk about how the lead times compare today versus where they were at in fourth quarter and maybe touch on the inventory trends there, whether there's any kind of destocking that still persist?

William K. Sales -- Executive Vice President, Operations

Yeah, happy to do that Martin. This is Bill. The lead times, I mean we've gone -- just recently, we've seen some of the domestic mills. The lead times have moved out one completely sold out through 2019. So, the supply side of that continues to be on the type side and as I mentioned, we receive the rest of the world that we're in the market was not as strong. We are seeing that improve. So, those lead times from those suppliers are starting to move out and so again, we see continued strength on the aerospace side.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Thanks for that. And the inventory trends there, what are you seeing?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

There is some talk in the market about destocking. I think that's really more at the OEM level, it's really not an issue in terms of our business. See in a couple of reports where that the position was that destocking or the inventory in the system was moderating or there was less of it. I think that's specific to a couple of situations overall from our inventory standpoint, we're in good shape. We are not overstocked by any means.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Okay, thanks for all that detail there.

211,Empty,2019-02-20T13:00:00Z,The two-headed economy is shaping up as a major issue for voters — and a challenge for whichever party forms the next government.,"EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the second in a five-part series that's a little different from what you usually read on CBC. In it, we add new reporting and analysis to the work of dozens of writers who have contributed to our Calgary at a Crossroads and Road Ahead projects over the past three years. The goal is to take stock of the turbulent times we've been through while exploring where we're headed next — and how we might get there.

The series was initially published in February. We're resurfacing it in March for those who may have missed it.

Let's call it the perception problem.

As Albertans are poised to head back to the polls after four years of NDP government, one of the main factors that will guide their ballots is the perception of where the economy is today.

When it comes down to brass tacks, we expect government to find solutions to our macroeconomic problems — whether through intervention or staying out of the market's way.

But if we plan to put our faith in the policy of a party, any party, and then later hold that party to account for achieving or failing to achieve its goals, it would seem important to agree on a set of terms and facts.

Yet, we don't.

And if that government is to have the political capital to enact policies in response to the realities the province faces — not necessarily the policies we'd prefer, in an ideal world — there needs to be some agreement on what those realities are.

Yet, there isn't.

What is and what isn't

Here's what we know from the economic data.

Out of the doom and gloom of 2015, Alberta's economy began a slow recovery in late 2016, which accelerated into a genuine rebound in 2017, and then began to sputter in 2018.

""Is our economy strong, or is it weak?"" economist Trevor Tombe wrote in January. ""Is the recession ongoing, or is recovery underway? Simple questions, but the answers are complex.""

So complex that even the data can't fully provide all the answers. Only indications.

Some indicators suggest our province could be headed for another recession. Tombe doesn't say we are actually in one, yet, only that one is possible.

""Based on all the monthly indicators, the pace of recovery is slower than any recovery has been at least in the past 20 years,"" he said earlier this month.

And we had one hell of hole to climb out of.

""The scale of the recession was massive,"" Tombe said previously. ""One-hundred-and-thirty-thousand job losses from when the recession started to when it ended in late 2016. So to say that it has come back from such a big shock is still to say that there is a long way to go.""

A long way to go. A glacial pace in a province historically rooted in fast market changes, fast decisions, fast social consequences.

Now, this will feed into the fire of the debate — the complex issue of perception around recovery.

The economy is a large and complex thing and the recovery, to date, has not been even. It's been felt differently by different Albertans depending on who they are, where they live and what sector they work in. And our province remains divided over those who see any recovery at all, and those who do not.

A lot of people just ain't buyin' it.

Who's on board and who isn't

Some CBC polling data from 2018 gives us a pretty good sense of this divide.

While the poll was a snapshot of the province taken last spring, pollster Janet Brown, who conducted the research, says it's still a pretty good indicator of the general mood.

What the poll suggested is that 45 per cent — less than half — of Albertans thought the economy was recovering at that time. But 18 per cent thought the province's economic situation was getting worse, while 35 per cent thought the situation was staying about the same.

Remember. This was in the spring. And it was a poll of all Albertans.

A different poll, taken in November and December and limited to Calgary only, found a much sourer mood. In that survey, 67 per cent of Calgarians felt the provincial economy was getting worse.

Unemployment has been persistently higher in Calgary than in Edmonton since the recession and Calgarians have been cooler to the idea that the economy has, in fact, been recovering from the depths of the downturn. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)

Now, ""recovery"" is a pretty generic word. It's macroeconomic in a way most of us don't live our lives.

Whether we feel a recovery is likely based on our personal experience, and the experience of others in our lives. There are jobs, but you can't find one. There are jobs, but your sister can't find one. You have a job, but you're making half what you used to make.

This can be nuanced by ATB chief economist Todd Hirsch, who last August said improvement in employment has been slow and the quality of new jobs somewhat dubious.

As we wrote in 2018, this recovery just feels different.

Even gender plays a role. This recession was a ""mancession,"" by many indicators. Men, who held most of those oil and gas jobs, saw more of their employment disappear during the downturn. Meanwhile, in the past couple of years, women have seen their employment rate grow at the fastest pace in decades.

Age also matters.

Ten employers greeted about 100 young job seekers when the City of Calgary’s Annual Youth Hiring Fair started two decades ago. Last year, 5,000 people showed up, resume in hand, to meet around 90 employers. (Terri Trembath/CBC)

""The share of workers in Calgary under the age of 25 that is employed is lower now than at any point in at least the past 30 years — and that's really just as far back as we have data,"" Tombe said recently.

""So, for them, I think it is fair to say the economy is getting worse.""

And yet, counterintuitively, young Calgarians were three times more likely than those over the age of 65 to see the economy as being on a positive trajectory last year.

And it's not just individuals. Industry is also divided.

Recovery or exhaustion

""There is a recovery — and there is frustration,"" Calgary Chamber of Commerce president Sandip Lalli recently said of her members' mood.

When it comes to the energy industry, specifically, economist Peter Tertzakian said there's ""a sense of exhaustion"" and ""in some cases, capitulation"" in the face of ongoing challenges.

""These are not healthy symptoms for what has traditionally been an incredibly entrepreneurial (industry),"" he said during a Chamber event in January that was moderated by CBC.

The panel, hosted by CBC's David Gray, consisted of pollster Janet Brown, ARC Energy Research Institute executive director Peter Tertzakian, Calgary Chamber of Commerce president Sandip Lalli and University of Calgary economist professor Trevor Tombe. (CBC)

​""We were feeling pretty good by summer of last year, "" he added. ""Then, we had the whole Trans Mountain judicial kiboshing — or delay — and then the (oil-price) differentials, and now we've come into '19 feeling beaten up. It's going to take most of the year to heal the wounds.""

A year to heal. If all goes well.

During that year, Albertans will go to the polls and there's little doubt that, in some sense, the vote will be a judgment on the current government's economic record. In that CBC poll from last spring, 47 per cent of people said pipelines or the economy were the most important issues facing the province.

So, let's look at how the NDP government has approached the economy — and how their main rivals say they would do things differently.

Policy choices

Governments inevitably please some and anger others.

And this government's first few years ""have been marked by contentious policy shifts,"" writes columnist Jen Gerson, ""like carbon taxes, climate change policies, farm worker legislation, minimum wage hikes and high rates of debt accrual.""

""None of it has gone over well in a deeply pro-energy province that was suffering a serious economic recession.""

At the same time, Gerson has also described Premier Rachel Notley as ""a capable, national leader during one of the most fraught economic periods of Alberta's recent history.""

""Certainly, the Notley government has taken a very active, perhaps surprising, role in supporting the energy industry,"" she wrote.

So, we return — again — to the idea of agency.

What can the government, any government, actually fix? And what is beyond its control?

It's not like you can just ring up OPEC and make demands or suddenly convince the Americans to lay off the fracking. The global energy market is just that — global. Alberta's economy, wedded as it is to energy resources, is at the mercy of the whim and caprice of international markets and geopolitical decisions made in faraway places.

But there are some things an Alberta government can control.

Just yesterday, the province announced a deal with Canadian National and Canadian Pacific to lease 4,400 rail cars to transport Alberta crude to international markets. Prior to that, Notley also acted on calls from some players in the divided oil industry to curtail crude production, despite opposition from some of the biggest, integrated oil companies in the country. She's also been advocating for the energy sector across Canada.

In a bid to diversify the energy sector and create jobs, the provincial government has also provided $1 billion in royalty credits for new petrochemical plants. Then there was the provision of up to $1 billion in additional loan guarantees and grants.

Later, the government inked a letter of intent to provide a $440-million loan guarantee for construction of a $2-billion partial upgrading facility. And the idea of home-grown Alberta refineries are also on the table.

Meanwhile, the United Conservative Party has defined its own policies largely as a negation of the NDP's.

If his party wins in a spring election, UCP Leader Jason Kenney has promised a ""summer of repeal"" in which he would legislate away the current government's farm-work safety rules, renewable energy incentives and carbon tax.

At its founding convention last May, members of the newly formed party voted on a series of more specific policy proposals, but their leader stressed that these did not form an official platform.

Federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer greets United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney prior to his speech at the UCP's inaugural annual general meeting in Red Deer in May 2018. (CBC)

Kenney has since suggested some policies he'd like to see — like introducing a youth wage that is lower than the minimum wage, or reverting to a PC-era approach to pricing carbon on large-emitters only — with the caveat that these are not guarantees.

The UCP has yet to reveal a full platform but, in a speech this past weekend, Kenney promised it will be the ""most detailed election platform in the province's history."" He also offered a few more hints at policy proposals for the economy, including a tax cut aimed at ""job creation"" and new legislation aimed at cutting red tape.

As for the specifics, we'll have to wait and see.

In the meantime, the pre-campaign campaigning has seen both Notley and Kenney trying to position themselves as ""fighting for"" Albertans.

And that means fighting for pipelines.

Pipeline posturing — and perception

It is perhaps in this scrappy national dispute over the Trans Mountain pipeline that Notley has notched some of her most political success, as of late. Her approval ratings have tended to rise when she picked fights over the issue, a strategy she continues to employ.

""Albertans still need the federal government to step up and support the industry while we are trying to get through this ridiculousness of having not enough capacity to get our oil and gas to market,"" the premier said in January, reiterating a message she's been pressing for months.

It's the kind of rhetoric that plays well at home.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley speaks at a press conference in January 2019. (Travis McEwan/CBC )

This kind of talk has even won the premier praise in some perhaps unexpected quarters. Ian Brodie, former chief of staff to prime minister Stephen Harper, wrote last year: ""The party has some big political assets, some strong cards to play. The most important of which, is Premier Rachel Notley.""

It is bandied about by political science types that, when it comes to perception, the Alberta NDP has elided with Notley, herself, which could be both a strength and deficit in the upcoming election.

Nevertheless, as Gerson described it: ""The NDP's ideology may not be a natural fit for Alberta, but Notley is still one of this province's prodigal children. And after almost three years in office she seems to have finally hit her stride. She now has a statesman-like air, a polite but cutting defence of her province in the nation.""

""Whatever Albertans think of her government's record,"" wrote Brodie, ""Notley is an honest and sympathetic character from a family with deep roots in Alberta politics. Sunny, seen as in-touch with concerns of Albertans.""

But we again return to the idea of perception.

While Brodie may see Notley as in-touch with Albertans, surveys suggest her party doesn't fare as well with the voting public.

We go back to that CBC poll from last spring.

Remember: the data showed Albertans see pipelines and the economy as the top issues facing the province. It also showed the NDP's chief rival, the United Conservative Party, to be dominant on those issues.

Pro-pipeline protesters gather and chant slogans outside a venue where Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau was speaking in Calgary in November 2018. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)

Despite Notley's tough talk on pipelines, only 26 per cent of Albertans surveyed believed the NDP were best positioned to get a pipeline built. Fifty per cent thought the UCP is better suited to the task.

When asked who they thought was best suited to manage the province's finances, 52 per cent picked the UCP and only 18 per cent chose the NDP.

And when it came to strengthening Alberta's economy? Fifty-one per cent said the UCP versus 21 per cent who chose the NDP.

And let's take into this some more recent polling data.

An in-depth survey of Calgarians' beliefs about the economy shows a massive divide along political lines. Among UCP supporters, 87 per cent thought things were worse in 2018 than the year before. Among NDP supporters, 79 per cent believed the economy had improved or at least stayed the same.

So why is this?

It could be due the NDP's messaging on the economy, according to Mount Royal University political scientist Duane Bratt.

""They keep talking about recovery and good news, and as long as they're talking about the good news and not acknowledging the really serious concerns that we're seeing coming out of these numbers, that's coming off as really tone deaf,"" Bratt said, commenting on the polling data last year.

Brown, the pollster, would agree.

""First and foremost, I think the government has to acknowledge people's pain,"" she said at a recent forum.

""And I think one of the single biggest mistakes the NDP is making is they go too hard in their promotion of positive economic news. And every time they push a positive economic statistic, somebody with real anxiety is saying, 'You know, Rachel Notley and her team, they just don't get it.'""

This ties deeply into the idea of government finding solutions to Alberta's economic woes.

""Because,"" said Brown, ""if you can't acknowledge how much anxiety I feel in my household, how am I ever going to trust you to find the solutions?""

But even if you were able to find solutions, what if nobody liked them?

Success without sacrifice

Let's recap.

The data suggests Alberta has been recovering from the recession, but the recovery is uneven and being experienced differently by different people. Therefore, a lot of anxiety remains.

Meanwhile, the government has been talking up the data that illustrates the recovery.

But it is quite possibly this emphasis on macro-level trends that is frustrating those people who have not experienced the recovery — or at least have not felt it. Instead, they feel the government isn't acknowledging the genuine challenges they face. They perceive no sympathy for their pain.

No matter which party forms government after the upcoming election, it will need to seek solutions to Alberta's troubles while contending with the varying perceptions of whether a recovery has occurred, or is occurring.

That's complicated enough, on its own. But the next government will also have to make difficult fiscal decisions in the face of another paradox in public opinion.

That same CBC polling data also suggests most Albertans want a government that balances its books without raising taxes and without requiring citizens to give anything up.

Fifty-eight per cent of Albertans want an end to government deficits. Seventy-nine per cent say now is not a good time to make significant cuts to social programs. And almost three-quarters (73 per cent) oppose a provincial sales tax.

So where's the cash supposed to come from?

""The conclusion here is simple,"" Tombe, the economist, wrote in a policy paper in November. ""Substantial spending restraint alone is insufficient to close Alberta's fiscal gap.""

There is also a need for ""modest new revenues,"" according to Tombe's analysis, if we are to ""create a sustainable economic future for Alberta.""

Economist Trevor Tombe is with the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy. (Mike Symington/CBC)

But if the majority of us are opposed to raising that revenue through new taxes, then what?

This appears to be tied back into the overarching theme of ""someone should do something."" We face choices, or our government does, but we don't like any of the options so far.

Rather, we'd like a nice, easy, painless fix for the economy, please.

​At the same time, a related choice we face is how to end our public finances' dependence on the resource roller-coaster.

As Brodie puts it: the ""bugaboo of public policy in Alberta.""

The royalty roller-coaster

""When the royalty roller-coaster goes up,"" Brodie wrote, ""money floods into the treasury and politicians promise more spending with lower taxes. We get new hospitals, new schools, better roads. And everyone on the provincial payroll gets a bigger paycheque.""

But conversely, he says, when it comes down, the private sector is quick to cut spending while the provincial government is rarely so nimble.

There have long been bids to get us off this roller-coaster, but no government of any stripe has yet found a way.

The Klein solution of heavy cuts was deeply unpopular with many, though it had plenty of supporters, too. Ultimately, though, Klein's debt-free declaration was made possible by a royalty rebound, particularly a huge surge in revenues from natural gas.

The Prentice plan, which leaned more on tax hikes coupled with modest spending reductions, led to electoral defeat.

The NDP have fared no better finding a permanent solution, opting to borrow more money to cover the ongoing gap between Alberta's revenue and expenses.

Ron Kneebone with the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy says he was initially optimistic when the NDP won power in 2015, but his hope soon faded that the government would get the province off the royalty roller-coaster.

Ron Kneebone is professor of economics at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy. (Robson Fletcher/CBC)

""I thought we were past that,"" he said last year. ""We shouldn't be balancing the budget on the basis of oil and gas.""

So what to do? Taxes? Cuts? Wage freezes?

Who wants to give up their hospital? Or their kid's school? Or their public-service job?

The upcoming election campaign will no doubt see fears raised around such choices — or at least their magnitude.

But if, as the polling suggests, Albertans expect low taxes, balanced budgets and no service cuts, it's unclear how any party can forge a winning plan that will stop the roller-coaster ride.

We might, over the decades, have waited too long for an easy fix.

A perception election

It will be intriguing to see how all the parties in the upcoming election deal with public perception of the economy and the types of solutions that are put forward. As we've seen, balancing what's pragmatic with what's popular will be a herculean task.

But this is what platforms are all about. Tangible, delineated solutions. And, it must be said, a healthy dose of telling people what they want to hear, which might sound quite different depending on the audience.

Albertans, it seems, have yet to agree on a frame for our common dilemma.

In the meantime, we must get on with business.

Alberta is, and looks set to remain, an energy-industry province.

But that industry has gone through a massive retooling over the last five years. Yes, tens of thousands of jobs have been shed, and companies were hollowed out of their human resources. But new and innovative technological advancements have also been made. New methods pioneered.

Perhaps most importantly, and in keeping with the theme that the recession and recovery feel different this time around, there appears to be a dawning awareness that the industry has entered a whole new era.

This, too, presents individual Albertans with new choices.

But that is another story: part three of The Road Ahead.

This is part two of a five-part series.

The Road Ahead is CBC Calgary's ongoing, special focus on our city and province as they pass through the crucible of the downturn: the challenges we face and possible solutions, as we explore what kind of future we want to create.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Thanks very much, Joe. Good afternoon, investors and OneSpan colleagues around the world. I'm pleased to have the opportunity to speak with you this afternoon.

We had a strong fourth quarter and for the year, revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeded the high-end of our guidance range. Our fourth quarter revenue was near record levels, with software and services growing 27% year-on-year, achieving a record high and hardware also growing at a strong 13% in the quarter. We also reported record gross profit for the fourth quarter and full year, a clear indication of the profit generating capacity of our business.

For the year, we achieved 10% revenue growth, including a doubling of sales from new customer logos and for the first time ever, our software and services revenue exceeded our hardware revenue. Mark will provide additional details on our fourth quarter and full-year results during his financial review.

OneSpan is the leading provider of authentication and fraud prevention solutions to the financial services industry. Our deep insights and comprehensive portfolio of security and productivity solutions makes OneSpan the partner of choice in this evolving landscape. The successful execution of our Trusted Identity strategy is enabling us to help our banking customers address the range of urgent challenges they face, from increases in fraud and regulation, the rapid technology change and the emergence of non-traditional competitors.

I'll now touch on each of these business drivers in more detail. Sophisticated hacking attacks and unprecedented data breaches are increasing losses to fraud on a global basis. More than 185 million social security numbers, those of well over half of the US population are now in the hands of criminals. The result is that in the US alone, identity fraud, including account takeover and new account fraud increased to nearly $17 billion in 2017, with account takeover losses surpassing $5 billion.

Our recently launched Intelligent Adaptive Authentication and Risk Analytics offerings are seeing strong customer interest, as they expand our capabilities to detect and combat identity fraud across digital channels. This is a persistent problem, and demand for identity fraud solutions is growing.

We're taking advantage of the increased opportunity presented by PSD2 and similar regulations around the world that are driving an increase in demand for sophisticated multi-factor authentication and risk-based analytics. Our mobile security suite and hardware authentication solutions assist our clients with compliance, and ensure the security of their transactions and systems.

Online-only banks, FinTechs and digital platform companies are squeezing the profitability of traditional banking services. Our open cloud-based Trusted Identity platform is designed to improve agility and security, reduce complexity and costs, and speed time to market for new consumer and commercial banking offerings. Our solutions are also built for rapid integration with leading third party technologies and customers existing in-house systems.

Two weeks ago I met with one of Europe's largest financial institutions, and they told me that they need our help in moving their identity security infrastructure into an agile cloud environment so that they can be more responsive to the emerging needs of their customers. We are carefully integrating our portfolio of capabilities into solutions that respond to these business drivers.

Our strategy is to secure, enable the full Identity life cycle from new account opening to transaction security, to securing open banking. We're in a position -- we are positioning OneSpan to be the provider of choice. No competitor can match the range of offerings we provide and are developing. This is a powerful strategy that can support our growth objectives and financial institutions and beyond, and to government, insurance and enterprise markets.

Our increased R&D investment of the last two years is enabling us to launch innovative new solutions that address these urgent market needs. I'll now update you on some of our key offerings. First, mobile security suite or MSS. Mobile security suite had an outstanding year, with revenue growth in excess of 50% and our opportunity pipeline remains robust.

Many of our existing customers are adopting mobile security suite and are often operating in mix environments that use both mobile security suite software and our hardware products, reflecting the diverse needs of their own customer bases. Critical to our success is the ability of our solutions to use consistent authentication financial transaction protocols across the mix of end-user devices.

Mobile security suite not only delivers industry-leading security, but also a low-friction user experience through its biometric capabilities. Javelin Research -- Javelin Strategy & Research recently awarded OneSpan 2018 Best in Class Mobile Biometrics Platform over 11 other providers. Mobile security suite is also an important enabler of our Trusted Identity strategy, as it integrates with our cloud-based offerings to enhance risk analytics and adaptive authentication.

The second product category I'll talk about is our e-signature and identity verification solutions that help financial institutions and enterprise to digitize business processes to reduce costs, improve productivity and enhance customer experiences. Our e-signature subscription revenue grew in excess of 20% in 2018.

In 2019, with integration to our identity verification components and with the availability of a qualified electronic signature capability, we will deliver a new secure agreement automation offering to address global market needs. We see substantial opportunities for accelerated growth in this area. As we noted previously, our customers are increasingly choosing to deploy e-signature in the cloud through a recurring revenue model. This shift is leading to a decline in new license revenue through the first quarter of 2019.

Third, let me talk about our hardware offerings. We're the market leading provider of fraud and prevention -- fraud prevention solutions for authentication and transaction security in the financial services industry. And as noted above, hardware is a key element of our overall value proposition.

In 2018, hardware revenue outperformed our expectations, with 13% growth in Q4 and full-year results matching those of last year. We attribute this outperformance to increased regulation, our advanced hardware products and the fact that hardware provides the highest level of security.

And fourth, as you have heard, we are launching several new cloud offerings through our Trusted Identity platform. We released Intelligent Adaptive Authentication in Q3, and announced our cloud-based risk analytics fraud management solution just last week. Intelligent Adaptive Authentication and Risk Analytics both have significant opportunity pipelines, and we had initial Intelligent Adaptive Authentication sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 -- I'm sorry, 2018.

In 2019, as we noted previously, we're planning to launch our secure agreement automation offering, which combines e-signature, biometrics and digital identity verification technology to create a comprehensive integrated solution for our customers. This will allow us to address our customers' needs to securely enable digital account openings, while reducing new customer on-boarding abandonment rates that can reach up to 95%, and impose immense class and lost growth opportunities on banks.

These new offerings are designed to be predominantly subscription-based, and will help grow our recurring revenue stream. Our exciting roadmap of new offerings will continue to evolve through 2020 and future years. In the meantime, we are encouraged by the talent we are attracting from our largest competitors and across the industry as knowledge of our compelling growth strategy attracts attention.

Now, let me turn to our 2019 financial guidance. Revenue for the full year of 2019 is expected to be in the range of $229 million to $237 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the full-year 2019 is expected to be in the range of $22 million to $27 million. We expect 2019's quarterly revenue trend to be similar to 2018's, with new products contributing more significantly as the year progresses.

In 2019, we will be making significant investments in our global cloud infrastructure, which is necessary to support the growth in recurring revenue that we anticipate. This may result in modest pressure on gross margin until the growth of these new services contributes to margin expansion.

I'll now turn the call over to Mark Hoyt, our Chief Financial Officer, and he will provide details for you about the quarter, the full-year 2018 and our 2019 outlook.

Mark?

Mark Hoyt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Executive Vice President

Thank you, Scott. OneSpan's strong fourth quarter was fueled by 19% revenue growth to $64.8 million. Product and license revenue grew 11% to $47.6 million, and services and other revenue grew 47% to $17.2 million. For the full-year 2018, revenue increased 10% to $212 million. And as Scott mentioned, for the first time, our annual revenue from non-hardware was more than hardware.

Subscription revenue grew 68% in the quarter and 50% for the full-year 2018. OneSpan's Sign subscription revenue grew more than 20% in 2018, and total Dealflo revenue, including subscription, maintenance and professional services met our expectations, contributing $4 million for the year. Software license revenue includes mobile security, server and OneSpan Sign e-signature licenses. It grew 6% in the quarter and 15% for the year.

Maintenance support and other revenue grew 24% in 2018, and professional services revenue grew 17%. Hardware grew 13% (ph) in the quarter, and included a broad base of customers. For the year, hardware was flat ahead of our expectations. We still expect the longer-term hardware revenue trend line to be a decline in the mid-single digit range.

Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 65% compared to 66% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross margin percentage was affected by the product mix, and by an increase in expenses to service our cloud customers. Gross margin for the full-year 2018 was 69%. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $38 million, an increase of 10% from $35 million reported in Q4 last year.

For the year, our OpEx increased 15% to $147 million. The increases in the quarter and the year are largely driven by investments in R&D and sales and marketing, and include OpEx attributed to the Dealflo business. We finished the year with 732 employees. We expect operating expense growth to moderate in 2019, with growth in R&D partially offset by declines in G&A, with slower growth in sales and marketing investments.

Adjusted EBITDA, or adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, long-term incentive compensation and non-recurring items was $9.1 million, an increase of $2.7 million from $6.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the year, adjusted EBITDA totaled $21.6 million. And as Scott mentioned, it exceeded our guidance range of $15 million to $19 million.

GAAP earnings per share was $0.10 in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to a loss of $0.65 in the fourth quarter of 2017, which, of course, was driven by the impacts of the 2017 tax reform law. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which excludes long-term incentive compensation, amortization, non-recurring items and the impact of tax adjustments was $0.17 for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $0.14 in the fourth quarter of last year.

Geographically, our revenue mix for the fourth quarter included 59% from EMEA, 23% from the Americas and 18% from Asia-Pac. This compares to 55%, 28%, and 17% in the same regions in Q4 2017, respectively. The higher share revenue in EMEA was driven by strength in our mobile security suite and contributions from our Dealflo acquisition.

Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with $99 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as compared to $158 million at the end of 2017. The acquisition of Dealflo accounted for a majority of that difference.

I will now turn the meeting back to Scott.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Thanks very much, Mark. As financial institutions and enterprise focus on growth in their digital channels, it's more important than ever to protect the customer journey, as fraud and other financial crimes become more sophisticated and pervasive. At OneSpan, our mission is to ensure customers can establish trust and peoples identities, and the devices they use and in the transactions they conduct.

Our investments in technology, people and business processes are intended to ensure that we continue to be a market leader. Our pipeline of opportunities is growing, and we will continue to invest in R&D, while managing overall operating expenses. The significant investments we've made over the prior year are contributing to growth and we're confident 2019 will be a year of progress, enhancing customer and shareholder value.

One final note before I finish my comments. As you may have seen, a shareholder has sent an open letter to our Board of Directors making a number of recommendations with respect to the configuration of our business. Our Board takes the input of shareholders very seriously, and you should know that the Board is evaluating the contents of that letter and as it always does, other approaches for creating value for shareholders.

So, as we move into the Q&A section, I want to remind participants that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our operational and financial results. So, we ask that you please keep your questions focused on that topic. And we thank you for your cooperation in this regard.

Operator, we are ready to take questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Zack Turcotte of Dougherty. Your line is now open.

Zack Turcotte -- Dougherty & Company -- Analyst

Hey. Thanks, guys. Zack on for Catharine Trebnick. So, you talked about some of your customers having mix environments both in software solutions as well as hardware. What does the timeline look like as far as when some of those customers maybe willing to move fully to software, particularly with increased regulation you talked about, as well as their kind of historical confidence in the higher-level security?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Hi, Zack. I'll take a crack at that. I think that for the foreseeable future, I think most of our large customers will continue to operate in a mix environment of hardware and mobile security software, our mobile security suite. And I think the reason for that is, we need to remember that many of these customers, even the smaller ones have hundreds of thousands of users and the larger ones have many millions of users. And those users are everything from 18 young -- 16, 17, 18 year old opening their first bank account to older people like my parents who have been banking for a long time.

And so we see that those different cohorts in the customer base really do want -- they have different requirements for their authentication solution. Some people really value the simplicity of using a hardware authenticator. Some really value the fact that they can do everything they need to do on their mobile device and don't need to have a hardware authentication. And we see the propensity to go one way or another varies a lot by region of the world. And in Asia, for example, hardware authentication remains quite popular, even as we sell a lot of mobile security suite there.

So, I think there -- our view is and there is no -- I don't think there's a lot of doubt about this that over time there is a substitution taking place of mobile security for hardware authentication. That's why we continue to suggest that we will see a gradual decline in unit sales of hardware authenticators over the next -- over the coming years with continued growth in mobile security suite.

As the mix of banking customers shifts younger or toward newer generations, they will have a tendency to use mobile devices rather than hard authentication. But this is going to take a long time. We do see that in the commercial banking space, our hardware authenticators are still the dominant approach because of the security that they offer and the fact, they are not connected to the Internet, they're quite secure.

So that's, I think what's happening. And I would make one other point about our hardware business. It plays a critical role in opening up opportunities for us because of the penetration that we have of this hardware business on a global basis. It really is a key thing that customers want and it opens the door. And in many cases, it gives us the opportunity to talk about mobile security and adaptive authentication and risk analytics, the things that are being driven both by fraud and by regulation around the world.

Zack Turcotte -- Dougherty & Company -- Analyst

Got it. Okay. And then on -- talking about e-signature, the subscription growth. Are you seeing a lot of traction from moving your current on-premise e-signature for customers to your cloud-based offering or is it primarily from new cloud deals?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Yeah. It's really new customers, predominantly, Zack. I think the reason that we have had an on-premise offering in that business, even when other competitors have not is because particularly banks, to a degree, insurance companies have been slow, I think, to move to the cloud because of the complexity of their infrastructure and also their traditional view that they could be more secure if there's -- if there are software solutions we're operating behind the firewall of their company.

And so that is beginning to change. That is why when we talk about our Trusted Identity strategy and adaptive authentication, that it's a cloud first strategy. It's because we believe when we developed that strategy that banks were going to be accelerating a shift toward the cloud. We're in the early days of that. I think this transition will happen gradually over the coming years. So, I don't expect a big shift in a short period of time with our existing on-prem customers toward cloud.

I think that will take place over somewhere in the three to five-year timeframe. And so, I think it's a very manageable transition for us, even as we -- even as we expand globally with this business and see these other opportunities around cloud, new cloud opportunities for growth. I don't think we're going to see an on-mass move, for example, from on-prem to cloud for those kinds of institutions.

Zack Turcotte -- Dougherty & Company -- Analyst

Okay. One last one on the geographic split. Substantial amount of revenue from EMEA in the quarter. I know you partially attributed to Dealflo customers. So, do you expect a similar level of revenue from EMEA in the future, next 12 months, 24 months? And could you see some additional international cross-selling opportunities for e-signature through those customers?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Well, I think that we will see some -- we will still see some benefit in EMEA from Dealflo in 2019 because we don't have a full year of it in the numbers yet. So, we still got about five months of sort of one-time pickup in EMEA in 2019 for Dealflo. So, I think that's the first thing. Mobile security suite continues to be -- have a lot of opportunity. That opportunity is global. But given that the largest proportion of our installed base is in Europe, we see a lot of that transition or uptake of mobile security suite happening in Europe, although it's also strong in North America and Asia Pacific.

So, I think those things will continue to be a factor in EMEA. I think with respect to e-signature, we have a number of things that are going on with the intent of strengthening opportunities for our e-signature business in the rest of the world. I did talk about some of those in the -- in comments that I gave earlier. We have focused, I think, in our e-signature business more than most other competitors in the financial services, in the regulated industries.

The reality is that in Europe, the banks have been slow to take up e-signature because initially, there was uncertainty about the requirements and the implications of the eIDAS regulation. We have seen that clarify, and I think one of the issues that they now face is the scalability and cost of delivering qualified electronic signature solutions. This is -- we can deliver a QES solution today. But it's -- I think we have opportunities to really make it more scalable, more cost effective, easier for the consumer to deal with.

These are all challenges around a QES. And QES, qualified electronic signature will be a minority of the e-signature business in Europe and Asia. But it is something that is an element of the solution story that needs to be used for certain types of transactions, even if it's not the most of the transactions, it needs to be something that's available, scalable, deliverable to consumers. So, as I mentioned in the call, we are working very hard on a QES solution that we intend to launch in 2019, that will help with that. At the same time, we do see opportunity for cross selling with Dealflo and our e-signature product line.

And then finally, we continue to evolve our go-to market model and our sales model internationally to support the e-signature business. In fact in 2018, we saw roughly 10% of our revenue come through our -- really our security channel and out of the global, the rest of the world environment outside of North America. So, we've seen some beginnings there. We expect to see a lot more progress and traction on that in 2019.

Zack Turcotte -- Dougherty & Company -- Analyst

Great. Thanks, Scott.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Thanks, Zack.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Fishbein of BTIG. Your line is now open.

Joel Fishbein -- BTIG, LLC -- Analyst

Good afternoon, and congrats on a great quarter and end of the fiscal '18. Scott, I have -- just couple for you. On the -- I looked in initial guide for 2019, above where we were, implies roughly 10% growth. Love to just understand your confidence in the full-year guide and what kind of visibility that you have into that number?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Sure. I think we do take a lot of effort to model the revenue outlook for the coming year. We take a lot of inputs from everything, sort of a bottoms-up view from our sales organization as well as input from our marketing and product management people about new solutions.

I feel -- I do feel confident about the guidance range that we have given. It does not, I don't think require us to deliver huge amounts of new product revenue. It does require that we deliver some. If we -- I think if we do better, then if we do, I guess, quite well on these new products. And in 2019, we could see -- we could do better. We could see better performance out of the business.

We also have taken a, I think a reasonably conservative view of the hardware business in 2019 as we did in 2018. And in 2018, we did quite a bit better than we expected. So, I think we try to look at all the parts and the pieces and be realistic about those individual components of the revenue growth and put together something that is -- stretches our organization a little bit, but is achievable for our -- in terms of meeting our commitments to investors and to our Board.

Joel Fishbein -- BTIG, LLC -- Analyst

Great. Just one quick follow-up. Were there any very large deals in 4Q, particularly on the hardware side?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Not from a revenue point of view. We did have a large hardware booking in the fourth quarter, but the revenue contribution from that was limited in Q4. So, I think, it was a pretty broad demand for our hardware products around the world, Europe and Asia, in particular. As I noted in the comments, we have positioned ourselves, I think, to take advantage of the some of the regulatory things that are happening around PSD2. And it's been very interesting to watch that.

As PSD2 has become known, we see parts of Asia and the number of different parts of Asia and the Pacific who are basically adopting a similar viewpoint around strong authentication and risk analytics, although with a longer timeline around when they plan to adopt that. So, I think that's the drivers that we're seeing for the hardware business.

Joel Fishbein -- BTIG, LLC -- Analyst

Great. Thank you so much.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Thanks. Good talking to you, Joel.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Galinko of National Securities. Your line is now open.

Matthew Galinko -- National Securities Corporation -- Analyst

Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my couple of questions. I guess, first one is just, hear your comments on hardware but just curious what visibility you have into the pipeline and sort of closure of the pipeline just given the outperformance this year and kind of the general trends that you've discussed over the last few quarters?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Yeah, I think it -- I would say, generally, you have to think about the hardware business sort of multiple parts, right. So there is a part, which is, what I like to call sort of flo business, right? I mean these are just orders that kind of come in because an existing customer needs more tokens, because they have new customers that are replacing old tokens or lost or broken ones. So, there is a fair amount of underlying business that occurs related to that.

And when you look at the customer base for hardware, that customer base is pretty well known. A large proportion of their revenue, as I noted, are reorders and additional orders in the hardware business. Now, that doesn't mean we necessarily have specific visibility more than, say, 90 days or 120 days or something like that, but it does give us some confidence in a baseline level of the business activity.

On top of that are new projects, where a customer is deploying, maybe there -- they've been a customer before and they're upgrading to a new token technology, for example, our CRONTO technology, which has been an important driver for us over the last few years and will be an important driver for us in 2019.

And so, we do have some good visibility to some of that project work. A meaningful part of the hardware revenue in 2019 is related to orders we've already received for larger orders from large customers. And so, we layer that on top of the -- on top of that flo business that I talked about. So, that's kind of the pieces that we look at, and I would say, our visibility to 2019 isn't materially different than it was for 2018.

Matthew Galinko -- National Securities Corporation -- Analyst

Okay. Thanks. And then, you talked about investments in global cloud infrastructure. Can you be a little more specific about what those investments might entail and are they limited to 2019? Do you expect them to be made earlier in the year and sort of will see them flow through the year?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Yeah. So, we have -- we do have cloud infrastructure in many places around the world today to support our e-signature business. We have cloud platforms in Canada, US, Europe, the Pacific. So, we do have a lot of that already. But that infrastructure is really supporting e-signature today, as we begin to deploy these new integrated TID solutions, adaptive authentication and risk analytics. And then later in the year, some of the new agreement automation offerings, which will tie together e-signature and our identity verification capabilities. Those are all going to require in some cases new and in some cases, expanded infrastructure for these cloud offerings.

So, in order for us to -- let me just say, first of all, we have global interest in these new solutions; adaptive authentication, risk analytics, for example. In every region, we have customers that we are engaged with and talking about those products, those solutions. Obviously, before we can deploy those products or let those customers do proof-of-concepts and things like that, we need to put the cloud infrastructure in place. So, that's a part of what's required. We -- I would say that's coming a little bit faster than maybe we originally thought. And the reason for that is because of the amount of customer interest that we're seeing.

You have to keep in mind that, that infrastructure has to be in place and there's a buying process, a buying cycle that takes place and then there is a deployment period that takes place, and then there's a ramp-up of volume on that platform. So, we are using public cloud infrastructure for most of that. So, there is an upfront investment that we need to make to enable our ability to solve these solutions and that does run ahead of revenue initially. And then after that, we do this in a way that we can then scale those platforms with demand.

But others are getting in price. So, it's sort of the costs to get started and that's what we're talking about. That's happening -- is already been happening in 2018. Mark, I think referred to it in his comments. We did -- we are already seeing a significant uptick in cloud infrastructure costs in 2018 related to the intelligent -- sorry, Intelligent Adaptive Authentication product and the Risk Analytics that we just launched. So, that will continue to build, I would say throughout 2019, probably be a little more heavily weighted in early part of the year.

As you know, we have a -- not a seasonality, but a sort of a pattern to our business over the kind of the revenues in the first half and the second half, and revenues tend to be higher in the second half. So, there's a little bit of a -- there's certainly some pressure on margin in the early part of the year just based on that infrastructure investment that starts to get little better as we look at the second half.

Matthew Galinko -- National Securities Corporation -- Analyst

Great. Thank you.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Thanks, Matt.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Anja Soderstrom from Sidoti & Company. Your line is now open.

Anja Soderstrom -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst

Thank you, and congratulations on a good quarter. And I have some follow-up questions on the e-signature. So, I just want a clarification. So, are people still going on-premise first or are people most going into the cloud directly now or clients, I would say?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Sure. Sure. Hi, Anja. Nice to hear from you. What's -- the change that's really happening, Anja, in through 2018 and into the early part of 2019 is that most of our new opportunities, our new customers are want -- do want to use the cloud, the cloud product and the cloud platform. I think that this is true, certainly true for those customers, our non-banking customers, I would say in e-signature and is becoming increasingly true for our banking customers, although, again, that's going to be -- that's going to take a little bit of time, but it is. We are seeing that happen. It is the case that financial institutions, for example, have very rigorous internal processes and regulatory issues related to putting systems into the cloud.

So, they really have to do their homework. They are doing that homework. And the reason they're doing it is because they are under significant financial pressure as I mentioned in my comments. And so they -- and then they also need to be more responsive to their new customers and being agile at delivering new services.

So, a cloud deployment of these types of services can be quite useful or quite helpful, both in reducing costs and increasing their speed to market. So, that's why we see it happening. It's happening again with banks slowly. I don't think we see it, in terms of a big shift, but we will see it as a transition over time and indeed most of our new opportunities are coming as recurring revenue cloud-based implementation.

Anja Soderstrom -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst

Okay. Thank you. That was helpful. And then also, I wanted also to have some clarity on the e-signature as it relates to the new client on-boarding that you are launching in the second half, that's going to be an essential part for that, right?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Certainly, I think it's -- we've been looking at this opportunity for quite some time. With -- we know that it is a real-time opportunity with banks and other types of customers around the world. This ability to digitally open new accounts and onboard customers, verify their identity, meet the know-your-customer, anti-money laundering requirements. It's complicated to do it, and the success rate for many institutions in doing it has not been very high. So, it is a big opportunity because nobody -- let me not say nobody, many people, particularly young people are not interested in going into a bank branch to open new accounts. They expect to be able to do it online or on their phone.

And today, it's a mixed bag. In some places, you can do it and in some, you can't. And so we know that this is a big opportunity and we have been looking at it very hard for well over a year. That was one of the fundamental drivers for the acquisition of Dealflo to increase our capability and accelerate our speed to market to capture that opportunity and do it in a way that is really focused on the security issues around new account opening.

The trick is not so much a workflow, a web-based workflow that allows you to show screens to people and capture information. It's really about how you can use that data and other information to ensure that someone is who they say they are, and that they are a legitimate client for that bank, that institution. So, that's our approach. That's what we're focused on. And we think it's -- we think it's a pretty big deal over the next few years.

Anja Soderstrom -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst

Okay. Thank you. And then lastly, sort of M&A. You acquired Dealflo and you are still sort of working on that. Is there any other -- how do you think about M&A? Are you looking for more like technology or?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Yeah. So, I think -- yeah, I think, on Dealflo, first of all, so far so good. We have really, I would say, fully integrated that business into OneSpan. We are doing, as I've noted, we're doing a lot of work right now in integrating the Dealflo technology, not only into our e-signature but also into our Trusted Identity platform. So, there is some good progress that's going on there.

We continue to, I would say, be methodical about our M&A opportunity. We are always looking at lots of companies. We filter the companies that we look at based on our strategy, first and foremost and second of all, based on actionability and potential cost and risk and all of those. And we really consider all of those kinds of things, when we -- as we do this. So, it's not a -- it's not kind of a one-off or somebody gets a big idea is to do a deal, it's a process that we carry out on a continual basis to identify gaps in our -- in our capability that we can best fill through acquisition. So, we continue to do that in real time.

And I would say, I'm not trying to tell you there's anything imminent necessarily. But we are -- we continue to be very active and thoughtful about how to best use our balance sheet, how to best get a good return on the capital that we have available for our business. We're very focused on making sure that we use our cash and our capital for high-return opportunities.

Anja Soderstrom -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst

Okay. Thank you. That was very helpful.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Great. Thanks, Anja.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Reed Motulsky of Imperial Capital. Your line is now open.

Reed Motulsky -- Imperial Capital -- Analyst

Hi. Speaking on behalf of Saliq Khan. Could you please give us some more color on OneSpan's transformation toward more of a cloud-based and services business model?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Sure. Hi, Reed. And our thoughts to Saliq, he is on a plan or something right now, but anyway, we are glad to have you. Reed, let me just try and think about kind of where to start with that. We, today, as we narrowed in our comments earlier, for the first time in 2018, a minority of our revenue came from our hardware products, the majority came from our non-hardware products which includes software, different types of services and subscription-based revenues.

So we -- the subscription based revenue is, I would say, is a smaller part of that right now. But it's a part that is growing pretty, pretty quickly, as Mark shared with you in his comments. We have -- we have built our Trusted Identity strategy and our Trusted Identity platform to be a cloud-first strategy. It doesn't mean necessarily cloud only over time, but as a cloud-first strategy because we believe that's where the highest growth is and that's where the biggest demand is going to be.

And I think most of the analyst reports that you read about the cybersecurity industry, when you look at the cloud-based deployment model, part of each different categories of cybersecurity, the cloud model is always growing faster. And as you know, it delivers -- it can deliver a more stable recurring revenue model with strong levels of profitability and all that. So that -- those are the reasons, right, that we decided to use a cloud-first model with Trusted Identity. We learned a lot, I think, about cloud from our acquisition of eSignLive a few years ago. And with the addition of Dealflo there, we are increasing the proportion of our revenue that comes from cloud and recurring revenue.

So, it is a learning process for our organization. I think to really become a cloud-first company, we're making, I think a lot of progress on that. And as we see from the release of the products that I talked about, Intelligent Adaptive Authentication, Risk Analytics. And so it's hard work, but we're making good progress and I'm -- I think it's going to be an increasing contributor to our overall revenue stream profitability as we get through 2019 and into 2020 and forward. So, don't know if I exactly answered your question but I will try again if I didn't.

Reed Motulsky -- Imperial Capital -- Analyst

Thank you. And you talked earlier about hardware reorders and some of that category is more predictable. Are those sales largely put into the maintenance support and other category when you break out revenue by major products and services?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Mark, you want to take that one?

Mark Hoyt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Executive Vice President

Sure. Reed, we include the hardware in our products and licenses subset, not service and maintenance. There is maintenance and service that we get on our other business, of course, and that's included in the next line. But the bulk of that hardware revenue comes through the product and license subset.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

And the bulk of the maintenance is actually software maintenance.

Mark Hoyt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Executive Vice President

Correct.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Right? Yeah.

Reed Motulsky -- Imperial Capital -- Analyst

All right. Thank you very much.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Thanks (ph), Reed.

All right. Thanks, Reed.

Operator

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Scott Clements, CEO, for any closing remarks.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Thanks very much, operator. Thanks to all of you for listening in and asking, I think some very, very good questions and I'm sure were beneficial to others who were on the call beyond just self. So, we are very pleased with the performance that we saw in 2018.

Two-years ago, we defined a three-year plan to transform our company and through two years of that three-year plan, I believe we have delivered on what we said we are going to do. And we're excited for 2019 and looking forward to another year of progress and contribution that really creates a shareholder value value for our shareholders, and those who are participating in the story of this company through holding our shares.

Thanks, everybody. Have a good rest of your day.

Operator

Good morning. My name is Daisy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 20th, 2019.

Your speakers for today are Scott Gammill, Tom Fanning and Drew Evans. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.

Scott Gammill -- Investor Relations Director

Thank you, Daisy. Good morning and welcome to Southern Company's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer.

Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.

At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. As we report our 2018 results and look ahead to 2019 and beyond, our focus remains on investing in our premier state-regulated utilities and providing outstanding risk-adjusted returns for investors.

2018 was a year of incredible accomplishments for Southern Company. We entered the year with a great deal of uncertainty regarding corporate tax reform and our own first full year as general contractor at Vogtle 3 and 4. First regarding tax reform, we reached timely innovative and constructive outcomes with regulators in multiple jurisdictions, and as a result, are in the process of delivering approximately $1.8 billion of benefits to customers, while preserving our credit quality and improving earnings per share.

At Vogtle Units 3 and 4, we completed our first full year as general contractor. In July, we revised the estimated cost to complete and we recalibrated site production expectations with a sitewide reset. Since then, we have achieved a trajectory of staffing and productive hours worked per week that is ahead of what we targeted on our last earnings call. We continue to have a lot of work ahead of us to sustain this performance, but we are pleased with our progress and are confident that we can meet the schedule approved by our regulators. I'll provide more details on Vogtle 3 and 4, shortly.

We are executing our business model in a world-class manner. Our modernization initiatives have improved customer service and resilience of our system. Through aggressive cost management, we expect to continue to invest in our state-regulated franchise, while keeping rates low, sustaining our outstanding operational performance, and delivering strong financial performance.

In 2018, we successfully completed strategic value accretive transactions totaling over $11 billion, efficiently sourcing equity to strengthen our balance sheet. Notably, we closed on the sale of Gulf Power Company on January 1st of 2019. And we expect to close on the sale of Southern Power's Mankato facility this summer. Our decisive actions substantially reduced our projected equity needs, removed significant risk from financing plans and positioned the Company for future growth.

Customers are at the center of everything we do and we have continued our long-standing track record of providing some of the best customer service in the business. For example, Georgia Power, was the highest-rated utility for both residential and business customer satisfaction by JD Power in the South region in 2018, and Nicor Gas was rated among the most trusted utility brands by residential customers.

Let's turn now to an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Throughout 2018, progress at the site was significant. We achieved our major 2018 construction milestones for the project. Overall, including engineering, procurement, and the initial test plan, the project is approximately 74% complete. During the past three months, several significant milestones were achieved. Unit 3 milestones included: setting the first reactor coolant pump; placement of the third and final containment ring; and setting the main control room roof.

At Unit 4, we set the pressurizer and second steam generator inside the containment vessel. Additionally, since our third quarter earnings call, the remaining two AP1000 units in China, Sandman 2 and Haiyang 2 achieved commercial operation. Lessons learned from China will continue to benefit our project .

On our third quarter call, we detailed solid productivity improvement, and I'm pleased to report today that positive momentum at that site continues. We've successfully added approximately 700 new skilled craft resources, attracting pipe fitters and electricians to the site. We told you in November that we were targeting to ramp up to 140,000 productive hours worked per week by March. So far, for the month of February, we have averaged 141,000 earned hours per week. In fact, last week, we achieved a 146,000 hours with a CPI of 1.08. We are focused on sustaining this progress throughout 2019 and into spring of 2020.

As we have discussed previously, we continue to manage construction on a more aggressive schedule in order to preserve margin to the regulatory approved dates. For reference, we currently estimate that we need to sustain approximately 110,000 weekly earned hours in order to meet the November '21 and November 2022 regulatory approved schedule.

We are currently in the midst of rebaselining our work for Vogtle Units 3 and 4. At a high level, this effort involves a verification of estimates for remaining commodity quantities, hours to install those quantities, staffing trends, testing and system turnover requirements and achievable craft labor production. This rebaselining effort will refine the weekly work plan for the remainder of the project. Our over arching objective in the rebaselining effort is to maintain the aggressive work plan at the site, allowing us to preserve as much margin in our schedule as possible to the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory approved in service dates.

While it's important to acknowledge that this rebaselining effort is not complete, we continue to expect that the project schedule and capital cost forecast will be consistent with our prior estimates, and based on early indications, we also expect a reduction in the amount of remaining productive hours needed to complete the project. We expect to conclude the rebaseline effort prior to our first quarter call and Georgia Power will file a report with the Georgia PSC reflecting the results no later than May 15. The Public Service Commission staff will then have until July 31st to file their observations on the outcome of the rebaseline process with the Commission.

In the appendix of our slide deck for this call, we've provided the most recent schedule performance index, cost performance index and percent complete metrics. While we continue to believe that these measures are the best indicators of progress at the site, please note that the charts provided for the schedule performance index and percent complete metrics, do not reflect the ongoing rebaselining effort and we believe it is likely that the most recent results shown on those charts are not representative of the current status of the project. We will provide an update on the results of the rebaselining effort, including an update on these key measures on our first quarter earnings call.

On the regulatory front, the Georgia Public Service Commission voted yesterday to approve a stipulation between the PSC staff and Georgia Power that settled all issues in VCM 19, which included combining the filing of VCM 20 and 21 in August of 2019 at the request of the PSC staff. Combining the filings recognizes the ongoing rebaselining effort and is designed to accommodate an unusually busy regulatory calendar in Georgia, which includes Georgia Power's triennial integrated resource plan filing and rate case filings for Georgia Power and Atlanta Gas Light. This action is not without precedent. Some of you may remember that in 2013, we made a similar determination with the PSC staff to combine VCMs 9 and 10 during Georgia Power's 2013 rate case.

I'll turn the call over now to Drew for a financial and economic overview.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, adjusted results for the quarter and the full year exceeded our expectation. Due to the positive impact of weather and cost control for the full year, the related customer refund accruals occurred in the fourth quarter, so comparison of year-over-year adjusted fourth quarter earnings results is not particularly informative and I'll focus on the full year.

For the full year, on an adjusted basis, Southern Company earned $3.13 billion, or $3.07 per share in 2018, compared to $3.02 billion, or $3.02 a share for 2017. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in this morning's release and earnings package. Last year, as a result of the impacts of tax reform in our business, we reset the starting point of our expected long-term EPS growth trajectory to $2.87 per share. Our adjusted 2018 results of $3.07 per share were approximately 7% above the mid-point of our original guidance range.

This result was also above our updated guidance range disclosed on the second quarter call, which was increased due to performance through mid-year and the Florida asset transactions. The major drivers versus 2017 were the positive effects of constructive regulatory outcomes and weather at our state regulated utilities, somewhat offset by increased depreciation and amortization, interest expense and share issuance.

Importantly, we have also been successful in holding our non-fuel O&M expense flat at our state-regulated electric utilities year-over-year as we continue to create and seek out operational efficiencies.

Looking at some of the operational highlights, our generation system load was 4% higher in 2018 compared to 2017, representing our second highest load on record. The increase was primarily due to extreme cold temperatures in January and warmer than normal temperatures in September. We also experienced record gas burn and gas generation in 2018, due to higher loads throughout the year and lower gas prices in the second and third quarters.

For 2018, our energy supply mix was comprised of 47% natural gas, 27% coal, 15% nuclear and 11% renewables. Notably, generation from coal plants continue to trend downward, which is in line with our stated carbon reduction objectives.

Moving now to an economic review of the year, we continue to see robust net income -- net-in migration, particularly in the Southeast. Across our regulated utilities, we added 41,000 new residential electric customers and 32,000 new residential gas meters during 2018. Our combined business territories continue to see slightly faster population growth than the rest of the nation, and in particular, Atlanta is currently the fourth fastest growing metro area in the United States.

Retail electric sales growth for the year was approximately 1% on a weather-normalized basis, principally driven by this customer growth, with a minimal decline in customer usage. As we forecast future years, we anticipate the customer growth trend to continue, but we also expect a slight annual decline in customer usage. When looking at these two factors combined, our forecast for retail electric sales growth remains flat to 1%. While we achieved growth at the top end of this range in 2018, our guidance remains flat to 1% for 2019 for sales.

The commercial customer class continues to grow. However, energy efficiency, eCommerce and other changes in business models are challenging overall demand growth. While there were signs of slowing momentum in the fourth quarter in selected industrial segments, industrial sales were strong for the year in 2018, with seven of our Top 10 industrial segments posting year-over-year growth.

Overall total employment growth remains strong in our service territories. Alabama and Georgia both outpaced the national average, with employment growth of 2.2% and 2.5%, respectively. And developers continue to select sites in the Southeast for large-scale economic development projects.

Before I turn the call back to Tom, I'd like to discuss our 2019 EPS guidance range and our long-term outlook. Our 2019 EPS guidance range is $2.98 per share to $3.10 per share. The $3.04 per share mid-point represents growth of approximately 6% from $2.87 per share, the midpoint of our original 2018 guidance range.

In the first quarter of 2019, we estimate that we will earn $0.70 per share, excluding a preliminary gain on the sale of Gulf Power currently estimated to be $1.28 per share, as well as any other adjustments in that period. Our expected long-term EPS growth rate remains 4% to 6%, using the same base of $2.87 per share that we established a year ago. This growth rate is driven by strong fundamentals across our state-regulated electric and gas utilities, and a continued focus on cost control. We expect our state regulated utilities to comprise over 90% of total projected earnings through the five-year horizon.

Our long-term outlook continues to be driven by capital investment in our state-regulated businesses. Our investment plan of $38 billion includes a projected rate base growth at our regulated utilities of approximately 6%. This updated plan reflects a $3.7 billion increase over last year's forecast for 2019 through 2022, excluding the previously disclosed Vogtle cost increase.

The main drivers of the increase are significant incremental state-regulated utility investments primarily related to the closure of ash ponds or environmental spend in Georgia and Alabama as we continue initiatives to modernize and increase the resilience of our electric generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure.

For Southern Power, the cumulative five-year investment plan of $900 million is comprised entirely of previously announced projects and maintenance capital for the existing generation fleet. We expect to remain opportunistic with regard to growth at Southern Power, seeking to deploy new capital for projects that meet our stringent risk and hurdle rate objectives, but any incremental growth opportunities at Southern Power are expected to enhance the long-term financial plan and be largely self-funded.

We currently forecast the total equity need of $2.5 billion to $3 billion over the next five years. We have the capacity to fulfill most or all of our projected equity needs through our robust internal equity plans. However, we will continue to preserve all options and evaluate other potential equity alternatives. We have demonstrated discipline and agility in seeking the most efficient sources of equity in the past. 2018 could not be more indicative of this, and we will remain equally thoughtful and investor focused as we fulfill our future equity needs.

Financial integrity and strong credit metrics provide significant benefit to customers and investors, and it has always been a top priority for us. We've taken significant steps over the past year to deleverage our balance sheet, and in 2019, we expect to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our credit metrics.

Another long-standing priority for Southern Company is providing a regular, predictable and sustainable return to shareholders through our dividend. We have an outstanding track record of dividend payments and growth. Over a 71-year period, dating back to 1948, we have paid 285 consecutive quarterly dividends that have been equal to or greater than the prior quarters. While future dividend policy is the purview of the Board of Directors, we are proud of this track record and we believe our financial outlook continues to support our objectives of growing the dividend $0.08 per year.

I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Drew. In closing, throughout 2018, we continued to execute across all our businesses, achieving outstanding results. The foundation of our business remains strong. Our customer-focused business model, with an emphasis on outstanding reliability, best-in-class customer service and rates well below the national average, continues to be the cornerstone of delivering value to customers and shareholders.

Our credit profiles are significantly improved, we continue to project 4% to 6% long-term growth in our business and our employees across the franchise continue to deliver outstanding service to customers and the communities that we are privileged to serve.

2019 will be an extraordinarily important year for Southern Company, with particular focus on Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and investment in our state-regulated businesses. We have a long track record of successfully executing on our business model and believe we are poised for continued success in the months and years ahead.

We appreciate your continued interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take your questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning, Greg.

Greg Gordon -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

Hey. Good morning. Thank you for the time, just numbers look great, near-term outlook looks great. I just wanted to make sure I understand precisely the message you're trying to deliver on Vogtle today. It was just a tad confusing.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Okay.

Greg Gordon -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

If I heard you correctly, you said, you were at 146,000 -- productivity of 146,000 recently, you're at 140,000 today. The target was to be at 140,000 by March and that if you can maintain at least 110,000, you believe you can deliver the regulatory in-service date in November on the current cost schedule, is that correct?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. In general, we were --

Greg Gordon -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

Because the reason I'm asking, sorry --

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Go ahead.

Greg Gordon -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

The reason I'm asking is, because you then said you're now rebaselining and I think -- but the rebaselining, if my understanding is correct, is just delivering a schedule to the regulator that now reflects that aspiration?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

It's all of that. Yes, it's -- every so often. Say, 18 months or so, we'll take a look at the schedule and based on everything -- we have to kind of use schedule in discrete periods, right. We obviously look every week to optimize workflows and process, learnings from China as they have now achieved start-up, all of that goes into our thinking about, what the implications are for the work performed for the remaining construction period of the plant. All of that input goes into what we call rebaselining. And the outputs we believe -- now, it's not gone yet, got to stress this to everybody, but everything that we see right now, as of today, says, cost and schedule are preserved and we expect to have to spend less hours to complete the project than what is currently in our budgets. Okay.

And if I just gave a little more refinement there, what we know today, what we believe today is at least a reduction in hours of around 600,000 hours. Now, there may be more, we'll see what happens, we will deliver that when it becomes public as we conclude the rebaselining effort. So, in general, what we said in October was, we needed to hit 140,000 by March. We've hit 140,000 in February. Last week, we hit 146,000. So we're very happy with the productivity and the staffing resources necessary to deliver productive hours per week. So good track. The challenge for us, can we sustain that from February of '19 to February of '20. You should expect that those numbers may bounce around during that period of time, but if we can average 140,000, we believe right now and this is before baselining is complete, that we'll be able to hit our more aggressive schedules.

Recall, the schedule that we are focusing on, paramount, is November '21, November '22 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. It remains the case that we are working on site to April schedules. The idea there is to deliver more margin to the regulatory approved schedules by the Georgia Public Service Commission. Okay. And we try to give you reference points. And let me just make sure we get those clear. On productive hours worked per week, we think if we average 110,000 hours per week, we could hit November schedules. Hitting anything better than that improves our likelihood of gaining margin to November. That's why we're targeting 140,000 or even above for this remainder of the period, February '19, February of '20. These numbers, we believe, are consistent with the April schedule that we have in place. But again, we got to finish rebaselining, there's a lot that goes on.

Even theoretically you could reduce hours and have a prolonged schedule maybe a week, two weeks, three weeks, a month, something like that. It just depends on a whole lot of sequencing that goes on, but the point is, if we do better than 110,000, we are gaining margin to November. We're targeting 140,000, and we're doing a little better than that right now.

One other point, these charts in the back, we had an argument internally about providing you those charts. That's OK. We fight all the time here.The charts are based on the old schedule, they do not include the new rebaselining and everything else. And let me just give you the reference point there. On CPI, if we can beat -- I think, it's 1.4 -- CPI is 1.4, then we will do better than our budget that we're projecting for the November in-service dates. And schedule, if we can beat 1.3, we will do better than the November schedule. That's how we're evaluating those charts. Those are the reference points.

Now, I'm sorry Greg, I went into a little bit detail, maybe more than you wanted, but I want to be very clear about where we are.

Greg Gordon -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

No. That's exactly -- Tom, that's exactly what I was asking. So, right now, you're creating margin against the November schedule. You will sort of quantify exactly what the current schedule is in the rebaselining process that you're going to submit to the Commission, and then as long as you can keep on track, you're continuing to create a little bit of above 110,000, you continue to create a little bit of headroom to the November in-service date. I think that's clear. I guess the one final question, then I'll jump to the back. You said you might be able to do it in fewer hours, does fewer hours mean actually a lower cost? I mean is it really this times hour or are there other factors involved?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. There's other factors, the amount of commodities involved, and piping wire, stuff like that, certainly the cost of the units employed. I think we suggested -- there was all this conversation in the past about we need people from Canada and everything else and I still think that would be a good thing to have, what we did on the site was actually increase wages for electricians and pipe fitters to essentially top decile. Now, we were able to absorb those costs in our own variance without touching contingency, but there will be issues along the way that really deal with unit cost. Hours certainly matter and all of the things being equal, you have less hours, you have less cost, you have less schedule, but we can't say that with certainty until rebaselining is complete. So let us finish the work and we'll tell everybody what the results are once it's complete.

Greg Gordon -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

Thank you, Tom.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Hey, Julien.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Hey, good morning. Can you hear me?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes, sir. Hear you fine.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Excellent. So perhaps following up on Greg's question on Vogtle, if you don't mind. You talk about a reduction in the amount of remaining productive hours. Can you elaborate a little bit more? You may have already touched on this just a tad in the last question, but I want to hit that very specifically here. What is improving in terms of the underlying construction site from a productivity perspective?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So, if you recall, one of the big issues we talked about -- we kind of stated, we need more people, and once we get the people on the site, we got to get them productive. And I think, we've talked in the past about some guys, some -- an electrician walks on the site, so we got a new person, but it takes him a while to get productive. We estimate that there is a little bit of friction, may take two weeks or so to get the person working at near best capability. So there is this issue of -- what do we get about 75 people per week, getting them up to speed, and so you'll see some friction in the -- especially the CPI metric. But as you get staffing where you need it and everybody starts to become productive, CPI should start to go down, and in fact, that's exactly what we're seeing on the site. So it's a function of getting people, getting them productive and then working better.

The other factor that has been important here is not just attracting, but retaining people. And not only retaining, but also less absenteeism and a variety of other things. All of our compensation practices right now, incent people to stay, to have good attendance and to be productive. And I must say, we've had a terrific partnership with Bechtel. I want to make sure I call out my friend Brendan Bechtel and Jack Futcher and Barbara and the whole team there at Vogtle 3 and 4. We work with them day in and day out. And we continue to surprise ourselves, I think, with more productivity at the site. It goes to material management practices, it goes to work packages, just real kind of meat and potatoes, blocking and tackling kind of stuff. We continue to find ways to improve.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Julien I think another --

Julien Dumoulin-Smith -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Please.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Another way for you maybe to think about this is that rebaselining is an effort to understand the number of hours that it takes to complete each of the tasks that are required for completion of the facility. And so, efficiency is an important measure, but after a year or so of operation, just really redefining what each individual task will take in terms of total hours that way we're not tracking against the curve that's incomplete.

And everybody should know, Julien, we know it well, there is still a long way to go. Building margin is just smart, you just don't know what's going to happen in the future, we're showing a really good report today. It's important for us to continue to build the margin, that just insulates us against risk in the future.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

And just to reconcile this, the hiring ramp, I know you're already at these 140,000 plus hours a week. How do you think about that today, given the 700? You just mentioned a second ago about you would like to see potentially Canadian hires, but implied that it wasn't necessary at this point just, just where are we here?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

The Canada comment was just another arrow in the quiver should something else happen. We still have to go through outage season, will people stay with us, a variety of all, but that's just belt suspenders. We feel like everything we are doing right now is getting us the people we need, and in fact, what I would say is, pipe fitters, we're pretty well where we need to be. We do need a few more electricians down the road, but we are where we need to be right now and we'll assess hitting the market for more people later.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Got it. It's composition of people rather than a hiring ramp at this point?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. We're actually very happy with where we are, and in fact, we have a backlog right now. So what does that mean? People see what's happening at the site. I think, word is spreading quickly. We've had great cooperation, Sean McGarvey, US Building Trades, they see this as a quality worksite, a safe worksite. They can count on the hours and so people are really attracted to come here now. So I think what we want to do is continue to see that. We've had more applications come in than we can process or want to process on the site. Like I said, we could process maybe 150 people on the site, but we couldn't make them productive. That would just be a cost measure, our kind of target has been around 75 people per week. And so we have a backlog right now. We feel good about staffing, we feel good about making them productive. And the numbers that we show so far reflect that.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Hi, Jonathan.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

Good morning, guys. I appreciate the extra information on the slides that you're going to update with the rebaselining. And the one you didn't talk about was that percent complete in your answer to Greg, Tom. And I was just curious, when you look at those December and January numbers, they seem to be a long way short even though you are exceeding your current target zone on hours worked. And should we expect that that gap will effectively be eliminated once you rebaseline? So, is that the right way to kind of think about how that's going to change or anything you could say to that picture?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

That graph, I think is based on the aggressive schedule and it's based on an April target. Okay. And it's on the old data. It's on the old kind of hours worked and everything else. So my sense is, there's really two pieces of information you don't see on that: one is, how does that compare to November; two is, it doesn't include the benefits of rebaselining.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

Okay. Those sounds like putting them out together, it's safe to assume next time you show it to us, that gap between the blue and the green bars ought to be a lot smaller?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. And Jonathan let me just give you that. We chatted about that just before the call what that would look like. Now, this is highly imperfect. I'm giving you what we believe. We think at kind of this 140,000 plus level, we're going to be completing about 2% per month and that will essentially converge these two lines, but we need to show you that.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

Perfect.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

We had a real debate about whether to show this or not. We said we would show it to you, that's why we put all these disclaimers up her.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

Well, having that answer, to explain it was very helpful.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

You bet.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

Thank you for that. And then just one other, when we look back to some guidance, look back to how you showed your guidance last year, you had this 4% to 6% cone and the numbers coming in at the high-end in 2019, including Vogtle, which you've obviously now affirmed, and then, drifting into the middle in '2, and toward the lower end in '21. I'm just curious, is that still the right kind of trajectory to be thinking about, or is that old presentation now redundant?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Jonathan, I think that's still fair. You have to remember that what will actually be reported is still a function of the ROEs that are allowed during the construction period for Vogtle. And so that capital deployment does put a little bit of pressure on what would have been reported normally. Tom and I've talked a lot about this. I think, absent Vogtle, we're quite comfortable with our strength within that cone of earnings.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

We'd be at the top end of the range.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

We'd be at the top end, but we are comfortable that we can stay within it even with the ROE depression that we get from Vogtle deployment.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

And remember, Vogtle 3 and 4. I think, is 8% of our earnings, somewhere around there?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

And just remember, during that period, especially '20 and '21, we're in that period where we have the lower ROEs associated with incremental expenditures. But recall, once we clear '21 and '22, once you get these units in, the trajectory really accelerates. It looks like an 8% kind of number out there from say '20 to '22, or '21 to '23. So it has a little bit of a shape and it shouldn't surprise anybody. You all have known about the regulatory settlement with Georgia for some time. I'm happy that if you look at our range this year, it shows that the top side, 8% over 287 (ph). And the bottom side is anchored in the bottom of our 4% growth rate.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

The most significant difference probably year-over-year is that we really are focusing our efforts on this $38 billion worth of investment into regulated enterprise. We continue to identify projects, whether environmental or modernization, and transmission and distribution. We're still exploring opportunity around migration of the generating fleet to a less carbon intensive mode. And so I think that these will be a series of updates as we explore these options through '20 and '21, but this is our single best projection of our future, I think, today.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. And one more just point of interest, the Georgia Commission has always been innovative and creative. For the first time in our IRP, we introduced a section called Resilience, and it really talks about thinking differently about the electric system. In other words, integrating in concepts of resilience beyond transmission lines and generating plants to gas pipelines and what are all the implications of storage and how can we think differently about the make, move and sell concept in terms of improving the reliability and ultimately the resilience to customers. These are really important concepts.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

Great. And just what one high scheming item, did you end up sharing with customers in Georgia in 2018?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. In fact, and Drew probably knows better than I do, but I said on TV this morning, we shared -- I mean we gave benefits to customers this year of around $2 billion, $1.8 billion from tax reform. They got about two-thirds of the benefit. And then another $200 million or so, perhaps more, $209 million is what people are showing me right now, in terms of sharing.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

You got it. And equally weighted across Alabama and Georgia?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

Or closely weighted.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

We love to have the regulatory mechanisms. If the Company does well, customers do well.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Angie, how are you?

Angie Storozynski -- Macquarie -- Analyst

Great. Thank you. So no questions about Vogtle from me for a change. So, we saw the IRP filing from Georgia Power. We're still waiting to see what the Alabama Power files. And given the changes in the sharing mechanism for any over earning, I was just wondering, I mean, we all still expect this earnings pivot during construction at Vogtle, but is there a way to minimize that earnings slowdown from Alabama Power?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

From Alabama Power?

Angie Storozynski -- Macquarie -- Analyst

Meaning like just have some strength in Alabama Power earnings in order to offset the temporary weakness in earnings at Vogtle?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

(inaudible) you're saying. Look, yes, we talk a lot about -- I think our plan, we call it optionality, we've got lots of singles we can hit here, lay aside any home runs, lots of little singles we can hit along the way, that we think we can optimize plants, but particularly in '21, is kind of the year we're focused on. We certainly have the ability to do that.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

I think ascribing it to Alabama perhaps is a little bit unfair. We'll look at a variety of options across unregulated complex in total, Alabama's going to seek to do what's in the best interest of their customers at all times related to rate and return.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Thank you, Drew. That clarification is exactly right. And in fact, when we think about -- and we haven't talked about it yet, but this investor friendly asset sales and all the stuff, we were very active last year. We have a lot more opportunity to do things here. I would view it more as pruning. We just announced Mankato and we expect to close that I guess by June or so. There's more of that to do, whether it's Southern Power, PowerSecure, things like that, we'll see.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Perfect example is hyper investment in unregulated subsidiary generally leads to some dilution in the near term. We can produce a better earnings profile out of that business in the short term by utilizing its own assets to fund its development. And as Tom said, maybe prune back a little bit and things that are a little less strategic or find opportunities for people have a different view of value than we do.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

And we certainly have done that in '18. And one more comment, boy, we have a great appetite within our operating companies, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, the Gas business to where without forcing anything, we're not backing in the numbers, these are things that we can identify, whether it's ash ponds or resilience in the transmission system, get very reasonable on things that we should do for the benefit of customers. The other trade we've made, you've heard about modernization, reducing O&M significantly. Georgia has done a heck of a lot of that. Mississippi, just give you an example, have reduced over the years personnel at that company from 1,500 to now about a 1,000 -- little over 1,000. So we're really taking money out of the business. We are creating headroom to invest in matters of resilience and technology to improve customer service. Georgia Power withdrew from a lot of its local offices -- bill paying offices and yet increased customer touch through technology by four times. We have lots of opportunity to do better.

Angie Storozynski -- Macquarie -- Analyst

Okay. And just one other question, so your large cap peers seem to be pursuing a lots of growth from commercial renewables. I know that you have some growth embedded in your plans for Southern Power? But how do you see this, is this just more as a way to basically give you some flexibility around that 4% to 6% earnings growth or would you think that commercial renewables are still delivering attractive returns and as such should be pursued?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Angie, that's terrific point to raise, and we've debated about how to talk about this. Let me just tell you what our point of view is and let the other companies speak for themselves. We find -- especially in the current environment, we find that solar and wind margins are shrinking pretty dramatically. And we will still be active. I guess we have a placeholder in our financial plan of something like $500 million a year for this stuff. We don't expect to spend it. We expect more to be in the $200 million range and that's really a function of the market. You recall when the market was hot, we played really hard.

On the other hand, we have a tremendous appetite inside our franchise businesses to spend more CapEx. What you're seeing with us is an intentional reallocation of CapEx away from those markets to our franchise markets. And it really is a function of need and weighted average cost of capital and what we expect the market will deliver.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

We're certainly not turning away from the concept of renewables. In fact, Georgia Power included over 1,000 mega watts of renewables within their most recent IRP. And so, I think you might see the form of that investment change a little bit, but as Tom said, as we look at things in the unregulated space, it's not only the margins that have declined, but perhaps the duration of contract and the credit quality of counter party. It simply falls through some of our return expectations. And so we just have to evaluate these things on a case-by-case basis and make sure they're accretive to shareholder value.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Let me -- he made such a good point, so let me underline it. Value is a function of risk and return. Returns are down in that market in our opinion, risk is up because the duration of the contract available is down, we don't find that all that attractive.

Angie Storozynski -- Macquarie -- Analyst

Great. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Praful, how are you?

Praful Mehta -- Citigroup -- Analyst

Good, how are you?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Super.

Praful Mehta -- Citigroup -- Analyst

Well, thank you for taking the question. I guess going back to Vogtle, if you don't mind. Great progress so far and great to see that you're tracking to your faster internal schedule. I guess, just wanted to understand a little bit on the testing phase. I know that, that will start at some point in terms of testing all the equipment. How would you see that and do you see any uncertainty being added to your schedule as you get to that testing phase?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Man, you're right on the money. This is the next big thing to talk about. So coming out the July reset and then into the October earnings call or November earnings call, whenever it was, setting the trajectory, and getting people on-site and getting them productive was the most important thing we could do. We already have been involved in some turnover from construction to start up. So that actually has been ongoing. None of those systems that in the past have been all that critical in terms of critical path to schedule. Frankly, we haven't done as well as we would like to do on those early efforts, but we are now laser focused on what it's going to take in order to move out of construction phase in the start-up phase.

Let me just tell you, if we stay on this April schedule, conceivably, you could have fuel load as early as for Units 3, October of 2020, that's 18 months away. So we are right now in a big-time mode on focusing, taking in systems, turning them over to the start-up folks and that's not only the construction and operation, but the paperwork and all the stuff we have in place to get the i-tags (ph) complete to go to high fuel load. We have integrated teams in place, we have some of the best people around the United States, out own people, Bechtel, and we're very happy with kind of where we are right now.

You should know also, this is an area of great learning from China. We have seen what they've done at Sandman and Haiyang. We've taken best practices, and in fact, we are thinking -- even in the part of the rebate lining is, rethinking the schedule and sequence of the major events in the schedule to give us more certainty on the turnover package issue. This will be the next big thing to talk about. And we have talked internally about some graphics and some other ways to give you some transparency as to how this is going. Right now, we want to make sure we've got people, got them productive. The next thing will be our progress on the question you raised.

Praful Mehta -- Citigroup -- Analyst

Got you.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

And man, let me just add two more things. One way to talk about this is, just what are the big kind of systems that you should watch: one is, initial Energy Station, we think that's going to happen in the second quarter; and then the integrated flush of the system. This is essentially where you take water and move it through the pipes, you clean out the pipes, and you get ready to operate. That's kind of the integrated flush, third quarter. And that's one way to talk about, but you got imagine there is lot of systems that go -- underlie all these big issues. If we hit these big issues on time, we should hit the little issues on time. So, we're going to work hard to find a way to communicate this with you.

Praful Mehta -- Citigroup -- Analyst

Got it. And that is super helpful. So as you think about the testing phase, building in some cushion through the current phase as you enter testing is probably what you're trying to track for given there is a little bit of uncertainty at least in terms of how that testing would go, is that fair?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Hey, let me add one more thing that is just important. I know people love to complain about government and everything else, I would argue that this administration has been very helpful. Congress has been very helpful. In fact, even the past administrator was helpful on building Vogtle. The NRC is a very tough regulator. They are very exacting and requiring, as they should be, and we work well with them. One of the things that when we got the AP1000 technology approved, if you remember, way back then by the NRC, there was a lot of first of a kind issues with that technology. Now, with Sandman and Haiyang operating, we were able to work with the NRC to eliminate what had been required as first of a kind test issues. So, those issues have been eliminated or lessened and that has added about three weeks to our margin. So we're very happy to continue to work with the NRC to look for innovative, creative ways to help achieve the schedules we have in place.

Praful Mehta -- Citigroup -- Analyst

As usual very comprehensive answer So, really appreciate that.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

You bet.

Praful Mehta -- Citigroup -- Analyst

I guess just quickly moving onto the finance side. Just to quickly test, on the equity, you've mentioned $2.5 billion to $3 billion over five years. Was there any clarification around strategic asset sales or other M&A transactions as a part of that? I wasn't clear on that point. So just wanted to clarify. Could that equity number come down as you look at more M&A transactions?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

First, I think a simple answer to your question is, absolutely, it could. What we wanted to demonstrate though is that we can meet the requirements of the plan that we've laid out for ourselves just using the internal plans at our disposal. And so, it's basically dividend reinvestment in any option exercise that occurs. I think '18 has been very indicative of the approach that we'll take, but I would say the majors have been done or are in process for 2019. We're always looking to prune and make sure that there are opportunities to kind of refocus smaller business lines and we're going to be as opportunistic around those things as we possibly can this year.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

And if I could just beat some good news accomplishment. I think, we bought well and we sold well. I think we demonstrate terrific discipline in that. I think the AGL acquisition was a terrific one for shareholders. I think SONAT was a terrific one for shareholders. When you think about what we were able to do in '18, we sold our a gas business in New Jersey and a few other places for 37 times earnings. The highest multiple ever paid for a gas business. The Florida gas business we sold was I think tied -- right at tied for the second highest multiple ever paid. Gulf was the highest multiple paid in our knowledge for any electric company.

When you think about just other ways to dimension that, we were carrying assets at the time at $45 a share and sold them for $90 bucks a share. We sold 5% of our earnings for 12% of our market cap. So, it wasn't just that we were raising money. We were historically raising money with valuations that people hadn't seen before. These were all very accretive, very friendly to shareholders.

Praful Mehta -- Citigroup -- Analyst

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Hi, Michael.

Michael Weinstein -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Hi. Good morning. On rate-base growth versus earnings growth, it looks like the -- especially on the electric side, it looks like the electric rate base growth profile is a little higher, about 1% higher and that's taking out Gulf Power and I guess replacing it with more ash pond CapEx. I'm wondering if that's going up and it looks like the incremental equity is a little bit less than half of the incremental CapEx overall. All those things would seem to indicate higher guidance growth rate going forward, but the growth rate is basically the same growth rate off that 2018 mid-point. Is that -- maybe just talk about what is it about the translation from rate base growth to earnings growth that's keeping the earnings growth about the same?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

So, this is a little like the question, I think, we took earlier and really relates to the shape of our -- or the path of our growth through that 4% to 6% earnings expectation. We know that we're going to have pressure related to Vogtle, with construction investment over the next three-year period, and so it doesn't translate as you see it here, 6% growth in state-regulated -- or 6% growth in electric utility to a full 6% growth at the Corporation. I don't know that we'd be particularly doing ourselves a benefit by moving our growth ranges around to the time when we are really focused on execution on Vogtle, but we'll kind of revisit that idea when we are substantially complete there.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

But even with Vogtle, we're within the 4% to 6% count. And if you look at the end, like I suggested before, the shape, for whatever flatter kind of performance you will get through '21, it really takes off once you start clearing 3 and 4. And it looks more like 8% growth at that point.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

And Michael, you are correct, the vast majority of the change here relates to environmental CapEx and also some modernization of the T&D infrastructure over that period. But our change is little over $4 billion or kind of in that proximity and really is almost entirely in regulated enterprises.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. And I just want to add, these aren't made up numbers. They're not like what do we need to fill a hole and let's create CapEx to do that. These are projects that we know about, they are sensible and they help customers.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Identified and largely filed.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes.

Michael Weinstein -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

No. I appreciate your comment also about I guess the increased competitiveness on the non-regulated renewables side. I'm also noticing that the amount of CapEx that's going into the gas pipelines segment declines over time. And I'm just wondering if that is also an area that you might be thinking about divesting at some point?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Divesting, it's an interesting question. I think we will continue to look at opportunity within the midstream. We really enjoy the investment there that we have in SONAT, Dalton, the construction that was completed a year and a half ago that's brought tremendous benefit I think to the customers of Georgia. The same can be said of other two constructions, although they are much smaller in terms of relative contribution to the -- particularly the first one that I mentioned, but divestiture, I don't know, I think as these things get to commercial operation, we'll just have to assess whether they're better held by us or by others.

Yes. And the old joke around here is, strategic means the numbers don't work. SONAT is strategic and the numbers work. It's a wonderful annuity. That's another one, where we bought well, I think. And as you mentioned, Dalton, is perfect for our system. There's high synergy with those assets.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

The primary goal is to bring low cost gas into our service territories and to the extent that we can continue to do that, SONAT certainly does into the Southeast for both the gas and electric businesses. ACP or PennEast Pipeline into Illinois, anything that's in service of customer, probably fits in our portfolio.

Michael Weinstein -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

And just one final question about PowerSecure. So I mean that was a relatively recent purchase. And I guess you're thinking about it being a nonstrategic asset at this point, does that mean you are --

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

No. Hope I didn't communicate that, PowerSecure, we think is a really important thing. In fact, somebody -- I think it was Angie asked before about generation in commercial and industrial realm. In fact, that's what we've seen. The last three win deals we've done have been General Mills, General Motors and a cruise line. Here's the point, we see the age of big iron making, moving and selling at scale, central station power units, as potentially slowing down and dissipating over time, won't go away. And I can't tell you the timeframe in which this is happening, but I think it's happening to some degree now.

And then what we see in its place is something we refer to as distributed infrastructure. So now think about make, move and sell on the customer premises. And so we think that a certain combination of Southern Power as it applies to Angie's question, the commercial and industrial segment, along with the strategic portion of PowerSecure really do matter. And also we are finding in the market elements of Sequent, really include Sequent in our guidance and all that stuff. That is a subsidiary that's part of the gas infrastructure. Their major purpose in life beyond managing the pipeline investments we have, like SONAT< is to make sure that the pipelines are full of gas, and that we have efficient operation. Customers are finding now that if we can handle their fuel management issues, that synergy along with distributed infrastructure has great appeal and may fill up this gap that's developing on what we call distributed infrastructure. There's a whole lot about PowerSecure that is a very strategic. There are elements perhaps that may not be. And we'll figure that out over time.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

You have to really put that investment in context of size and it does show up in our capital deployment. It's just not as capital intensive as the core business is.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

It's tiny.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

This is -- an experiment is not the correct word, probably very important for us to be able to understand how the distributed generation market develops. We have a good sense of it in our own service territories, but there are others that are further along in their journey, whether that's sort of out west of us or otherwise. And so, I think we'll continue to invest in that business to understand how distributed generation might change the utility business in total, it's a very important way for us to understand the markets.

Michael Weinstein -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Hey, Tom. Thank you for taking my question. Mine is going to be really, really quick. When looking at the capital spend guidance, the one thing that kind of stood out is, there's very little at the regulated electrics for any new generation in the next few years, meaning, next three or four, three to five years. Just curious, are you guys being conservative about whether there's an opportunity to build renewables in rate base or whether as you potentially retire or run your coal units even less often, whether new gas fired generation in rate base would be needed?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

I'd say if you look at the projections today, it's more the lack of having these items here, or probably more around the uncertainty of whether or not there will be -- the IRPs will reflect them. However, we are in process with IRPs in Georgia and ultimately in Alabama and expect at least 1,000 megawatts of renewables will be built within the Georgia portfolio .

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

And we're always looking over our hand in terms of the economics of the best mix of capacity we've got. It wouldn't surprise me, we've announced some stuff in the IRP at Georgia, Hammond, Macintosh, to see more of that thinking elsewhere in the system. It's just huff to think about all of the expense, whether it's O&M, environmental, everything else supporting the coal fleet. We think that is a drumbeat that will continue and as technologies developed, whether they are renewables or new, highly efficient gas or storage, we will take that into account as well.

Ali Agha -- SunTrust -- Analyst

Good. Thanks, Tom. Good morning.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning.

Ali Agha -- SunTrust -- Analyst

First question, I just wanted to be certain, in the past you all have given us a net income profile for Vogtle depending on the construction timeline and the ROE hits that you've been alluding to. Is that still a good profile to be using for modeling purposes?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

I think so. If it's not, we'll cover that with you offline, but I don't think anything has changed materially there.

Ali Agha -- SunTrust -- Analyst

Okay. Also a couple of your utilities have obviously seen an increase in there all-tied (ph) equity ratios in the recent past. Again, for your planning purposes, as you look out long-term and the 4% to 6% growth, are you assuming that those higher equity ratios stay where they are or how are you thinking about that as future rate cases are coming up?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

We are assuming that they stay in place, assuming that tax law stays as it is. You'll probably remember that the adjustments to capital structure really were simply for maintenance of the current credit quality of the utilities, as they existed prior to reform. And so, Ali, we do expect that will continue. That'll be adjudicated in Georgia over the next few months for both Atlanta Gas Light and Georgia Power. We are working to make some progress in the State of Illinois. And Alabama, had I think really, really strong commitment from their regulators to maintain the credit quality of their business and so, comfortable with how we've described in the projections.

And let me tell you something, if I could give a quick policy argument, tax reform as they've done it, has been so beneficial to so many people. The argument against it is, only the fat cats, the rich people benefit. It's dead wrong in our business. The way we've structured it, something like $1.8 billion of some sort of rate reductions accrue, whether they're refunds or other sort of rate reductions accrue to customers. And 46% of our customers make less than $40,000 a year and when you look at that segment, energy budget is a high part of their disposable income. This has a direct positive impact on some of the people in our economy that needed the most. This has been a great outcome.

Ali Agha -- SunTrust -- Analyst

Got you. And just one quick question. The effective tax rate, if we get little bit right on your adjusted earnings was slightly lower than I think what you were expecting earlier, is this a good sort of run rate to be thinking about in future years as well?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

I think the largest change year-over-year was the impact of tax reform. But let me get back to you in terms of the effective rate and the cash tax rate. I don't think it's very differently, significantly from our original expectation. Little bit of movement perhaps related to gains on sale of assets, but that would be the principal difference.

Ali Agha -- SunTrust -- Analyst

I got you. Thank you.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Paul glad to have you with us.

Paul Patterson -- Glenrock Association -- Analyst

Good to be here. Listen, I mean you guys have really pretty much covered everything with Vogtle, just a quick follow-up on the staff testimony in November, sort of raised some concerns about the 29 month extension and what have you and I was just wondering, 29 months, right?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes.

Paul Patterson -- Glenrock Association -- Analyst

And I just wanted to get a sense as to what changed between November and now, other than what you guys have already gone over? I mean, I guess it would appear that things have really improved quite a bit. And perhaps that skepticism, if they were to write it today, would be less and I'm not asking you to speak for them, but if you can address, I mean you guys never really I think filed rebuttal testimony or anything. So that's why, I was just wondering if you could just fill in a little bit there as to why they had so much skepticism then and the outlook now?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So you hit my first answer right on the head. And that is, I don't want to speak for the staff. Look, if you just look at the facts right now, whether it's productive hours per week, a 110,000 versus a 140,000 plus hours work per week, we're developing margin to November. And we are able to get the staff we need. We haven't eaten into any of the contingency. So, schedule, costs, productivity, these numbers look pretty good. Now, we have to sustain them, and maybe things that we don't know, the unknown are unknowns. We have the units in China working well. So we know the technology works. So, here's the thing, I think -- just as I indicated on an earlier question, I think that we're able to demonstrate we get staff, we get them productive, we are working. I think the next big issue is going to be turnover. And I know Dr. Jacobs, who we dearly love, he is a really smart guy and works with us, and sits in all our meetings, that's part of his area of expertise, but how we move from construction now to the start-up, looking toward half fuel load, potentially as soon as '18 months away, is kind of the big issue right now. And we'll talk more about that in calls ahead.

Paul Patterson -- Glenrock Association -- Analyst

Okay. Listen, everything else has been answered and congratulations.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you. Really appreciate it.

Paul Patterson -- Glenrock Association -- Analyst

Okay. Hang in there.

Operator

And that will conclude today's question and answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

No. We're really happy to be able to report these results. It's the productive work of thousands of people, making thousands of good decisions every day. I want to call out Bechtel, our partner on this important Vogtle journey that we're on. I think we're in good shape right now. The challenge is going to be keep the momentum going, sustain the progress and continue to execute the way we have. The financial plan is awfully robust.

I think, we've demonstrated agility in being able to respond to changed conditions in some of the best regulatory environments in the United States. We expect that will continue. Lots of important work ahead in '19, but I think we're poised to execute and do well during this year. Thank you for your followership of this Company and we'll continue to work on your behalf as hard as we can. Have a great week.

215,Empty,2019-02-20T23:09:25Z,Two radical self-experimenters share what they’ve learned about the promises and perils of “smart drugs” and brain supplements.,"A Summary of Specific Nootropics Mentioned, with Recommendations

There are literally hundreds of nootropics out there—more than I could hope to cover in one article. Here’s some info on the few that Marius and Mike mentioned in their interviews.

Caffeine + Theanine

The combination of caffeine and L-Theanine (often simply referred to as theanine) is one of the most popular nootropics- as well as one of the safest and most well-studied. It is widely recommended (and I concur) as the first nootropic that most people should try.

You know what caffeine is. L-Theanine is an amino acid analog of L-glutamine and L-glutamate, and is mainly known as one of the constituents of green tea. It contributes to the savory flavor of green tea (caffeine alone is very bitter) and exerts a calming effect on the brain. This calming effect mitigates the mental side effects of caffeine, such as anxiety and jitteriness, and is the reason why the effects of green tea are commonly felt as milder or more mellow than the effects of a normal caffeine buzz.

This combination is typically taken in a 1:2 ratio of caffeine to theanine, with the most common dosage being 100 mg of caffeine and 200 mg of theanine. Note that this is much more theanine than you’d get from simply drinking tea, as tea typically has 2–10 times as much caffeine as theanine. Theanine must be consumed as a supplement, though you can certainly get your caffeine from tea if you want. (Green tea typically contains between 30 and 50 mg per 8-ounce serving.)

Since caffeine tolerance can start building up with as little as 100 mg a day of intake, I would treat this dosage as a maximum, not a minimum. I suggest starting at half of that: 50 mg caffeine and 100 mg theanine, early in the morning.

Marius van Voorden: Good combination. Everyone is familiar with caffeine, and L-Theanine just improves the experience. Nice and understandable for people new to nootropics, too.

Melatonin

Melatonin is the primary hormone responsible for sleep onset. It is produced naturally by the brain in response to fatigue and low environmental light (particularly blue light) level. It’s also available as a pill — over the counter in the U.S. and some other countries, or by prescription in other countries, including most of the E.U.

As a supplement, melatonin is typically taken 30–60 minutes before bedtime to induce sleep. Melatonin supplements are usually dosed at 3, 5, 10, or occasionally 1 mg, but these dosages are likely excessive. As little as .1 mg can induce drowsiness, .3 mg can induce sleep, and .5 mg can effectively shift your circadian rhythm. Some people, like Marius, report that melatonin also helps them to get more refreshing sleep in less time — whether this is due to sleeping more deeply or simply getting to sleep faster is unclear.

Melatonin is very safe, with side effects no worse than placebo. This holds true even at higher dosages; while there’s little reason to use a high dose, there also seems to be little risk in doing so. Some individuals do report needing a higher dose for it to be effective, but this seems to be rare based on the research.

The optimal way to use melatonin seems to be to take between .3 and 1 mg, 30–60 minutes before you want to go to sleep.

Marius: It lets me get a full night’s sleep in 7 hours instead of 8, waking up naturally without an alarm. I quite like that.

Piracetam

Piracetam is the granddaddy of all nootropics, and probably the only one that can compete with the caffeine + theanine combo for sheer popularity. It belongs to a class of related nootropics called racetams, and despite having been around since the 1950’s, it is still poorly understood.

Studies on Piracetam have found mixed results. The most-supported use is in the prevention of cognitive decline—so much so that studies of other anti-dementia drugs will sometimes compare the effectiveness of the studied drug to that of piracetam.

Other than that, there are some studies which find that Piracetam improves memory. The effects are long-term rather than acute; it takes at least 2 weeks of continuous daily usage to experience benefits, and most users take piracetam for at least a few months at a time.

Anecdotally, many users report improvements in mood, cognition and the ability to focus, but these are not supported by research at this time. Many other users report no effect at all. Response to Piracetam seems to be highly individual.

Piracetam is typically dosed between 1200 and 4800 mg/day, split into two or three (ideally three) doses. Based on the research, 400 mg three times a day is a good starting point. After the first two weeks, this dosage can be gradually increased to 800 mg three times a day — the highest dosage to have strong support in the research.

Marius: Useful, depending on the person. The various racetams affect different people differently, which makes it hard to make general statements. Some experimentation required to see if it works for you.

Mike: It didn’t do much for me. I don’t seem to respond to many of the racetams.

Phenylpiracetam

Another member of the racetam group, Phenylpiracetam hasn’t been studied as much as Piracetam. It seems to have similar effects as Piracetam, but the required dosage is several times lower.

Like Piracetam, Phenylpiracetam seems to aid in preventing or slowing cognitive decline, particularly in stroke survivors. It has also been shown to reduce depression and anxiety…again, in stroke patients. Unfortunately, the research on it has mostly been confined to stroke patients.

That said, widespread anecdotal reports suggest that it has similar effects to Piracetam, but with more of a stimulant effect. At least one study has found that rats move around more, and faster, after taking Phenylpiracetam. This has lead to it becoming modestly popular for athletic enhancement, and being banned as a doping agent in many athletic organizations.

The typical dosage is 100–200 mg, taken 2–3 times a day, for a total daily dosage of 200–600 mg.

Marius: For me, it reduces the activation energy to get started on things.

Choline

Choline is not a drug, per se, but a naturally occurring essential nutrient. It is water-soluble, vitamin-like, and occurs naturally in many food sources — most notably in egg yolks.

Its use as a nootropic stems from the fact that Choline is the primary building block of Acetylcholine, the primary neurotransmitter responsible for learning. In addition, since a Choline deficiency can cause fat accumulation in the liver, Choline is sometimes used to help treat fatty liver.

Choline is one of the more popular nootropic supplements. It’s safe, affordable, and usually used in stacks with other supplements that act on the cholinergic system — as Choline can, at least in theory, potentiate anything else that promotes the production of Acetylcholine.

Research is sparse on Choline — the one study I could find found no effect from it. That said, the study had a small sample size and short duration, and its design bears little resemblance to how choline is used in practice.

If you want to try a Choline supplement, they come in several forms. CDP-choline and alpha-GPC are the two forms thought to be most active in the brain. Daily dosages range from 200 mg once a day, up to 1500 mg divided into several daily doses. I’d recommend staying near the lower end of that range, personally.

As always, start low and gradually raise it over the course of several weeks, and be especially conservative if stacking it with other nootropics. To avoid overdosing, take Choline in pill form, not powder form — see Marius’s comment below.

Marius (repeated from the interview above): If you mis-measure [… ] any Choline source […] can trigger depressive episodes in people prone to that. High amounts might trigger worse episodes, I reckon.

Ashwaghanda

Ashwaghanda is an herb known in ayurvedic (Indian) medicine for its ability to reduce anxiety and allegedly help the body adapt to stressors.

It is well-established as an anxiolytic—multiple studies have found that Ashwaghanda is effective at reducing stress and anxiety. It has also been shown to reduce cortisol (the stress hormone) and c-reactive protein (a measure of inflammation).

The typical dosage is 300–500 mg per day, either divided or taken with breakfast. Lower doses, around 100 mg per day, may be preferable if combining it with other anti-anxiety agents. There’s a lack of data on how Ashwaghanda interacts with other anti-anxiety agents, so don’t combine it with prescription anti-anxiety drugs (at least without talking to your doctor first).

Mike: Ashwagandha (is one of the) three (nootropics) that I use the most…to reduce stress and anxiety.

Modafinil and Adrafinil

Over the past few years, Modafinil has become one of the most popular well-known nootropics. It has been the subject of many mainstream media articles- and arguably a bit of a fad.

So what is Modafinil? It’s a prescription drug for keeping narcoleptics awake, and it’s very effective at what it does. It’s prescription-only in the U.S. and Canada. Adrafinil, on the other hand, is available over the internet, and it’s a prodrug of Modafinil — that is, it converts to Modafinil in the body.

There can be no doubt at this point that Modafinil reduces fatigue and enhances wakefulness. It has also been shown in several studies that Modafinil improves cognition, working memory, motivation, and subjective well-being in healthy subjects. That said, studies find more pronounced benefits in sleep-deprived subjects or those with sleep disorders. In healthy, well-rested subjects, the benefits are still there, but fairly minor.

While it is often compared to amphetamines, the effects are markedly different. Modafinil only slightly increases blood pressure and reaction time; overall, its effects seem to be less physical and more purely mental compared to most stimulants.

Modafinil is typically dosed at 100–200 mg per day. It has a very long half-life — around 15 hours — so it should only be taken first thing in the morning, before breakfast, unless you want to stay up very, very late that night.

Adrafinil converts to Modafinil at somewhere between a 3:2 and 3:1 basis. That is, 300 mg of Adrafinil converts to somewhere between 100 and 200 mg of Modafinil, so the starting dosage should be around 200 mg. Since Adrafinil itself has a half-life of one hour, the effects last even a little bit longer than Modafinil. Again, only take it first thing in the morning.

Mike: The first supplement I’d recommend for boosting productivity would be Modafinil. Many people find it to be effective and it’s generally pretty safe. Either that or caffeine and L-theanine. Modafinil…can cause insomnia when dosed too late in the day. If you need to pull an all-nighter, though, Modafinil will absolutely help you get through the night.

Marius: Useful for most people. The effect is similar to caffeine, but without the jitteriness/anxiety that can come with it. Adrafinil gets converted to Modrafinil in the body. Adrafinil will keep you awake if you take it too late: it gets converted to Modafinil in the body, and Modafinil is also used as an anti-narcolepsy medicine. That’s gonna keep you awake.

Some people do say that they feel more tired the day after they use Adrafinil, but if you see that coming ahead of time you can factor that into your plans. Adrafinil can then still be a nice option to intensify one day, and then rest the next day. You’d have to try it out to see if that applies to you as well.

Author’s thoughts: I like both of these but I use them very sparingly and at low dosages- like 50–100 mg, not 100–200, because of the long half-life. You can take a little caffeine with it in the morning, then have a tiny bit more caffeine around noon, to benefit from the synergistic effect. Since caffeine has a shorter half-life than Modafinil, that doesn’t keep me from sleeping the way a higher dose of Modafinil would. Regardless, I’d limit this one to 1–2 days a week, only on days when you want to work really late.

LSD Microdosing

LSD microdosing is currently growing in popularity as a way to improve productivity, mood, creativity, and overall well-being. Due to its legal status, research on LSD microdosing has been nonexistent until recently. While studies are now starting to be performed, the results aren’t out yet. That said, many individuals have found LSD microdosing to be highly effective, even life-changing.

So what is microdosing? A typical dose of LSD is around 100 micrograms — most blotters are dosed at that level, and that’s the typical “party dose” that will make you hallucinate a bit, but not completely lose your mind and forget where you are. People who want to “trip out” might take several times that much.

A microdose, by contrast, is around 10–20 micrograms. This dose doesn’t cause hallucinations, and in fact, the effects tend to be very subtle. Mostly, it just makes you have a really good day. People who microdose typically take this dosage in the morning once every 3–4 days, and usually find that it doesn’t cause a tolerance at this level.

For more information, read this complete guide to microdosing by Janet L. Chang. One thing I will add that she doesn’t mention: there is a legal alternative to LSD, called 1-propionyl-LSD. Google ‘1P-LSD’; it’s sold legally as a designer drug on a few websites, at least for the time being.

Mike: [I’d like to see more research on] LSD and psilocin microdosing. Unfortunately, due to the ridiculous drug laws in the U.S., it’s incredibly difficult to do scientific research on these substances. There are a lot of anecdotal reports that indicate microdosing can be incredibly effective at increasing productivity.

Marius: Haven’t tried this either. It seems interesting, but I’m a little worried about research that claims LSD permanently increases how open-minded you are.

Nicotine

Yes, nicotine, the main ingredient in cigarettes. Surprisingly, nicotine in isolation seems to be far safer and less addictive than tobacco products, and is fairly popular as a nootropic. Part of this may be because cigarettes have other chemicals besides nicotine, but the rate of delivery is important too. Nicotine patches seem to be less addictive than other forms of nicotine, such as gums and inhalers — researchers attribute this to the slower rate of nicotine delivery in patches, which avoids any euphoria-inducing peaks.

Studies on nicotine’s mental effects in non-smokers are few and far between right now. One study found improvements in cognition and memory, another found that nicotine combined with caffeine synergistically increased energy levels and calorie expenditure, and a third found that nicotine may mildly improve focus.

Effects on anxiety are mixed — nicotine may increase or decrease anxiety.

Anecdotally, nicotine is usually used for focus, and to suppress hunger while working. For non-smokers, the dosage is usually 1 mg or less of nicotine gum, or 1–4 mg of a nicotine patch. Nicotine patches are the preferred method due to their sustained release. Since patches are dosed at 7, 14 or 21 mg in the U.S., users typically cut them up to reduce the dosage.

Marius: It’s interesting for habit formation. I reckon it can be tricky to use for people who want to see effects the first time you use something; that’s not really what nicotine is for.

Mike: I can definitely say that it increases focus.

Author’s notes: I’ve found low doses to be good for mood and focus, but they mainly enhance productivity for non-creative work. For creative work like writing, this stuff sometimes gives me writer’s block or otherwise makes me get stuck and unproductive.

For habit formation, you would use nicotine while engaging in the habit you’re trying to build, linking the buzz from the nicotine to the act of engaging in the habit, a form of operant conditioning. Like Marius says, you’d have to do this repeatedly — say 10–30 times in total, and at least a few times a week — to really build a new habit.","The Best Nootropics for Productivity, According to Two Nootropics Experts",Coach.me,https://betterhumans.coach.me/the-best-nootropics-for-productivity-according-to-two-nootropics-experts-394fb888596a

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Instructure's CEO Dan Goldsmith.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Erin, and thank you everyone for joining us on our Q4 and full-year 2018 earnings call. At Instructure, our vision is to help people learn, develop and engage from their first day of school to their last day of work. 2018 has been an exciting and productive time for the company, and the business has performed well. At a high level, we grew full-year revenue 30% year over year, enhanced our operating structure and defined and launch our growth initiatives.

Our strategy is aligned around three key objectives: drive growth, both near and long term through clear and impactful initiatives; execute well to deliver both strong financial results and customer success; and get profitable through continued focus on operational excellence. Let me start with our focus on growth. Coming into 2019, we have six defined growth initiatives that will broaden our product offerings and meaningfully expand our TAM. Today, we will talk specifically about three of these.

Our first growth initiative will drive the connection between the academic and professional worlds, initially by launching an essential student success platform. The true value of education is realized only when students can leverage their academic experience and achievements to transition successfully into the workforce. Today, we've taken a great stride toward enabling that transition with our expected acquisition of Portfolium, a successful, longtime Canvas partner. Portfolium's vision is to help each person realize their full potential by connecting learning with opportunity through e-portfolios, program and course-level assessments, career pathways and by matching students to job opportunities.

Portfolium will join Instructure with a wealth of shared customers such as Virginia Tech, Santa Clara University and Swinburne University in Australia. This acquisition is a great match in vision and culture and represents our first major step into the student success market. And while Portfolium's current offerings provide an excellent solution, more importantly, they establish the first bridge between academia and the corporate world that aligns precisely with Instructure's vision. I am also pleased to share with you an early insight into our second growth initiative focused on analytics, data science and artificial intelligence.

Story continues

The codename for this initiative is Dig, and this technology platform, combined with the most comprehensive SaaS database on the educational experience, uniquely positions us to deliver meaningful value to our customers. And from a growth perspective, Dig has the potential to double our TAM and education. We are already well on our way to completing our initial product validation tours and solidifying customer use cases. Dig demonstrates our commitment to continuous innovation in the education space, and I look forward to sharing additional details, including launch plans and progress, over the course of this year.

Now let's turn our attention to Bridge as our third growth initiative. We continue to establish and expand the category of employee engagement and development by broadening our offerings and establishing Bridge as an essential solution for all employees and companies across the globe. The changes in product positioning and strategy introduced in 2018 are already resonating in the market, and we see our customers sharing in our long-term vision around employee engagement and development. Looking forward, we are poised for strong execution this year.

We have strengthened the foundation for our Bridge go-to-market strategy with key strategic hires and continued investment in our platform. We are on track to release two new Bridge products in the coming months, which will further expand our TAM within the corporate space. We will formally launch these offerings at our Bridge conference in June, where business, HR and talent leaders from around the country will join us to learn about our vision for employee engagement and development. I would encourage all of you to attend.

With a strong vision, expanding suite and a solid go-to-market strategy, we are increasingly able to go after large enterprise opportunities, resulting in larger deals and cross-selling opportunities with Bridge. As excited as we are about these growth initiatives, we must also execute well by leveraging our existing product portfolio to deliver growth today. Let me spend a few minutes sharing our success across the globe with both Canvas and Bridge during the fourth quarter of 2018. Within the domestic higher education market, win rates remain high across the country, from UC San Diego to Wilmington University, to the Vermont State College system.

And we are excited to announce that Harvard Medical School selected Practice in support of their global training for clinical research programs. Looking at our international markets, we made significant headway in LatAm, winning deals throughout Peru, Mexico, Brazil and Ecuador, predominantly replacing Blackboard and Moodle. Most notably, Tec de Monterrey in Mexico selected Canvas for their 200,000 learners. Key leadership hires and a deep understanding of the international regions, has led us to this success, and we will continue this pattern for our international expansion.

In the APAC region, the prestigious University of Melbourne and the University of Technology Sydney replaced Blackboard with Canvas for their collective 80,000 learners. It is exciting to see Canvas being used by the four largest universities in Australia, and our expansion story in APAC region continues with Our Lady of Fatima University in the Philippines selecting Canvas for over 70,000 users. And in Europe, the world's leading provider of wine education, the Wine & Spirit Education Trust, will use Canvas to present a more modern and accessible LMS for their face-to-face programs consisting of 30,000 passionate wine and spirit professionals and enthusiasts. Turning to Bridge.

Our focus on large enterprise deals and vertical use cases delivered meaningful key wins in Q4. ETQ, a leading provider of quality and compliance management software, selected Bridge Learn to train there over 100,000 customers. Internationally, Deloitte España will be using Bridge Learn not only for internal employees but also to deliver cybersecurity training to their clients. In Canada, lululemon athletica selected Bridge Learn and Arc to assist them with employee training and development.

Sales enablement and customer service training are use cases where we have found particular success. And in Q4, we saw Henry Schein, a solutions company for healthcare professionals, select Bridge Learn in practice for these efforts. The Pacific Financial Group shows Bridge Learn in practice to help measure the effectiveness of live training for the 3,000 financial representatives and clients. And Regency Furniture selected Perform to assist sales managers and staff with their performance management needs.

Chewy, the online pet retailer, chose Bridge Learn for their customer success team of 10,000 employees. Additionally, a financial services company with more than 2 million clients and over $850 billion in assets under management, selected Practice for onboarding and development for their call center representatives. Looking forward to 2019 and beyond, Instructure is focus on strong execution against our plan for growth. I've talked about three of those growth initiatives today: bridging the GAAP between academia and corporate with student success; machine learning and A.I.

and education with Dig; and our Bridge expansion strategy. I look forward to updating you on our additional growth initiatives over the course of this year. If growth is one side of the strategic coin, the flip side is delivering operational excellence. Adding additional depth and knowledge to our executive team is important for Instructure as we focus on executing our 2019 plan.

We recently brought aboard Marta DeBellis as our chief marketing officer. Marta is an exceptional senior marketing executive with extensive global experience, including in-region roles in both Europe and in Asia. Most recently, Marta ran enterprise marketing for Adobe's digital experience business. Prior to Adobe, she spent time on the agency side with MRM McCann and held a variety of corporate, solutions and partner-marketing roles at Intel.

Her focus on driving growth across marketing disciplines will be a tremendous asset for Instructure. As we discuss last quarter, our focus on operational excellence continues. We have identified a number of cost-saving initiatives and implemented a number of efficiency measures across the organization. The results of those efforts are reflected not only in our strong Q4 year-over-year operating margin improvements but also in our achievement of total cash flow positive.

I will let Steve provide more detail in a moment. The near-term benefits of these efforts are meaningful. But even more importantly, they allow us to invest in both organic and inorganic growth. With a strong management team in place and a clear focus on growth and operational excellence, Instructure is well positioned for success in 2019 and beyond.

Now let me turn it over to Steve to take you through the financials.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Dan, and thanks everyone for joining us today. 2018 was a successful year for Instructure. Here are a few highlights. In addition to growing total 2018 revenue 30% year over year, we grew our recurring revenue base slightly faster, adding over $44 million.

Our international business expanded from 15% of revenue in 2017 to 19% in 2018. As Dan alluded to, we demonstrated significant leverage in our operating margin. And importantly, our cash position is quite strong. Let me provide some additional details on the quarter and year.

In Q4, total revenue and subscription revenue both grew 26% year over year to $56.3 million and $51 million respectively. For the full-year 2018, total revenue came in at the top end of our guidance at $209.5 million, of which $188.5 million was subscription revenue. Rolling 12-month billings at the end of Q4 was $228.6 million, up 22% from the fourth quarter of last year, also calculated on a rolling 12-month basis. For the remainder of my commentary, unless otherwise noted, I will discuss non-GAAP results; and all EPS numbers are on a per-commentary basis.

Gross margin in Q4 was 71.3%. And for the full year, gross margin was 72.2%. As we have noted before, we are approaching our long-term target of 75% gross margin and expect improvements to continue to moderate going forward. Total operating expense for the fourth quarter was $41.1 million, a 7% year-over-year increase as compared to revenue growth of 26% during the same period.

For the full year of 2018, total operating expense was $173.1 million, an increase of 20% over last year. As Dan mentioned earlier, our cost savings initiatives implemented in the second half of the year led to dramatic improvements in our operating margin, and we delivered over 1,200 basis points of year-over-year improvements in Q4. For the fourth quarter, we realized approximately $1.3 million in efficiencies as a direct result of these efforts. A few examples include: leveraging hiring in our new Budapest office, optimizing our investments in our facilities globally, streamlining our enterprise software spend and reducing third-party recruiting costs.

Operating loss for Q4 was $1 million, an impressive year-over-year improvement of $5.3 million. For the full-year 2018, operating loss improved over 700 basis points year over year to $21.9 million. GAAP net loss for Q4 was $7.6 million, an improvement of $0.10 per share year over year. GAAP net loss for 2018 was $43.5 million, representing a $0.20 per share improvement over the prior year.

In Q4, on a non-GAAP basis, we realized a small net loss of $300,000, which is a substantial improvement over the prior year. This is partly due to our cost savings initiatives as mentioned above, and is partly due to a change in compensation philosophy, which essentially aligns management's incentives with that of our stockholders. Specifically, during the quarter, all 2018 executive bonuses were given in stock as opposed to cash. This resulted in about a $1.8-million improvement in our non-GAAP net income.

For the full year, non-GAAP net loss was $20.7 million, a $0.36 per share improvement over last year. Turning to the balance sheet, I am particularly pleased to report that we achieved our goal of being total cash flow positive slightly in 2018. This is a very important milestone for Instructure. Our ending cash balance for 2018 was marginally higher than the balance at the end of 2017, after adjusting for our $110-million equity raised last year.

Our cost-savings initiatives, along with strong collections, resulted in a balance of $153 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. Free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $22.4 million. Backlog grew 19% year over year to $466 million at the beginning of 2019. This is comprised of $121 million of deferred revenue, which you can find on our year-end balance sheet; and $345 million of off balance sheet revenue under contract.

Additionally, our average contract length continues to be greater than three years. I'll end my remarks with a discussion around our expectations for the first-quarter and full-year 2019. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $56.9 million to $57.5 million, non-GAAP net loss of $5.6 million to $5 million, and non-GAAP net loss per common share of $0.16 to $0.14. For the full-year 2019, we expect revenue in the range of $256 million to $260 million.

We expect non-GAAP net loss of $23.5 million to $21.5 million, and a non-GAAP net loss per common share of $0.65 to $0.59. For calculating EPS, we expect our shares to be $35.5 million for the first quarter of 2019 and $36.1 million for the full year. Let me provide some context around these expectations. On the revenue side, our win rates for domestic Canvas remain best in class, and we continue to capture market share.

However, as we previously discussed, we see muted new bookings growth through the domestic LMS market. While we are quite optimistic about our longer-term opportunities for TAM expansion and strong revenue growth, Dig and Portfolium being two examples, it is appropriate to balance those expectations in the near term. These efforts require time and market, and therefore we are assuming minimal impact for 2019. Turning to the expense side.

With our focus on operational excellence during the second half of 2018, we've changed the mindset of our leadership team and the entire organization about how we approach the business and fund investments. A focus on disciplined investments for balancing profitable growth has been put in place and is reflected in the outlook we provided today. On the cash side, we have a strong cash position to support our important strategic objectives for both Canvas and Bridge. And looking forward to 2019, we anticipate being approximately free cash flow neutral for the full year.

In summary, we have a strong plan for execution with a focus on balancing growth and profitability. There's a great deal of hard work to do, but I'm confident that the investments we're making today will position Instructure well for strong growth and expansion in 2019 and beyond. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator, please go ahead with our first question.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Your first question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.

Unknown speaker

Hi guys, it's Bavin on for Brad. Congrats on the quarter. Can you just dive into just the synergy opportunities with Portfolium? How much overlap do you guys have with your current install base? And how many schools within the Canvas base don't have a solution like Portfolium?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

So thanks for joining. Let me talk to that. This is Dan Goldsmith. Portfolium is a pretty strategic initiative for us.

We've been contemplating and looking into student success market for some time now, and we've been talking about our vision from first day of school to last day of work. So the student success market and Portfolium specifically is a great first step to connecting the dots between those two worlds. Portfolium is still at the early stages. And so part of the acquisition is based upon their feedback that we've received from common customers and organizations out in the market, but there's still a huge opportunity moving forward to expand.

Portfolium works across a number of academic institutions, both Canvas customers and non-Canvas customers.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

So just to add a tiny bit more color to that. Portfolium has hundreds of clients, several of them overlap with ours; while we have thousands. So there is a lot of headroom for us in terms of going to our install base for folks who don't yet have Portfolium. And it gives us an opportunity to sell them the product.[Unknown speaker]That's helpful.

And then just any sense of financials for the deal? And does your guidance include Portfolium?

So the guidance does include Portfolium. We are not going to break it out. We don't have a history of doing that. And we can't really discuss any other details.

The deal has not yet closed. We believe that is eminent and once it closes, there will be a little bit more information that comes out.

Unknown speaker

Thank you very much guys.

Your next question comes from Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Brian Essex -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Hi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. Hey, Dan, I was wondering if you could give us a little update on Bridge, some of the initiatives that you've had particularly on the sales force side this year. And maybe as a housekeeping item, just where we stand in terms of contribution from Bridge, not just on revenue but on bookings as well, given that we've kind of targeted that 15% and 20% bookings from Bridge?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So, Brian, good to talk to you. So on Bridge, as you recall, we've talked to 2018 about getting ready for 2019 and laying a lot of the foundation for further growth and execution in 2019. We entered the year this year with clear objectives, clear goals for the year actually loaded within our own instance of our Bridge product with all the employees to see.

In terms of the scaling and growth of Bridge, we continue to scale our sales team, bringing in additional talent into the team. And that will continue through 2019 and beyond as we expand within the market. Execution with Bridge continues to be strong. Through fourth quarter, we're very pleased with how the pipeline has grown.

We're pleased with the size of the deals that are coming through the pipeline. But as we put emphasis on enterprise deals, we also see longer sales cycles as well. So we expect to see more and more uplift for Bridge as we move forward through this year and into 2020. But early indications are good.

As you recall, some of the things we talk about when monitoring Bridge are the significant and large deals. So significant being key marquee deals with large customers where we have a lot of opportunity to expand within those customers or large-sized deals. We look at win rates within Bridge as well, which continued to move in the right direction. And then we look at average number of customers per product, which helps indicate whether we're being successful with the Bridge suite story.

So let me turn over to Steve to talk a little more about sort of the financials.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, so one of the things that we did last year as we talked about Bridge relative to the total, we actually don't think that makes sense anymore so we're not going to give that comparison. Canvas globally is still moving very, very rapidly, and we have new initiatives like the Portfolium acquisition that will hopefully enhance that to some degree. And so it becomes unfair to Bridge to compare it to Canvas, and it's better to look at Bridge as stand-alone. But saying all that, we are still not in a position where we're ready to break Bridge out in any level of detail.

Brian Essex -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Got it. And then maybe, Dan, just to kind of touch on kind of go to market as a follow up. How are you in terms of feature parity, pricing parity with the competition? And what do you see the most I guess effective penetration rate in terms of deal size?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So, Brian, great question. There's sort of three ways to think about that and answer that question. First and foremost, recognize that we're going after the market as a suite of capabilities.

So we're not solely focused on the corporate LMS area and domain and market per se, although Bridge Learn obviously touches on that market. With Bridge Learn, Perform, with Practice, and then obviously we're working with early customers and beta customers in the market around the upcoming product releases, the Bridge suite story continues to get stronger and stronger. So in terms of just attractiveness within the market, we're seeing more and more multi-product sales with Bridge and we're happy with those results. And we're being very successful with our beta.

In terms of feature parity, we're strong and competitive, and we've seen wins across all of our competitors in the market around sort of the learning space. And we continue to see a lot of open white space where we're clearly differentiated with some of our innovative products like Practice. So it's a little hard to pin down on sort of feature parity. We have a lot of room to grow, and we're going to continue to invest in R&D.

But a lot of that investment will go toward that Bridge suite story more so than just feature parity.

Brian Essex -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Got it, that's helpful. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham. Your line is open.

Unknown speaker

Hey guys, this is Josh [Inaudible] for Scott. So how are you thinking about you partner strategy for Bridge in 2019? You've had a lot of success with your partner network with Canvas. Can you replicate this on the corporate side of the business? And what are some of the dynamics that might be different for those two?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

So good to talk to you. We're getting a little static on the line, so it's a little hard to hear. But in terms of our partner strategy for Bridge, we're on track with where I want to be at this stage within our partner strategy. Obviously, Canvas has a 10-year track record to fall upon and building of that partner network and education, and that's been a strong point for us solidifying within in the market.

With regards to Bridge, our strategy is to start with sort of leading thought leaders and analysts, and we're getting a lot of good coverage of thought leaders and analysts. And we're starting to work with various consultancies, large and small. Additionally, we're seeing more and more interest from technology partners as well with Bridge, and we're adding more and more over time. So we're still in the early stages of establishing that partner program.

But as we go through 2019, you'll see more and more partners added to the Bridge side of the house.

Unknown speaker

OK, great. And then just one follow-up question. You mentioned that international revenue is up 18% of revenue. What regions do you plan to make the greatest investments internationally in 2019?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

The question I think was where do we intend to make the greatest investments internationally?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Josh, could you go on mute please? Because there's a ton of static coming through? Sorry. [Inaudible] Josh?

Unknown speaker

Sorry. Is that better?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

No. Uh-oh.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

So apologies, we're having static on the line. But let me try and answer the question here around where investments are for international. So international, there's really sort of three prongs of our international approach. We have expansion with our edu market, with the the edu market the Canvas are sort of country by country.

And we continue to execute with a sort of common playbook across each of those markets and we're seeing success. I highlighted that success in the earlier remarks across LatAm. We're seeing similar success in Europe and Asia Pac as well. Embedded in that in international expansion, we're also starting to focus on some of the larger markets as well in terms of volume.

So you'll hear more of that moving forward as we continue to examine the new countries and markets on the edu side. Additionally with international, we will be focusing more and more with Bridge. We're making strategic hires with Bridge as well, and anticipate more growth with Bridge both in Europe, Asia Pac and LatAm. What is advantageous for us around Bridge is we can focus on some of the core markets like Australia or the U.K.

or Germany for example or France, and that will automatically take us into a number of multinational deals easily into other countries as well. So those are sort of three prongs to our strategy for international. And with the solid foundation and the new GM structure we introduced in 2018, we feel very ready for execution and we're already seeing results in our pipeline.

Operator

Your next question comes from Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Your line is open.

Brian Peterson -- Raymond James -- Analyst

Hi guys, and hopefully I'm not bringing as much static. I had to take some migraine medicine. So just wanted to start. The international success you had this quarter, probably a little bit better than I expected.

How many deals are there out there that can contribute kind of 50,000-plus type of students? And is that still an incremental opportunity for you guys over the next few years?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

So good to talk to you, Brian. So when we talk about international, there's still a lot of very sizable deals out there in the market. I assume you're alluding to the education side. There's still a lot of sizable deals out there.

So I wouldn't call it just incremental growth. I think it can be pretty monumental growth with some of those large deals. That being said, the market is pretty bifurcated into larger deals and in a number of smaller caps or smaller deals as well, herding cats and dogs out there in the market. The other dynamic that we're shifting this year as well is recognition that the international markets still focus a lot on the open source and the perceived freebie model as well with Moodle.

And so we've introduced a value engineering capability with maturity models and ROI models specifically to help advance our position and help our prospects and customers make the business case for switching over to Canvas. What's great about that is for the wins that we've had against Moodle, we get feedback constantly about the fact that from a total cost of ownership, Canvas is equal or even better than what many of these organizations typically experience with their legacy platforms. So large deals still out there, as well as a number of cats and dogs and smaller deals. The larger deals exist across all geographies, and we're selling with strategic intent through 2019 and beyond to capture those deals and accelerate the pipeline.

Brian Peterson -- Raymond James -- Analyst

Got it. And maybe just pivoting to the domestic higher ed segment for a bit. My checks have indicated that that kind of slowed in the back half of the year. I'm just curious, how should we think about the pipeline of opportunities in 2019?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

So I think we talked about that a little bit in the prepared remarks, that we expect a muted growth rate. I think we're looking at the year as somewhat consistent to last year. So if there's upside that would be great. But we're just assuming it's going to run about the same.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

One thing to bear in mind is we're not resting on our laurels with that either. We've talked about this previously. So we're working actively, we've made some strategic hires. And the types of dialogues we're having with institutions that wouldn't have engaged with us previously.

We're working very proactively. We're engaging in those dialogues, and we're creating business cases ideally to move organizations ahead of RFPs to move over to Canvas and create demand.

Brian Peterson -- Raymond James -- Analyst

Thanks guys.

Your next question comes from Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Your line is open.

Corey Greendale -- First Analysis -- Analysis

Hey, good afternoon. First, just a quick clarifying question. U.S. higher ed, when you say consistent, do you mean you expect flattish billings or flattish new billings?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

So, Corey, when we talk about that, we're talking about new business.

Corey Greendale -- First Analysis -- Analysis

OK, so it should still grow, the new business?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Oh, yeah, yeah! Oh, absolutely. No, there's definitely growth from a billings perspective. This is about new business.

Corey Greendale -- First Analysis -- Analysis

Yes, just wanted to clarify that. And then, Dan, the six growth initiatives, you mentioned three. I just want to be clear. The other three, you're just not discussing at all or you can kind of mention what they are but you're just not elaborating on this call?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

We're not elaborating right now, we're not discussing at this time. One of the areas that the leadership team worked on last year as we were getting ready for 2019 was sort of this concept of layering in growth initiatives. This was a fundamental strategy that I've employed in previous companies, is to make sure that we not only are doing the things near term to drive growth of the company, but we're laying the groundwork and planting the seeds for growth in the mid and long term as well. Obviously, as the the law of large numbers continues to create headwinds for large percentage growth rates, we need to consider elements for growth as early as possible.

So there's six growth initiatives, actually are spread out pretty nicely and layered in. Can be very beneficial from the strong position we are within education, as well as connectivity over to corporate and expansion in corporate as well. So over the next two quarters, I'll talk more about the remaining three growth initiatives. The reason why we're not talking about them now is they're more in the sort of incubation and start-up phase of things.

And so as we calibrate those markets and the growth potential of those initiatives and we lay the foundation for the team to execute that, we'll talk more specifically at what those are and what they can do for our business.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

But I can say that our guidance includes all the effect of all the growth initiatives that we believe will take place in 2019.

Corey Greendale -- First Analysis -- Analysis

Which I assume is primarily cost, not a revenue contribution?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

No, you should not assume that. In fact, two several things Dan talked about earlier were revenue generating. But that doesn't mean it will all happen in '19. These are medium to long-range plans, right? So they're not like one-hit wonders.

Corey Greendale -- First Analysis -- Analysis

I meant more the [Inaudible] we haven't heard about. I was assuming they won't be a big revenue contribution, but maybe that's wrong?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

We're not planning for those major revenue contributors this year, but it's still early in the process.

Corey Greendale -- First Analysis -- Analysis

And just one last one on the same topic. The Dig initiative. Potentially doubling TAM and education sounds like potentially a big deal. And I understand it's at a high level.

Is there any more you can say about what that looks like or what the product might look? Just anything.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, happy to do that. And actually this is not something that's new. We've been working on the scaffolding for Dig for well over a year now. I mentioned in the remarks that we already have product validation tours out there on the market.

We have instructors and students consuming outputs from some of the initial experiments with Dig. And we anticipate later this year obviously to make more announcements around specific products and offerings and how we bring them into the market. Dig ultimately is a platform first and foremost based upon machine learning and artificial intelligence. I believe that any multi-tenant SaaS company born in the cloud has the opportunity once they hit a certain market share.

And in fact it may even be incumbent upon those organizations to sort of partner with the industry and evolve that industry with new insights and predictive modeling using A.I. and ML. That's what Dig is at its heart. So we've established the core engine, the core platform.

Now it's a matter of scaling that engine and building application use cases. We already have a handful of use cases we're working with around student success for example where we have some predictive algorithms around students and courses even before they even step foot into the course and how we can advise and guide instructors to help drive improvements and success, as well as other algorithms that will help steer students to be more efficient in their studies and more up to speed with the things that they need to focus on to be successful through their academic experience and beyond.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

So just to add to that, Corey. One way to think about this is when you think about LMS, we're somewhat constrained on our pricing model because of legacy pricing that's been established for a couple of decades. When we think about things like Dig and the impact it could have on student retention, and knowing that the success rate of an entering freshman is about 50% to get to a graduation level, to finish with a bachelor's degree, and you think average tuitions are 40, 50 grand a year, when you start adding that up, what's the impact to a school to get the 50% to 55%? If we can help them do that with things like Dig, there's huge value. And since this is a relatively new market, we have an opportunity to price this more on value than on legacy.

So there's how you sort of get to a point where you could imagine 1 billion to whatever TAM associated with student retention.

Corey Greendale -- First Analysis -- Analysis

Great, that's very helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Terry Tillman with SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open.[Unknown speaker]Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. This is Eric [Unknown Speaker] for Terry. I wanted to ask you guys about your thoughts on the K-12 market.

In the past it's been a little bit more of a difficult market to penetrate given the unique dynamics there. But when we look into 2019 and your guidance, how do you think about the growth in the K-12 market and the availability of resources to go after that market?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

I'd say you're correct. I mean, K-12 is not as large of a market or opportunity for us as high ed for example, but it continues to be an important market where we are experiencing very high win rates. And we'll continue to hammer away at that market and move forward. We anticipate growth globally for K-12 this year, building on last year's momentum.

But I can't really say more than that.[Unknown speaker]OK. And on a similar topic on Gauge, you've talked about in the past that product readiness wasn't exactly correct when you first went to market. So can you just give an update on where the Gauge product stands in terms of product availability and readiness for the market?

Yes, so the AMS market continues to represent a significant opportunity for us, and we're getting very good reception. As we mentioned, we pulled back in 2018 after sort of going out in the market and recognizing that we had some gaps in the product. We entered 2019 with an upgraded version and enhanced version of Gauge that can capture a significant amount of the K-12 market. We started building a pipeline late in the 2018 year, and now we're in the middle of a variety of sales cycles.

So so far, indicators are green around our ability to grow. We've put in some conservative estimates around the contribution through the AMS market with Gauge this year as we continue to prove out the product. But that's a long-term play for us in that AMS market given the size and our penetration and K-12.[Unknown speaker]Great, thank you.

Your next question comes from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.

Brian Schwartz -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst

Yes, hi, thanks for taking my questions today. Dan, just wanted to ask you on the Bridge on the corporate side. As you're moving upmarket here with Bridge, are you making any changes or maybe no change to the type of sales rep that you're hiring for the Bridge group? Or really, the Bridge sales organization in general entering this year.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, Brian. So good to talk to you. So yes, we absolutely are. We've been upgrading the team there in a variety of ways.

And that actually started with the hiring of Mark Landwehr early in 2018, and it's continued with hiring a number of additional sales people and sales managers into that team. We now have two mid-market teams that are focusing on Bridge, and we continue to expand those teams where we had one last year. And we have an enterprise team that's growing very rapidly. So the talent that we're bringing in is talent that has deep experience in the software space and proven success or selling SaaS-based software across a variety of environments, as well as a number of members to the team that have experience specifically in sort of learning and employee development markets as well.

So we still have work to do there. There's still a number of hires that we'd like to make and we anticipate making within that this quarter and the next quarter. But we bring on new reps. They have domain experience both in software and relevant sort of functional domains, and they hit the ground running pretty quickly.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

One thing I would add to that is we're in a position now where we can actually recruit higher-caliber sales reps because we have more stuff on the truck to sell. And so when they think about, for example a year and a half ago with just learn, now it's a suite that's growing. And they look at that and say oh, I think I can hit my quota or meet my quota and make a lot of money here because you've got plenty of stuff to sell. So that has changed the game for us on the recruiting side in a positive way.

Brian Schwartz -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst

Thank you. And then, Steve, two real financial questions for you kind of separately. I apologize if you gave it already, if you gave the 4Q revenue retention metrics that came in above 100% again. And then the second financial question, just wanted to ask you about stock comp.

Really helpful all the commentary on the philosophy. I think we totally get it on that. My question I just wanted to ask you, how we should think about the trend, modeling out the trend on the stock comp. Should we think about it looking in the future more as a percentage of revenue closer to 2019 or 2018, or maybe somewhere in between? Thanks.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, sure. So first on the net revenue retention, we did not mention it but it is still over 100%. And we see that as an ongoing trend. For stock-based comp, I think you see in the tables in the press release that it's getting closer or maybe around 20% is what we're forecasting for 2019.

It's slightly elevated as a result of the way that the senior executive team was handled. Because instead of getting annual refresh grants, we got one effectively four-year grant. We won't get one in 2020 or 2021. And that's a sizable amount of money.

So that will help SBC moderate in 2020 and beyond. But it's probably -- I don't know, I haven't looked at a forecast but I would suspect going into 2020 and beyond it'll probably be somewhere between '18 and '19.

Brian Schwartz -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst

That's very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions this afternoon.

Your next question comes from Justin Furby with William Blair and Co. Your line is open.

Justin Furby -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

Great, thanks guys. Maybe just to start, Steve, on the guidance for this year. I think you're guiding for 19% growth in Q1 and closer to 22% for full year?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

22% to 24%, that's correct.

Justin Furby -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

I guesss I assume the acceleration in that guide, Steve, is just driven by the acquisition? Or is there something else when you think about that [Inaudible] Q1 versus the outer quarters?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

So it's not the acquisition. We're not going to give specifics about that, but that's nominal. First of all, our Q1 over Q1, we have a tough comp. And it comes from non-recurring.

Recurring is growing nicely Q1 over Q1, but non-recurring is essentially flat in our numbers. So that creates, because the high non-recurring from Q1 of last year, that creates a tough comp. But the growth initiatives that Dan talked about, which do not include Portfolium per se, are really the drivers of the full year looking a little bit better than Q1.

Justin Furby -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

Got it. Super helpful. And then I guess in terms of Bridge, is there a point when, Steve, you think you'll break that out in terms of a trigger point, whether it's 10% of revenue or whatever it is? And then can you give us an update on how much of your development spend today is being allocated toward Bridge? I think I had them, I had a couple of years ago. It was around a third of development, and my sense is it's probably higher now.

So just any update here would be helpful. Thanks.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, so I'm sorry, what was the first question again?

Justin Furby -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

Just that there's a trigger point where you think you'll break out --

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Oh yes, yes, yes. So yes there is. It's a qualitative trigger point, not a hard number trigger point. It's when we believe that the numbers are moving consistently in the same direction over a long enough period of time, and we believe that it's big enough where most of the volatility is removed.

We think that is the biggest issue with reporting numbers now. Because it's a relatively small base certainly compared to Canvas, that it will appear volatile and we would hate for people to think that one or two data points is a trend when in fact it may just be an anomaly of a particular quarter. So when we see stability is when we'll probably start reporting more detail. Regarding the R&D investment, we don't really break that out.

But what we can tell you qualitatively is while we are doing some incremental investments on the Canvas side, and Dig is a good example of that, the lion's share of the growth in R&D is going to Bridge.

Justin Furby -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

[Inaudible] and then if I could sneak one more in. I might have missed this, but I think you're moving away from talking about Bridge in terms of ACV mix. But can you just say how you did in 2018 versus your stated target of 15 to 20? Thanks.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. We didn't quite get there, but we got very, very close and it was effectively one deal that slipped into 2019.

Justin Furby -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

OK, got it. Thanks guys.

Your next question comes from Alex Paris with Barrington Research. Your line is open.

Chris Howe -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

This is Chris Howe sitting in for Alex. Good afternoon everyone.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Hey, how's it going?

Chris Howe -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

Good. A few topics here to cover. You had mentioned your wins against Moodle, the way you've highlighted value engineering, the total cost of ownership being equal or better. Can you perhaps add some additional color on what you're seeing when you go up against Moodle? Has there been a regression in their product versus yours? Or has it been just the advancement of your product versus yours? And Just what you're seeing in that pre environment competitive space.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Well, it's a great question. So it's still early days for us around value engineering. That's something that we initiated and started building at the end of 2018, and we're still in the progress as we're introducing that more solidly within the market. You'll see more of that as we come toward Instructure Con, which is in July this year in the U.S.

With regards to the product differentiation, I don't think it's as much -- I mean, we continue to advance our product, and that's natural for us to sort of innovate more efficiently and with greater investment into our Canvas products. So from a product differentiation perspective, it's very, very strong. I think that naturally happens with Moodle as well. We see not necessarily a regression in the product but some stagnation in terms of the product and their ability to compete on that front.

A lot of the organizations though, although the product functionality and capabilities are a meaningful data point in terms of a decision like this, there needs to be a compelling value case. So the financials need to work with them, which is much harder to unearth and unravel from an organization where you're not dealing with subscription fees in the same way. And an organization needs to be ready for change. And so some of those things take time.

Again, with the value-engineering initiative, that will help on both of those fronts. We continue to win over Moodle. There's a sales execution element to this as well. Again, moving internationally, and by the way the Moodle phenomenon is primarily international.

Part of it is us just continuing to penetrate market by market as well. The other dynamic with education is as we go into individual countries, there are sort of anchor customers, if you will, as we go into those countries that help more and more with preference selling. So when we do that in a market like Germany or Spain for example, then it will help other companies build confidence around their ability to move from Moodle to Canvas, for example.

Chris Howe -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

Thanks Dan, that's very helpful. And a little more topic. Staying on the international front, you've mentioned and highlighted the wins with Deloitte and Lulu. Should I think of this as gaps that were geographic-specific? Or is there the potential to expand these company opportunities across borders? And as it relates to your product extensions within Bridge Learn, how would you characterize where you are on the timeline as far as you mentioned the two new products coming this month? How many more could there be as far as the product design and what's been--

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

So let me address both questions. The first one was around sort of regional needs or gaps. It's absolutely not the case that that's local. And my experience, I've worked with multinational companies extensively over my career and these are healthy signs, where a global company will start in one particular region or function within their organization and use that almost as a pilot in a proof case.

So in fact, in many of the situations where we're starting in a particular pocket within a customer, we're already having dialogues almost in parallel as we start up those dialogues with those customers. So Deloitte with Deloitte España is a great first step. Deloitte is a global organization, but they're also a sort of franchise organization as well, so there are decision makers in different markets. But they tend to be strong references across Deloitte globally.

And then Lululemon obviously in Canada, we have the opportunity to expand as we work across their organization. And those are just two examples of customers in the Bridge side that we have global international expansion opportunities. When it comes to the Bridge product and product launches, first let me correct something. We will announce within the coming months, not the coming month, two new products.

And then we will formally launch those at our Bridge event here in the U.S. in June. The phase we're in right now with both of those products is sort of our beta phase. We have customers actively using those products out in the market, and it gives us a lot of good feedback.

That's a very healthy way for SaaS companies to introduce products so we can work out some of the kinks and we can flesh out our product roadmap moving forward, as well as our value proposition in the market and doing so in a way that is controlled and it makes it easier to sort of scale with confidence over time. So those will be announced within the next two or three months, and it will be formally launched in the June timeframe average. So stay tuned for that.

[Operator instructions] The next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.

Rishi Jaluria -- D.A. Davidson

Hey, hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Dan, let me start with the comment you made about seeing a little bit of a lengthening of sales cycles on the Bridge side with larger deals. Can you give a little bit more color on this? When you say larger deals, are you talking about targeting larger initial deployments, by seed, more modules, or just going after customers that are bigger in terms of the opportunity? And why are you seeing lengthening sales cycles? Is it because you're replacing more products? Is it just because it's a higher price tag you're going after? Some color there would be helpful. And then I have a follow up for Steve.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, so Rishi, good to talk to you. So really none of the above. Actually, the elongation of sales cycles is quite simple. We're working on opportunities with larger companies and larger deals.

And larger companies tend to take longer to do evaluations and make decisions. There's committees, there's approval processes, etc. that they need to work through. So there's nothing different about the product mix and the number of products being replaced.

It's just frankly the anatomy of larger companies making decisions. And that's not unique to us. I experienced that in all of my previous careers selling large deals, and we experience a similar dynamic here. If anything, the Bridge suite is creating a much more compelling story, and we're opening up opportunities.

The interesting factor is as we go to market, and we're seeing this a lot in Europe right now, and we tell the employee development engagement story, we're seeing a lot more tailwinds come into the sales cycle and driving sort of buyers' interest, starting from that position rather than starting from a corporate LMS position. So that also tells us that strategy is working. That does also contribute to the elongation of deals because the customers may not always be naturally looking for a change in the existing system they have.

Rishi Jaluria -- D.A. Davidson

Got it. And just alongside those larger deals, is that something given maybe a higher amount of complexity that we should expect to see a higher services attach rate than maybe we've seen with Bridge in the past?

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. I don't think it will be misproportionate. But you'll see, yeah, you'll see higher services demand on those deals.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, I don't think you'll see that reflected in the financials in our recurring versus nonrecurring revenue breakout, just because there's so much volume and the mountain is very tall for what we have so far on recurring.

Rishi Jaluria -- D.A. Davidson

Got it, helpful. Thanks. And, Steve, just from a financial perspective, why did we see a decline in subscription gross margins in the quarter both sequentially and year over year? Was that driven by mix shift, geography? Or anything you could call out there?

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

It was actually driven by something that was positive in the long run, which is how we account for discounts for Amazon Web Services. So there was an adjustment in the fourth quarter, that without that it would have been basically flat to prior quarters.

Rishi Jaluria -- D.A. Davidson

Got it, that's helpful. Thanks guys.

Steve Kaminsky -- Chief Financial Officer

OK.

Operator

And that's all the time that we have questions for today. I turn the call back to Dan Goldsmith, CEO, for any closing remarks.

Dan Goldsmith -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank our passionate customers, our amazing partners and our dedicated and talented employees for contributing success in 2018.

Manitoba will post a budget gap of less than $400 million for the 2019-20 fiscal year, down from a forecast of a $518 million deficit in the current fiscal year, Pallister said in an interview. The government has lowered spending growth through “efficiencies,” by reducing staff travel budgets, government vehicle costs and streamlining the tender contract process, he said.

Manitoba has posted budget deficits since 2010 and Pallister’s Progressive Conservative Party has pledged to run a surplus by 2024. ( JOHN WOODS / THE CANADIAN PRESS file photo )

“We have found a lot of waste, a lot of overlap, a lot of duplication that has allowed us to bend the cost curve,” Pallister said in a Feb. 15 interview in his office at the provincial legislature in Winnipeg. He expects the March 7 budget will show his government is ahead of schedule on deficit reduction. Manitoba has posted budget deficits since 2010 and Pallister’s Progressive Conservative Party has pledged to run a surplus by 2024. Pallister, 64, reiterated that the government is still on track to reduce the provincial sales tax to 7 per cent from 8 per cent in his first term, which ends in October 2020 unless he calls an early election. The cut would cost the province about $300 million in lost revenue, but put more money into the pockets of Manitoba consumers, he said. Lower Tax

“We’re not going to solve it all by lowering a PST by one point, but at least somebody is trying to put a little bit more money on the kitchen table instead of taking it off,” Pallister said. “Kitchen tables are under attack.” The Manitoba government had forecast a budget deficit of $518 million for the 2018-19 fiscal year, or $3 million lower than its initial estimate in last spring’s budget, according to a fiscal update released in December. The province expects economic growth of 1.8 per cent for 2019, in line with last year. Economists expect growth of 1.5 per cent in 2020. The improved finances may be helping bolster the province’s bonds. Manitoba’s $1.45 billion of 3 per cent debt due 2028 returned 2 per cent this year, compared with 1.93 per cent for bonds in the Bloomberg Barclays Canada Aggregate Government-Related index. Manitoba’s credit rating was cut by S&P Global Ratings in 2016 and again in 2017 as it carries one of the highest relative debt loads among Canadian provinces. S&P rates the province A+, in line with Ontario, yet below Saskatchewan. Economic Headwinds

Pallister said the province still faces headwinds as he aims to meet his goal of a balanced budget. The Bank of Canada’s five interest rate hikes have pushed Manitoba’s annual debt service costs above $1 billion for the first time, he said. The central Canada province has more than $25 billion in debt. “I don’t think we can take our foot off the pedal” in terms of curbing spending, he said. “We’ve started to turn the canoe to a safer shore, but now we have to paddle like crazy.”",Manitoba Premier sees deficit narrowing more than forecast,Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/02/19/manitoba-premier-sees-deficit-narrowing-more-than-forecast.html
219,Empty,2019-02-20T21:38:40Z,"Mike Schreiner is making history Wednesday by introducing the Green Party of Ontario's first bill at Queen's Park — one that seeks to protect the Paris Galt Moraine that supplies drinking water to about 130,000 people in Guelph, and more than 200,000 in the r…","As a resident of Guelph, Mike Schreiner has been a longtime champion of water protection issues in southwestern Ontario, where the quantity and quality of drinking water is under threat by industry and development.

The Green Party of Ontario leader has personally advocated for the city's efforts to negotiate with a local quarry operation that has been requesting the doubling of its extraction activities since 2007. The issue has been a source of contention ever since.

Residents have been worried it will contaminate the the groundwater 8 in 10 residents in the city depend on through access to wells, Schreiner said. The issue has been in mediation with the Ministry of Environment for over five years to help find a possible resolution. Over the years, Schreiner has collected thousands of petition signatures to help the city's cause.

But the issue of cleaning water extends far beyond Guelph's historic limestone quarry and the industrial actions it has attracted.

Now MPP for Guelph, Schreiner is making history Wednesday by introducing the Green Party's first bill — one that seeks to protect the Paris Galt Moraine that supplies drinking water to about 130,000 people in Guelph, and more than 200,000 in the region.

""Water isn't the renewable resource that people thought it was because it takes a number of years to recharge and replenish the aquifers that supply our drinking water...so we want to make sure we protect them,"" Schreiner told National Observer in an interview in his Queen's Park office Tuesday. ""Without clean drinking water we're in trouble.""

Full house here at @MikeSchreiner’s office as he launches the first Green Party legislation in Ontario history, an act to conserve the Paris-Galt Moraine. https://t.co/y6C7ScXUYP #ProtectOurWater #Guelph #onpoli #greenviewingparty pic.twitter.com/LYJAVk33NE — Green Party Ontario (@OntarioGreens) February 20, 2019

Guelph is one of the largest cities in Canada to rely so heavily on groundwater for drinking water, relying on a series of 21 operational groundwater wells and a shallow groundwater collector system.

Through extensive municipal-led water conservation campaigns, it is also one of the only Canadian cities that has seen water usage decrease as the population has increased. The municipal government has encouraged residents to adopt low water flow toilets and shower heads and worked with businesses to make sure they are using water efficiently.

Despite this, a 2017 water quantity risk assessment report presented to the Lake Erie Region Source Protection Committee found that Guelph as a community could face water shortages in the future if the expected population growth and climate change collide. As a result, for the last few summer seasons, water restrictions have been imposed in the city to limit the consumption of water by the community.

According to the report, ""under the extreme scenario for the combined impact of drought conditions...land use development, and additional future municipal pumping, there was a significant risk that the water supply system would not meet the future demand.""

With the region's estimated population set to increase to one million people by 2041, the need to protect groundwater is clear, Schreiner said.

“The responsible thing to do now is put plans in place to protect it,"" he said. ""It seemed appropriate that (this issue) would be my first private member's bill.""

To do so, Schreiner is proposing the Paris Galt Moraine Protection Act — a conservation plan that provides a framework to protect the moraine's ecological and hydrological features.

""We want to make sure development's done in a way that's responsible and thoughtful, that protects the moraine and protects the wetlands,"" he said.

The Paris Galt Moraine is an integral part of the backbone of the Grand River watershed that serves as the main water supply to the region.

A moraine is glacial debris that has accumulated through geomorphological processes. The Paris Galt Moraine, which extends some 150 kilometres along the watershed, acts as a natural filter that recharges most of the region's groundwater. If it isn't protected, Schreiner said, government will have to make large investments in regional water infrastructure.

Schreiner's bill will develop a conservation plan in consultation with affected ministries, municipalities and Indigenous leaders, and will be reviewed every 10 years.

""It's the environmentally, socially and fiscally responsible approach,"" Schreiner said. ""We prioritize drinking water for people and communities and that we don't have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars building water infrastructure because we haven't protected what nature provides for free.""

Private member's bills can take two approaches, Schreiner said. They can either make a statement or they can be formulated in a way that turns the bill into legislation. ""This bill is both,"" he said. ""I'm making a statement that I think we need stronger protections for water, but I've done it in a way that I'm hoping it has a chance of passing.""

Schreiner modeled his first bill after the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, which was written and passed by a Progressive Conservative government in 2001 and proposed similar protections for the 1,900 square kilometres of land and water in south-central Ontario. He hopes this way the government will be ""sympathetic"" to his bill and ""recognize the good work of a previous conservative government.""

His bill comes weeks after the Ontario government backtracked on a proposed piece of legislation that could have opened up the province's protected greenbelt to development. The greenbelt is a 7,200-square-kilometre area that borders the Greater Golden Horseshoe area, which was established in 2005 to protect environmentally-sensitive land and water from urban development.

Bill 66 could have had significant implications for Guelph. In 2007 Guelph city council requested the provincial government to add the undeveloped portions of the moraines to the Province's greenbelt plan. Two years later, the city reversed its position, and allowed development on moraine land.

""Here's an opportunity for (the government) to expand those protections to a part of the province that doesn't have the same kind of protections that the greenbelt has in an area where there are deep concerns about the quantity of the water that's available,"" Schreiner said about his bill.

Since summer 2018, Schreiner has consulted with members across party lines, including a Conservative MPP who ""gave quite a bit of feedback,"" which he incorporated in the bill. He has also had ""productive conversations"" with Environment Minister Rod Phillips and consulted leaders of the Mississaugas of the the Credit First Nation about the matter.

""We came up with a bill and a strategy that can speak to every party,"" Schreiner said. ""It's about the environment, but it's about public health, and it's an economical and fiscally responsible piece of legislation.""

Agriculture sustains the economy of Guelph and the surrounding regions, he noted. ""If we don't have water to grow our food, businesses aren't going to invest in a community that doesn't have access to enough water to supply those businesses with the water they need,"" Schreiner said.

""I want my kids, grandkids, their kids and grandkids to have water,"" he added. ""I'm trying to put the protections in place where the environment filters and cleans our water for free essentially.

""I don't want us to have to spend millions of dollars in water treatment infrastructure or build a pipeline to one of the Great Lakes or something like that.""",Mike Schreiner introduces Ontario’s first-ever Green Party bill to protect water,Nationalobserver.com,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/02/20/news/mike-schreiner-aims-protect-water-ontarios-first-ever-green-party-bill
220,Empty,2019-02-20T02:06:49Z,Report calls for more scrutiny into 'elite capture' by China of retired UK politicians,"Economic uncertainties after Brexit could make the UK more vulnerable to Chinese interference, with Beijing using a variety of means to infiltrate Britain’s power structures, a leading think-tank has warned.

There has been little focus in Britain on how China preys on targeted countries and there is a need for a cohesive programme to counter it, according to a report by the Royal United Services Institute, which charts the tactics used by the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to achieve its aims.

The report examines the “concerted strategy” allegedly used by Beijing, ranging from spreading surreptitious technological reach through mega-corporations like Huawei, to the “elite capture” of people in important positions and opinion-formers by the placing of “advisers”.

Most western European states have resisted Beijing’s efforts to join China’s “Belt and Road” scheme which has been used, say critics, to spread economic and political hegemony in parts of Asia and Africa.

But the UK, seeking post-Brexit trade, has agreed to join the controversial initiative with David Cameron leading a $1bn private fund, supported by the British government.

Last year, 27 of the 28 EU-member-state ambassadors in Beijing (Hungary being the exception) signed off a report saying the Belt and Road project “runs counter to the European Union’s agenda for liberalising trade and pushes the balance of power in favour of subsidised Chinese companies”.

The British ambassador was one of the signatories. But Philip Hammond, on a subsequent visit to Beijing, declared: “I was privileged earlier this year to represent the UK at the first Belt and Road forum and one of the things we will discuss is the opportunity for closer collaboration in delivering the ambitions of the Belt and Road programme.”

The Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) report – “UK Vulnerable to Chinese Influence and Interference Operations” – calls for scrutiny of the “risk of financial dependencies being set up through consultancies offered to retired politicians, who the CCP hopes will push a sympathetic narrative.

“The case of former British prime minister David Cameron, who is involved in a large China fund which aims to invest $1bn in BRI projects, has gained some attention.

“The question of ‘elite capture’ by the CCP has not been closely examined. It should be, including the issue of how much time should elapse between government service and working for Chinese state or quasistate organisations.”

There is no suggestion in the report that the Chinese have tried to influence Mr Cameron.

The Rusi document, compiled by Charles Parton, a former diplomat, states: “The UK’s departure from the EU may increase the Chinese Communist Party’s desire to interfere, as it seeks to implement further a divide-and-rule strategy, aimed at imposing its global vision and promoting its interests”.

The report calls for the development of “systems to prevent non-transparent financing of political activities and lobbying by CCP-backed individuals and organisations; the ultimate donor should be clear, even when monies are channelled through British citizens.”

There are differences, on the whole, between the types of interference by the Kremlin and Beijing, according to the report.

“Except in the sphere of espionage and cyberattacks, CCP interference is not of the Russian kind, which is more deliberately hostile, even destructive. It is more subtle, incremental and often under the radar, although it is occasionally brazen.”

The main goal, it is held, is to promote a “ruthless advancement of China’s interests and values at the expense of those of the west, including through actions which encourage self-censorship and self-limiting policies”.

It points, as an example, to universities and research centres where “junior academics often self-censor to avoid having access to research opportunities withdrawn. Chinese interference in academic freedom also extends to putting pressure on academics, born in China and working in the UK to support the CCP line”.

There must be great caution, the report maintains, in allowing Chinese participation in the UK’s critical national infrastructure.

CCP interference is not of the Russian kind, which is more deliberately hostile, even destructive. It is more subtle, incremental and often under the radar, although it is occasionally brazen Rusi report

“Were there to be a decision in favour of allowing Chinese operator Huawei to offer fifth-generation mobile networks [5G] in the country it would be ‘at best naïve, at worst irresponsible. This is not least because [Chinese] national security laws require Huawei’s Chinese staff to accede to requests from government departments.”

The search for an optimistic post-Brexit future must not blind the UK to the risks involved, the report cautions. “The UK needs to realise that behind the enticing, but essentially meaningless, language of ‘win-win’ or ‘shared future for mankind’ lies a ruthless CCP agenda to advance its and China’s interests.”

“The UK will not change that, but its aim must be to channel it into a genuinely balanced relationship. In achieving that, language is important: if there must be talk of ‘the Golden Era’ (and within China, the phrase does help UK interests), the UK should not allow it to cloud its perceptions. The UK’s goal must be genuine reciprocity and an equal, mature and comprehensive relationship.”

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Thanks very much, Joe. Good afternoon, investors and OneSpan colleagues around the world. I'm pleased to have the opportunity to speak with you this afternoon.

We had a strong fourth quarter and for the year, revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeded the high-end of our guidance range. Our fourth quarter revenue was near record levels, with software and services growing 27% year-on-year, achieving a record high and hardware also growing at a strong 13% in the quarter. We also reported record gross profit for the fourth quarter and full year, a clear indication of the profit generating capacity of our business.

For the year, we achieved 10% revenue growth, including a doubling of sales from new customer logos and for the first time ever, our software and services revenue exceeded our hardware revenue. Mark will provide additional details on our fourth quarter and full-year results during his financial review.

OneSpan is the leading provider of authentication and fraud prevention solutions to the financial services industry. Our deep insights and comprehensive portfolio of security and productivity solutions makes OneSpan the partner of choice in this evolving landscape. The successful execution of our Trusted Identity strategy is enabling us to help our banking customers address the range of urgent challenges they face, from increases in fraud and regulation, the rapid technology change and the emergence of non-traditional competitors.

Story continues

I'll now touch on each of these business drivers in more detail. Sophisticated hacking attacks and unprecedented data breaches are increasing losses to fraud on a global basis. More than 185 million social security numbers, those of well over half of the US population are now in the hands of criminals. The result is that in the US alone, identity fraud, including account takeover and new account fraud increased to nearly $17 billion in 2017, with account takeover losses surpassing $5 billion.

Our recently launched Intelligent Adaptive Authentication and Risk Analytics offerings are seeing strong customer interest, as they expand our capabilities to detect and combat identity fraud across digital channels. This is a persistent problem, and demand for identity fraud solutions is growing.

We're taking advantage of the increased opportunity presented by PSD2 and similar regulations around the world that are driving an increase in demand for sophisticated multi-factor authentication and risk-based analytics. Our mobile security suite and hardware authentication solutions assist our clients with compliance, and ensure the security of their transactions and systems.

Online-only banks, FinTechs and digital platform companies are squeezing the profitability of traditional banking services. Our open cloud-based Trusted Identity platform is designed to improve agility and security, reduce complexity and costs, and speed time to market for new consumer and commercial banking offerings. Our solutions are also built for rapid integration with leading third party technologies and customers existing in-house systems.

Two weeks ago I met with one of Europe's largest financial institutions, and they told me that they need our help in moving their identity security infrastructure into an agile cloud environment so that they can be more responsive to the emerging needs of their customers. We are carefully integrating our portfolio of capabilities into solutions that respond to these business drivers.

Our strategy is to secure, enable the full Identity life cycle from new account opening to transaction security, to securing open banking. We're in a position -- we are positioning OneSpan to be the provider of choice. No competitor can match the range of offerings we provide and are developing. This is a powerful strategy that can support our growth objectives and financial institutions and beyond, and to government, insurance and enterprise markets.

Our increased R&D investment of the last two years is enabling us to launch innovative new solutions that address these urgent market needs. I'll now update you on some of our key offerings. First, mobile security suite or MSS. Mobile security suite had an outstanding year, with revenue growth in excess of 50% and our opportunity pipeline remains robust.

Many of our existing customers are adopting mobile security suite and are often operating in mix environments that use both mobile security suite software and our hardware products, reflecting the diverse needs of their own customer bases. Critical to our success is the ability of our solutions to use consistent authentication financial transaction protocols across the mix of end-user devices.

Mobile security suite not only delivers industry-leading security, but also a low-friction user experience through its biometric capabilities. Javelin Research -- Javelin Strategy & Research recently awarded OneSpan 2018 Best in Class Mobile Biometrics Platform over 11 other providers. Mobile security suite is also an important enabler of our Trusted Identity strategy, as it integrates with our cloud-based offerings to enhance risk analytics and adaptive authentication.

The second product category I'll talk about is our e-signature and identity verification solutions that help financial institutions and enterprise to digitize business processes to reduce costs, improve productivity and enhance customer experiences. Our e-signature subscription revenue grew in excess of 20% in 2018.

In 2019, with integration to our identity verification components and with the availability of a qualified electronic signature capability, we will deliver a new secure agreement automation offering to address global market needs. We see substantial opportunities for accelerated growth in this area. As we noted previously, our customers are increasingly choosing to deploy e-signature in the cloud through a recurring revenue model. This shift is leading to a decline in new license revenue through the first quarter of 2019.

Third, let me talk about our hardware offerings. We're the market leading provider of fraud and prevention -- fraud prevention solutions for authentication and transaction security in the financial services industry. And as noted above, hardware is a key element of our overall value proposition.

In 2018, hardware revenue outperformed our expectations, with 13% growth in Q4 and full-year results matching those of last year. We attribute this outperformance to increased regulation, our advanced hardware products and the fact that hardware provides the highest level of security.

And fourth, as you have heard, we are launching several new cloud offerings through our Trusted Identity platform. We released Intelligent Adaptive Authentication in Q3, and announced our cloud-based risk analytics fraud management solution just last week. Intelligent Adaptive Authentication and Risk Analytics both have significant opportunity pipelines, and we had initial Intelligent Adaptive Authentication sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 -- I'm sorry, 2018.

In 2019, as we noted previously, we're planning to launch our secure agreement automation offering, which combines e-signature, biometrics and digital identity verification technology to create a comprehensive integrated solution for our customers. This will allow us to address our customers' needs to securely enable digital account openings, while reducing new customer on-boarding abandonment rates that can reach up to 95%, and impose immense class and lost growth opportunities on banks.

These new offerings are designed to be predominantly subscription-based, and will help grow our recurring revenue stream. Our exciting roadmap of new offerings will continue to evolve through 2020 and future years. In the meantime, we are encouraged by the talent we are attracting from our largest competitors and across the industry as knowledge of our compelling growth strategy attracts attention.

Now, let me turn to our 2019 financial guidance. Revenue for the full year of 2019 is expected to be in the range of $229 million to $237 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the full-year 2019 is expected to be in the range of $22 million to $27 million. We expect 2019's quarterly revenue trend to be similar to 2018's, with new products contributing more significantly as the year progresses.

In 2019, we will be making significant investments in our global cloud infrastructure, which is necessary to support the growth in recurring revenue that we anticipate. This may result in modest pressure on gross margin until the growth of these new services contributes to margin expansion.

I'll now turn the call over to Mark Hoyt, our Chief Financial Officer, and he will provide details for you about the quarter, the full-year 2018 and our 2019 outlook.

Mark?

Mark Hoyt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Executive Vice President

Thank you, Scott. OneSpan's strong fourth quarter was fueled by 19% revenue growth to $64.8 million. Product and license revenue grew 11% to $47.6 million, and services and other revenue grew 47% to $17.2 million. For the full-year 2018, revenue increased 10% to $212 million. And as Scott mentioned, for the first time, our annual revenue from non-hardware was more than hardware.

Subscription revenue grew 68% in the quarter and 50% for the full-year 2018. OneSpan's Sign subscription revenue grew more than 20% in 2018, and total Dealflo revenue, including subscription, maintenance and professional services met our expectations, contributing $4 million for the year. Software license revenue includes mobile security, server and OneSpan Sign e-signature licenses. It grew 6% in the quarter and 15% for the year.

Maintenance support and other revenue grew 24% in 2018, and professional services revenue grew 17%. Hardware grew 13% (ph) in the quarter, and included a broad base of customers. For the year, hardware was flat ahead of our expectations. We still expect the longer-term hardware revenue trend line to be a decline in the mid-single digit range.

Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 65% compared to 66% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross margin percentage was affected by the product mix, and by an increase in expenses to service our cloud customers. Gross margin for the full-year 2018 was 69%. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $38 million, an increase of 10% from $35 million reported in Q4 last year.

For the year, our OpEx increased 15% to $147 million. The increases in the quarter and the year are largely driven by investments in R&D and sales and marketing, and include OpEx attributed to the Dealflo business. We finished the year with 732 employees. We expect operating expense growth to moderate in 2019, with growth in R&D partially offset by declines in G&A, with slower growth in sales and marketing investments.

Adjusted EBITDA, or adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, long-term incentive compensation and non-recurring items was $9.1 million, an increase of $2.7 million from $6.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the year, adjusted EBITDA totaled $21.6 million. And as Scott mentioned, it exceeded our guidance range of $15 million to $19 million.

GAAP earnings per share was $0.10 in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to a loss of $0.65 in the fourth quarter of 2017, which, of course, was driven by the impacts of the 2017 tax reform law. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which excludes long-term incentive compensation, amortization, non-recurring items and the impact of tax adjustments was $0.17 for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $0.14 in the fourth quarter of last year.

Geographically, our revenue mix for the fourth quarter included 59% from EMEA, 23% from the Americas and 18% from Asia-Pac. This compares to 55%, 28%, and 17% in the same regions in Q4 2017, respectively. The higher share revenue in EMEA was driven by strength in our mobile security suite and contributions from our Dealflo acquisition.

Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with $99 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as compared to $158 million at the end of 2017. The acquisition of Dealflo accounted for a majority of that difference.

I will now turn the meeting back to Scott.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Thanks very much, Mark. As financial institutions and enterprise focus on growth in their digital channels, it's more important than ever to protect the customer journey, as fraud and other financial crimes become more sophisticated and pervasive. At OneSpan, our mission is to ensure customers can establish trust and peoples identities, and the devices they use and in the transactions they conduct.

Our investments in technology, people and business processes are intended to ensure that we continue to be a market leader. Our pipeline of opportunities is growing, and we will continue to invest in R&D, while managing overall operating expenses. The significant investments we've made over the prior year are contributing to growth and we're confident 2019 will be a year of progress, enhancing customer and shareholder value.

One final note before I finish my comments. As you may have seen, a shareholder has sent an open letter to our Board of Directors making a number of recommendations with respect to the configuration of our business. Our Board takes the input of shareholders very seriously, and you should know that the Board is evaluating the contents of that letter and as it always does, other approaches for creating value for shareholders.

So, as we move into the Q&A section, I want to remind participants that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our operational and financial results. So, we ask that you please keep your questions focused on that topic. And we thank you for your cooperation in this regard.

Operator, we are ready to take questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Zack Turcotte of Dougherty. Your line is now open.

Zack Turcotte -- Dougherty & Company -- Analyst

Hey. Thanks, guys. Zack on for Catharine Trebnick. So, you talked about some of your customers having mix environments both in software solutions as well as hardware. What does the timeline look like as far as when some of those customers maybe willing to move fully to software, particularly with increased regulation you talked about, as well as their kind of historical confidence in the higher-level security?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Hi, Zack. I'll take a crack at that. I think that for the foreseeable future, I think most of our large customers will continue to operate in a mix environment of hardware and mobile security software, our mobile security suite. And I think the reason for that is, we need to remember that many of these customers, even the smaller ones have hundreds of thousands of users and the larger ones have many millions of users. And those users are everything from 18 young -- 16, 17, 18 year old opening their first bank account to older people like my parents who have been banking for a long time.

And so we see that those different cohorts in the customer base really do want -- they have different requirements for their authentication solution. Some people really value the simplicity of using a hardware authenticator. Some really value the fact that they can do everything they need to do on their mobile device and don't need to have a hardware authentication. And we see the propensity to go one way or another varies a lot by region of the world. And in Asia, for example, hardware authentication remains quite popular, even as we sell a lot of mobile security suite there.

So, I think there -- our view is and there is no -- I don't think there's a lot of doubt about this that over time there is a substitution taking place of mobile security for hardware authentication. That's why we continue to suggest that we will see a gradual decline in unit sales of hardware authenticators over the next -- over the coming years with continued growth in mobile security suite.

As the mix of banking customers shifts younger or toward newer generations, they will have a tendency to use mobile devices rather than hard authentication. But this is going to take a long time. We do see that in the commercial banking space, our hardware authenticators are still the dominant approach because of the security that they offer and the fact, they are not connected to the Internet, they're quite secure.

So that's, I think what's happening. And I would make one other point about our hardware business. It plays a critical role in opening up opportunities for us because of the penetration that we have of this hardware business on a global basis. It really is a key thing that customers want and it opens the door. And in many cases, it gives us the opportunity to talk about mobile security and adaptive authentication and risk analytics, the things that are being driven both by fraud and by regulation around the world.

Zack Turcotte -- Dougherty & Company -- Analyst

Got it. Okay. And then on -- talking about e-signature, the subscription growth. Are you seeing a lot of traction from moving your current on-premise e-signature for customers to your cloud-based offering or is it primarily from new cloud deals?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Yeah. It's really new customers, predominantly, Zack. I think the reason that we have had an on-premise offering in that business, even when other competitors have not is because particularly banks, to a degree, insurance companies have been slow, I think, to move to the cloud because of the complexity of their infrastructure and also their traditional view that they could be more secure if there's -- if there are software solutions we're operating behind the firewall of their company.

And so that is beginning to change. That is why when we talk about our Trusted Identity strategy and adaptive authentication, that it's a cloud first strategy. It's because we believe when we developed that strategy that banks were going to be accelerating a shift toward the cloud. We're in the early days of that. I think this transition will happen gradually over the coming years. So, I don't expect a big shift in a short period of time with our existing on-prem customers toward cloud.

I think that will take place over somewhere in the three to five-year timeframe. And so, I think it's a very manageable transition for us, even as we -- even as we expand globally with this business and see these other opportunities around cloud, new cloud opportunities for growth. I don't think we're going to see an on-mass move, for example, from on-prem to cloud for those kinds of institutions.

Zack Turcotte -- Dougherty & Company -- Analyst

Okay. One last one on the geographic split. Substantial amount of revenue from EMEA in the quarter. I know you partially attributed to Dealflo customers. So, do you expect a similar level of revenue from EMEA in the future, next 12 months, 24 months? And could you see some additional international cross-selling opportunities for e-signature through those customers?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Well, I think that we will see some -- we will still see some benefit in EMEA from Dealflo in 2019 because we don't have a full year of it in the numbers yet. So, we still got about five months of sort of one-time pickup in EMEA in 2019 for Dealflo. So, I think that's the first thing. Mobile security suite continues to be -- have a lot of opportunity. That opportunity is global. But given that the largest proportion of our installed base is in Europe, we see a lot of that transition or uptake of mobile security suite happening in Europe, although it's also strong in North America and Asia Pacific.

So, I think those things will continue to be a factor in EMEA. I think with respect to e-signature, we have a number of things that are going on with the intent of strengthening opportunities for our e-signature business in the rest of the world. I did talk about some of those in the -- in comments that I gave earlier. We have focused, I think, in our e-signature business more than most other competitors in the financial services, in the regulated industries.

The reality is that in Europe, the banks have been slow to take up e-signature because initially, there was uncertainty about the requirements and the implications of the eIDAS regulation. We have seen that clarify, and I think one of the issues that they now face is the scalability and cost of delivering qualified electronic signature solutions. This is -- we can deliver a QES solution today. But it's -- I think we have opportunities to really make it more scalable, more cost effective, easier for the consumer to deal with.

These are all challenges around a QES. And QES, qualified electronic signature will be a minority of the e-signature business in Europe and Asia. But it is something that is an element of the solution story that needs to be used for certain types of transactions, even if it's not the most of the transactions, it needs to be something that's available, scalable, deliverable to consumers. So, as I mentioned in the call, we are working very hard on a QES solution that we intend to launch in 2019, that will help with that. At the same time, we do see opportunity for cross selling with Dealflo and our e-signature product line.

And then finally, we continue to evolve our go-to market model and our sales model internationally to support the e-signature business. In fact in 2018, we saw roughly 10% of our revenue come through our -- really our security channel and out of the global, the rest of the world environment outside of North America. So, we've seen some beginnings there. We expect to see a lot more progress and traction on that in 2019.

Zack Turcotte -- Dougherty & Company -- Analyst

Great. Thanks, Scott.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Thanks, Zack.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Fishbein of BTIG. Your line is now open.

Joel Fishbein -- BTIG, LLC -- Analyst

Good afternoon, and congrats on a great quarter and end of the fiscal '18. Scott, I have -- just couple for you. On the -- I looked in initial guide for 2019, above where we were, implies roughly 10% growth. Love to just understand your confidence in the full-year guide and what kind of visibility that you have into that number?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Sure. I think we do take a lot of effort to model the revenue outlook for the coming year. We take a lot of inputs from everything, sort of a bottoms-up view from our sales organization as well as input from our marketing and product management people about new solutions.

I feel -- I do feel confident about the guidance range that we have given. It does not, I don't think require us to deliver huge amounts of new product revenue. It does require that we deliver some. If we -- I think if we do better, then if we do, I guess, quite well on these new products. And in 2019, we could see -- we could do better. We could see better performance out of the business.

We also have taken a, I think a reasonably conservative view of the hardware business in 2019 as we did in 2018. And in 2018, we did quite a bit better than we expected. So, I think we try to look at all the parts and the pieces and be realistic about those individual components of the revenue growth and put together something that is -- stretches our organization a little bit, but is achievable for our -- in terms of meeting our commitments to investors and to our Board.

Joel Fishbein -- BTIG, LLC -- Analyst

Great. Just one quick follow-up. Were there any very large deals in 4Q, particularly on the hardware side?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Not from a revenue point of view. We did have a large hardware booking in the fourth quarter, but the revenue contribution from that was limited in Q4. So, I think, it was a pretty broad demand for our hardware products around the world, Europe and Asia, in particular. As I noted in the comments, we have positioned ourselves, I think, to take advantage of the some of the regulatory things that are happening around PSD2. And it's been very interesting to watch that.

As PSD2 has become known, we see parts of Asia and the number of different parts of Asia and the Pacific who are basically adopting a similar viewpoint around strong authentication and risk analytics, although with a longer timeline around when they plan to adopt that. So, I think that's the drivers that we're seeing for the hardware business.

Joel Fishbein -- BTIG, LLC -- Analyst

Great. Thank you so much.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Thanks. Good talking to you, Joel.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Galinko of National Securities. Your line is now open.

Matthew Galinko -- National Securities Corporation -- Analyst

Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my couple of questions. I guess, first one is just, hear your comments on hardware but just curious what visibility you have into the pipeline and sort of closure of the pipeline just given the outperformance this year and kind of the general trends that you've discussed over the last few quarters?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Yeah, I think it -- I would say, generally, you have to think about the hardware business sort of multiple parts, right. So there is a part, which is, what I like to call sort of flo business, right? I mean these are just orders that kind of come in because an existing customer needs more tokens, because they have new customers that are replacing old tokens or lost or broken ones. So, there is a fair amount of underlying business that occurs related to that.

And when you look at the customer base for hardware, that customer base is pretty well known. A large proportion of their revenue, as I noted, are reorders and additional orders in the hardware business. Now, that doesn't mean we necessarily have specific visibility more than, say, 90 days or 120 days or something like that, but it does give us some confidence in a baseline level of the business activity.

On top of that are new projects, where a customer is deploying, maybe there -- they've been a customer before and they're upgrading to a new token technology, for example, our CRONTO technology, which has been an important driver for us over the last few years and will be an important driver for us in 2019.

And so, we do have some good visibility to some of that project work. A meaningful part of the hardware revenue in 2019 is related to orders we've already received for larger orders from large customers. And so, we layer that on top of the -- on top of that flo business that I talked about. So, that's kind of the pieces that we look at, and I would say, our visibility to 2019 isn't materially different than it was for 2018.

Matthew Galinko -- National Securities Corporation -- Analyst

Okay. Thanks. And then, you talked about investments in global cloud infrastructure. Can you be a little more specific about what those investments might entail and are they limited to 2019? Do you expect them to be made earlier in the year and sort of will see them flow through the year?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Yeah. So, we have -- we do have cloud infrastructure in many places around the world today to support our e-signature business. We have cloud platforms in Canada, US, Europe, the Pacific. So, we do have a lot of that already. But that infrastructure is really supporting e-signature today, as we begin to deploy these new integrated TID solutions, adaptive authentication and risk analytics. And then later in the year, some of the new agreement automation offerings, which will tie together e-signature and our identity verification capabilities. Those are all going to require in some cases new and in some cases, expanded infrastructure for these cloud offerings.

So, in order for us to -- let me just say, first of all, we have global interest in these new solutions; adaptive authentication, risk analytics, for example. In every region, we have customers that we are engaged with and talking about those products, those solutions. Obviously, before we can deploy those products or let those customers do proof-of-concepts and things like that, we need to put the cloud infrastructure in place. So, that's a part of what's required. We -- I would say that's coming a little bit faster than maybe we originally thought. And the reason for that is because of the amount of customer interest that we're seeing.

You have to keep in mind that, that infrastructure has to be in place and there's a buying process, a buying cycle that takes place and then there is a deployment period that takes place, and then there's a ramp-up of volume on that platform. So, we are using public cloud infrastructure for most of that. So, there is an upfront investment that we need to make to enable our ability to solve these solutions and that does run ahead of revenue initially. And then after that, we do this in a way that we can then scale those platforms with demand.

But others are getting in price. So, it's sort of the costs to get started and that's what we're talking about. That's happening -- is already been happening in 2018. Mark, I think referred to it in his comments. We did -- we are already seeing a significant uptick in cloud infrastructure costs in 2018 related to the intelligent -- sorry, Intelligent Adaptive Authentication product and the Risk Analytics that we just launched. So, that will continue to build, I would say throughout 2019, probably be a little more heavily weighted in early part of the year.

As you know, we have a -- not a seasonality, but a sort of a pattern to our business over the kind of the revenues in the first half and the second half, and revenues tend to be higher in the second half. So, there's a little bit of a -- there's certainly some pressure on margin in the early part of the year just based on that infrastructure investment that starts to get little better as we look at the second half.

Matthew Galinko -- National Securities Corporation -- Analyst

Great. Thank you.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Thanks, Matt.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Anja Soderstrom from Sidoti & Company. Your line is now open.

Anja Soderstrom -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst

Thank you, and congratulations on a good quarter. And I have some follow-up questions on the e-signature. So, I just want a clarification. So, are people still going on-premise first or are people most going into the cloud directly now or clients, I would say?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Sure. Sure. Hi, Anja. Nice to hear from you. What's -- the change that's really happening, Anja, in through 2018 and into the early part of 2019 is that most of our new opportunities, our new customers are want -- do want to use the cloud, the cloud product and the cloud platform. I think that this is true, certainly true for those customers, our non-banking customers, I would say in e-signature and is becoming increasingly true for our banking customers, although, again, that's going to be -- that's going to take a little bit of time, but it is. We are seeing that happen. It is the case that financial institutions, for example, have very rigorous internal processes and regulatory issues related to putting systems into the cloud.

So, they really have to do their homework. They are doing that homework. And the reason they're doing it is because they are under significant financial pressure as I mentioned in my comments. And so they -- and then they also need to be more responsive to their new customers and being agile at delivering new services.

So, a cloud deployment of these types of services can be quite useful or quite helpful, both in reducing costs and increasing their speed to market. So, that's why we see it happening. It's happening again with banks slowly. I don't think we see it, in terms of a big shift, but we will see it as a transition over time and indeed most of our new opportunities are coming as recurring revenue cloud-based implementation.

Anja Soderstrom -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst

Okay. Thank you. That was helpful. And then also, I wanted also to have some clarity on the e-signature as it relates to the new client on-boarding that you are launching in the second half, that's going to be an essential part for that, right?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Certainly, I think it's -- we've been looking at this opportunity for quite some time. With -- we know that it is a real-time opportunity with banks and other types of customers around the world. This ability to digitally open new accounts and onboard customers, verify their identity, meet the know-your-customer, anti-money laundering requirements. It's complicated to do it, and the success rate for many institutions in doing it has not been very high. So, it is a big opportunity because nobody -- let me not say nobody, many people, particularly young people are not interested in going into a bank branch to open new accounts. They expect to be able to do it online or on their phone.

And today, it's a mixed bag. In some places, you can do it and in some, you can't. And so we know that this is a big opportunity and we have been looking at it very hard for well over a year. That was one of the fundamental drivers for the acquisition of Dealflo to increase our capability and accelerate our speed to market to capture that opportunity and do it in a way that is really focused on the security issues around new account opening.

The trick is not so much a workflow, a web-based workflow that allows you to show screens to people and capture information. It's really about how you can use that data and other information to ensure that someone is who they say they are, and that they are a legitimate client for that bank, that institution. So, that's our approach. That's what we're focused on. And we think it's -- we think it's a pretty big deal over the next few years.

Anja Soderstrom -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst

Okay. Thank you. And then lastly, sort of M&A. You acquired Dealflo and you are still sort of working on that. Is there any other -- how do you think about M&A? Are you looking for more like technology or?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Yeah. So, I think -- yeah, I think, on Dealflo, first of all, so far so good. We have really, I would say, fully integrated that business into OneSpan. We are doing, as I've noted, we're doing a lot of work right now in integrating the Dealflo technology, not only into our e-signature but also into our Trusted Identity platform. So, there is some good progress that's going on there.

We continue to, I would say, be methodical about our M&A opportunity. We are always looking at lots of companies. We filter the companies that we look at based on our strategy, first and foremost and second of all, based on actionability and potential cost and risk and all of those. And we really consider all of those kinds of things, when we -- as we do this. So, it's not a -- it's not kind of a one-off or somebody gets a big idea is to do a deal, it's a process that we carry out on a continual basis to identify gaps in our -- in our capability that we can best fill through acquisition. So, we continue to do that in real time.

And I would say, I'm not trying to tell you there's anything imminent necessarily. But we are -- we continue to be very active and thoughtful about how to best use our balance sheet, how to best get a good return on the capital that we have available for our business. We're very focused on making sure that we use our cash and our capital for high-return opportunities.

Anja Soderstrom -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst

Okay. Thank you. That was very helpful.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Great. Thanks, Anja.

Anja Soderstrom -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Reed Motulsky of Imperial Capital. Your line is now open.

Reed Motulsky -- Imperial Capital -- Analyst

Hi. Speaking on behalf of Saliq Khan. Could you please give us some more color on OneSpan's transformation toward more of a cloud-based and services business model?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Sure. Hi, Reed. And our thoughts to Saliq, he is on a plan or something right now, but anyway, we are glad to have you. Reed, let me just try and think about kind of where to start with that. We, today, as we narrowed in our comments earlier, for the first time in 2018, a minority of our revenue came from our hardware products, the majority came from our non-hardware products which includes software, different types of services and subscription-based revenues.

So we -- the subscription based revenue is, I would say, is a smaller part of that right now. But it's a part that is growing pretty, pretty quickly, as Mark shared with you in his comments. We have -- we have built our Trusted Identity strategy and our Trusted Identity platform to be a cloud-first strategy. It doesn't mean necessarily cloud only over time, but as a cloud-first strategy because we believe that's where the highest growth is and that's where the biggest demand is going to be.

And I think most of the analyst reports that you read about the cybersecurity industry, when you look at the cloud-based deployment model, part of each different categories of cybersecurity, the cloud model is always growing faster. And as you know, it delivers -- it can deliver a more stable recurring revenue model with strong levels of profitability and all that. So that -- those are the reasons, right, that we decided to use a cloud-first model with Trusted Identity. We learned a lot, I think, about cloud from our acquisition of eSignLive a few years ago. And with the addition of Dealflo there, we are increasing the proportion of our revenue that comes from cloud and recurring revenue.

So, it is a learning process for our organization. I think to really become a cloud-first company, we're making, I think a lot of progress on that. And as we see from the release of the products that I talked about, Intelligent Adaptive Authentication, Risk Analytics. And so it's hard work, but we're making good progress and I'm -- I think it's going to be an increasing contributor to our overall revenue stream profitability as we get through 2019 and into 2020 and forward. So, don't know if I exactly answered your question but I will try again if I didn't.

Reed Motulsky -- Imperial Capital -- Analyst

Thank you. And you talked earlier about hardware reorders and some of that category is more predictable. Are those sales largely put into the maintenance support and other category when you break out revenue by major products and services?

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Mark, you want to take that one?

Mark Hoyt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Executive Vice President

Sure. Reed, we include the hardware in our products and licenses subset, not service and maintenance. There is maintenance and service that we get on our other business, of course, and that's included in the next line. But the bulk of that hardware revenue comes through the product and license subset.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

And the bulk of the maintenance is actually software maintenance.

Mark Hoyt -- Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Executive Vice President

Correct.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Right? Yeah.

Reed Motulsky -- Imperial Capital -- Analyst

All right. Thank you very much.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Thanks (ph), Reed.

All right. Thanks, Reed.

Operator

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Scott Clements, CEO, for any closing remarks.

Scott M. Clements -- Chief Executive Officer and President

Thanks very much, operator. Thanks to all of you for listening in and asking, I think some very, very good questions and I'm sure were beneficial to others who were on the call beyond just self. So, we are very pleased with the performance that we saw in 2018.

Two-years ago, we defined a three-year plan to transform our company and through two years of that three-year plan, I believe we have delivered on what we said we are going to do. And we're excited for 2019 and looking forward to another year of progress and contribution that really creates a shareholder value value for our shareholders, and those who are participating in the story of this company through holding our shares.

Thanks, everybody. Have a good rest of your day.

Clement made his first post to Instagram Wednesday since he resigned as a Conservative MP in November.

Wednesday’s post includes a picture of him standing in the new House of Commons with a statement thanking his followers for getting him through the “dark valley” after the scandal broke.

In November Clement admitted he shared explicit images online with someone he believed to be a consenting female adult but who then turned around and demanded he pay 50,000 euros to prevent the images from going public.

He initially claimed it was a one-time lapse in judgement but when it became clear it wasn’t, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asked him to resign from the party caucus.

Clement now sits as an independent and says he is getting back to his duties as the MP for Parry Sound-Muskoka.

“I had a severe personal crisis and it manifested itself in the irrational behaviour that became apparent and for which I take full responsibility,” Clement says on Instagram.

He also says he was “getting the counselling I needed and working on my family life” during his time away from office.

Earlier this year, two men in the Ivory Coast were arrested and charged with trying to blackmail Clement.

The RCMP is continuing to work with the Ivory Coast’s cyber crimes unit.

Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call

, 8:00 a.m. ET

Operator

Good morning. My name is Daisy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 20th, 2019.

Your speakers for today are Scott Gammill, Tom Fanning and Drew Evans. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.

Scott Gammill -- Investor Relations Director

Thank you, Daisy. Good morning and welcome to Southern Company's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer.

Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.

At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. As we report our 2018 results and look ahead to 2019 and beyond, our focus remains on investing in our premier state-regulated utilities and providing outstanding risk-adjusted returns for investors.

2018 was a year of incredible accomplishments for Southern Company. We entered the year with a great deal of uncertainty regarding corporate tax reform and our own first full year as general contractor at Vogtle 3 and 4. First regarding tax reform, we reached timely innovative and constructive outcomes with regulators in multiple jurisdictions, and as a result, are in the process of delivering approximately $1.8 billion of benefits to customers, while preserving our credit quality and improving earnings per share.

At Vogtle Units 3 and 4, we completed our first full year as general contractor. In July, we revised the estimated cost to complete and we recalibrated site production expectations with a sitewide reset. Since then, we have achieved a trajectory of staffing and productive hours worked per week that is ahead of what we targeted on our last earnings call. We continue to have a lot of work ahead of us to sustain this performance, but we are pleased with our progress and are confident that we can meet the schedule approved by our regulators. I'll provide more details on Vogtle 3 and 4, shortly.

We are executing our business model in a world-class manner. Our modernization initiatives have improved customer service and resilience of our system. Through aggressive cost management, we expect to continue to invest in our state-regulated franchise, while keeping rates low, sustaining our outstanding operational performance, and delivering strong financial performance.

In 2018, we successfully completed strategic value accretive transactions totaling over $11 billion, efficiently sourcing equity to strengthen our balance sheet. Notably, we closed on the sale of Gulf Power Company on January 1st of 2019. And we expect to close on the sale of Southern Power's Mankato facility this summer. Our decisive actions substantially reduced our projected equity needs, removed significant risk from financing plans and positioned the Company for future growth.

Customers are at the center of everything we do and we have continued our long-standing track record of providing some of the best customer service in the business. For example, Georgia Power, was the highest-rated utility for both residential and business customer satisfaction by JD Power in the South region in 2018, and Nicor Gas was rated among the most trusted utility brands by residential customers.

Story continues

Let's turn now to an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Throughout 2018, progress at the site was significant. We achieved our major 2018 construction milestones for the project. Overall, including engineering, procurement, and the initial test plan, the project is approximately 74% complete. During the past three months, several significant milestones were achieved. Unit 3 milestones included: setting the first reactor coolant pump; placement of the third and final containment ring; and setting the main control room roof.

At Unit 4, we set the pressurizer and second steam generator inside the containment vessel. Additionally, since our third quarter earnings call, the remaining two AP1000 units in China, Sandman 2 and Haiyang 2 achieved commercial operation. Lessons learned from China will continue to benefit our project .

On our third quarter call, we detailed solid productivity improvement, and I'm pleased to report today that positive momentum at that site continues. We've successfully added approximately 700 new skilled craft resources, attracting pipe fitters and electricians to the site. We told you in November that we were targeting to ramp up to 140,000 productive hours worked per week by March. So far, for the month of February, we have averaged 141,000 earned hours per week. In fact, last week, we achieved a 146,000 hours with a CPI of 1.08. We are focused on sustaining this progress throughout 2019 and into spring of 2020.

As we have discussed previously, we continue to manage construction on a more aggressive schedule in order to preserve margin to the regulatory approved dates. For reference, we currently estimate that we need to sustain approximately 110,000 weekly earned hours in order to meet the November '21 and November 2022 regulatory approved schedule.

We are currently in the midst of rebaselining our work for Vogtle Units 3 and 4. At a high level, this effort involves a verification of estimates for remaining commodity quantities, hours to install those quantities, staffing trends, testing and system turnover requirements and achievable craft labor production. This rebaselining effort will refine the weekly work plan for the remainder of the project. Our over arching objective in the rebaselining effort is to maintain the aggressive work plan at the site, allowing us to preserve as much margin in our schedule as possible to the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory approved in service dates.

While it's important to acknowledge that this rebaselining effort is not complete, we continue to expect that the project schedule and capital cost forecast will be consistent with our prior estimates, and based on early indications, we also expect a reduction in the amount of remaining productive hours needed to complete the project. We expect to conclude the rebaseline effort prior to our first quarter call and Georgia Power will file a report with the Georgia PSC reflecting the results no later than May 15. The Public Service Commission staff will then have until July 31st to file their observations on the outcome of the rebaseline process with the Commission.

In the appendix of our slide deck for this call, we've provided the most recent schedule performance index, cost performance index and percent complete metrics. While we continue to believe that these measures are the best indicators of progress at the site, please note that the charts provided for the schedule performance index and percent complete metrics, do not reflect the ongoing rebaselining effort and we believe it is likely that the most recent results shown on those charts are not representative of the current status of the project. We will provide an update on the results of the rebaselining effort, including an update on these key measures on our first quarter earnings call.

On the regulatory front, the Georgia Public Service Commission voted yesterday to approve a stipulation between the PSC staff and Georgia Power that settled all issues in VCM 19, which included combining the filing of VCM 20 and 21 in August of 2019 at the request of the PSC staff. Combining the filings recognizes the ongoing rebaselining effort and is designed to accommodate an unusually busy regulatory calendar in Georgia, which includes Georgia Power's triennial integrated resource plan filing and rate case filings for Georgia Power and Atlanta Gas Light. This action is not without precedent. Some of you may remember that in 2013, we made a similar determination with the PSC staff to combine VCMs 9 and 10 during Georgia Power's 2013 rate case.

I'll turn the call over now to Drew for a financial and economic overview.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, adjusted results for the quarter and the full year exceeded our expectation. Due to the positive impact of weather and cost control for the full year, the related customer refund accruals occurred in the fourth quarter, so comparison of year-over-year adjusted fourth quarter earnings results is not particularly informative and I'll focus on the full year.

For the full year, on an adjusted basis, Southern Company earned $3.13 billion, or $3.07 per share in 2018, compared to $3.02 billion, or $3.02 a share for 2017. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in this morning's release and earnings package. Last year, as a result of the impacts of tax reform in our business, we reset the starting point of our expected long-term EPS growth trajectory to $2.87 per share. Our adjusted 2018 results of $3.07 per share were approximately 7% above the mid-point of our original guidance range.

This result was also above our updated guidance range disclosed on the second quarter call, which was increased due to performance through mid-year and the Florida asset transactions. The major drivers versus 2017 were the positive effects of constructive regulatory outcomes and weather at our state regulated utilities, somewhat offset by increased depreciation and amortization, interest expense and share issuance.

Importantly, we have also been successful in holding our non-fuel O&M expense flat at our state-regulated electric utilities year-over-year as we continue to create and seek out operational efficiencies.

Looking at some of the operational highlights, our generation system load was 4% higher in 2018 compared to 2017, representing our second highest load on record. The increase was primarily due to extreme cold temperatures in January and warmer than normal temperatures in September. We also experienced record gas burn and gas generation in 2018, due to higher loads throughout the year and lower gas prices in the second and third quarters.

For 2018, our energy supply mix was comprised of 47% natural gas, 27% coal, 15% nuclear and 11% renewables. Notably, generation from coal plants continue to trend downward, which is in line with our stated carbon reduction objectives.

Moving now to an economic review of the year, we continue to see robust net income -- net-in migration, particularly in the Southeast. Across our regulated utilities, we added 41,000 new residential electric customers and 32,000 new residential gas meters during 2018. Our combined business territories continue to see slightly faster population growth than the rest of the nation, and in particular, Atlanta is currently the fourth fastest growing metro area in the United States.

Retail electric sales growth for the year was approximately 1% on a weather-normalized basis, principally driven by this customer growth, with a minimal decline in customer usage. As we forecast future years, we anticipate the customer growth trend to continue, but we also expect a slight annual decline in customer usage. When looking at these two factors combined, our forecast for retail electric sales growth remains flat to 1%. While we achieved growth at the top end of this range in 2018, our guidance remains flat to 1% for 2019 for sales.

The commercial customer class continues to grow. However, energy efficiency, eCommerce and other changes in business models are challenging overall demand growth. While there were signs of slowing momentum in the fourth quarter in selected industrial segments, industrial sales were strong for the year in 2018, with seven of our Top 10 industrial segments posting year-over-year growth.

Overall total employment growth remains strong in our service territories. Alabama and Georgia both outpaced the national average, with employment growth of 2.2% and 2.5%, respectively. And developers continue to select sites in the Southeast for large-scale economic development projects.

Before I turn the call back to Tom, I'd like to discuss our 2019 EPS guidance range and our long-term outlook. Our 2019 EPS guidance range is $2.98 per share to $3.10 per share. The $3.04 per share mid-point represents growth of approximately 6% from $2.87 per share, the midpoint of our original 2018 guidance range.

In the first quarter of 2019, we estimate that we will earn $0.70 per share, excluding a preliminary gain on the sale of Gulf Power currently estimated to be $1.28 per share, as well as any other adjustments in that period. Our expected long-term EPS growth rate remains 4% to 6%, using the same base of $2.87 per share that we established a year ago. This growth rate is driven by strong fundamentals across our state-regulated electric and gas utilities, and a continued focus on cost control. We expect our state regulated utilities to comprise over 90% of total projected earnings through the five-year horizon.

Our long-term outlook continues to be driven by capital investment in our state-regulated businesses. Our investment plan of $38 billion includes a projected rate base growth at our regulated utilities of approximately 6%. This updated plan reflects a $3.7 billion increase over last year's forecast for 2019 through 2022, excluding the previously disclosed Vogtle cost increase.

The main drivers of the increase are significant incremental state-regulated utility investments primarily related to the closure of ash ponds or environmental spend in Georgia and Alabama as we continue initiatives to modernize and increase the resilience of our electric generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure.

For Southern Power, the cumulative five-year investment plan of $900 million is comprised entirely of previously announced projects and maintenance capital for the existing generation fleet. We expect to remain opportunistic with regard to growth at Southern Power, seeking to deploy new capital for projects that meet our stringent risk and hurdle rate objectives, but any incremental growth opportunities at Southern Power are expected to enhance the long-term financial plan and be largely self-funded.

We currently forecast the total equity need of $2.5 billion to $3 billion over the next five years. We have the capacity to fulfill most or all of our projected equity needs through our robust internal equity plans. However, we will continue to preserve all options and evaluate other potential equity alternatives. We have demonstrated discipline and agility in seeking the most efficient sources of equity in the past. 2018 could not be more indicative of this, and we will remain equally thoughtful and investor focused as we fulfill our future equity needs.

Financial integrity and strong credit metrics provide significant benefit to customers and investors, and it has always been a top priority for us. We've taken significant steps over the past year to deleverage our balance sheet, and in 2019, we expect to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our credit metrics.

Another long-standing priority for Southern Company is providing a regular, predictable and sustainable return to shareholders through our dividend. We have an outstanding track record of dividend payments and growth. Over a 71-year period, dating back to 1948, we have paid 285 consecutive quarterly dividends that have been equal to or greater than the prior quarters. While future dividend policy is the purview of the Board of Directors, we are proud of this track record and we believe our financial outlook continues to support our objectives of growing the dividend $0.08 per year.

I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Drew. In closing, throughout 2018, we continued to execute across all our businesses, achieving outstanding results. The foundation of our business remains strong. Our customer-focused business model, with an emphasis on outstanding reliability, best-in-class customer service and rates well below the national average, continues to be the cornerstone of delivering value to customers and shareholders.

Our credit profiles are significantly improved, we continue to project 4% to 6% long-term growth in our business and our employees across the franchise continue to deliver outstanding service to customers and the communities that we are privileged to serve.

2019 will be an extraordinarily important year for Southern Company, with particular focus on Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and investment in our state-regulated businesses. We have a long track record of successfully executing on our business model and believe we are poised for continued success in the months and years ahead.

We appreciate your continued interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take your questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning, Greg.

Greg Gordon -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

Hey. Good morning. Thank you for the time, just numbers look great, near-term outlook looks great. I just wanted to make sure I understand precisely the message you're trying to deliver on Vogtle today. It was just a tad confusing.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Okay.

Greg Gordon -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

If I heard you correctly, you said, you were at 146,000 -- productivity of 146,000 recently, you're at 140,000 today. The target was to be at 140,000 by March and that if you can maintain at least 110,000, you believe you can deliver the regulatory in-service date in November on the current cost schedule, is that correct?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. In general, we were --

Greg Gordon -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

Because the reason I'm asking, sorry --

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Go ahead.

Greg Gordon -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

The reason I'm asking is, because you then said you're now rebaselining and I think -- but the rebaselining, if my understanding is correct, is just delivering a schedule to the regulator that now reflects that aspiration?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

It's all of that. Yes, it's -- every so often. Say, 18 months or so, we'll take a look at the schedule and based on everything -- we have to kind of use schedule in discrete periods, right. We obviously look every week to optimize workflows and process, learnings from China as they have now achieved start-up, all of that goes into our thinking about, what the implications are for the work performed for the remaining construction period of the plant. All of that input goes into what we call rebaselining. And the outputs we believe -- now, it's not gone yet, got to stress this to everybody, but everything that we see right now, as of today, says, cost and schedule are preserved and we expect to have to spend less hours to complete the project than what is currently in our budgets. Okay.

And if I just gave a little more refinement there, what we know today, what we believe today is at least a reduction in hours of around 600,000 hours. Now, there may be more, we'll see what happens, we will deliver that when it becomes public as we conclude the rebaselining effort. So, in general, what we said in October was, we needed to hit 140,000 by March. We've hit 140,000 in February. Last week, we hit 146,000. So we're very happy with the productivity and the staffing resources necessary to deliver productive hours per week. So good track. The challenge for us, can we sustain that from February of '19 to February of '20. You should expect that those numbers may bounce around during that period of time, but if we can average 140,000, we believe right now and this is before baselining is complete, that we'll be able to hit our more aggressive schedules.

Recall, the schedule that we are focusing on, paramount, is November '21, November '22 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. It remains the case that we are working on site to April schedules. The idea there is to deliver more margin to the regulatory approved schedules by the Georgia Public Service Commission. Okay. And we try to give you reference points. And let me just make sure we get those clear. On productive hours worked per week, we think if we average 110,000 hours per week, we could hit November schedules. Hitting anything better than that improves our likelihood of gaining margin to November. That's why we're targeting 140,000 or even above for this remainder of the period, February '19, February of '20. These numbers, we believe, are consistent with the April schedule that we have in place. But again, we got to finish rebaselining, there's a lot that goes on.

Even theoretically you could reduce hours and have a prolonged schedule maybe a week, two weeks, three weeks, a month, something like that. It just depends on a whole lot of sequencing that goes on, but the point is, if we do better than 110,000, we are gaining margin to November. We're targeting 140,000, and we're doing a little better than that right now.

One other point, these charts in the back, we had an argument internally about providing you those charts. That's OK. We fight all the time here.The charts are based on the old schedule, they do not include the new rebaselining and everything else. And let me just give you the reference point there. On CPI, if we can beat -- I think, it's 1.4 -- CPI is 1.4, then we will do better than our budget that we're projecting for the November in-service dates. And schedule, if we can beat 1.3, we will do better than the November schedule. That's how we're evaluating those charts. Those are the reference points.

Now, I'm sorry Greg, I went into a little bit detail, maybe more than you wanted, but I want to be very clear about where we are.

Greg Gordon -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

No. That's exactly -- Tom, that's exactly what I was asking. So, right now, you're creating margin against the November schedule. You will sort of quantify exactly what the current schedule is in the rebaselining process that you're going to submit to the Commission, and then as long as you can keep on track, you're continuing to create a little bit of above 110,000, you continue to create a little bit of headroom to the November in-service date. I think that's clear. I guess the one final question, then I'll jump to the back. You said you might be able to do it in fewer hours, does fewer hours mean actually a lower cost? I mean is it really this times hour or are there other factors involved?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. There's other factors, the amount of commodities involved, and piping wire, stuff like that, certainly the cost of the units employed. I think we suggested -- there was all this conversation in the past about we need people from Canada and everything else and I still think that would be a good thing to have, what we did on the site was actually increase wages for electricians and pipe fitters to essentially top decile. Now, we were able to absorb those costs in our own variance without touching contingency, but there will be issues along the way that really deal with unit cost. Hours certainly matter and all of the things being equal, you have less hours, you have less cost, you have less schedule, but we can't say that with certainty until rebaselining is complete. So let us finish the work and we'll tell everybody what the results are once it's complete.

Greg Gordon -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

Thank you, Tom.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Hey, Julien.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Hey, good morning. Can you hear me?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes, sir. Hear you fine.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Excellent. So perhaps following up on Greg's question on Vogtle, if you don't mind. You talk about a reduction in the amount of remaining productive hours. Can you elaborate a little bit more? You may have already touched on this just a tad in the last question, but I want to hit that very specifically here. What is improving in terms of the underlying construction site from a productivity perspective?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So, if you recall, one of the big issues we talked about -- we kind of stated, we need more people, and once we get the people on the site, we got to get them productive. And I think, we've talked in the past about some guys, some -- an electrician walks on the site, so we got a new person, but it takes him a while to get productive. We estimate that there is a little bit of friction, may take two weeks or so to get the person working at near best capability. So there is this issue of -- what do we get about 75 people per week, getting them up to speed, and so you'll see some friction in the -- especially the CPI metric. But as you get staffing where you need it and everybody starts to become productive, CPI should start to go down, and in fact, that's exactly what we're seeing on the site. So it's a function of getting people, getting them productive and then working better.

The other factor that has been important here is not just attracting, but retaining people. And not only retaining, but also less absenteeism and a variety of other things. All of our compensation practices right now, incent people to stay, to have good attendance and to be productive. And I must say, we've had a terrific partnership with Bechtel. I want to make sure I call out my friend Brendan Bechtel and Jack Futcher and Barbara and the whole team there at Vogtle 3 and 4. We work with them day in and day out. And we continue to surprise ourselves, I think, with more productivity at the site. It goes to material management practices, it goes to work packages, just real kind of meat and potatoes, blocking and tackling kind of stuff. We continue to find ways to improve.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Julien I think another --

Julien Dumoulin-Smith -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Please.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Another way for you maybe to think about this is that rebaselining is an effort to understand the number of hours that it takes to complete each of the tasks that are required for completion of the facility. And so, efficiency is an important measure, but after a year or so of operation, just really redefining what each individual task will take in terms of total hours that way we're not tracking against the curve that's incomplete.

And everybody should know, Julien, we know it well, there is still a long way to go. Building margin is just smart, you just don't know what's going to happen in the future, we're showing a really good report today. It's important for us to continue to build the margin, that just insulates us against risk in the future.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

And just to reconcile this, the hiring ramp, I know you're already at these 140,000 plus hours a week. How do you think about that today, given the 700? You just mentioned a second ago about you would like to see potentially Canadian hires, but implied that it wasn't necessary at this point just, just where are we here?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

The Canada comment was just another arrow in the quiver should something else happen. We still have to go through outage season, will people stay with us, a variety of all, but that's just belt suspenders. We feel like everything we are doing right now is getting us the people we need, and in fact, what I would say is, pipe fitters, we're pretty well where we need to be. We do need a few more electricians down the road, but we are where we need to be right now and we'll assess hitting the market for more people later.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Got it. It's composition of people rather than a hiring ramp at this point?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. We're actually very happy with where we are, and in fact, we have a backlog right now. So what does that mean? People see what's happening at the site. I think, word is spreading quickly. We've had great cooperation, Sean McGarvey, US Building Trades, they see this as a quality worksite, a safe worksite. They can count on the hours and so people are really attracted to come here now. So I think what we want to do is continue to see that. We've had more applications come in than we can process or want to process on the site. Like I said, we could process maybe 150 people on the site, but we couldn't make them productive. That would just be a cost measure, our kind of target has been around 75 people per week. And so we have a backlog right now. We feel good about staffing, we feel good about making them productive. And the numbers that we show so far reflect that.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Hi, Jonathan.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

Good morning, guys. I appreciate the extra information on the slides that you're going to update with the rebaselining. And the one you didn't talk about was that percent complete in your answer to Greg, Tom. And I was just curious, when you look at those December and January numbers, they seem to be a long way short even though you are exceeding your current target zone on hours worked. And should we expect that that gap will effectively be eliminated once you rebaseline? So, is that the right way to kind of think about how that's going to change or anything you could say to that picture?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

That graph, I think is based on the aggressive schedule and it's based on an April target. Okay. And it's on the old data. It's on the old kind of hours worked and everything else. So my sense is, there's really two pieces of information you don't see on that: one is, how does that compare to November; two is, it doesn't include the benefits of rebaselining.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

Okay. Those sounds like putting them out together, it's safe to assume next time you show it to us, that gap between the blue and the green bars ought to be a lot smaller?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. And Jonathan let me just give you that. We chatted about that just before the call what that would look like. Now, this is highly imperfect. I'm giving you what we believe. We think at kind of this 140,000 plus level, we're going to be completing about 2% per month and that will essentially converge these two lines, but we need to show you that.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

Perfect.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

We had a real debate about whether to show this or not. We said we would show it to you, that's why we put all these disclaimers up her.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

Well, having that answer, to explain it was very helpful.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

You bet.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

Thank you for that. And then just one other, when we look back to some guidance, look back to how you showed your guidance last year, you had this 4% to 6% cone and the numbers coming in at the high-end in 2019, including Vogtle, which you've obviously now affirmed, and then, drifting into the middle in '2, and toward the lower end in '21. I'm just curious, is that still the right kind of trajectory to be thinking about, or is that old presentation now redundant?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Jonathan, I think that's still fair. You have to remember that what will actually be reported is still a function of the ROEs that are allowed during the construction period for Vogtle. And so that capital deployment does put a little bit of pressure on what would have been reported normally. Tom and I've talked a lot about this. I think, absent Vogtle, we're quite comfortable with our strength within that cone of earnings.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

We'd be at the top end of the range.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

We'd be at the top end, but we are comfortable that we can stay within it even with the ROE depression that we get from Vogtle deployment.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

And remember, Vogtle 3 and 4. I think, is 8% of our earnings, somewhere around there?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

And just remember, during that period, especially '20 and '21, we're in that period where we have the lower ROEs associated with incremental expenditures. But recall, once we clear '21 and '22, once you get these units in, the trajectory really accelerates. It looks like an 8% kind of number out there from say '20 to '22, or '21 to '23. So it has a little bit of a shape and it shouldn't surprise anybody. You all have known about the regulatory settlement with Georgia for some time. I'm happy that if you look at our range this year, it shows that the top side, 8% over 287 (ph). And the bottom side is anchored in the bottom of our 4% growth rate.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

The most significant difference probably year-over-year is that we really are focusing our efforts on this $38 billion worth of investment into regulated enterprise. We continue to identify projects, whether environmental or modernization, and transmission and distribution. We're still exploring opportunity around migration of the generating fleet to a less carbon intensive mode. And so I think that these will be a series of updates as we explore these options through '20 and '21, but this is our single best projection of our future, I think, today.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. And one more just point of interest, the Georgia Commission has always been innovative and creative. For the first time in our IRP, we introduced a section called Resilience, and it really talks about thinking differently about the electric system. In other words, integrating in concepts of resilience beyond transmission lines and generating plants to gas pipelines and what are all the implications of storage and how can we think differently about the make, move and sell concept in terms of improving the reliability and ultimately the resilience to customers. These are really important concepts.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

Great. And just what one high scheming item, did you end up sharing with customers in Georgia in 2018?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. In fact, and Drew probably knows better than I do, but I said on TV this morning, we shared -- I mean we gave benefits to customers this year of around $2 billion, $1.8 billion from tax reform. They got about two-thirds of the benefit. And then another $200 million or so, perhaps more, $209 million is what people are showing me right now, in terms of sharing.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

You got it. And equally weighted across Alabama and Georgia?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

Or closely weighted.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

We love to have the regulatory mechanisms. If the Company does well, customers do well.

Jonathan Arnold -- Deutsche Bank Securities -- Analyst

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Angie, how are you?

Angie Storozynski -- Macquarie -- Analyst

Great. Thank you. So no questions about Vogtle from me for a change. So, we saw the IRP filing from Georgia Power. We're still waiting to see what the Alabama Power files. And given the changes in the sharing mechanism for any over earning, I was just wondering, I mean, we all still expect this earnings pivot during construction at Vogtle, but is there a way to minimize that earnings slowdown from Alabama Power?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

From Alabama Power?

Angie Storozynski -- Macquarie -- Analyst

Meaning like just have some strength in Alabama Power earnings in order to offset the temporary weakness in earnings at Vogtle?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

(inaudible) you're saying. Look, yes, we talk a lot about -- I think our plan, we call it optionality, we've got lots of singles we can hit here, lay aside any home runs, lots of little singles we can hit along the way, that we think we can optimize plants, but particularly in '21, is kind of the year we're focused on. We certainly have the ability to do that.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

I think ascribing it to Alabama perhaps is a little bit unfair. We'll look at a variety of options across unregulated complex in total, Alabama's going to seek to do what's in the best interest of their customers at all times related to rate and return.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Thank you, Drew. That clarification is exactly right. And in fact, when we think about -- and we haven't talked about it yet, but this investor friendly asset sales and all the stuff, we were very active last year. We have a lot more opportunity to do things here. I would view it more as pruning. We just announced Mankato and we expect to close that I guess by June or so. There's more of that to do, whether it's Southern Power, PowerSecure, things like that, we'll see.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Perfect example is hyper investment in unregulated subsidiary generally leads to some dilution in the near term. We can produce a better earnings profile out of that business in the short term by utilizing its own assets to fund its development. And as Tom said, maybe prune back a little bit and things that are a little less strategic or find opportunities for people have a different view of value than we do.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

And we certainly have done that in '18. And one more comment, boy, we have a great appetite within our operating companies, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, the Gas business to where without forcing anything, we're not backing in the numbers, these are things that we can identify, whether it's ash ponds or resilience in the transmission system, get very reasonable on things that we should do for the benefit of customers. The other trade we've made, you've heard about modernization, reducing O&M significantly. Georgia has done a heck of a lot of that. Mississippi, just give you an example, have reduced over the years personnel at that company from 1,500 to now about a 1,000 -- little over 1,000. So we're really taking money out of the business. We are creating headroom to invest in matters of resilience and technology to improve customer service. Georgia Power withdrew from a lot of its local offices -- bill paying offices and yet increased customer touch through technology by four times. We have lots of opportunity to do better.

Angie Storozynski -- Macquarie -- Analyst

Okay. And just one other question, so your large cap peers seem to be pursuing a lots of growth from commercial renewables. I know that you have some growth embedded in your plans for Southern Power? But how do you see this, is this just more as a way to basically give you some flexibility around that 4% to 6% earnings growth or would you think that commercial renewables are still delivering attractive returns and as such should be pursued?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Angie, that's terrific point to raise, and we've debated about how to talk about this. Let me just tell you what our point of view is and let the other companies speak for themselves. We find -- especially in the current environment, we find that solar and wind margins are shrinking pretty dramatically. And we will still be active. I guess we have a placeholder in our financial plan of something like $500 million a year for this stuff. We don't expect to spend it. We expect more to be in the $200 million range and that's really a function of the market. You recall when the market was hot, we played really hard.

On the other hand, we have a tremendous appetite inside our franchise businesses to spend more CapEx. What you're seeing with us is an intentional reallocation of CapEx away from those markets to our franchise markets. And it really is a function of need and weighted average cost of capital and what we expect the market will deliver.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

We're certainly not turning away from the concept of renewables. In fact, Georgia Power included over 1,000 mega watts of renewables within their most recent IRP. And so, I think you might see the form of that investment change a little bit, but as Tom said, as we look at things in the unregulated space, it's not only the margins that have declined, but perhaps the duration of contract and the credit quality of counter party. It simply falls through some of our return expectations. And so we just have to evaluate these things on a case-by-case basis and make sure they're accretive to shareholder value.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Let me -- he made such a good point, so let me underline it. Value is a function of risk and return. Returns are down in that market in our opinion, risk is up because the duration of the contract available is down, we don't find that all that attractive.

Angie Storozynski -- Macquarie -- Analyst

Great. Thank you very much.

Praful Mehta -- Citigroup -- Analyst

Good, how are you?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Super.

Praful Mehta -- Citigroup -- Analyst

Well, thank you for taking the question. I guess going back to Vogtle, if you don't mind. Great progress so far and great to see that you're tracking to your faster internal schedule. I guess, just wanted to understand a little bit on the testing phase. I know that, that will start at some point in terms of testing all the equipment. How would you see that and do you see any uncertainty being added to your schedule as you get to that testing phase?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Man, you're right on the money. This is the next big thing to talk about. So coming out the July reset and then into the October earnings call or November earnings call, whenever it was, setting the trajectory, and getting people on-site and getting them productive was the most important thing we could do. We already have been involved in some turnover from construction to start up. So that actually has been ongoing. None of those systems that in the past have been all that critical in terms of critical path to schedule. Frankly, we haven't done as well as we would like to do on those early efforts, but we are now laser focused on what it's going to take in order to move out of construction phase in the start-up phase.

Let me just tell you, if we stay on this April schedule, conceivably, you could have fuel load as early as for Units 3, October of 2020, that's 18 months away. So we are right now in a big-time mode on focusing, taking in systems, turning them over to the start-up folks and that's not only the construction and operation, but the paperwork and all the stuff we have in place to get the i-tags (ph) complete to go to high fuel load. We have integrated teams in place, we have some of the best people around the United States, out own people, Bechtel, and we're very happy with kind of where we are right now.

You should know also, this is an area of great learning from China. We have seen what they've done at Sandman and Haiyang. We've taken best practices, and in fact, we are thinking -- even in the part of the rebate lining is, rethinking the schedule and sequence of the major events in the schedule to give us more certainty on the turnover package issue. This will be the next big thing to talk about. And we have talked internally about some graphics and some other ways to give you some transparency as to how this is going. Right now, we want to make sure we've got people, got them productive. The next thing will be our progress on the question you raised.

Praful Mehta -- Citigroup -- Analyst

Got you.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

And man, let me just add two more things. One way to talk about this is, just what are the big kind of systems that you should watch: one is, initial Energy Station, we think that's going to happen in the second quarter; and then the integrated flush of the system. This is essentially where you take water and move it through the pipes, you clean out the pipes, and you get ready to operate. That's kind of the integrated flush, third quarter. And that's one way to talk about, but you got imagine there is lot of systems that go -- underlie all these big issues. If we hit these big issues on time, we should hit the little issues on time. So, we're going to work hard to find a way to communicate this with you.

Praful Mehta -- Citigroup -- Analyst

Got it. And that is super helpful. So as you think about the testing phase, building in some cushion through the current phase as you enter testing is probably what you're trying to track for given there is a little bit of uncertainty at least in terms of how that testing would go, is that fair?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Hey, let me add one more thing that is just important. I know people love to complain about government and everything else, I would argue that this administration has been very helpful. Congress has been very helpful. In fact, even the past administrator was helpful on building Vogtle. The NRC is a very tough regulator. They are very exacting and requiring, as they should be, and we work well with them. One of the things that when we got the AP1000 technology approved, if you remember, way back then by the NRC, there was a lot of first of a kind issues with that technology. Now, with Sandman and Haiyang operating, we were able to work with the NRC to eliminate what had been required as first of a kind test issues. So, those issues have been eliminated or lessened and that has added about three weeks to our margin. So we're very happy to continue to work with the NRC to look for innovative, creative ways to help achieve the schedules we have in place.

Praful Mehta -- Citigroup -- Analyst

As usual very comprehensive answer So, really appreciate that.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

You bet.

Praful Mehta -- Citigroup -- Analyst

I guess just quickly moving onto the finance side. Just to quickly test, on the equity, you've mentioned $2.5 billion to $3 billion over five years. Was there any clarification around strategic asset sales or other M&A transactions as a part of that? I wasn't clear on that point. So just wanted to clarify. Could that equity number come down as you look at more M&A transactions?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

First, I think a simple answer to your question is, absolutely, it could. What we wanted to demonstrate though is that we can meet the requirements of the plan that we've laid out for ourselves just using the internal plans at our disposal. And so, it's basically dividend reinvestment in any option exercise that occurs. I think '18 has been very indicative of the approach that we'll take, but I would say the majors have been done or are in process for 2019. We're always looking to prune and make sure that there are opportunities to kind of refocus smaller business lines and we're going to be as opportunistic around those things as we possibly can this year.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

And if I could just beat some good news accomplishment. I think, we bought well and we sold well. I think we demonstrate terrific discipline in that. I think the AGL acquisition was a terrific one for shareholders. I think SONAT was a terrific one for shareholders. When you think about what we were able to do in '18, we sold our a gas business in New Jersey and a few other places for 37 times earnings. The highest multiple ever paid for a gas business. The Florida gas business we sold was I think tied -- right at tied for the second highest multiple ever paid. Gulf was the highest multiple paid in our knowledge for any electric company.

When you think about just other ways to dimension that, we were carrying assets at the time at $45 a share and sold them for $90 bucks a share. We sold 5% of our earnings for 12% of our market cap. So, it wasn't just that we were raising money. We were historically raising money with valuations that people hadn't seen before. These were all very accretive, very friendly to shareholders.

Praful Mehta -- Citigroup -- Analyst

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Hi, Michael.

Michael Weinstein -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Hi. Good morning. On rate-base growth versus earnings growth, it looks like the -- especially on the electric side, it looks like the electric rate base growth profile is a little higher, about 1% higher and that's taking out Gulf Power and I guess replacing it with more ash pond CapEx. I'm wondering if that's going up and it looks like the incremental equity is a little bit less than half of the incremental CapEx overall. All those things would seem to indicate higher guidance growth rate going forward, but the growth rate is basically the same growth rate off that 2018 mid-point. Is that -- maybe just talk about what is it about the translation from rate base growth to earnings growth that's keeping the earnings growth about the same?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

So, this is a little like the question, I think, we took earlier and really relates to the shape of our -- or the path of our growth through that 4% to 6% earnings expectation. We know that we're going to have pressure related to Vogtle, with construction investment over the next three-year period, and so it doesn't translate as you see it here, 6% growth in state-regulated -- or 6% growth in electric utility to a full 6% growth at the Corporation. I don't know that we'd be particularly doing ourselves a benefit by moving our growth ranges around to the time when we are really focused on execution on Vogtle, but we'll kind of revisit that idea when we are substantially complete there.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

But even with Vogtle, we're within the 4% to 6% count. And if you look at the end, like I suggested before, the shape, for whatever flatter kind of performance you will get through '21, it really takes off once you start clearing 3 and 4. And it looks more like 8% growth at that point.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

And Michael, you are correct, the vast majority of the change here relates to environmental CapEx and also some modernization of the T&D infrastructure over that period. But our change is little over $4 billion or kind of in that proximity and really is almost entirely in regulated enterprises.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. And I just want to add, these aren't made up numbers. They're not like what do we need to fill a hole and let's create CapEx to do that. These are projects that we know about, they are sensible and they help customers.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Identified and largely filed.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes.

Michael Weinstein -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

No. I appreciate your comment also about I guess the increased competitiveness on the non-regulated renewables side. I'm also noticing that the amount of CapEx that's going into the gas pipelines segment declines over time. And I'm just wondering if that is also an area that you might be thinking about divesting at some point?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Divesting, it's an interesting question. I think we will continue to look at opportunity within the midstream. We really enjoy the investment there that we have in SONAT, Dalton, the construction that was completed a year and a half ago that's brought tremendous benefit I think to the customers of Georgia. The same can be said of other two constructions, although they are much smaller in terms of relative contribution to the -- particularly the first one that I mentioned, but divestiture, I don't know, I think as these things get to commercial operation, we'll just have to assess whether they're better held by us or by others.

Yes. And the old joke around here is, strategic means the numbers don't work. SONAT is strategic and the numbers work. It's a wonderful annuity. That's another one, where we bought well, I think. And as you mentioned, Dalton, is perfect for our system. There's high synergy with those assets.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

The primary goal is to bring low cost gas into our service territories and to the extent that we can continue to do that, SONAT certainly does into the Southeast for both the gas and electric businesses. ACP or PennEast Pipeline into Illinois, anything that's in service of customer, probably fits in our portfolio.

Michael Weinstein -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

And just one final question about PowerSecure. So I mean that was a relatively recent purchase. And I guess you're thinking about it being a nonstrategic asset at this point, does that mean you are --

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

No. Hope I didn't communicate that, PowerSecure, we think is a really important thing. In fact, somebody -- I think it was Angie asked before about generation in commercial and industrial realm. In fact, that's what we've seen. The last three win deals we've done have been General Mills, General Motors and a cruise line. Here's the point, we see the age of big iron making, moving and selling at scale, central station power units, as potentially slowing down and dissipating over time, won't go away. And I can't tell you the timeframe in which this is happening, but I think it's happening to some degree now.

And then what we see in its place is something we refer to as distributed infrastructure. So now think about make, move and sell on the customer premises. And so we think that a certain combination of Southern Power as it applies to Angie's question, the commercial and industrial segment, along with the strategic portion of PowerSecure really do matter. And also we are finding in the market elements of Sequent, really include Sequent in our guidance and all that stuff. That is a subsidiary that's part of the gas infrastructure. Their major purpose in life beyond managing the pipeline investments we have, like SONAT< is to make sure that the pipelines are full of gas, and that we have efficient operation. Customers are finding now that if we can handle their fuel management issues, that synergy along with distributed infrastructure has great appeal and may fill up this gap that's developing on what we call distributed infrastructure. There's a whole lot about PowerSecure that is a very strategic. There are elements perhaps that may not be. And we'll figure that out over time.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

You have to really put that investment in context of size and it does show up in our capital deployment. It's just not as capital intensive as the core business is.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

It's tiny.

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

This is -- an experiment is not the correct word, probably very important for us to be able to understand how the distributed generation market develops. We have a good sense of it in our own service territories, but there are others that are further along in their journey, whether that's sort of out west of us or otherwise. And so, I think we'll continue to invest in that business to understand how distributed generation might change the utility business in total, it's a very important way for us to understand the markets.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Hey, Tom. Thank you for taking my question. Mine is going to be really, really quick. When looking at the capital spend guidance, the one thing that kind of stood out is, there's very little at the regulated electrics for any new generation in the next few years, meaning, next three or four, three to five years. Just curious, are you guys being conservative about whether there's an opportunity to build renewables in rate base or whether as you potentially retire or run your coal units even less often, whether new gas fired generation in rate base would be needed?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

I'd say if you look at the projections today, it's more the lack of having these items here, or probably more around the uncertainty of whether or not there will be -- the IRPs will reflect them. However, we are in process with IRPs in Georgia and ultimately in Alabama and expect at least 1,000 megawatts of renewables will be built within the Georgia portfolio .

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

And we're always looking over our hand in terms of the economics of the best mix of capacity we've got. It wouldn't surprise me, we've announced some stuff in the IRP at Georgia, Hammond, Macintosh, to see more of that thinking elsewhere in the system. It's just huff to think about all of the expense, whether it's O&M, environmental, everything else supporting the coal fleet. We think that is a drumbeat that will continue and as technologies developed, whether they are renewables or new, highly efficient gas or storage, we will take that into account as well.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Hey, Ali, how are you?

Ali Agha -- SunTrust -- Analyst

Good. Thanks, Tom. Good morning.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning.

Ali Agha -- SunTrust -- Analyst

First question, I just wanted to be certain, in the past you all have given us a net income profile for Vogtle depending on the construction timeline and the ROE hits that you've been alluding to. Is that still a good profile to be using for modeling purposes?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

I think so. If it's not, we'll cover that with you offline, but I don't think anything has changed materially there.

Ali Agha -- SunTrust -- Analyst

Okay. Also a couple of your utilities have obviously seen an increase in there all-tied (ph) equity ratios in the recent past. Again, for your planning purposes, as you look out long-term and the 4% to 6% growth, are you assuming that those higher equity ratios stay where they are or how are you thinking about that as future rate cases are coming up?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

We are assuming that they stay in place, assuming that tax law stays as it is. You'll probably remember that the adjustments to capital structure really were simply for maintenance of the current credit quality of the utilities, as they existed prior to reform. And so, Ali, we do expect that will continue. That'll be adjudicated in Georgia over the next few months for both Atlanta Gas Light and Georgia Power. We are working to make some progress in the State of Illinois. And Alabama, had I think really, really strong commitment from their regulators to maintain the credit quality of their business and so, comfortable with how we've described in the projections.

And let me tell you something, if I could give a quick policy argument, tax reform as they've done it, has been so beneficial to so many people. The argument against it is, only the fat cats, the rich people benefit. It's dead wrong in our business. The way we've structured it, something like $1.8 billion of some sort of rate reductions accrue, whether they're refunds or other sort of rate reductions accrue to customers. And 46% of our customers make less than $40,000 a year and when you look at that segment, energy budget is a high part of their disposable income. This has a direct positive impact on some of the people in our economy that needed the most. This has been a great outcome.

Ali Agha -- SunTrust -- Analyst

Got you. And just one quick question. The effective tax rate, if we get little bit right on your adjusted earnings was slightly lower than I think what you were expecting earlier, is this a good sort of run rate to be thinking about in future years as well?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

I think the largest change year-over-year was the impact of tax reform. But let me get back to you in terms of the effective rate and the cash tax rate. I don't think it's very differently, significantly from our original expectation. Little bit of movement perhaps related to gains on sale of assets, but that would be the principal difference.

Ali Agha -- SunTrust -- Analyst

I got you. Thank you.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Association. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Paul glad to have you with us.

Paul Patterson -- Glenrock Association -- Analyst

Good to be here. Listen, I mean you guys have really pretty much covered everything with Vogtle, just a quick follow-up on the staff testimony in November, sort of raised some concerns about the 29 month extension and what have you and I was just wondering, 29 months, right?

Andrew W. Evans -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes.

Paul Patterson -- Glenrock Association -- Analyst

And I just wanted to get a sense as to what changed between November and now, other than what you guys have already gone over? I mean, I guess it would appear that things have really improved quite a bit. And perhaps that skepticism, if they were to write it today, would be less and I'm not asking you to speak for them, but if you can address, I mean you guys never really I think filed rebuttal testimony or anything. So that's why, I was just wondering if you could just fill in a little bit there as to why they had so much skepticism then and the outlook now?

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So you hit my first answer right on the head. And that is, I don't want to speak for the staff. Look, if you just look at the facts right now, whether it's productive hours per week, a 110,000 versus a 140,000 plus hours work per week, we're developing margin to November. And we are able to get the staff we need. We haven't eaten into any of the contingency. So, schedule, costs, productivity, these numbers look pretty good. Now, we have to sustain them, and maybe things that we don't know, the unknown are unknowns. We have the units in China working well. So we know the technology works. So, here's the thing, I think -- just as I indicated on an earlier question, I think that we're able to demonstrate we get staff, we get them productive, we are working. I think the next big issue is going to be turnover. And I know Dr. Jacobs, who we dearly love, he is a really smart guy and works with us, and sits in all our meetings, that's part of his area of expertise, but how we move from construction now to the start-up, looking toward half fuel load, potentially as soon as '18 months away, is kind of the big issue right now. And we'll talk more about that in calls ahead.

Paul Patterson -- Glenrock Association -- Analyst

Okay. Listen, everything else has been answered and congratulations.

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Thomas A. Fanning -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

No. We're really happy to be able to report these results. It's the productive work of thousands of people, making thousands of good decisions every day. I want to call out Bechtel, our partner on this important Vogtle journey that we're on. I think we're in good shape right now. The challenge is going to be keep the momentum going, sustain the progress and continue to execute the way we have. The financial plan is awfully robust.

I think, we've demonstrated agility in being able to respond to changed conditions in some of the best regulatory environments in the United States. We expect that will continue. Lots of important work ahead in '19, but I think we're poised to execute and do well during this year.

"" data-adaptive-image-768-img="" "" data-adaptive-image-1024-img="" "" data-adaptive-image-max-img="" ""> I asked this morning which way The Independent Grou…","I asked this morning which way The Independent Group would vote in a confidence motion in Theresa May’s government. Now one of its founders, Gavin Shuker, has provided the answer: to keep the prime minister in office, provided she offered a second referendum.

Shuker tells HuffPost that members of the group first made the offer to May’s de facto deputy, David Lidington, before their resignations:

“I went into the Cabinet Office about a month ago when Theresa May was in full listening mode and sat down with David Lidington when I was a Labour MP and I said, look you can have my support to pass any deal you like on Brexit – it can be Norway, it can be Theresa May’s deal, it can be Canada, whatever you want you can have my vote “But at the end of it I want a confirmatory referendum. “And do you know what? If you do that British politics is going to be shaken quite a bit if you get that through – I’m willing to extend confidence and supply to your government so it doesn’t fall over through the period of the referendum. If it’s a year, fine. “They obviously didn’t choose to go down that route. “But if you are asking me about future hypotheticals about when the maths of parliament are so febrile, it comes down to – to use the cliche – doing the right thing by the country.”

Though Lidington rejected the offer, Shuker said that it still stood in principle. He urged the government to support plans from the Labour backbenchers Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle to amend the next meaningful vote to approve the withdrawal agreement on the condition that it is put to the public in a confirmatory referendum.

The first thing to note is that it is an offer that May was, and is, bound to refuse for reasons of principle – her own opposition to a second referendum is well-known – and internal party management. To accept the Wilson-Kyle amendment would be to split a Conservative coalition that is every bit as restive as Labour. In that respect it is a non-starter.

Then there is the opposition. Some Labour frontbenchers believe that, should it come at the eleventh hour, the leadership could make its peace with voting for the withdrawal agreement on the proviso it was put to a referendum.

Optimists believe that those in the shadow cabinet who are opposed to a second vote are in fact a noisy minority and that such a plan could be spun internally as all things to all people: a vote for Brexit for those in leave constituencies, and a vote for a second referendum for those whose electorates backed remain. Failing to whip in favour of the plan would also risk a string of shadow ministerial resignations and further defections (the reverse is true for May).

But we know that a good chunk of the PLP is sufficiently squeamish about being seen to thwart or frustrate Brexit to oppose any parliamentary move to extend Article 50, especially given the widespread assumption that Theresa May will eventually have to do it herself. It is also clear that the leadership’s preference is to facilitate the passage of a deal without precipitating a further electoral event. When faced with a choice between jettisoning its frontbench Remainers and those in Leave constituencies, it has always chosen the former. Support from either Downing Street or the Labour leadership is more or less essential if Wilson-Kyle is to pass, but for these reasons is unlikely to be forthcoming.

That the Independent Group have drawn a straight line between the passage of that amendment and May surviving in office makes support from Labour unlikelier still. As far as Team Corbyn is concerned, the offer is a political gift. “Offering to prop up a Tory government that has inflicted so much suffering on our communities is shameful,” a source says. “This grubby offer shows what the new establishment coalition really stands for – austerity, privatisation and the interests of the super-rich”.

Given that the price Shuker has set for supporting a Brexit deal is too high for either leadership, it suggests the new grouping has decreased rather than increased the chances of a negotiated settlement passing the Commons – and with it increased the chances of the general election that is much too soon for it to fight.",The Independent Group name their price for keeping the Tories in power,Newstatesman.com,https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/02/independent-group-name-their-price-keeping-tories-power
226,Empty,2019-02-24T11:00:00Z,"Negative campaigns have had success, but a vision of something bigger and better is proving difficult to defeat.","It has become a basic truth among a generation of campaigners who grew up with social media that the only campaign strategy and tactics that deliver votes are nasty. Starting with the Harris government, continuing through the Harper years, to their several provincial cousins today — some of different parties — campaign planning today is devoted more to wrecking strategies directed at the personal reputations of opponents, than to how they would improve Canadians lives.

The federal leaders of Canada’s three major parties, from left: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “Many voters, young and old, choose their horse based on shrewd observation of who seems authentic and which leader they believe has the ability to defend their interests best. Other than hard partisans, many fewer choose who delivers the best insults,” writes Robin V. Sears. ( Norma Zminkowska )

Sadly, it often works, as its champions often brag. We appear to be on the verge of sliding into yet one more election campaign marked by anger, vituperation and insult. But examining political history paints a somewhat less gloomy alternative approach. The biggest, boldest, most optimistic vision has often overcome the venomous. Mulroney trounced Turner, Layton romped through Quebec, and Justin Trudeau crushed his opponents. In each case their messages where of a bigger and better Canada, against a gloomier, dystopic vision buttressed by nasty sound bites and, these days, sensational clickbait tweets. Even in the U.S. it’s useful to consider how campaigns of animus did against those of other more visionary leaders. Not to give the Trump aberration more credit than it is due, we might recall that Reagan/Carter, Clinton/Dole, Obama/McCain were all matchups that went to the sunnier visions. A Biden/Trump matchup might have turned out differently, too.

Article Continued Below

Justin Trudeau can hardly campaign on sunny ways again, without being laughed at. But he can still articulate a confident progressive agenda, and not mud-wrestle with Scheer in the political ditch each day. Despite his unhappy few months, when Jagmeet Singh enters the House of Commons next month he should be able to convey his message of inclusion, optimism and a bold vision for Canada, and still be tough in Question Period. Those were the messages that won him the leadership, in part echoing the Layton’s “love over fear” mission, and partly referencing his own life story as proof of what is possible in a Canada that dreams big. Unless they have a change of heart over the summer, it seems clear that the Scheer campaign strategy will be grounded first in sneering at the Trudeau failures — most clearly now SNC-Lavalin. He will be challenged from the right by the nasty identitarian politics of Max Bernier. Even including a subtheme of the old-time American conservative fairy tale — lower taxes, better service and smaller government, all funded by the “billions and billions” of dollars of waste and corruption in Ottawa — he will be pushed to attack first and always. With two articulate progressive visions opposing him, he might be wiser to return to Conservative “big message” politics. Liberal failure to deliver is obviously fair game, but how will Scheer make Canadians’ lives better? Singh’s vulnerability will be in the numbers — polling, funds raised and strong new candidates recruited. But voters across the Western world have confounded pundits time and again in recent years, swinging from one pole to a widely distant one in a single leap, not always in response to incitement politics.

Macron smashed the left and right with a “new France” vision. However delusionary you may believe his program, Jeremy Corbyn almost defeated British Conservatives with a big change agenda. Democrats are rolling out very bold — perhaps, overly so — visions for America. Many voters, young and old, choose their horse based on shrewd observation of who seems authentic and which leader they believe has the ability to defend their interests best. Other than hard partisans, many fewer choose who delivers the best insults.

Article Continued Below

Thirtysomethings have shown their faith in a bigger, fairer, greener Canada in the past two federal elections. That does not seem to have ebbed. The twentysomethings are always harder to read because of turnout, but we know that when they do vote, it is less often a response to attack politics than to a bigger vision for their futures. So, to each of the party strategists: Don’t put all your money on how mean and tough you can look. Canadians respect and do vote for leaders with bolder visions too. Robin V.

227,Empty,2019-02-20T01:16:30Z,"All human beings have a right to healthcare, but powerful forces remain dead set against it. An interview with PNHP president Dr. Adam Gaffney... Dr. Adam Gaffney is the brand new president of Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP), the national, Med…","Dr. Adam Gaffney is the brand new president of Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP), the national, Medicare for All advocacy group of medical professionals and others committed to single-payer—universal healthcare “provided equitably as a public service rather than bought and sold as a commodity.”

In the announcement of his election, Dr. Gaffney said, “We’ve been so successful in popularizing the idea of ‘Medicare for all’ that everybody wants in on the slogan—even if they have something completely different in mind, like a public option. But tweaks won’t solve the fundamental problems of American health care: persistently high uninsurance, rising underinsurance, unaffordable drugs, narrow provider networks, and the growing corporate domination of health care that prioritizes profits over patients.”

Adam Gaffney is a pulmonary specialist at Cambridge Health Alliance in Massachusetts who earned his bachelor’s and medical degrees from New York University and a master’s in public health from Harvard. He’s been active in the single-payer movement for several years, writing numerous articles and research papers and co-chairing a working group that developed PNHP’s “Physicians’ Proposal for Single-Payer Health Care Reform.”

We spoke recently while he was in New York for a meeting of the commission on public policy and health in the Trump era, a group brought together by the medical journal The Lancet. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Talk a bit about your medical background and how it has made you such a strong Medicare for All advocate.

I think that my politics preceded my medical career. In college I was very progressive. In 2000, when I was a freshman in college, I supported Ralph Nader in that election. I think that’s when I first heard the term “single payer,” although I certainly supported universal healthcare as a concept earlier than that, back to my years in high school.

But I would say that everything I’ve seen since embarking on my medical career has reinforced my feelings about why we need single-payer and universal healthcare: all the patients I’ve seen who have gone without care because they couldn’t afford it, who have skipped inhalers for their emphysema because they couldn’t afford the copay, have shown up in the ICU because of complications of illness that didn’t get treated because they had gone without insurance or because their insurance had lapsed. Everything I’ve seen since embarking on a medical career has definitely reinforced what I had thought before I started it.

People often say why do we need one public payer? Why can’t we have a number of different insurance companies? There are many downsides to that. It’s not just that fragmentation produces waste, which it does, it’s not just the enormous burden of billing and administration that imposes on hospitals and doctors and that generates as much as $500 billion a year in wasted spending on administration. It’s also the fact that often people don’t even know what’s covered. Physicians won’t even know what’s covered. People show up at the pharmacy and it turns out the drug they need isn’t covered.

Literally the last thing I would want a patient or family to have to think about are the financial consequences of their healthcare. And they don’t have to.

So you are completely convinced that single-payer is the best way to go?

Yes. I am also completely convinced that imposing costs on patients at the time of healthcare use has no useful purpose. That seems like a radical idea, and even people on the liberal-left side of the spectrum sometimes say, well, having a reasonable copay is not such a bad idea to ensure that healthcare is not used sort of frivolously. I think some people think a system where you don’t impose costs is pie-in-the-sky and unrealistic. It’s of course not unrealistic, considering that in the UK this already exists. In the UK, there are no copays for doctor’s visits, no deductibles, no payments to hospitals. In Scotland, you don’t even pay for parking at the hospital if you’re visiting a loved one. It’s clearly doable and I think it’s a better system.

At the end of the day, maybe people paying for healthcare only really affects working class and poor people because well-off people are always going to be willing to pay a forty-dollar copay, right? It really is just a way of punishing the sick and the poor.

When your presidency was announced, you described it as an exciting but also dangerous moment in the history of single-payer. Why?

Exciting in that we’re farther along than we ever have been. Single-payer has made incredible strides in just the last few years, from a position that was mostly on kind of the fringe of respectable politics to a position that’s now very close to center that’s being embraced by politicians running for president. That was not the case in 2008. In 2008, basically all the major candidates had no interest in single-payer, they already had their minds made up that healthcare reform was going to be a sort of Obamacare-like proposal, which it was. That’s not the case anymore.

I think it’s part of a larger, progressive swing. In many ways our politics have become more regressive with the election of Trump, with the domination of Congress by Republicans. But there has been a progressive swing with exciting, new left-wing candidates in the House of Representatives. The move of single-payer to the center of the conversation is part of that.

But it’s a dangerous moment as well. Think about this: Even while we get excited about the prospects of single-payer, Republicans in Congress are now pushing dangerous new programs. States like Arkansas are imposing work requirements on a Medicaid program that’s squeezing out of the program, I think the latest figure was 18,000 people, by creating bureaucratic barriers and paperwork.

There's obviously going to be an ongoing effort by the right to dismantle existing, public healthcare systems – whether that takes the form of another attempted repeal of the Affordable Care Act seems unlikely given the change in Congress in November.

In December, the Trump administration released a white paper that was mostly not noticed in the news, but it was a wish list or manifesto for a conservative healthcare future. It gives you a sense of what corporate opposition would do if it could: Further privatize the system or further privatize Medicare, it would increase high deductible health plans; it would just take an overall, laissez-faire, deregulatory approach to the health care system. So there are both promises and dangers on the horizon.

Let’s talk about the 2020 elections. In the PNHP announcement of your presidency it’s said that Medicare for All has become such a catchphrase that some candidates may be misusing it.

We’ve had the idea for a long time. But what happened was that the idea has become very popular, something that everyone is rallying behind. So I do think there’s an effort to steal some of that thunder and use the branding on other types of healthcare proposals that fall well short of what we’re talking about.

We’re talking about a national health insurance program that covers everyone in the country. These other proposals are not that. Some of them still might help many people but they’re not what the country needs. They wouldn’t fix the fundamental problems of the US healthcare system.

There has been a long-standing debate over whether calling this Medicare for All is the right approach. On the pro side, Medicare is a familiar system, something that people understand, a term people are familiar with. Historically, the people who designed Medicare first envisioned it as a national health care system. It was the progeny of a national health insurance model. The architects of national health insurance under the Truman administration, when that fell through, they basically said, all right, let’s at least make this into a program for seniors. So in terms of the historical, ideological lineage, there is something to be said for calling single-payer Medicare for All.

The cons are that it can be confusing, because we’re not talking about replicating Medicare in its current form, we’re talking about going beyond it. Medicare has copays, this system will not. Medicare doesn’t cover dental, this system would. Medicare has somewhat privatized; there's Medicare Advantage, and Medicare part D, the drug benefit. In contrast, this would be a single, solitary public plan, so there are significant differences between Medicare and what we’re talking about.

Would you say that Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All legislation in the Senate or the House bill comes closest to your organization’s position?

The House bill comes closest. The Sanders bill has a couple of areas for improvement that we’d like to see. They’re mostly sort of wonky design issues that most people don’t get too excited about but that we think are very important.

Overall, the Sanders bill is a single-payer bill; it gets most of it right. We would like to see a change in the way hospitals are financed so that they get global budgets that cover all their operating expenditures rather than replicating the current Medicare payment system which incentivizes profit-oriented activities. We’d like to see no copays on drugs. The Sanders bill has almost no copays but it has small residual copays for some drugs. It’s pretty minor but we’d like to see that out. We’d like to see the inclusion of long-term care, which the Sanders bill does not have. It is a lot of money but we need to deal with long-term care and make sure that’s covered.

Ryan Grim had a piece in The Intercept recently reporting that Nancy Pelosi’s top healthcare aide had met with representatives of Blue Cross Blue Shield and told them that the House would move on drug prices over single payer or changing the ACA.

I think there’s some truth that we’re not going to pass single-payer under the Trump administration. It isn’t realistic to think that it’s going to happen with this current government. But it is disturbing that those assurances are being given to the industry. It suggests that not all Democrats are on the same page.

There’s longstanding resistance among some in the establishment to sweeping ideas like Medicare for All. I talk about all the huge strides that have been made but there are still many obstacles ahead. As you’re probably aware, there’s a new corporate group funded by Big Pharma and the insurances companies that is spoiling for a fight, sharpening its swords, gearing up to tackle single-payer. The industry is not going to go down without a fight. Obviously, they’re going to pour money into Washington, they’re going to pour money into lobbying, they’re going to pour money into candidates, they’re going to take out ads, they’re going to smear it left and right, so our work is cut out for us.

Senator Sherrod Brown, a progressive on most things, has said that he’s for Medicare for All, but thinks it should be incremental, starting by lowering the Medicare age to 55.

I understand those arguments but I think what’s often not understood is that many of the savings that a single-payer system would achieve really come from a systemic shift and not from the incremental. Let’s say you create a public option that’s one more option people can buy into as a choice of healthcare insurance. That may achieve somewhat lower premiums, by virtue of paying Medicare rates instead of private insurance rates, but it’s actually not going to take the profit orientation out of the system. It’s not going to achieve the administrative savings that you get from a single payer system, it’s not going to allow us to reduce the armies of billers and coders that are employed by hospitals. So I think that some of those arguments fail to realize the real policy issues.

You just mentioned this new corporate group that wants to come down hard on single-payer because you're advocating for the complete elimination of private insurance.

There may be some small residual role for private coverage of cosmetic surgery or things like that. That’s basically how it is in Canada. In Canada, the system doesn’t cover drugs or vision, there are supplementary plans for those things, but that's a weakness of their system, not something we should emulate. So there’s really no need to have a private health insurance industry in this country. You’d have one public payer that covers everybody.

You’re going up against a behemoth.

Yes. They’ll need to find a new line of work (laughs). I don’t know what to say. The workers in those industries definitely need to be taken care of. The Sanders bill and the House bill both have provisions to take care of displaced workers. It’s not their fault that these industries don’t really have value. [What happens to] the CEO’s, I really don’t care too much about.

But how do you go about buying out for-profit hospitals and nursing homes? How do you keep owners from simply converting hospitals and nursing facilities into apartments or hotels?

There’s an ongoing debate about this among supporters of single payer. PNHP’s position is that we should have a plan for how to buy out for-profit healthcare providers as we transition into single-payer. We think that you could take out a large bond, use it to buy out for-profit providers, convert them to not-for-profit and that would be a way to ensure that for-profit owners don’t say to heck with this, I’m selling off all my dialysis machines to Europe.

Unions are a bulwark of the Democratic Party and I know that a lot of union members are going to say that my union healthcare plan is really good, why would I give it up for single-payer?

My response would be that you’re never going to give it up for something that’s not better. We and our allies would never support a plan that replaced people’s existing plans with something inferior. If you look at the bills, they have comprehensive benefits and no cost sharing. That essentially beats every private plan out there and goes beyond them.

For at least the next two years, the Republicans will keep trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act. As you see it, is there value in continuing to work to shore up Obamacare until changes can be made?

I think we should join forces with everyone who’s fighting to defend existing programs that help people. I think you saw that during the 2017 repeal effort when single-payer supporters linked arms with people who supported ACA or supported other forms of universal coverage and we fought together to push back against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. I don’t think that doing that retards the advance of single-payer and I don’t think that fighting for single-payer gives an opening for those who want to attack the ACA.

So how do you pay for single payer?

There was a 200-page report on the economics of single payer that came out of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, led by economist Robert Pollin. They suggested a mix of taxes that would cover its costs. It’s by no means definitive, there are other approaches to the problem, [but] their proposal includes redirecting all existing public health monies into the new system. Roughly two thirds of current public health dollars are already taxpayer-financed. So you divert those funds into the new system and for the remaining, yes, you need a mix of taxes. They propose a modest sales tax on non-essentials, an employer-side payroll tax and some new taxes on the very wealthy.

What you call “truly progressive taxation.”

Which has the added benefit of doing something about soaring economic inequality, which in itself is a cause of bad health. So actually, publicly financing our healthcare system has benefits by helping to confront the problem of inequality.

The other side screams “socialized medicine,” just as they did when Medicare and Medicaid and Obamacare began.

Call it what you will (laughs). Medicare and Medicaid were historic advances as was the Affordable Care Act, improving people’s lives. But they have left big holes, and for some people, things actually are getting worse. There just was a report from the Commonwealth Fund in which they looked at the inadequacy of insurance and they found that 45 percent of non-elderly American adults are inadequately insured or underinsured. People with insurance from their employers have seen their deductibles triple over the last decade, and the portion of people who are underinsured continues to rise. The Affordable Care Act helped to reduce the uninsured by 20 million people but it obviously left huge holes.

You alluded to “global budgets,” also known as global operating plans. Explain.

There are different ways to pay a hospital. The existing way is per patient billing. Sometimes that means having to add up every single service they used or every single Tylenol and so on, which obviously is a huge waste.

So what are the downsides of that? For one, you need an enormous infrastructure of people adding up the costs on a per patient basis. US hospitals spend a quarter of their revenue on administration and billing. That is double the proportion that Canada and Scotland spend.

The other problem with existing hospital payment methods is that they incentivize a profit-oriented approach focusing on the kinds of patients or the kinds of care. I’m not saying every hospital does this; my hospital, Cambridge Health Alliance, certainly does not.

Overall, it creates an incentive for hospitals writ large to engage in some profit-oriented activities – supplying services that generate the highest revenue, neglecting those that do not. This is something that PNHP co-founders David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler have written a lot about. Even non-profits are sort of beholden to this sort of system. Not only that, but for hospitals to expand, to build new infrastructure, to get new machines, new equipment, they need to generate profits because the way that new healthcare infrastructure is funded in America is from profits for hospitals.

So the whole system is designed to encourage even non-profits to engage in profitable activities because if they don’t they’ll go under. They won’t be able to buy the new equipment, they won’t be able to build the new wing, they won’t be able to attract patients and the patients will go elsewhere. This is why we need to get away from a discussion that focuses on bad actors and start thinking about the way the system is designed, the defects in the system.

What do we need to do to change that? First, we need global operating budgets. Himmselstein and Woolhandler have rightly emphasized this. It’s a lump sum that a hospital gets to cover all its operating expenses. This is how it works with the VA, this is how it works in Europe, in Canada, for the most part. You get a lump sum and you can use it to take care of all your patients and then you’re not trying to say, well, I’ll do more invasive surgery that makes a lot more money. Instead, I’ll spend it where it’s needed, take care of patients in response to community needs.

At the same time, what we propose and what is in the House bill is a system where the capital expenditures I mentioned are separately funded, where hospitals don’t have to try to seek a profit on their operating revenues in order to have money left over to build stuff. Capital expenditures are determined based on medical need when and where the structure is needed.

So you move away from this whole profit ethos toward one that’s focused on community needs. In the current system, new hospitals get built where revenues are highest, new wings get built where revenues exceed costs. Hospitals in rural areas are going under because it’s hard to turn a profit in a rural

What we call single-payer incorporates things beyond just where the money comes from. It envisions a reconfiguration, a reformulation of the healthcare system away from profit-oriented activities towards one that is oriented toward community and patient needs.

People ask questions like, when do you see this happening, how do you see this happening – frankly, I have no idea. No one knows. The reality is that when we achieve single-payer there still are going to be areas for improvement. We’re not going to get it perfect the first time, and there are always going to be efforts to dismantle it. But I think the single-payer system is particularly resilient against that.

You see that in Europe – even when there have been right wing governments, try as they may, they often stumble in their efforts to dismantle public systems of healthcare. Margaret Thatcher, her people certainly would have loved to have dismantled NHS but they knew they couldn’t. They tinkered with it, they made it worse, they added some market elements to it…

And then the conservative Brexiteers lied and used as an argument that all the money saved from leaving the EU would be put into the NHS.

It does show how achieving real solid victories that help people on an everyday basis create the constituencies that support it. That doesn’t make it invincible, I understand that. But the NHS is socialism! (laughs)

Talk a bit about PNHP’s education efforts.

We have a sort of split focus, both on the medical profession and on the general public. Our members do grand rounds at hospitals, we speak to colleagues, we give talks, we disseminate materials, we produce research. We are one part of the single payer movement that does focus on the medical profession. But the reality is that we don’t just want doctors to be on board, we need doctors to be on board.

There are some polls that show majority support for single payer among physicians. A lot has changed from the late 1940’s when the American Medical Association was the main force that defeated Truman’s national health insurance plan.

For one thing, there are more voices, it’s a more pluralistic profession than it was, it’s certainly a far more diverse profession than it was. There are still elements in the medical profession that are opposed to single-payer but there are elements like ours that powerfully support it. There also have been changes in the political economy of healthcare. Relatively recently, it was reported that a majority of physicians are now employees, which is a tremendous shift in the political economy of healthcare. Traditionally, physicians were essentially archetypal small business people, typically businessmen.

There have been real downsides for physicians, in terms of the quality of their work. They spend more time on clerical activities, on fighting with insurance companies, on checking boxes – interacting with the computer instead of interacting with the patients. I think it has resulted in a lot of burnout with physicians and it has resulted in job dissatisfaction, so I think there is a real desire among physicians to imagine a better world for their patients and for themselves. I think that has created an opening within the medical profession to support single-payer.

And about educating the general public?

Our members do media, write op-eds, give talks, engage in debates and also some of our members engage in policy research that our organization helps to get out there.

Drs. Himmelstein and Woolhandler were the lead authors of single-payer proposals that were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA [the Journal of the American Medical Association] that actually became the foundation for the House single-payer bills. They have done a lot of studies – the statistic that the majority of bankruptcies are medical bankruptcies was their work, just to give one example.

I’m doing healthcare research. For one project, we're focusing on patients with lung disease, at how deductibles affect people with COPD. We’re also looking at how one of the big concerns with single-payer is that it would create an enormous explosion in expense because people would use more healthcare because it was free. We're not sure, so we have done some research on the effects of the Affordable Care Act an Medicare in the 1960's. Stay tuned on that.

I’m going to continue the work that previous presidents have done. If you look at some of these polls that sort of get cited where the bottom line is yes, single-payer polls really well, but when you start asking people this or that, the support is malleable. It’s true that many people don’t understand all of the design aspects, that it will be one public plan that covers everybody instead of an option, so there is an enormous amount of education of the public that has to take place to make single-payer a reality.

Finally, I wanted to ask you about immigration. PNHP is calling for coverage of all undocumented and documented immigrants.

We are calling for coverage of all US residents. I think that’s important. Look, everyone needs healthcare. You’re not going to deny people healthcare simply by virtue of the country they were born in, nor should we. Healthcare is a human right. That’s imperative. At the end of the day, the reality is that unless you’re willing to push people away from the doors of hospitals and call in the goons to throw them into the streets, you need to take care of people, right? It’s just common decency.

The irony is there’s also some research that immigrants actually pay more into the healthcare system. If that wasn’t the case it wouldn’t change my opinion but it is a funny irony. The reason is pretty simple – immigrants in general are younger and healthier, they use less healthcare and they pay more into the system.

But that’s not the motivation. The motivation is to envision healthcare as a human right that everyone deserves by virtue of belonging to the human race.","An ""Exciting But Dangerous Moment"" for Medicare for All",Commondreams.org,https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/02/20/exciting-dangerous-moment-medicare-all

Chinese technology giant Huawei today unveiled a new folding-screen smartphone on Sunday, which will run on superfact 5G networks and cost twice as much as the latest Apple iPhone, retailing for around £2,000.

Huawei revealed the Mate X phone on the eve of a four-day industry event in Spain to showcase new devices, and Executive Director, CEO of the Consumer Business Group, Richard Yu said it would satisfy consumers' demands for bigger screens and longer battery life when it goes on sale in the summer.

But what is less clear is whether it will satisfy users' demands for privacy, with Huawei under intense suspicion by Western intelligence chiefs who fear the company works as a front for the vast Chinese spy apparatus.

Richard Yu, the Executive Director, CEO of the Consumer Business Group, presented the new Huawei Mate X smartphone at the Mobile World Congress (MWC), on the eve of the world's biggest mobile fair in Barcelona

The Mate has a foldable screen which wraps around the outside of the product, allowing users to view the screen when closed

The new Huawei Mate X device unfolded (left) and folded over (right). Unfolded, the Mate X's screen is 8 inches diagonally, making it the size of a small tablet

At the glitzy Barcelona launch of the device Mr Yu said Huawei engineers spent three years working on the device's hinge, which doesn't leave a gap when shut

Unveiling his company's latest brainchild, Mr Yu asked: 'How can we bring the more big innovation to this smartphone industry?'

The Mate X us his answer. The screen wraps around the outside so users can still view it when it's closed, unlike its competitor, the Galaxy Fold, which has a screen that folds shut.

Unfolded, the Mate X's screen is 8 inches diagonally, making it the size of a small tablet.

Mr Yu said Huawei engineers spent three years working on the device's hinge, which doesn't leave a gap when shut.

The Mate X will retail for £1,996 (2,299 euros or $2,600) when it goes on sale by midyear. The latest iPhone costs around £1,000 and more than Samsung's recently revealed Galaxy Fold, another folding smartphone, which is priced at 'only' $2,000.

But consumer who do choose to fork over the price of a second-hand car for the new Chinese phone may be getting more than they bargain for.

The firm, which is also involved in the upgrade of the telecoms network itself, is at the centre of a global row about cybersecurity with multiple Western spy chiefs concerned its technology creates a back door allowing the Beijing regime to listen in on Western conversations.

Senior MPs have called for Britain to ban Huawei from working on the 5G mobile internet upgrade completely.

Conservative MPs Julian Lewis and Bob Seely urged the government to follow the UK's 'Five Eyes' intelligence partners Australia and New Zealand and stop the firm from working on critical infrastructure projects. However, a Huawei spokesperson responded that the New Zealand government `turned down a single 5G proposal submitted for review by one carrier, but the regulatory process was still ongoing'.

Dr Lewis told MailOnline: 'What we have to remember is despite their protestations of independence, there is no such thing as an independent enterprise under a Communist regime.

'And until such time as China ceases to be a dictatorship of the Communist party in China then there can be no meaningful claim to independence by enterprises. We should definitely follow Australia's and New Zealand's example.'

And Mr Seely, a Tory MP and defence expert, warned China may be able to discover the UK's vulnerabilities if its firms are given the crucial contracts.

Their intervention came after Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said he had 'grave concerns' about Huawei.

Julian Lewis (pictured left) and Bob Seely (pictured right) urged the government to follow its Five Eyes intelligence partners Australia and New Zealand and stop the firm from working on critical infrastructure projects.

Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has expressed 'grave' concerns at the prospect of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei being involved in the UK's new 5G network

Mr Williamson said: 'I have grave, very deep concerns about Huawei providing the 5G network in Britain. It's something we'd have to look at very closely.

'We've got to look at what partners such as Australia and the US are doing in order to ensure that they have the maximum security of that 5G network and we've got to recognise the fact, as has been recently exposed, the Chinese state does sometimes act in a malign way.'

Huawei said it was not banned from current or future networks, and the GSCB clarified that the telco could still work with Huawei to address the security risk.

Only last month Dr Ian Levy, technical director of the cyber arm of the UK’s electronic surveillance organisation, , GCHQ, said Huawei still has not produced a ‘credible plan’ to address security concerns.

He said: 'Last year we said we found some worrying engineering and security issues. As of today, we have not seen a credible plan. That’s the reality of the situation unfortunately.’

And Ciaran Martin, head of the National Cyber Security Centre, said he had separate concerns that the company fell short on security standards for its product, regardless of any possible link to Chinese spying.

President Donald Trump signaled on Tuesday that he might reverse a ban which currently prevents Huawei selling phones in the USA as part of a larger China trade deal, tweeting that the U.S. shouldn't win the 5G mobile arms race by 'blocking out currently more advanced technologies'

Trump tweeted less than 90 minutes after Huawei boss Ren Zhengfei s declared in a TV interview that his copmany was not involved in espionage

Huawei phones are currently banned in the US, which considers the Chinese giant's technology a security threat, and only last August President Trump signed into law a bill reaffirming the embargo.

The cloud over Huawei also includes U.S. criminal charges filed last month against the company and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who U.S. prosecutors want to extradite from Canada.

They accuse her of fraud and say the company stole trade secrets, including technology that mobile carrier T-Mobile used to test smartphones.

But in what may be a signal of a forthcoming policy shift, the president tweeted on Thursday that he wants the U.S. 'to win through competition' rather than by blocking out technologies which are currently more advanced.

Allowing Huawei's mobile phone equipment back into U.S. markets could be a carrot for Beijing as Trump's negotiators hash out a new trade framework with the world's second largest economy.

Huawei Technologies is trying to raise its profile in the fiercely competitive smartphone market. Almost everyone with a smartphone has heard of Apple and Samsung, the top device makers, and Google, the creator of the software on Android phones.

Huawei, a Chinese company with a name many people in the West don't know how to pronounce ('HWA-way'), is jockeying for a seat at the top table. Last year it was third in global smartphone sales, behind Apple and Sansung in pole position.

Huawei is making its push at a time that both Samsung and Apple are struggling with declining smartphone sales amid a lull in industry innovation that is causing more consumers to hold on to the devices until they wear out instead of upgrading to the latest model as quickly as they once did.

It remains to be seen whether Britain's savvy consumers will decide £2,000 - plus the risk of their private conversations being overheard by Chinese spies in windowless Beijing listening posts - is a price worth paying for the latest shiny tech toy.

But that's only because of the lack of submissions! Send me your best concoctions and family secrets, people. I accept news tips and story ideas, too. Reach out and sign up. Thanks for waking up with us.

The Investigations

""BY THE BOOK BOB”: As Washington preps for what looks like the imminent release next week of Robert Mueller's report, prosecutors we talked to yesterday say some things are already pretty clear about the special prosecutor's two-year long probe into Russia interference in the 2016 election and ties to the Trump campaign.

These lawyers, many of whom have experience in sprawling investigations like this one, however, said that whatever happens, Mueller is likely to hew tightly to the letter of the law: “He is by-the-book-Bob. So you want to start with the presumption that he will look at these regulations and follow them very literally and closely,” said one former Justice Department prosecutor.

Lawyers we talked to have a couple of reminders for breathless lawmakers, readers and us journalists: the whole report may not be released publicly, and Mueller is unlikely to recommend charges against President Trump, regardless of what evidence he does or does not uncover. But the prosecutors told Power Up to expect a slew of subpoenas and potentially charged litigation that could make its way to the Supreme Court.

Important: Trump and his allies have spent months calling the probe a “witch hunt” and trying to undermine the special counsel's work. But the investigation has so far led to criminal charges against 34 people (many of them Russians unlikely to be extradited) and six advisers and Trump associates have pleaded guilty.

Here's what the prosecutors told me to expect:

1. The Barr Factor: It's up to new Attorney General William Barr to decide whether to release all, some or none of the Mueller report.

Trump said as much on Wednesday in the Oval Office: “That'll be totally up to the new attorney general,” Trump told reporters during a meeting with Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. “He's a tremendous man, a tremendous person who really respects this country and respects the Justice Department.”

“That'll be totally up to the new attorney general,” Trump told reporters during a meeting with Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. “He's a tremendous man, a tremendous person who really respects this country and respects the Justice Department.” Public?: “Lawmakers have demanded that Mueller’s report be made public, but Barr has been noncommittal on that point, saying that he intends to be as forthcoming as the regulations and department practice allow,” report The Post's Devlin Barrett, Josh Dawsey and Matt Zapotosky. “He has pointed, however, to Justice Department practices that insist on saying little or nothing about conduct that does not lead to criminal charges.”

“Lawmakers have demanded that Mueller’s report be made public, but Barr has been noncommittal on that point, saying that he intends to be as forthcoming as the regulations and department practice allow,” report The Post's Devlin Barrett, Josh Dawsey and Matt Zapotosky. The process: Regulations require Mueller to “provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.” The regulations then call for Barr to report to Congress about the investigation. It's unclear, though, how detailed Barr's summary will be though due to “legitimate investigative” or “privacy concerns” that require confidentiality.

2. Expect a tug of war with Congress and Justice — and potentially the courts — regarding full access to the report.

How tough a line will DOJ take? Republicans set the standard last year for obtaining access to information that the FBI or the DOJ wouldn't normally provide during ongoing cases after House Republicans' intense lobbying and threats to impeach top FBI and DOJ officials over the information flow.

Republicans set the standard last year for obtaining access to information that the FBI or the DOJ wouldn't normally provide during ongoing cases after House Republicans' intense lobbying and threats to impeach top FBI and DOJ officials over the information flow. Supreme Court : The former prosecutors said if Barr declines to send the whole report to Congress, the House Judiciary Committee could subpoena it, leading to a possible chain of litigation all the way up the Supreme Court.

: The former prosecutors said if Barr declines to send the whole report to Congress, the House Judiciary Committee could subpoena it, leading to a possible chain of litigation all the way up the Supreme Court. “I think it’ll come down to what the House Judiciary is willing to accept and how fulsome Barr chooses to be in including material within the scope of the report in whatever summary that he transmits to Congress,” another former DOJ prosecutor told us.

Worst-case scenario: Mueller is subpoenaed to testify before Congress. Yes, this could actually happen.

How? “What if Mueller finishes what he does and is not an employee of the government anymore — just a private citizen -- and doesn't want to be held in contempt by Congress so he agrees to honor their subpoena? It would be quite the circus,"" said another former DOJ prosecutor.

“What if Mueller finishes what he does and is not an employee of the government anymore — just a private citizen -- and doesn't want to be held in contempt by Congress so he agrees to honor their subpoena? It would be quite the circus,"" said another former DOJ prosecutor. That prosecutor pointed to the ""gold standard"" of accommodation and cooperation outlined in something we might all need to get to know: the Linder letter. The letter sent by DOJ to then-Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.) in 2000 cites examples of confidential information that might not be available to Congress and outlines ""the Department's longstanding positions and practices on responding to congressional oversight requests."" The letter is especially stringent when it comes to ongoing investigations.

3. Mueller is not likely to recommend criminal charges against Trump.

The special prosecutor's report is likely to contain what prosecutors described as a “kitchen sink” of relevant investigative information.

If (and it's a big if) Mueller has amassed sufficient evidence regarding Trump himself, it might describe such evidence but not recommend any kind of criminal charges because of DOJ guidelines that block a sitting president from being indicted.

“Whether it’s a crime or not is beside the point because they’re not going to prosecute him anyway,” a former prosecutor at the DOJ told us of Trump.

Mueller “is a rules follower and he’d be careful to refrain from doing or saying anything than operating outside of the prescribed legal scope of his authority,” another former DOJ prosecutor us.

“According to people familiar with the special counsel’s work, Mueller has envisioned it as an investigative assignment, not necessarily a prosecutorial one, and for that reason does not plan to keep the office running to see to the end all of the indictments it has filed,” Devlin, Josh and Matt report.

4. There will be a lot of loose ends. And ""the end of the special counsel’s probe would not mean the end of criminal investigations connected to the president,"" my colleagues report. In other words: ""It means the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end,"" former acting solicitor general Neal Katyal tweeted.

“Federal prosecutors in New York, for instance, are exploring whether corrupt payments were made in connection with Trump’s inaugural committee funding. If Mueller does close up shop, government lawyers on his team would likely return to their original posts, but would be able to continue to work on the prosecution of cases initiated by the special counsel’s office,” per my colleagues. ""If Mueller does close up shop, government lawyers on his team would likely return to their original posts, but would be able to continue to work on the prosecution of cases initiated by the special counsel’s office.”

Michael Cohen will come before the @OversightDems & @HouseIntel Committees next week.

IN OTHER NEWS, A COHEN UPDATE: Michael Cohen, Trump's former fixer and longtime lawyer, will testify publicly before the House Oversight Committee on Feb. 27 in a blockbuster showdown featuring his long-term relationship with the president. According to a memo released by Chair Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Cohen is expected to address a number of issues related to Trump's debts, business practices, compliance with campaign finance laws, etc. (See below for the full scope).

Key: “Mr. Cohen won’t answer questions that touch on [Mueller’s] investigation into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. election, according to a person close to Mr. Cohen,” per the Wall Street Journal's Rebecca Ballhaus.

“Mr. Cohen won’t answer questions that touch on [Mueller’s] investigation into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. election, according to a person close to Mr. Cohen,” per the Wall Street Journal's Rebecca Ballhaus. Top Republicans on Oversight, Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), wrote a letter to Cummings Tuesday, accusing him of being “out to attack the president for partisan gain,” noting that Cohen had previously lied to Congress. ""They said they intended to question Mr. Cohen about his 'conduct throughout his professional life and any other financial dealings he has had, including with his father-in-law,'"" Ballhaus reports.

Cohen was also granted a two-month extension to begin his prison sentence reached after pleading guilty to lying to Congress, following a shoulder surgery and is now set to start his three-year jail stint on May 6.

""SUBSTANTIAL GAPS”: When Mueller is issuing his report next week and Cohen is testifying before Congress, President Trump is slated to be in Vietnam for his second nuclear summit with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un. My colleagues John Hudson and David Nakamura report that Trump's special envoy to North Korea Stephen Biegun, a former Ford lobbyist and one-time foreign policy adviser to Sarah Palin, arrived in Hanoi late last night in order to ""close substantial gaps"" ahead of Trump and Kim's meeting.

“The challenge for Biegun in meeting his counterpart, Kim Hyok Chol, will be to try to clinch a detailed agreement that can satisfy Trump’s desire for a historic deal but one that can withstand the scrutiny of detractors, including national security adviser John Bolton and others, who warn that Pyongyang is not to be trusted,” Hudson and Nakamura report.

However, Biegun has faced internal resistance from hawkish members of the administration like Bolton who has “fiercely opposed this 'step-by-step' process in favor of maintaining maximum pressure through economic sanctions that would in theory force a better deal by eroding North Korea's resolve.""

Shot: “Bolton has fretted privately that Biegun’s team is too eager for a deal and he continues to believe the negotiations will fail, according to people familiar with the deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the tensions within the administration,” per Hudson and Nakamura.

Chaser: “If you don’t like this approach, then I don’t think you’re in favor of diplomacy — period. And it may be that Bolton isn’t,” said Tod Lindberg, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute. “This is what good diplomacy looks like.”

Trump, for his part, sounded optimistic about the summit, telling reporters: “Chairman Kim and I have a very good relationship. I wouldn’t be surprised to see something work out."" He said on Tuesday that he's in “no rush whatsoever” on North Korean denuclearization.

Earlier yesterday, Trump spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. A Japanese official told us that Abe asked Trump to “extend support to the Prime Minister in resolving the abduction issue just like at the first summit meeting in Singapore by sending Abe's intention to Kim Jong Un.” The two will speak again after the Vietnam summit.

Presumably in response to reports that Trump is considering firing Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats (after he publicly contradicted Trump on the prospects of reaching a disarmament agreement with North Korea), Sen. Susan Collins (R-Ma.) tweeted the below:

DNI Dan Coats is a good friend, former Senate colleague, and leader of integrity who has always served our country well. We are fortunate to have a person of his ability and candor to lead our intelligence community. — Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) February 20, 2019

When asked about replacing Coats in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump told reporters, ""I haven't even thought about it.""

ISRAEL: “EQUIVALENT TO A U.S. PRESIDENT CUTTING A POLITICAL DEAL WITH DAVID DUKE”: Barak Ravid of Israel's Channel 13 news/ Axios reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu successfully formed an “ultra right-wing party that will run in the April 9 elections, paving the way for Jewish supremacists from the 'Jewish Power' party to make it into the next Knesset.”

Ravid called the move “an unprecedented development in Israel's history and is equivalent to a U.S. president cutting a political deal with David Duke, the former KKK leader.”

“The prime minister and the ruling Likud Party are legitimizing a racist, xenophobic and homophobic fringe party in hopes of bolstering a right-wing bloc after the elections,” Ravid added.

“Jewish Power” was formed by the followers of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the former leader of the Kach party, which was banned from running in Israel's 1988 elections and designated a terror organization by the Israeli government in 1994. Kach was also blacklisted as a terrorist organization in the U.S., Canada and the EU.”

VENEZUELA: The standoff continues between President Nicolás Maduro and Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader who declared himself Venezuela’s legitimate leader last month, as the crisis in the country deepens.

The New York Times's Nicholas Casey reports that ahead of a Saturday deadline by the Trump administration and the opposition to “end a blockade and allow the delivery of humanitarian aid that has been piling up at the country’s borders for more than a week,” the government closed its borders “to air and sea traffic from three caribbean islands in an effort to block aid shipments to the country organized by the Venezuelan opposition.”

Maduro continues to deny there is a humanitarian crisis and is staging a dueling concert after billionaire Richard Branson announced he’d be throwing “an aid concert in Colombia on Friday to benefit Venezuelans suffering food and medicine shortages amid their country’s economic crisis,” per the Associated Press’s Luis Andres Henao.

“Branson told [the AP] that the concert he’s throwing on Friday will save lives by raising money for 'much-needed medical help' and other aid for crisis-torn Venezuela. Minutes later, Maduro’s government announced what it called a “massive” concert for Friday and Saturday on the Venezuelan side of the border,” Henao reports.

SYRIA: My colleagues Karen DeYoung and Missy Ryan report that our European allies are refusing to replace American forces with their own troops in Syria and won't stay there unless Trump reverses his hastily announced withdrawal order with which senior Pentagon officials have publicly disagreed.

“As the deadline approaches for the withdrawal of U.S. forces fighting the Islamic State in Syria, America’s closest European allies have turned down a Trump administration request to fill the gap with their own troops, according to U.S. and foreign officials.”

“Allies have 'unanimously' told the United States that they 'won’t stay if you pull out,' a senior administration official said. France and Britain are the only other countries with troops on the ground in the U.S.-led coalition battling the Islamic State,” per DeYoung and Ryan.

230,Empty,2019-02-20T20:00:00Z,"Divorce in Turkey is on the rise, even as President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's government offers tax-breaks and incentives to women to get married and start a family. Despite those efforts, women are getting married older and the rate of marriage is declining.","A version of this story originally appeared on NYR Daily, the online section of The New York Review of Books.

Nebiye A. crossed the Bosphorus on a ferry, far from the home and life she once had. On her way to a meeting, Nebiye’s short hair — once wrapped in a headscarf —blows in the wind. In Istanbul, this chaotic, ancient city of 15 million people, Nebiye feels free. But beyond the sea, in the hinterlands of Anatolia, not long ago, Nebiye had another life as a married woman, one much closer to that of her mother, and her mother before her.

Petite, with a shy smile and freckles, Nebiye, who said that revealing her last name would put her family’s dignity at risk, married at the age of 22, right after graduating from university. Two years later, she left her husband, which meant standing up to her family as well as braving the stigma of divorce in Turkey. “My father told me that he would disown me because I was doing something that God does not agree with. My mom said that she would disown me if I went to live by myself in Istanbul after my divorce,” Nebiye told me, as she drew on a cigarette.

Now six years later, Nebiye, 30, is no longer in contact with her family. But she has gained a freedom and sense of empowerment that is emblematic of what women are achieving in today’s Turkey and across much of the Islamic world.

Divorce — though originally sanctioned more than 1,400 years ago by Islamic law — is still widely viewed in Muslim societies as a subversive act that breaks up the family. Women who seek divorce can often find themselves ostracized and treated as immoral. Despite such taboos and restrictions, however, divorce rates are rising across Islamic countries, even in ultra-conservative places like Afghanistan.

Turkey, in particular, is seeing a record number of divorces, as both women and men are looking for a way out of unhappy and sometimes abusive marriages. Over the past 15 years, the divorce rate has risen from under 15 percent of marriages to nearly a quarter of them. Domestic violence is almost always cited as a leading reason by Turkish women seeking a divorce. This is true even outside urban areas, which have also seen a slight growth in divorce cases; increasingly, women are willing to seek divorces in smaller, religious towns such as Konya, in central Anatolia, where Nebiye was raised. More of these girls and women also now have access to education and online information.

Ipek Bozkurt, an outspoken women’s rights activist and Istanbul-based divorce lawyer, told me that one reason for this change in social norms is that more women are working, and they are more aware of their rights. “They’re so fed up with their marriages and the treatment they receive, the treatment their kids receive, all the physical and psychological pressure that they have suffered,” she said. “They’re just willing to let that marriage go.”

""They’re so fed up with their marriages and the treatment they receive, the treatment their kids receive, all the physical and psychological pressure that they have suffered."" Ipek Bozkurt, women’s rights activist and divorce lawyer

Turkey is a predominantly Muslim country governed by secular laws. Women here have equal rights to property and are eligible for alimony after divorce. But over its 17-yearslong rule, Turkey’s conservative Justice and Development Party or AKP government has pushed a strong family values agenda: women should get married and have three kids, according to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Turkey provides incentives for married couples such as a tax break, and women who work part-time can get subsidized childcare. Despite such measures — and to the government’s dismay — the rate of marriage has declined by 27 percent over the AKP’s tenure, and women are choosing to marry at an older age. In large part, this is an unintended consequence of Erdoğan’s economic policies, which produced a long boom from 2002 to 2012 that saw women entering the urban workforce in unprecedented numbers.

In November, speaking to a roomful of his women supporters at a “gender justice” summit, Erdoğan boasted of presiding over an increase in the proportion of women in the workforce, up from 28 percent in 2002 to 38 percent today. At the same conference, Zehra Zümrüt Selçuk, the minister of family, labor, and social services, insisted that the government was working hard to encourage marriage and prevent divorce, but she balanced her message with an appeal to women’s growing desire for independence. “Our primary goal,” she said, “is to minimize and solve the problems encountered by the family and to protect its unity without ignoring the rights of the individuals.”

Her department used to be known as the ministry for women and family; that name had changed in 2011 — a move intended as a snub, in fact, to women’s rights advocates and to bolster the family values agenda before a general election. At the November summit, Erdoğan’s eldest daughter, Esra Albayrak, criticized Western women’s rights as self-indulgent. She echoed her father’s message that Turkey needs to find its own solutions to gender issues, with a focus on women’s traditional roles as mothers, sisters, and daughters. Albayrak and her conservative allies are fighting a rearguard action against the social changes that are making divorce more acceptable and easier. And last year, Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gül defended Turkish men who’ve been complaining about what they see as the injustice of being obliged to make lifelong alimony payments to their ex-wives.

The AKP commissioned a parliamentary report on how to tackle the rising divorce rate. When it was published, in May 2016, one of the document’s main recommendations was that if a married woman required extended police protection, such as a restraining order against her abusive husband, she would have to provide proof of his violence. Other proposals included advising judges presiding in divorce cases to refer couples to marriage counseling and that alimony payments should end after ten years.

The report received withering criticism from Turkish feminists and women’s rights activists, and none of its recommendations were implemented — although the report did receive widespread coverage. Women’s groups argued that lower-income women with minimum wage jobs or single mothers cannot make ends meet without alimony. According to Taylan Acar, an assistant professor of sociology at Istanbul’s Bosphorus University who has studied divorce and marriage, the divorce rate remains moderate and there’s no crisis of the family in Turkey. But “it appears that [the government] has convinced the media and the society that divorce rates have reached crisis levels,” he wrote me.

Changes to the way official statistics are gathered have led to disputed assessments of how rapidly the divorce rate is going up. The government refers to data that appear to show sharp increases from 2000 to 2010, but independent experts argue that more recent administrative data show only a steady but moderate rise—and far from the crisis some in government describe.

Following the report, the government hired more marriage guidance counselors, though critics say that these government counselors, some of whom are imams or clerics, sometimes send wives back to abusive husbands. Bozkurt, the lawyer, said the government is in denial about the real reasons behind domestic violence. “Women’s organizations say that there is an increase in divorce because there is an increase in domestic violence,” she said. “On the other hand, the government says: since the women want to get a divorce, domestic violence has increased.”

It is true that femicide has grown steadily in Turkey over the last decade, with more than 2,000 women killed by their partners. Feminists say that the number of murders is up because more women are resisting inequality and abuse in their marriage, and reporting domestic violence more. Unfortunately, some men are retaliating with deadly violence, said Gülsüm Kav, the co-founder of We Will Stop Femicides, a women’s group that advocates for victims’ families and independently counts women homicides in Turkey. But the solution, activists argue, is not what the government says—that women should stay in abusive marriages and try to work things out with their husbands—but legal reform.

The problem in Turkish law is that the burden of proof in domestic violence cases falls on the victims, who, the women’s rights advocates argue, are treated like pariahs in the justice system.

The problem in Turkish law is that the burden of proof in domestic violence cases falls on the victims, who, the women’s rights advocates argue, are treated like pariahs in the justice system. If a man claims that his partner cursed him in an altercation or “provoked” him in some way, the judge all too often gives him, not her, the benefit of the doubt. Chloe Fairweather, a British filmmaker, is making a film about Turkish women who were beaten and shot after leaving their partners, Dying to Divorce.

“While there is often legislation to protect women, it is not always implemented,” she said. “There are often cultural barriers, too. Despite obvious violence, some of the women we met face disapproval from their families who feel [the women] are to blame for the violence they have experienced.”

In 2017, in spite of protests from secularists and feminists, lawmakers passed a measure to permit imams to wed couples, a move that opponents say inches the country toward Sharia law, institutionalizing inequality in marriage and divorce. Islamic practices such as polygamy, marriage under age eighteen, and a man’s right to divorce his wife simply by saying, “I divorce you,” three times, are outlawed under Turkey’s secular Constitution, but some couples, especially in conservative rural Anatolia, still live by these beliefs. Supporters of the new law tried to argue that it could help to decrease the number of child-bride marriages, which account for about 15 percent of marriages in the country, by increasing transparency and government oversight of religious weddings.

Nebiye left her home and religious family in Konya in 2008 to study theology at a private university in Istanbul. As a woman who wore a headscarf, Nebiye could not, at that time, attend a public university because Turkey’s secular Kemalist governments had outlawed their wearing at government institutions. The AKP overturned that law in 2010, the year before Nebiye graduated. Then she landed a job at a literary magazine, where she met the man she would marry.

“He was kind, intelligent, and not authoritarian like the other guys,” she told me. With their families’ approval, the couple were married — and moved away from Istanbul after he was hired as a university professor in a remote town near the Armenian border.

There were hints of problems from the beginning of their relationship, she says — he could be jealous — but the main reason Nebiye eventually wanted out of the marriage was sexual incompatibility. “In secular families, they [both men and women] can talk about sex and even experience it before marriage, but in conservative families, they don’t even talk about it with their mothers,” she explained. “Also, sex is usually for men’s pleasure. Women are just supposed to procreate.”

Nebiye eventually asked for a divorce, and her husband eventually agreed; their court proceedings at least were easy because they didn’t have children or property to dispute. But his family harassed her: her mother-in-law insisted the devil had come between them and her father-in-law would call late at night trying to change her mind.

The hardest part for Nebiye, though, was confronting her own family. Even now, she seemed uncomfortable talking about their negative reaction. She lit up another cigarette and let out a nervous laugh.

She moved back to Istanbul where her friends raised money for her to live on until she got a job. She also stopped wearing the headscarf she had worn since the age of 12. This was the last straw for her parents, who renounced her. “Of course, I miss my family,” she said, “but I don’t think it’s right for them to have disowned me in the name of God.”

Today, Nebiye is studying for a master’s in new media and working as an activist for labor rights. She feels a loneliness that comes with being single in Turkey and has trouble trusting men. She keeps in touch with her older sister, but aches for losing her parents in exchange for her freedom.

“The more educated women become, the more likely they want partners who are going to match and satisfy them not only economically, but also emotionally and intellectually,” explained Acar, the sociologist. “If not, they postpone marriage or choose to forgo [it] altogether.” It’s not just the divorce rate that is going up; over the last decade, the average age of marriage has risen from 23 to 25 for women.

Not all Turkish women have found Nebiye’s path open to them. I met Nursel Öztürk, a Canadian-Turkish anthropology researcher, at an Istanbul shopping mall on a rainy day. Her field of study actually concerns the part Islamic traditions play in divorce carried out in the secular courts. Her interest is more than academic, perhaps — she had sought divorce herself, but withdrew her petition because the process was affecting her mental health and threatening her custody of the children. Today, the 41-year-old continues to live with her husband, a law professor in Istanbul, in a tense and unhappy silence.

“Women are sick and tired of being second-class citizens. I wanted to be treated like I matter,” she said, with visible anger.

Öztürk grew up in a secular home in Toronto, though her family made frequent visits to Turkey. When she turned 17, her father — without consulting his teenaged daughter — approved her marriage to her current husband, who was raised in Turkey. After the couple married, they also moved to Canada, and had four children. Öztürk studied as she raised her kids.

“I didn’t have any decision-making power with our children’s morals or education. Diapers and food were my job.” Nursel Öztürk, a Canadian-Turkish anthropology researcher

“I could be educated but had to do and think what my husband wanted,” she said. “I didn’t have any decision-making power with our children’s morals or education. Diapers and food were my job.”

Her husband eventually wanted to move back to Istanbul and work as an academic and, despite her misgivings, they did. The move put more stress on her marriage, and finally, after 24 years, she filed for divorce — though, after getting bogged down in disputes, she eventually abandoned the effort. In Öztürk’s embittered view, Turkey’s secular tradition pays lip service to women’s rights but the reality falls far short.

For Tanyar Ablak, a fit 50 year-old who runs a small business in Istanbul selling honey and dairy, things have gone more smoothly. He has been divorced twice, and both times the process was easy. “Everyone thinks that the woman is the victim in Turkey because she’s the one who is excluded and beaten up, who’s left alone — and a lot of times, it is like that,” he said. “But men can be oppressed in the process as well.” He meant that marriage places so much emphasis on the family that it doesn’t allow for individual development. “Unfortunately, this is our tradition,” he said.

Aware, though, of his privilege as a man in Turkey, where there is little pressure on men to contribute in the home, he is trying to do things differently. He has a girlfriend, but lives across the hall from his ex-wife, who’s also the mother of his son. They’re co-parenting and sometimes they eat the meals that he cooks together as a family.

As the country urbanizes, it is struggling to manage its relationship to modernity within the traditional institution of marriage. Turkey’s AKP government is threatened by liberal ideas, but change is coming — has come already.

“Women will not take it anymore,” Nebiye said.

This septic isle It never rains A delay by UK Prime Minister Theresa May to allow Parliament to vote on her Brexit deal has increased the chances Britain will leave the bloc without a deal in March. The odds on a no-deal Brexit have shortened to 2/1, according to oddschecker.com, while Steve Eisman, the trader whose prediction of the 2008 crisis was dramatized in the film The Big Short, is betting against UK banks.

This septic isle Money where your mouth is The IMF says that while some sectors like agriculture and mining might benefit, the majority of sectors would shrink by between about 1 percent and 33 percent. The Bank of England said no-deal would wipe between 4.75 percent and 7.75 percent off what the UK would have produced by 2024 and the pound would fall by 25 percent.

This septic isle Not waving, but drowning The EU has said the UK would have ""third country"" status under a no-deal scenario, giving it the same status as China, Russia and Pakistan. All goods crossing EU borders would be subject to tariffs of up to 38 percent. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said additional paperwork attached to trading under WTO rules would act as an extra tariff of up to an average of 6.5 percent.

This septic isle Love's labor lost Britain’s farmers and manufacturers face the largest shortage of skilled workers since 1989 due to a fall in the numbers of EU27 nationals coming to work since the Brexit vote. A no deal would likely accelerate that process.

This septic isle A road to nowhere The financial industry and British regulators say a hard Brexit poses a threat to trillions of euros worth of derivative and insurance contracts London could lose up to to €800 billion to Frankfurt, lobby group Frankfurt Main Finance has said. Some 30 banks and financial firms have already chosen the city as the site of their new EU headquarters, with others opting for Dublin or Paris.

This septic isle Movers and shakers left in limbo No-deal would have significant implications for people's ability to go where they want. A €7 charge for visiting the EU's Schengen Area would kick in in 2021, after the UK's transition period ends. British expats would face uncertainty, as many foreign governments have not yet established their rules for residency under no-deal.

This septic isle Can't beat a good queue The UK Road Haulage Association has said a lack of planning over no-deal would mean the manufacturing sector would be put under ""severe pressure"" and hauliers would go out of business. European airports have warned that no-deal would cause ""major disruption and heightened safety risks"" to the air network. Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary has warned planes could be grounded.

This septic isle All in it together The biggest impact of no deal could be felt in Ireland, which exports 12 percent of its goods and 40 percent of its food to the UK, and two-thirds of its other exports travel through the UK. The IMF believes the Netherlands, Denmark, the Czech Republic and Belgium also face taking moderate hits to their economies of between 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent.

This septic isle Where there is harmony, May brings discord The Police Federation has said it was worried about ""widescale disruption and dangers for the general public."" Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has said 3,500 troops are on standby to cope with the fallout of no deal. The government is preparing for potential shortages of key items in the wake of a no-deal Brexit. But May refused to guarantee the health service (NHS) would have enough medicines.

This septic isle Christmas-voting turkeys play chicken in Ireland The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would remain unresolved with no deal. The main sticking point has been the Irish 'backstop' — the insurance scheme for avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. One solution has been a Canada-style agreement that would remove most EU restrictions but would not abolish the need for a hard border. But uncertainty breeds fear. Author: Jo Harper



Leaving Britain

Honda's rival Japanese carmaker Nissan announced earlier this month that it was canceling plans to build the X-Trail SUV in the northeastern town of Sunderland. Nissan said explicitly that uncertainty around Brexit was a factor in its decision.

The absence of a withdrawal agreement — a so-called no deal Brexit — would likely mean the imposition of customs checks and tariffs as products enter and leave the UK.

The supply chain for most British cars crosses the channel several times as parts are shipped back and forth as part of a ""just in time"" supply arrangement.

Last week, the carmaker Ford said such a scenario would be ""catastrophic for the UK auto industry and Ford's manufacturing operations in the country.""

Meanwhile on Monday, Mercedes Formula One chief Toto Wolff said a no-deal Brexit could be a ""nightmare scenario"" for motorsports teams based in Britain.

""The way we get parts and services is just in time at the last minute ... taxes would massively damage the Formula 1 industry in the UK,"" Wolff said.

Visa and right-to-work worries were also high on Wolff's list of concerns, given the ""26 nationalities in our team"" who travel to several European races in the course of a season. Mercedes, a team ultimately funded in Stuttgart, but run out of factories in Brackley and Brixworth, is arguably the most obvious example of British F1 teams' ties to continental Europe.

Little time remaining

Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney on Monday expressed frustration at the failure of Britain to ratify a deal it struck with Brussels in November.

""We have less than 40 days to go until the United Kingdom formally leaves the European Union, and we still don't know what the British government is actually asking for to actually get this deal ratified,"" said Coveney, who is also Ireland foreign minister, after holding more talks with EU colleagues in Brussels.

The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnieron Monday evening met the UK's Brexit minister Stephen Barclay and Britain's attorney general Geoffrey Cox as the search went on for a way to avoid a no-deal Brexit.

Prime Minister May has so far been unable to pass the Brexit agreement reached in December through the British parliament. Among the major sticking points is a failure to agree arrangements on the border between Britain and Northern Ireland should the regulatory arrangements between the two countries diverge.

The most immense and dangerous public scandal in American history is finally cracking open like a ripe pomegranate. The broad swath of the Trump-hating media that has participated in what has amounted to an unconstitutional attempt to overthrow the government are reduced to reporting the events and revelations of the scandal in which they have been complicit, in a po-faced ho-hum manner to impart to the misinformed public that this is as routine as stock market fluctuations or the burning of an American flag in Tehran.

For more than two years, the United States and the world have had two competing narratives: that an elected president of the United States was a Russian agent whom the Kremlin helped elect; and its rival narrative that senior officials of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and other national intelligence organizations had repeatedly lied under oath, misinformed federal officials, and meddled in partisan political matters illegally and unconstitutionally and had effectively tried to influence the outcome of a presidential election, and then undo its result by falsely propagating the first narrative. It is now obvious and indisputable that the second narrative is the correct one.

The Greatest Constitutional Crisis Since the Civil War

The most immense and dangerous public scandal in American history is finally cracking open like a ripe pomegranate. The broad swath of the Trump-hating media that has participated in what has amounted to an unconstitutional attempt to overthrow the government are reduced to reporting the events and revelations of the scandal in which they have been complicit, in a po-faced ho-hum manner to impart to the misinformed public that this is as routine as stock market fluctuations or the burning of an American flag in Tehran.

For more than two years, the United States and the world have had two competing narratives: that an elected president of the United States was a Russian agent whom the Kremlin helped elect; and its rival narrative that senior officials of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and other national intelligence organizations had repeatedly lied under oath, misinformed federal officials, and meddled in partisan political matters illegally and unconstitutionally and had effectively tried to influence the outcome of a presidential election, and then undo its result by falsely propagating the first narrative. It is now obvious and indisputable that the second narrative is the correct one.

The authors, accomplices, and dupes of this attempted overthrow of constitutional government are now well along in reciting their misconduct without embarrassment or remorse becausein fired FBI Director James Comeys formulationa higher duty than the oath they swore to uphold the Constitution compelled them. Orin fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabes wordsthe threat was too great. Nevermind that the nature of the threat was that the people might elect someone he and Comey disapproved of as president, and that that person might actually serve his term, as elected.

A Long List of Offendersand Offenses

The extent of the criminal misconduct of the former law enforcement and intelligence chiefs is now notorious, but to make the right point here, it has to be summarized. The fact that the officially preferred candidate lied to federal officials about her emails and acted in outright contempt of Congress and the legal process in the destruction of evidence, was simply ignored by the FBI director, who announced that she would not be prosecuted, though he had no authority to make that determination.

The dossier of salacious gossip and defamatory falsehoods amassed by a retired British spy from the lowest grade of intelligence sources in Russia, commissioned and paid for by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, was circulated to the media by high public officials and cited in illegal and dishonest applications to authorize surveillance of the campaign of the other presidential candidate. A special counsel was empowered on the false pretext of the necessity to get to the bottom of Trump-Russian collusion in the election, of which there was and remains no evidence, because it did not occur and was a complete partisan fabrication.

The special counsel then packed his staff with militant Clinton partisans, and acted very late and only when his hand was forced by the media to remove two officials who referred in texts to each other to the Bureaus ability to smear and provoke the impeachment of the winning candidate as an insurance policy against his filling the office to which he was elected.

Large sections of the media colluded with the Democratic campaign and produced the doctrine that anything was justifiable, no matter how dishonest, to destroy the incoming presidents reputation and damage him in public opinion polls to legitimize attempts to remove him from office. Large sections of the media deliberately deluged the public with stories they knew to be false about the new president and referred to him in terms of unprecedented vituperation in what purported to be reportage and not comment.

This unorganized but widespread campaign of defamation was taken up by a great number of ordinarily newsworthy celebrities and was accompanied by false, unresearched stories denigrating President Trumps supporters, such as the false claims about Catholic school students treatment of an elderly native American and the false claim that actor Jussie Smollett had been beaten up and reviled by Trump supporters. The former intelligence chiefs of the nation under President Obama repeatedly have accused this president of treason, the most heinous of all crimes, and have asserted with the authority of their former positions that the Russians determined the result of the 2016 presidential election. They knew this to be entirely false.

Distracting Public Attention

The special counsel has failed to find any evidence of the collusion and electoral interference that was the justification for establishing his inquiry, and the Democrats are already expressing disappointment in his failure to produce such evidence when the leading Democratic members of congressional investigative committees still robotically claim to have at least prima facie evidence of such collusion.

The dishonest attempt of much of the opposition and what even left-leaning media-monitoring organizations record as 90 percent of the national media, continued for more than two years to try to condition the country to believe that the president had committed the high crimes and misdemeanors required by the Constitution for impeachment and removal from office.

The special counsel, apart from smearing the president, distracted public attention from or tended to justify the ever more evident misconduct of the presidents enemies. And we now know that Comey, despite his higher duty, lied to the president about his not being a target of an FBI investigation, illegally leaked to the New York Times the contents of a self-serving memo he purloined from the government, and lied to Congress by claiming 245 times in one sitting to be ignorant of recent matters that no one of sound mind could have forgotten.

And now we have Andrew McCabes proud confirmation that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein not only continued the illegal counterintelligence investigation of President Trump, but actively discussed methods of securing his removal from office by deliberate misuse of a variety of laws, including the Emoluments Clause, the 25th Amendment to deal with mental incompetence, and the Logan Act of 1799, which has never been used successfully and has not been tested in 150 years.

Make Those Responsible Pay at the Polls

This entire monstrous travesty is finally coming apart without even waiting for the horrible disappointment of the special counsels inability to adduce a scrap of evidence to justify his replication of Torquemada as an inquisitor and of the Gestapo and KGB at rounding up and accusing unarmed individuals who were not flight risks. The collapse of this grotesque putsch, under the irresistible pressure of a functioning attorney general and Senate committees that are not hamstrung by NeverTrumpers, will cause a revulsion against the Democratic Party that will be seismic and prolonged.

The disgrace of their misconduct is profound and shocking. Richard Nixon, against whom there is no conclusive evidence that he broke any laws (although a number of people in his entourage did) never did anything like this. J. Edgar Hoover in 47 years at the head of the FBI and its predecessor organization, never tried to meddle in a presidential election. Those responsible will pay for this, including at the polls.

Without realizing the proportions of the emergency, America has survived the greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War. All those who legitimately oppose or dislike the president, including traditional high-brow Republicans who find him distasteful, should join in the condemnation of this largely criminal assault on democracy, and then, if they wish, go out and try to beat him fair and square, the good old-fashioned way, in a free election. But they must abide by the elections result.

Eleven members of Parliament have bolted the two main parties this week.","LONDON — For months, analysts have wondered when the grinding pressures of Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union would stretch political divisions and loyalties to the breaking point, possibly leading to a realignment of British politics.

That point may have come closer this week.

On Wednesday, three lawmakers quit Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party, joining eight rebels from the opposition Labour Party in a bold attempt to smash Britain’s entrenched two-party system for the first time in a generation.

It will not be easy. The group of 11 newly independent lawmakers have no policy platform, political organization or leader, and they will operate in an electoral system that makes it almost impossible for new parties to break through.

Still, analysts believe that conditions are ripe for a shift, amid public disenchantment at the handling of Brexit, fierce internal party rifts, and a perception that both main parties are pandering to their extremes.","Three Lawmakers Quit Britain’s Conservative Party, Joining Labour Defectors",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/world/europe/uk-conservative-party-independent-group.html
234,Empty,2019-02-25T19:00:57Z,Democratic candidates for the 2020 nomination must come out against the filibuster.,"It would take decades before senators realized that without such a motion, there was no way for a simple majority to forcibly end debate, what we now call “cloture.” It was possible for a single member to block anything he opposed, and it took unanimous consent to stop him.

The filibuster was born. But the small size of the Senate and informal rules around deliberation meant it wasn’t used in earnest until the late 19th century, as American politics became more polarized around party and ideology, and informal rules around speaking and debate could not accommodate the increased pace of activity in the chamber.

The modern filibuster began to take shape in 1917, when President Woodrow Wilson used war demands to pressure the Senate into adopting cloture and a supermajority threshold for ending debate (at the time, it required two-thirds of the Senate ). But even with reform, the filibuster remained a powerful tool for “tedious delays” and “contemptible compromises of the public good.”

In the 20th century, recalcitrant senators used the filibuster to block or delay anti-lynching laws, bans on poll taxes, bans on literacy tests, and other civil rights laws. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was nearly killed by a filibuster. In recent decades, routine use of the filibuster has made it difficult for presidents to pursue their agendas and for Congress to pass major legislation. In turn, it has obscured democratic accountability and made voters feel less efficacious — when voting majorities to power isn’t enough to change the way things are, it’s fair to wonder if electoral politics is worth the trouble.

We are long past the days of large, bipartisan majorities for ambitious, far-reaching legislation. Just three Republican senators backed the 2009 stimulus and not one voted for the Affordable Care Act. Critics see this as evidence these laws were too liberal, but in truth it reflects structural change in American politics. The parties are polarized and ideologically coherent; they offer fundamentally different visions for the direction of the country. A President Booker or Klobuchar might seek Republican support for their agendas, but they won’t likely find it. The legislative path for their policies — to say nothing of a Green New Deal or universal child care — will go entirely through the Democratic Party.

As it stands, Democrats would be lucky to win a Senate majority in 2020, much less the supermajority needed to end a filibuster. For the party to have any hope at actually implementing its agenda, the filibuster needs to be either reformed or eliminated. And the first step toward that is litigating the issue in public to help voters see the cost of preserving this rule, which could put pressure on other senators if a movement forms to end it.

The Senate was built to govern, not to spend its time in endless deliberation, and the legislative filibuster makes that difficult, if not impossible. It does so in ways that typically disadvantage progressives and reformers, and which will cripple the next Democratic administration, as it nearly did the previous one. Any potential political danger — Republicans could easily attack an anti-filibuster push as the first step toward taking away our cars, cows and airplanes — is outweighed by the power that comes with being able to credibly connect the election outcome to a particular policy. Give me the votes, and I’ll give you this plan.

If Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand or any of the other Democratic candidates are actually serious about their policy agendas, the only choice they have is to abandon their attachment to this arcane procedure and lead their party to a firm consensus against a rule that was never supposed to exist.

She made a point of thanking her more critical questioners, including Dale Swanson, a founder of the local conservative women’s coalition, for their presence and their questions.

“If you’re only walking into comfortable spaces and comfortable rooms,” she added, “you’re probably not doing your job.”

But Ms. Spanberger said she has had conversations with colleagues in more solid blue districts about the impact of both hard-line liberal policy and the tone of opposition, which have prompted her to emphasize in town halls, sometimes unprompted, that she is “absolutely not a socialist.”

“When people say things in snarky ways or disrespectful ways or flippant ways, that creates an issue in districts like ours,” she said. “It’s real easy to be kind of snarky in the majority.”

At a pair of town halls last week in the deeply Republican suburbs of Salt Lake City, Mr. McAdams, an affable and mild-mannered former Salt Lake County mayor, fielded pointed questions about whether he supports the Green New Deal and socialism. More broadly, constituents worried how their moderate congressman might fare in the same caucus as the liberal bomb throwers. Richard Hansen, a Republican county commissioner and one of the two dozen constituents who attended the town hall in Nephi, a mountain town of 6,000, shared a wish with the Utah Democrat: “I hope they don’t corrupt you.”

“They won’t,” Mr. McAdams pledged. “There have been some articles about this, a little bit of tension on the Democratic side: Are we going to veer to the far left or are we going to stay in the center? I don’t know where the Democratic Party will go, but I tell you what, I will stay in the center.

Education

One set of proposals Mr. Sanders presented in 2016 that drew widespread attention was the idea of making public colleges and universities tuition-free and significantly lowering student loan interest rates. He continued to highlight the cost of higher education in the months after the 2016 campaign.

A victim of his own success

As some of Mr. Sanders’s supporters have pointed out, the 2020 Democratic primary landscape looks far different than the one in 2016. This time, Mr. Sanders, an independent, will not be the only progressive opponent facing an establishment-backed front-runner. Instead, the 2020 Democratic primary field is already crowded with candidates, some who are newer to the national political scene than he is, and some who have embraced the very policies he championed in 2016.

[Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]

As The Times reported in December, Mr. Sanders is struggling to retain the support he garnered two years ago, when he was far less of a political star than he is today. His supporters have conceded that in some ways, Mr. Sanders is a victim of his own success.

“Ironically, Bernie’s agenda for working families will be the Democratic Party’s message in 2020, but he may not be the one leading the parade,” Bill Press, a talk show host who supported Mr. Sanders in 2016, said last year.

Recent turmoil

Mr. Sanders has also had a weak track record with black voters — a vital base in the Democratic Party — which could be a potential threat to his candidacy. On Sunday, The Times reported that interviews with nearly two dozen current and former advisers and staff members revealed an uneven commitment on the part of Mr. Sanders and his top advisers to organize and communicate effectively with black voters and leaders during his 2016 campaign.

And this year, Mr. Sanders is already dealing with another problem involving his 2016 staff: allegations from women who say they were mistreated or harassed during the campaign.

Trump believes he has a winning hand with the economy and frequently touts a low unemployment rate, strong growth and stock market gains since his 2016 election victory.

Democrats, who won ground in gubernatorial elections in 2018, are looking for ways to convert the messages that worked in those state contests into victory in the presidential election in 2020.

Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, who defeated incumbent Republican Scott Walker in one of the biggest upsets last year, said the unemployment rate in his state did not reflect the struggles faced by voters.

“Yes, we have a 3 percent unemployment rate, but we also have 800,000 families that are struggling just to put food on the table. ... We have a long way to go,” Evers said in Washington, where he attended a weekend meeting of Democratic and Republican governors from across the country.

Trump won Wisconsin by a close margin in the 2016 presidential election, and it is a major target for Democrats in 2020.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, elected last year in a state that only narrowly voted Democratic in the 2016 presidential election, said voters in his state are concerned about corporate gains not flowing down to workers.

“There is no doubt that Minnesotans and Americans are working harder and (are) more productive, but most of that gain has not been seen in the middle class,” Walz said.

Walz has endorsed U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a fellow Minnesotan, for the Democratic presidential nomination.

New Mexico’s governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, also elected last year, said Democrats needed to counter Trump’s message by talking about how low wages, expensive health insurance and rising costs are squeezing middle-class voters.

She said she was concerned about Democrats’ ability to articulate an effective message on the economy and show voters how their own policies encourage investment and well-paid jobs.

“I do worry. ... If Democrats around the country, including me, are not talking about those precise strategies ... I think we won’t get attention for the economic efforts that we’re making,” she said.

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, who has endorsed U.S. Senator Cory Booker, also of his state, for president, said Democrats should not abandon their message about social issues to talk about the economy.

“We don’t make economic progress without social progress, and likewise, you don’t make social progress without economic progress,” Murphy said.",U.S. Democrats seek ways to counter Trump's economic message,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-democrats-idUSKCN1QD0ZP
238,Empty,2019-02-23T15:38:58Z,The small grass-roots organization wants to replace more centrist Democrats with liberal candidates — and that has made some lawmakers uneasy.,"Waleed Shahid, Justice Democrats’ communications director, said primaries give the most involved, activist voters in solid blue districts the chance to choose what kind of Democrat they want representing them in Congress.

“It takes movements like ours to push parties to prioritize what the base wants and what the values of the party are,” Mr. Shahid said. “That is the role of our movement, to give a policy vision for this country to a party that often lacks a clear policy vision.”

A spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House Democrats, said its focus remained on defeating President Trump and expanding the current House majority. (The committee has announced a slate of 32 seats held by Republicans it intends to challenge.) Mr. Cuellar, asked last month about Justice Democrats’ challenge, reminded reporters that this would not be his first round beating back a primary opponent.

“What happened to the Democratic Party being a tent?” Mr. Cuellar said as he described a moderate Democratic constituency in his district, which stretches from the Mexican border to the suburbs of San Antonio. “An outside group that thinks they know southwest Texas politics better than I do are going to find out.”

Both supporters and opponents of Justice Democrats say that with the 2018 election barely in the rearview mirror, it is too early to assess how primary challenges might disrupt the Democratic field. But in a presidential year, when turnout in the primaries is often much higher than in midterm election seasons, Justice Democrats has the potential to be far more disruptive than it was in 2018, and the group and its allies are in a fighting mood.

“We should absolutely be allowed to contest what it means to be a Democrat,” Mr. McElwee said in an interview. “You can’t have a tent that includes both people of color and people who work to undermine the rights and humanity of people of color.” He pointed to Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, who defeated a more progressive Democrat, Tom Perriello, in the primary, only to be consumed in scandal for his use of blackface in the 1980s.

Liberal primary challengers are not new to the Democratic Party, but they can be costly.

Sanders, 77, announced his candidacy in a lengthy early morning email to supporters, pledging to build a vast grassroots movement to confront the special interests that he said dominate government and politics.

“Our campaign is about creating a government and economy that works for the many, not just the few,” Sanders said in the email, asking for 1 million people to sign up to start the effort.

The senator from Vermont launched his insurgent 2016 candidacy against Clinton as a long shot, but ended up capturing 23 state nominating contests and pushing the party to the left, generating tension between its establishment and liberal wings that has not entirely abated.

This time around, Sanders has been among the leaders in opinion polls of prospective 2020 candidates, but he faces a field more heavily populated with other liberal progressives touting many of the same ideas he brought into the party mainstream. That could make it harder to generate the same level of fervent support as four years ago.

He also is likely to face questions about his age and relevance in a party that is increasingly advancing more diverse and fresh voices, including those of women and minorities - groups that Sanders struggled to win over in 2016.

The primaries and caucuses that determine the party’s nominee begin in February 2020 in Iowa, and the Democratic winner is likely to face President Donald Trump, a Republican, in the general election in November.

Sanders has been an unsparing critic of Trump, and in his email he called him “the most dangerous president in modern American history.”

“We are running against a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and someone who is undermining American democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction,” Sanders said.

‘COMPLETING THE REVOLUTION’

Among those already in the Democratic race are fellow Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

“Together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution. Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for,” Sanders said in his email to supporters.

Sanders, a political independent and democratic socialist who caucuses with Democrats in the Senate, said he would push in his campaign for many of the same issues that powered his 2016 bid and resonated with younger voters, including universal healthcare, raising the minimum wage, and free public college tuition.

“Three years have come and gone. And, as a result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans,” he said.

A former mayor of Burlington, Vermont, Sanders won a U.S. House of Representatives seat in 1990, making him the first independent elected to the House in 40 years. In 2006, he won a U.S. Senate seat and in 2018 was voted in for a third six-year term.

His push against Clinton, a former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state, was notable because few Democrats seemed inclined to challenge her claim on the nomination. Sanders’ candidacy swiftly became a phenomenon, as he spoke to swelling crowds and garnered passionate support on social media.

Unlike Clinton, he refused to take money from corporate political action committees, or PACs, relying on a flood of small-dollar donations.

When he ultimately conceded and spoke at the Democratic National Convention in support of Clinton, some of his supporters booed.

The MPs Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen, and Anna Soubry on Wednesday said they had resigned from the Conservatives and joined the new Independent Group, which was started Monday by seven MPs who resigned from Labour this week and later joined by an eighth.

Business Insider reported on Tuesday that the Conservative trio were set to quit the party despite friends' pleading with them to stay.

Writing to May to inform her of their decision, they said the Conservative government had bowed too far to the demands of the Brexit-supporting European Research Group of Tory MPs and the Democratic Unionist Party.

""We no longer feel we can remain in the Party of a Government whose policies and priorities are so firmly in the grip of the ERG and DUP,"" they wrote.

""Brexit has re-defined the Conservative Party — undoing all the efforts to modernise it. There has been a dismal failure to stand up to the hard-line ERG which operates openly as a party within a party, with its own leader, whip and policy.""

Why did they jump?

DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty Images

Allen, Wollaston, and Soubry are joining a new bloc of MPs who are principally united by two things: disillusionment with the leadership of the Labour and Conservative parties, and opposition to Brexit.

Many of the Independent Group's members are leading supporters of the People's Vote campaign for a second Brexit referendum, having repeatedly implored the government to pursue a softer exit from the European Union.

May's refusal to adopt these positions, plus a widely shared belief that they would soon be ousted by an increasingly hardline, pro-Brexit party membership, led the trio to walk away.

An ally of Allen told Business Insider that they had emailed her earlier this week, ""begging her to stay"" in the party.

Figures in the ""moderate"" wing of the Tory Party are furious with Conservative Campaign Headquarters for failing to prevent former UK Independence Party supporters and hardline Brexiteers from flooding local parties nationwide.

Allen, Wollaston, and Soubry plus other Conservative MPs had all been threatened with deselection by party members.

Senegal has witnessed a flurry of inaugurations of ambitious, big-budget projects in the last few months, including a new train line, a new bridge and the imposing Museum of Black Civilisations.

Happily snipping the ribbons has been President Macky Sall, who is seeking a second term in office in elections on Sunday.

""I will be voting for the first time and my choice is Macky Sall,"" said Mouhamad Thiam speaking to the BBC at a campaign rally in support of the president in the town of Kaolack, about 225km (140 miles) east of the capital, Dakar.

""I think his record is positive, his programme is positive, his accomplishments are positive.""

But while the 57-year-old, who has been in office since 2012, is lauded by some for pulling off these schemes, many of which were initiated by his predecessors, others are more cynical about a more general lack of development.

These frustrations, and concerns that the electoral process is flawed, mean the incumbent may be surprised to see himself voted out of office.

In a country where nearly half the population lives below the poverty line many struggle to see how Mr Sall has improved their daily lives.

'Young people need jobs'

""These projects have no importance, it's all politics,"" said Mamadou Senghor, a motorbike taxi driver in Kaolack.

Senegal, where there have been three peaceful transitions of power since independence in 1960, has long been seen as a model of stability in the continent.

But a number of politicians and human rights groups have raised concerns ahead of this vote.

""Senegal is definitely not a model,"" says Oumar Touré, also known as ""Thiat"", who is a well-known rapper and activist in the country.

""Macky Sall has made our country regress democratically.""

Backlash

Many have criticised the Constitutional Council's decision to bar two main opposition candidates from running.

Both Khalifa Sall, the popular former mayor of Dakar, and Karim Wade, the son of the former president, were deemed ineligible to run because of corruption convictions.

As a result of the decision, neither of their two parties - the Socialist Party and Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) respectively - which have dominated the country's political landscape since independence, have candidates in the upcoming election.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Some are supporting Idrissa Seck, backed by Dakar's former mayor Khalifa Sall, who was not allowed to run

""The race is already fixed,"" says Thiat, who is also a founding member of Y'en a Marre (Enough is Enough), a pro-democracy activist group.

""The process is fraudulent because there are candidates who have been put in prison for political reasons which aren't in the interests of the Senegalese people - meaning that our justice system has been manipulated.""

The government denies those charges. But it is not the only criticism it has faced.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Ousmane Sonko is one of four challengers to President Sall

There was a backlash after a law was passed in 2018 requiring candidates to have a certain number of signatures from voters to be able to run.

As a result, only five candidates have been deemed eligible for the 24 February vote, compared to 12 in the last election.

The two top contenders apart from the incumbent are:

Idrissa Seck, a former prime minister who enjoys the backing of Mr Sall, Dakar's former mayor

Ousmane Sonko, a former tax inspector who is popular with the young

The remaining two candidates are El Hadji Issa Sall, who has a following among more religious and conservative voters and Madicke Niang, a former minister, who was once a close ally of former President Abdoulaye Wade, who lost the 2012 election.

Mr Wade has called on voters to boycott the vote, alleging it has been fixed in advance in favour of the incumbent.

The 92-year-old, who has been a leading political figure in the country since the late 1970s, is now calling on voters to attack polling stations, burn their voter cards and electoral rolls.

The government has warned that anyone involved in illegal action will be prosecuted, adding that Mr Wade's comments were irresponsible and subversive.

Mr Sall used to be a member of Mr Wade's PDS party, but he broke away to found his own coalition, APR-Yakaar.

In the run-off in 2012 he beat his former boss, who had been power for 12 years.

In the first round, Mr Wade had polled 34.8% and Mr Sall came second with 26.6%. But most of the other 12 candidates backed Mr Sall in the second round, securing his victory.

Bernie Sanders' announcement of another presidential bid reopens questions about whether the schism in the Democratic Party that arguably helped send Donald Trump to the White House will return to haunt it in 2020.

The self-described democratic socialist waged a surprisingly competitive race against Hillary Clinton by championing progressive policies such as Medicare for all. He quickly demonstrated that he's still got an enthusiastic following.

Sanders, 77, raised more than $4 million yesterday from almost 150,000 individual donors, making him by far the top fundraiser among Democratic contenders on day one of their presidential bids.

That could spell trouble for less seasoned progressives – such as senators Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren – who are competing for support from a similar slice of the electorate as they endeavor to win the party's nomination to challenge Trump.

Sanders' candidacy also revives concerns that the Democratic field – which is quickly swelling and could top 20 names – might stay split far into the nominating season, as the protracted Clinton-Sanders fight did in 2016.

A similar establishment-versus-progressive showdown this time carries an even more dangerous risk: hampering the Democrats’ efforts to deny Trump a second term.

Global Headlines

Deutsche worries | After the 2016 election, top Deutsche Bank executives were so concerned the Trump Organization might default on about $340 million of loans that they discussed extending repayment dates until after a possible second term ended, Gavin Finch, Steven Arons and Shahien Nasiripour report. Executives were leery of the potential public-relations disaster of going after a sitting president's assets. Trump’s dealings with the bank face heightened scrutiny now that Democrats control the House.

Kim's carrot | One potential bargaining chip that Kim Jong Un may bring to his planned summit next week with Trump is an offer to dismantle a sprawling complex nestled in the mountains north of Pyongyang that for nearly four decades has been the focus of North Korea's nuclear ambitions. There's just one catch: The aging plutonium plant is no longer crucial to building Kim’s arsenal, Youkyung Lee and Jon Herskovitz report.

Media threat | When Milan Jovanovic escaped a firebomb that engulfed his house, he became Serbia's latest journalist to come under attack in what opponents of President Aleksandar Vucic say is an increasingly hostile place for the press. The European Union aspirant has joined an unbroken strip of nations stretching from the Baltic to the Adriatic seas where populist parties have taken over state media and denounced critics as spreading lies.

Unforeseen consequences | When Zimbabweans celebrated wildly as their military ended the four-decade reign of Robert Mugabe just over a year ago, few expected the economic chaos and repression that followed. Perhaps they should have. Similar scenarios have played out across Africa and beyond – think Venezuela – when a strongman who's ruled for decades leaves the stage, giving new meaning to the old adage: Be careful what you wish for.

Amazon raid | Peru moved to shut down an illegal gold mine hub in the Amazon after years of expansion destroyed pristine rain forest and polluted rivers with mercury. The government sent 1,500 police and troops to the La Pampa area in a two-week crackdown aimed at eradicating mining from the area. La Pampa became Peru’s biggest source of illegal gold in recent years, as criminal gangs financed operations on an industrial scale.

(CNN) On Tuesday, House Republicans will take a crucial vote that will mark what the party is becoming at this crossroads in American history. President Donald Trump has invoked national emergency power to secure federal funds for a wall that Congress refused to pay for. He has done so based on an alleged crisis at the border that almost no reputable expert agrees is real.

""The President's actions are at odds with the overwhelming evidence in the public record, including the administration's own data and estimates,"" proclaimed 58 prominent ex-national security officials who oppose what the President is trying to do. They made this assertion -- to be entered into the Congressional Record -- in a 13-page joint statement issued Monday.

Even some Republican loyalists understand that if President Trump takes this step to finance a border wall, future presidents in both parties will have sufficient justification to enact policy to tackle their goals, including initiatives on climate change, without congressional support.

Congress has the power to stop President Trump if it wants to; it doesn't need the courts to step in. If the House and Senate vote for a resolution revoking this use of emergency power, with sufficient votes to override an expected presidential veto, Trump has to back down. Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976 , Congress gave itself the power to restrain the president.

But President Trump is tweeting out warnings to his fellow Republicans. ""I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,"" he tweeted Monday morning. In a follow up , he asked: ""Why on earth would any Republican vote not to put up a Wall or against Border Security. Please explain that to me?""

The good news for President Trump is that the odds are on his side. Most Republicans won't go along with Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Although a handful of Republicans have indicated they opposed the emergency declaration, most have not. The Democratic-controlled House is expected to pass legislation reversing Trump's emergency order, but it is not even likely that the resolution will make its way through the Senate, where the Republicans hold power.

This vote is the latest in a series of critical moments since January 2017 in which congressional Republicans have shown themselves to be the foundation of the Trump presidency rather than passive bystanders. Republicans have made active decisions that strengthened the President's hand or allowed him to use his authority in unprecedented fashion because it seemed to serve their political interest.

When Republicans did not censure President Trump after his stunning failure to fully condemn the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, the party showed that it had the President's back . When the party ended his controversial first year by voting in favor of Trump's massive corporate tax cut, it handed him a crucial legislative victory at a key point in his presidency -- one that greatly improved his standing with the Republican electorate.

When then-House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes released a memo making pointed accusations about the motives of the FBI, he and the Republicans on his committee joined in on the President's ongoing assault on law enforcement institutions -- an apparent attempt to discredit the investigations into his campaign and presidency.

Most recently, the Republicans allowed President Trump to shut down the federal government for the longest period in American history , even though the Senate had reached an agreement over the budget, so that the administration could score political points with the base. Government workers went without pay so that the party could start setting up for the 2020 campaign.

In announcing the deal to reopen the government, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced his support for the President turning to emergency power -- only days after expressing his staunch opposition to such a move.

This week's vote might be the most important of all these enabling moments. If the Republicans don't vote to stand between Trump and this aggressive use of presidential power, they are giving consent to the President to unilaterally siphon money from programs that Congress has funded into a program that Congress refused to support.

Republicans are increasingly erasing any daylight between themselves and President Trump, and it may be about to happen again. This is his party, and more importantly, this practice has been an active decision by Republican elected officials.

When Trump's presidency is over, Republicans will spend many years reckoning with the decisions they have made.

It’s a marriage that reached its peak during the presidency of Barack Obama.

She isn’t the only Democrat running for president with a critique of Big Tech. In fact, every major 2020 Democratic presidential candidate has issued some form of statement critical of the industry or introduced legislation that would crack down on its most abusive practices.

“For too long the big tech companies have been telling you, ‘Don’t worry! We’ve got your back!’ while your identities are being stolen and your data is mined,” Klobuchar said.

When Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) announced her candidacy for the 2020 Democratic Party presidential nomination, she did something that would have been unheard of in previous election cycles: She explicitly criticized Silicon Valley’s big technology companies.

Stephen Maturen via Getty Images Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) criticized the tech industry when she announced her bid for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.

Obama was the first president who really got Silicon Valley ― and Silicon Valley got him. He brought tech insiders to Washington to bring their new ideas into government and streamline inefficient and outdated government technology infrastructure. And political hands went through the revolving door to work for those same tech companies.

Hillary Clinton, Obama’s first secretary of state and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, made technology and the internet a central part of her foreign policy, advocating that tech adoption would advance democracy. Her presidential campaign’s tech policy was a “love letter to Silicon Valley,” according to Recode.

“Now, that’s over,” said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, an anti-monopoly think tank that has called for the government to break up Google, Facebook and Amazon. “Nobody thinks Big Tech is generally good ― or everybody has to at least acknowledge that they’re a problem. Nobody can say we need more Google in government.”

The Democratic Party’s diversion from Silicon Valley veneration to pointed criticism has coincided with a so-called “Techlash” ― the public backlash against tech industry abuses of user privacy, consumer protection and, most importantly, their market position.

Congress has spotlighted these abuses in a series of hearings over the past two years. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives faced questions from lawmakers about a range of issues, from foreign countries using their platforms to manipulate U.S. political sentiment to the failure to protect user privacy to whether or not the companies constituted monopolies.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), one leading Democratic presidential candidate, was out ahead of the pack in 2016 with a stinging critique of Big Tech.

She criticized Google, Apple and Amazon for using their platforms as “a tool to snuff out competition” and compared the tech giants to “too big to fail” financial institutions at an event at the New America Foundation, the Google-funded think tank whose then-chairman was ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The speech launched a row where Google complained to the think tank about the speech and eventually led to the expulsion of antitrust scholars there who would go on to found the Open Markets Institute.

Warren’s call for greater antitrust scrutiny of giant tech companies helped inform the Democratic Party’s adoption of anti-monopoly policies in its 2018 campaign platform. And many of her fellow candidates have since echoed her concerns.

Klobuchar has led on these anti-monopoly issues in the Senate from her perch as the ranking member on the antitrust subcommittee. She introduced legislation in 2017 that would ban companies with market capitalization above $100 billion from making any new acquisitions. While not specifically targeting Silicon Valley, the market cap limit in her bill would include the Big Four tech giants ― Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who announced his presidential bid on Tuesday, previously released a set of videos featuring Stacy Mitchell, an antitrust expert at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, explaining the impact of Amazon’s monopoly power.

Even 2020 candidates with strong tech ties like Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) have changed their tone. Booker has close ties to the industry from his time at Stanford University, raised $100 million in charitable donations from Facebook’s Zuckerberg to the Newark public school system, and previously ran a tech start-up. But he is now calling for regulators to consider breaking up companies like Google and criticized Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods.",It Won’t Be A Lovefest For Democrats And Silicon Valley in 2020,Huffpost.com,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democrats-2020-silicon-valley_n_5c6dd969e4b0e37a1ed48ff7

Bernie Sanders on Tuesday announced he's joining a crowded, diverse field of Democratic candidates for president in 2020.

Sanders confirmed his plans to run to Vermont Public Radio early Tuesday morning.

""I wanted to let the people of the state of Vermont know about this first,"" Sanders told VPR. ""And what I promise to do is, as I go around the country, is to take the values that all of us in Vermont are proud of — a belief in justice, in community, in grassroots politics, in town meetings — that's what I'm going to carry all over this country.""

During the interview, Sanders was asked whether he's a sound choice to be the ""face of the new Democratic Party"" given his age and other factors. Sanders is 77, and if elected in 2020, at 79, he would be the oldest president in US history.

""We saw in the 2018 election that Democrats were able to elect a lot of younger and more diverse candidates to the US House,"" VPR's Bob Kinzel said. ""So, what do you say to those people who argue that an older candidate like yourself really isn't the face of the new Democratic Party?""

""We have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender, and not by their age,"" Sanders said in response. ""I mean, I think we have got to try to move us toward a nondiscriminatory society, which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for.

""I have been very blessed in my life with good health,"" Sanders continued, adding: ""I'm very lucky that as a kid I was a long-distance runner, and I think I had and still have a great deal of energy. So I would ask people to look at the totality of who I am — my energy level, my record in the US Senate — and not just at one criterion.""

In an October interview with Politico, Sanders said his age would ""obviously"" be a ""factor"" if he decided to hop in the 2020 race.

""It's part of a discussion, but it has to be part of an overall view of what somebody is and what somebody has accomplished,"" Sanders said at the time. ""Look, you've got people who are 50 years of age who are not well, right? You've got people who are 90 years of age who are going to work every day doing excellent work. And obviously, age is a factor. But it depends on the overall health and well being of the individual.""

Sanders on Tuesday told VPR he's running for president again, after a notable but ultimately unsuccessful 2016 campaign, primarily for two reasons: to oppose President Donald Trump and to continue the movement focused on a progressive agenda he started three years ago.

""I think the current occupant of the White House is an embarrassment to our country,"" Sanders said. ""I think he is a pathological liar — every day, he is telling one lie or another.

""And it gives me no pleasure to say that, but I also think he is a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, somebody who is gaining cheap political points by trying to pick on minorities, often undocumented immigrants.""",Bernie 2020: Sanders addresses concerns about his age and how he’ll compete in a diverse field of candidates,Business Insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-2020-sanders-addresses-concerns-about-age-diversity-2019-2

Long after he lost the race, he kept touring the country, trying to prove that Democrats could speak to the regions now known as Trump Country (I followed Sanders on a tour of West Virginia, in 2017). That long campaign has been so successful that Sanders—who announced his 2020 candidacy on Tuesday morning—is now in a stronger but also more ambiguous position. He is a figure of international renown whose message and agenda—against the millionaires and billionaires, for Medicare for All and free college—has been adopted by much of the Democratic Party. That success has made Sanders, at seventy-seven, appear to be a transitional figure: not exactly an insider, but no longer an outsider. Not obviously of the future nor the past.

In an interview with the CBS journalist John Dickerson, broadcast Tuesday morning, Sanders sat in his Burlington, Vermont, living room, softly lit, in a suit and tie. Dickerson asked him about his present feelings on capitalism, and he both praised entrepreneurs and criticized excessive accumulations of wealth: “Someone wants to call me a radical? O.K., here it is. I believe that people are entitled to health care. I believe that people are entitled to get the best education they can. People are entitled to live in a clean environment. People are entitled to have decent paying jobs. That’s what I believe.” It was tempting to agree with him. It didn’t sound so radical—or distinct from the rest of the Democratic field.

In 2016, Sanders was the prophet of left-wing populism. Now he seems to have entered a post-prophetic phase. Meanwhile, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, who spent their early careers building establishment bona fides, have embraced the expansive social-welfare policies of the left. Kamala Harris, who was thought to be vulnerable to progressive attacks, has tried to correct course by winning high-profile left-wing endorsements, from the congresswoman Barbara Lee and the labor leader Dolores Huerta. Sanders has done more to shift the Democratic Party’s post-Cold War image than any politician besides Clinton and Obama, and he has helped to make a similarly historic transition in how many Americans see their own relationship with wealth. He is also a straight white man of nearly eighty, with a long record of hectoring in the Senate but a much shorter list of legislative accomplishments. Other candidates can embody the country’s changing demographics in ways that he cannot; Elizabeth Warren, with her precision and expertise, might be the choice to press a reformist policy agenda through the federal bureaucracy. What now?

One hint that Sanders is aware of his newly apparent weaknesses came earlier this month, in a report in The Atlantic, by Edward-Isaac Dovere: ”Sanders’s team has been eyeing Beto O’Rourke nervously,” Dovere wrote, “given the former Texas congressman’s strong online presence and appeal with many of the same types of voters that Sanders taps into.” It’s interesting that Sanders’s strategists would see O’Rourke, rather than the more ideologically similar Warren, as his chief rival. But perhaps they understand what was so essential to Sanders’s success in 2016: the feeling he was able to conjure among his supporters that they were taking part in something exciting and new.

Trump is attempting to convince US voters that Democrats want to shove socialism down their throats while contending that reelecting him will prevent that.

After Sen. Bernie Sanders —a self-declared democratic socialist— on Tuesday announced he's running for president again in 2020, the Trump campaign in a statement said: ""Bernie Sanders has already won the debate in the Democrat primary, because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism.""

In particular, the Trump camp is using the example of Venezuela to highlight the dangers of socialist policies.

""But the American people will reject an agenda of sky-high tax rates, government-run health care and coddling dictators like those in Venezuela,"" the campaign's statement on Sanders' continued. ""Only President Trump will keep America free, prosperous and safe.""

Trump is zeroing-in on socialism

Socialism has long been a dirty word in America's political discourse, largely since the Cold War and the anti-Soviet sentiments that permeated the US. Even as recently as 2011—years after the collapse of the Soviet Union — Pew Research Center found that 60% of Americans had a negative view of the word socialism, with just 31% giving the word a positive connotation.

Read more: Here's the difference between a 'socialist' and a 'Democratic socialist'

Trump has played on those long-held fears by repeatedly attacking the policies of Nicolas Maduro's government in Venezuela.

During his State of the Union address in early February, Trump said the US stands with the Venezuelan people ""in their noble quest for freedom"" as he condemned the ""brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.""

Trump echoed this sentiments in a speech on the Venezuela crisis at Florida International University on Monday. ""There's nothing less democratic than socialism,"" Trump said during the speech.

Trump is attempting to connect socialism to Democrats

In turn, Trump has also tried to connect the situation in Venezuela to Democrats.

""Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,"" Trump said during his State of the Union after he mentioned Venezuela. ""America was founded on liberty and independence — not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.""

Similarly, in his Venezuela speech in Florida, Trump said, ""To those who would try to impose socialism on the United States, we again deliver a very simple message: America will never be a socialist country.""

Read more: Trump is going all out to tie Democrats to his latest political boogeyman: socialism

The president seems to be directing this message at Democratic lawmakers like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the increasingly influential freshman congresswoman who's a self-described socialist, and Sanders. This left wing of the Democratic party has pushed for the implementation of policies such as universal healthcare (Medicare for All) and tuition-free college, which critics and advocates alike have linked to socialism.

While similar policies have been adopted in other developed countries without the collapse of democratic institutions or the eradication of capitalism, Trump has seized upon the negative connotations tied to socialism to suggest politicians like Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders are driving the US down a dangerous, more authoritarian road.

In a recent email to supporters, the Trump campaign said Sanders is running on a platform of ""FULL-BLOWN SOCIALISM."" The email warned that ""a new wave of radical socialist Democrats is coming.""

Responding to this email in a post on Instagram, Sanders said the president is ""scared"" because of the Vermont senator's record-setting fundraising on the first day of his campaign.

Some Democrats distance themselves from socialist label

Though socialism continues to be an incendiary topic in the US, Democratic voters appear to be warming up to it. An August 2018 Gallup poll found 57% of Democrats have a positive view of socialism, compared to just 16% of Republicans.

Many Americans seem to be quite open to Ocasio-Cortez's ideas as well, especially increasing taxes on the rich, despite attempts from Republicans and some centrist Democrats to dismiss the proposals as radical.

Read more: Nearly half of Americans support Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70% marginal tax on the super-rich, according a new poll

With that said, Democratic candidates for 2020 do not all openly embrace the label ""socialist"" or ""democratic socialist"" in the same way Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have.

Sen. Kamala Harris, widely considered a top contender, on Monday explicitly stated she is not a ""democratic socialist.""

Harris in an interview with NBC News on Tuesday also contended Medicare for All, which has gained momentum with Democratic lawmakers, is not socialism.

""No, no. It's about providing health care to all people,"" Harris, who's adopted Medicare for All as part of her 2020 platform, said during the interview.

Srinagar: The Peoples' Democratic Party (PDP) has demanded action against Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) professor Amit Singh for her tweets concerning party leader and former Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti. In a Twitter post, Singh had blamed Mufti for the Pulwama terror attack and said that the barricading for civilian vehicles implemented during her regime as J&K CM resulted in the February 14 attack on CRPF personnel. Singh went a step further and demanded that Mufti should 'hand over her 40 people for public execution if she really feels hurt for our 40 soldiers'.

The Sena said that it is not “helpless” and no “adjustment” was reached for power and that it gave “another chance” to the alliance after differences were sorted between the two parties.

The BJP and the Sena announced an alliance for Lok Sabha and Assembly election on Monday.

The Sena in an editorial in the party mouthpiece Saamana said that it looked at the “numbers” and the “new arrangement” like any other political party.

“In a parliamentary democracy, numbers have got more importance than it should. Therefore, like others, look at their numbers, we too have to do it, the editorial said. However, it added that it has not “turned the way the wind was blowing” and said that the “wind” is now in favour of the Sena.

The Shiv Sena justified that it never left the National Democratic Alliance. “Even a trusted ally like Nitish Kumar has quit the NDA twice. Nitish, who had attacked on Ram temple and Godhra, was not acceptable to Modi... if Nitish Kumar can come back into the NDA, then Shiv Sena has been an equal member of the NDA,” the editorial said.

The Sena has been at the receiving end after its U-turn to ally with the BJP which came after almost five years of constant criticism.

The editorial in the Marathi daily added, “The oppostion has a question on why the alliance happened... Amit Shah came to Matoshree. We told him what we wanted to convey in ‘Thackeray’ style. It was unanimously decided that what mistakes were committed earlier will not be repeated.” The Sena added that it maintained its “dignity and will continue to do so.”

It added that the 2014 “wave” is gone and the 2019 elections will have to be fought on “ideology, work and the future”. “There are new challenges before the NDA. It seems difficult that the BJP will be able to cross the majority mark on its own, and it has realised it two years back,” the Sena said through the mouthpiece.

8:10 p.m.

Bernie Sanders' campaign says he has raised more than $4 million in the 12 hours since announcing his 2020 presidential campaign.

The Vermont senator said Tuesday that nearly 150,000 individuals had contributed to his Democratic bid.

Previously, the biggest first-day fundraiser in the race had been California Sen. Kamala Harris, who raised $1.5 million in the first 24 hours of her campaign.

Sanders stunned the Democratic establishment in 2016 with his spirited challenge to Hillary Clinton. His campaign helped lay the groundwork for the leftward lurch that has dominated Democratic politics in the era of President Donald Trump.

The question now for Sanders is whether he can stand out in a crowded field of Democrats who embrace many of his policy ideas and who are newer to the national political stage.

6:20 p.m.

Bernie Sanders is setting a new fundraising bar for 2020 Democrats.

The Vermont senator raised $3.3 million on Tuesday from 120,000 individual donors in the first 10 hours after announcing his presidential campaign. That's according to a person familiar with the campaign who wasn't authorized to publicly disclose the early numbers and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

The fundraising haul is more than double the $1.5 million that Sen. Kamala Harris raised in the first 24 hours of her campaign. The California Democrat had been the biggest first-day fundraiser in the race so far.

President Donald Trump says that Bernie Sanders ran a great race for the presidency four years ago but that he believes the Vermont senator ""missed his time.""

The 77-year-old Sanders has announced that he'll take another crack at becoming the Democratic Party's presidential nominee in 2020.

Trump took a handful of questions Tuesday in the Oval Office, including on Sanders, while signing a policy directive establishing a Space Force.

Trump says, ""I like Bernie."" He says the senator was tough on trade like he was. He adds, however, that ""the problem is he doesn't know what to do about it. We're doing something very spectacular on trade.""

Trump notes that a lot of candidates are running for his job but says only one can win and predicted it will be him.

2:30 p.m.

On the first day of his presidential campaign, Bernie Sanders picked up the support of his fellow home-state senator, Democrat Patrick Leahy.

Leahy, who endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary, says he'll back Sanders this year.

In a statement, Leahy said the Democratic field was strong and ""Bernie's entry makes the field even stronger."" He called Sanders ""a proven leader with a strong message.""

Also supporting Sanders is Vermont Rep. Peter Welch, who also backed him in 2016.

Sanders is the sixth senator competing in the primary. He joins Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders raised more than $1 million within hours of launching his 2020 presidential bid.

That's according to a person familiar with the campaign who wasn't authorized to publicly disclose the early numbers and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. The numbers were amassed less than four hours after Sanders announced Tuesday morning that he would run again.

Sanders identifies as a democratic socialist and unsuccessfully challenged Hillary Clinton during the 2016 Democratic primary.

Few candidates seeking the 2020 Democratic nomination have voluntarily released early fundraising figures.

California Sen. Kamala (KAH'-mah-lah) Harris reported raising $1.5 million in the 24 hours after she launched her campaign last month. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (KLOH'-buh-shar) reported raising $1 million in the 48 hours after launching her campaign this month.

255,Empty,2019-02-20T11:00:00Z,Scandals reveal a party beset by infighting and whispers of conspiracies.,"But efforts to aid Fairfax through less than official means continued last week as well. On February 12, Politico reported that Watson was once the subject of a restraining order in 2008 in Maryland, after she allegedly harassed a man she’d been in a relationship with, and that she’d threatened “tearing him down.” Watson’s lawyer told Politico that the man “abandoned the effort after hearing from Ms. Watson’s lawyer.” Prior to Politico’s story, an anonymous email account sent scans of the restraining order to several outlets, including The Atlantic, indicating that the documents “might suggest a pattern of behavior.”

It’s unclear from whom or where the documents originated, but the email does point to the conspiratorial aura that the response to scandals surrounding Fairfax—and Virginia politics as a whole—has taken on, and the real fault lines that have now perhaps irrevocably divided Virginia’s Democrats. Fairfax and his allies say the allegations are part of a political attack. After Watson’s initial allegation, the lieutenant governor said that “a vicious and coordinated smear campaign is being orchestrated against me.” While a conservative blog did make the first reports that damaged both Northam and Fairfax—during a time when national outrage was focused on Northam for an awkward statement he delivered on late-term abortions—Fairfax has seemingly indicated that he believes that the hidden hand here is a Democratic one, not a Republican one.

After Tyson’s claims made their way to the Richmond rumor mill, the Collective PAC, which has supported and worked closely with Fairfax, implied that Northam and his allies were behind the propagation, tweeting, “Governor Northam’s team and advisors have now decided to start attacking Lt. Gov Justin Fairfax by spreading lies to reporters and state leaders,” presumably in order to draw fire away from Northam’s own scandal and make the prospect of replacing him less appealing.

Later, Fairfax and his associates pointed to a rival, Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, as a potential culprit. During a February 4 press conference, after a reporter asked whether Stoney, also a rising star within the state Democratic Party, might have some connection to Tyson’s allegation resurfacing, Fairfax responded obliquely, saying, “You’re great reporters, and you’ll get to digging, and you’ll get to make some connections.” It has also not escaped the notice of Fairfax’s advisers that state Senator Jennifer McClellan, whose husband, Dave Mills, headlined the recent exodus from Fairfax’s office after the second allegation, was the odds-on favorite among party insiders to be appointed lieutenant governor should Fairfax resign or be forced out.

Neither Stoney’s nor McClellan’s spokespeople have responded to requests for comment, although Stoney’s spokesperson did tell The Washington Post, “This insinuation is 100 percent not true.” But it is clear that—whether or not his claims of political interference and smear campaigns are vindicated—Fairfax’s plight exposes the internal workings of Richmond-area politics. The woman whose screenshots of Tyson’s claims were forwarded to Big League Politics, Adria Scharf, is married to a former Stoney adviser.* Fairfax’s election to lieutenant governor was widely seen as the final stepping stone in his ascendancy to the governorship in 2021, and Stoney—who is also black, and is three years younger than Fairfax—was one of the few politicians with the clout, story, and youth to challenge Fairfax’s meteoric rise. And now, with Northam facing an extended lame-duck period in his term-limited governorship, and with Fairfax’s and Herring’s chances of ever being nominated to become the Democrats’ choice for governor most likely undone, the chessboard atop the party now belongs to Stoney and McClellan.",The Virginia Democrats’ Warring Factions,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/northam-herring-and-fairfax-divide-virginia-democrats/583117/

Raises $4m from 150,000 donors in first 12 hours after launch

Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont whose 2016 presidential campaign helped energize the progressive movement and reshaped the Democratic party, has entered the 2020 race for the White House.

Sanders, a self-styled democratic socialist who spent much of his nearly 30-year congressional career on the political fringe, cast his candidacy as the best way to accomplish the mission he started three years ago when he ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.

“Together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution,” he said in an email announcing his decision to supporters on Tuesday morning. “Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.”

Sanders, 77, running as a Democrat again, believes he can prevail in a crowded and diverse field that includes several female and minority candidates, and then beat Donald Trump, whom he called on Tuesday “the most dangerous president in modern American history”.

Asked in an interview on CBS on Tuesday morning what would be different about his 2020 campaign, Sanders replied: “We’re gonna win.”

Whether he can once again capture grassroots support, and whether the energy of his past campaign will pass to other candidates, will likely be a central factor in determining who Democrats nominate to take on the sitting president.

The progressive policies Sanders helped popularize in 2016 – Medicare for All, a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, tuition-free college, demands to fight climate change more aggressively and to tax the wealthy at a higher rate – have now been broadly embraced by several other presidential candidates.

Sanders wrore: “Three years ago, during our 2016 campaign, when we brought forth our progressive agenda we were told that our ideas were ‘radical’ and ‘extreme’. Well, three years have come and gone. And, as result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans.”

Sanders will face opposition from moderate Democrats and from Republicans who are likely to use his candidacy to paint the party as too liberal. In a preview of Trump’s re-election campaign, the president used his State of the Union speech this month to warn against what he said was the creep of socialism in America.

Trump 2020 campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement: “Bernie Sanders has already won the debate in the Democrat primary, because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism.

“But the American people will reject an agenda of sky-high tax rates, government-run health care and coddling dictators like those in Venezuela. Only President Trump will keep America free, prosperous and safe.”

Sanders made clear on Tuesday that he plans to go after Trump directly in his campaign.

In an interview with Vermont Public Radio, where he first announced his bid, he said: “I think the current occupant of the White House is an embarrassment to our country. I think he is a pathological liar. I also think he is a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, somebody who is gaining cheap political points by trying to pick on minorities, often undocumented immigrants.”

After a midterm election cycle that saw women and minority candidates sweep to power, the nominating contest is likely to be fought not only over ideology but over identity and electoral strategy. Already, the 2020 candidates are being pushed on how they can appeal to the Democrats’ broad range of demographic groups, which includes working-class families, black and Latino voters, suburban women and young people.

This year, Sanders apologized publicly and privately to former female staffers after allegations of sexual harassment by male staffers on his 2016 campaign. He has also continued to stumble on questions about race, despite a years-long effort to improve his standing with minority voters.

Still, no candidate will enter the race with as many advantages as Sanders, who ended the 2016 primary with more than 13m votes and nearly $230m raised, much of it through small donations. Now he begins a second run not as a political outsider but as a top-tier candidate with near-universal name recognition, a dedicated following and an unrivaled donor list.",Bernie Sanders announces run for presidency in 2020: 'We're gonna win',Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/bernie-sanders-announces-run-presidency-114438691.html

And then there were 10.

Official Democratic presidential contenders, that is. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders announced his candidacy Tuesday morning, adding a prospect who at 77 is not only a generation older than most of the other hopefuls but also the only one with the experience of having run for president before.

Sanders’ bid stuns no one, given his challenge to Hillary Clinton for the nomination in 2016 that turned out to be more formidable than most pundits predicted. But there have been surprises in what is likely to be biggest presidential field in American political history unfolds.

1. It’s a different Democratic Party

CLOSE Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders announces his entry into crowded 2020 Democratic field for President. USA TODAY

Bernie Sanders lost the nomination last time around, but he won the party.

""We were told that our ideas were radical and they were extreme,"" Sanders said in his announcement video, underscoring the point by making quotation marks in the air around the derisive adjectives. ""Well, three years have come and gone, and as a result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans.""

Proposals he made that seemed controversial then — Medicare For All, which Hillary Clinton had dismissed as a pipe dream, and free tuition at public colleges — are now in the Democratic mainstream as the ideological center of the party has moved left. Indeed, progressives now looking for a champion have choices this time beyond Sanders, who describes himself as a Democratic socialist.

California Sen. Kamala Harris says she’s open to eliminating all private health insurance if a single-payer, government-run system could be created. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, decrying an economic system that she argues is “rigged” against working people, is calling for a populist “wealth tax” on the rich, a 2 percent charge on the holdings of those who have more than $50 million in assets.

That said, cracks are forming among the candidates over just how far left to go, especially as Trump paints the opposition party as radical socialists who would threaten traditional American values. “They’re slipping extremely far left,” the president warned at a Cabinet meeting last week. “We don’t want that to happen to our country.”

The ambitious “Green New Deal,” a nonbinding resolution unveiled by freshman New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and veteran Massachusetts Sen. Edward Markey, could become a wedge between those who view it as an agenda and those who see it as an aspiration. It includes provisions to not only to address climate change but also to broaden the social safety net for Americans.

""I will tell you, I'm not a Democratic socialist,"" Harris told reporters in New Hampshire Monday. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., also sounded a note of caution, calling the Green New Deal ""the right place to begin.""

2. The candidates are more diverse

Here’s another surprise: Of the 10 formal candidates so far, only two are straight white men. Put another way, eight of the 10 don’t fit the mold set by 43 of the previous 44 U.S. presidents. Four are women. Two are African-American. One is Hispanic. One is openly gay.

Buttigieg — who finesses the challenge of pronouncing his last name by introducing himself as “Mayor Pete” — exemplifies the redefinition of who could be seen as a credible contender. For one thing, he’s 37 years old; the youngest president, Teddy Roosevelt, was 42 when he took office. For another, Buttigieg is not a prominent senator or a governor but rather the mayor of a city of 102,000 Hoosiers. And he’s gay.

He has a standard response when interviewers ask him if America is ready to elect a gay president. “There’s only one way to find out,” he replies.

By the way, his husband, Chasten Buttigieg, has suggested pronouncing it “boot-edge-edge.” Or possibly “buddha-judge.” Or maybe “boot-a-judge.”

3. Standing in the snow can be smart politics

Former vice president Walter Mondale told Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar he couldn’t quite believe she had scheduled her campaign announcement outdoors, in their native Minnesota, in February. While he’s endorsed her, the 91-year-old didn’t show up on Boom Island, but a blizzard did, blanketing Klobuchar’s uncovered head in a veil of snow as she declared her candidacy.

But what might have seemed like an advance planner's disaster turned out to be a political gold. Klobuchar came across as full of grit and good humor, despite the fierce weather — not bad qualities for a candidate to exhibit. Little known outside the North Star State, and dinged by stories that portray her as a tough boss, the photo of her battling the elements with a smile was a friendly first introduction to many voters.

That’s a good thing when authenticity is a calling card in politics today.

“By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!” President Trump, apparently unpersuaded, mocked in a tweet. She tweeted back: “And I wonder how your hair would fare in a blizzard?”

4. What is that guy’s name again?

Trump, that is.

Klobuchar didn’t mention the president's name when she formally announced her candidacy, though she may have had him in mind when she said Americans were “tired of the shutdowns and the showdowns, the gridlock and the grandstanding.” Warren didn’t mention his name, either, in the 4½ minute video she posted announcing formation of her exploratory committee.

Trump and just about everybody else expects him to be the Republican nominee, and the fevered opposition to him has fueled everything about the 2020 race.

But the lesson many take from the 2018 midterm elections and the 1998 midterms, waged during the impeachment of President Clinton, is that voters care more about what's going on in their own lives than the scandal engulfing a president. Most of the candidates have tried to emphasize what they're for, not just whom they're against.

While Sanders did target Trump by name, he also said that wasn't the only point. ""Our campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history,"" he said. ""Our campaign is about transforming our country.""

By John Whitesides

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bernie Sanders is back for another White House run, but this one promises to be far different than the improbable 2016 presidential campaign that made the Vermont senator a political force.

In the 2020 race, Sanders, who announced his latest bid on Tuesday, will have to fight to stand out in a crowded field of progressives touting issues he brought into the Democratic Party mainstream four years ago. At 77, he also will face questions about his age and relevance in a party increasingly embracing more diverse and fresh voices.

While many of his supporters are sticking with him, some are waiting to see how the Democratic field seeking to challenge Republican President Donald Trump shapes up.

""2020 is not 2016. He had his moment and 2020 may not be his moment,"" said Ron Abramson, a New Hampshire immigration lawyer and a Sanders delegate to the 2016 Democratic nominating convention who now is undecided.

Sanders enters the race with clear strengths: broad name recognition, an ability to raise money from small-dollar donors and passionate supporters who flocked to his insurgent 2016 campaign against one of the best-known figures in American politics, Hillary Clinton.

Sanders, an independent democratic socialist who aligns with Democrats in the Senate, pushed Clinton and the party to the left in 2016 and drew fervent support from young and liberal voters with an agenda supporting universal healthcare, raising the hourly minimum wage to $15 and free public college tuition.

Those are mainstream positions for the party now, with Democratic presidential contenders including fellow Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker promoting similar views.

""Some of us get to open doors and others get to walk through them,"" said Arnie Arnesen, a liberal radio host and former New Hampshire state legislator who calls herself a Sanders admirer. ""Bernie opened the door for progressive politics, but I think he has to recognize there are new voices and a new bench.""

Sanders also will face lingering resentment in some Democratic quarters over the 2016 campaign. His challenge to eventual nominee Clinton split the party and generated tension between its establishment and liberal wings that still exists.

DIVERSITY

Sanders already has moved to correct some 2016 missteps.

In January, he apologized to women campaign workers who said they had been harassed or mistreated by male campaign staffers, and he acknowledged the campaign's ""standards and safeguards were inadequate.""

He has been trying to reach out to black and Hispanic leaders after having trouble winning over minority voters in 2016. That could prove challenging again as a white man competing against female, black and Hispanic candidates.

""I really want to be sure the person who I ultimately support is going to take a hard look at diversity and ensure they are reaching out to all communities, particularly people of color and women,"" said Lucy Flores, a former Nevada state legislator and U.S. congressional candidate who backed Sanders last time but is uncommitted for 2020.

Ray Buckley, chairman of the Democratic Party in New Hampshire, an influential state with an early nominating contest where Sanders won 60 percent of the vote in 2016, said Sanders' inner circle of top supporters there is largely with him. But most prominent party activists are shopping the field, Buckley said.

Some Sanders allies expect the crowded field to help him, fracturing the vote enough to give Sanders and his dedicated following more clout.

""It’s going to be real hard for some of the other candidates to stand out, whereas Senator Sanders already has the name recognition and support,"" said Tim Smith, a state legislator in New Hampshire and a member of the state's steering committee for Sanders.

Sanders also will benefit from grassroots groups such as Organizing for Bernie-Draft Bernie and People for Bernie Sanders, which have been building support and organizing for him ahead of his announcement.

His supporters said his decades-long commitment to progressive issues will resonate with voters choosing among candidates with similar views.

""These aren't platitudes to him,"" said Katherine Brezler, co-founder of People for Bernie Sanders. ""Having to push somebody to believe these things is not where I need to be. Bernie would not have to be educated about these issues.""

His strengths on the issues, however, may not be enough.

""We need somebody who can tap a broader segment of the electorate,"" said Abramson, the 2016 Sanders delegate.

The resignations by the pro-European trio posed a fresh and embarrassing headache for Prime Minister Theresa May as she headed to Brussels for talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.

Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston said they planned to sit in parliament alongside eight former Labour MPs who, also citing their opposition to Brexit, resigned from the main opposition party this week to form the new Independent Group.

""I'm not leaving the Conservative Party; it's left us,"" Soubry said at a press conference flanked by her colleagues following the announcement of their decision, arguing its ""anti-EU wing"" was now setting the agenda.

Their move has reinforced the view that Britain was plunging further into political turmoil, without an EU divorce deal just 37 days before it is due to leave the bloc on March 29.

The shake-up means that the Conservatives now have a working majority of just eight, thanks only to their confidence and supply arrangement for support from Northern Ireland's 10 Democratic Unionist (DUP) lawmakers.

The political impasse risks the country crashing out of the EU without an agreement, with the rising uncertainty blamed for a string of car-makers and other businesses recently announcing job cuts and reduced investment in Britain.

- 'Towards a cliff edge' -

In damning indictments on May's leadership, the three Conservatives said in their letter to May that Brexit had ""redefined"" their party and was ""undoing all the efforts to modernise it"".

""The party that was once the most trusted on the economy and on business is now marching us towards the cliff edge of a no-deal Brexit,"" Wollaston said.

""None of us are prepared to wait until our toes are at the cliff edge before we take a stand,"" she added, urging Conservative ministers unwilling to defect to ""have the courage of their convictions"" and step down to oppose such a scenario.

May said in a statement she was ""saddened"" by the resignations and thanked the MPs for their ""dedicated service to our party over many years"".

She noted EU membership has been ""a source of disagreement both in our party and our country for a long time"" but the MPs' move would not stop Brexit.

""Under my leadership, the Conservative Party will always offer the decent, moderate and patriotic politics that the people of this country deserve.""

- 'Radical changes afoot' -

Also Wednesday, an eighth MP quit the Labour Party in protest at its veteran socialist leader Jeremy Corbyn, joining its own growing internal rebellion sparked by rows over Brexit and anti-Semitism.

The new Independent Group is now the joint fourth-biggest bloc in the Commons with 11 MPs -- the same as the centrist Liberal Democrats, with predictions of further defections to come.

""Everybody will get there in their own time,"" said the former Conservative MP Allen, who added she believed ""a significant number of colleagues"" were ready to follow suit in the weeks and months ahead.

The new group sat squashed together on the opposition backbenches in the Commons during the prime minister's weekly grilling, but did not ask May a question.

Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said: ""There is clearly some very radical changes now afoot as both the Conservatives and Labour have been taken over by militant groups, driving out more moderate MPs.""

- 'Country's interests first' -

The three former Conservative MPs said their decision to leave the party also went beyond Brexit.

They noted that there was a wider dissatisfaction with the state of British politics, with both the Conservatives and Labour moving ""to the fringes, leaving millions of people with no representation"".

At their press appearance, Allen added: ""As true centre-ground MPs sharing the same values as millions of our citizens, we have a responsibility to act.

""This week is the beginning,"" she vowed. ""Once there were seven, and now there are 11.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, the progressive populist who mounted a fierce challenge to front-runner Hillary Clinton in the 2016 White House campaign, said on Tuesday he would again seek the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination in 2020.

Sanders, 77, announced his candidacy in a lengthy early morning email to supporters, pledging to build a vast grassroots movement to confront the special interests that he said dominate government and politics.

""Our campaign is about creating a government and economy that works for the many, not just the few,"" Sanders said in the email, asking for 1 million people to sign up to start the effort.

The senator from Vermont launched his insurgent 2016 candidacy against Clinton as a long shot, but ended up capturing 23 state nominating contests and pushing the party to the left, generating tension between its establishment and liberal wings that has not entirely abated.

This time around, Sanders has been among the leaders in opinion polls of prospective 2020 candidates, but he faces a field more heavily populated with other liberal progressives touting many of the same ideas he brought into the party mainstream. That could make it harder to generate the same level of fervent support as four years ago.

He also is likely to face questions about his age and relevance in a party that is increasingly advancing more diverse and fresh voices, including those of women and minorities - groups that Sanders struggled to win over in 2016.

The primaries and caucuses that determine the party's nominee begin in February 2020 in Iowa, and the Democratic winner is likely to face President Donald Trump, a Republican, in the general election in November.

Sanders has been an unsparing critic of Trump, and in his email he called him ""the most dangerous president in modern American history.""

""We are running against a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and someone who is undermining American democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction,"" Sanders said.

'COMPLETING THE REVOLUTION'

Among those already in the Democratic race are fellow Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

""Together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution. Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for,"" Sanders said in his email to supporters.

Sanders, a political independent and democratic socialist who caucuses with Democrats in the Senate, said he would push in his campaign for many of the same issues that powered his 2016 bid and resonated with younger voters, including universal healthcare, raising the minimum wage, and free public college tuition.

""Three years have come and gone. And, as a result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans,"" he said.

A former mayor of Burlington, Vermont, Sanders won a U.S. House of Representatives seat in 1990, making him the first independent elected to the House in 40 years. In 2006, he won a U.S. Senate seat and in 2018 was voted in for a third six-year term.

His push against Clinton, a former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state, was notable because few Democrats seemed inclined to challenge her claim on the nomination. Sanders’ candidacy swiftly became a phenomenon, as he spoke to swelling crowds and garnered passionate support on social media.

Unlike Clinton, he refused to take money from corporate political action committees, or PACs, relying on a flood of small-dollar donations.

When he ultimately conceded and spoke at the Democratic National Convention in support of Clinton, some of his supporters booed. At the time, Sanders said his populist platform would endure.

He’s got the largest list; he’s got the most intense following that has stayed with him since 2016; he has a proven ability to fundraise from his small-dollar base,” said Brian Fallon, a Democratic strategist who was the spokesman for Clinton, leading the public charge against Sanders last time around. “He’s in the exact opposite position that he started off the 2016 campaign in.”

The Democrats running against him assume that this won’t last. But he’ll raise millions, get 20,000 people at his rallies, and make them all look junior varsity in comparison. Still, they’re confident that he won’t be able to maintain that over the next year.

Peter Beinart: Bernie Sanders offers a foreign policy for the common man

Sanders running when he’s part of a big field of enticing candidates is a whole lot different from Sanders running as the single fresh alternative to a candidate who never inspired much passion throughout her entire career. He could burn out, get eclipsed by some of the newer forces in the party, and have to answer for all the parts of his record and background that didn’t get full scrutiny when he was a novelty nowhere near winning in 2016.

If nothing else, there could certainly come a point late in the game, much like what happened with Howard Dean in 2004, when Democratic voters look at him and say they just can’t take seriously the idea of Sanders actually beating Trump, or actually being the commander in chief and sitting behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as the 46th president of the United States.

At least that’s what his rivals are telling themselves. Because that’s how races have always gone up to this point. Except, that is, for 2016, when Sanders became a bizarre breakout sensation and the country put Trump behind that desk as the 45th president.

No matter what, his candidacy seems set to reshape the dynamics of the race.

Sanders has moved quickly in an attempt to show that he’s a more serious candidate than four years ago, when he announced his campaign during a break from the Senate floor, gave a few harried answers to the questions from the few reporters who had showed up, and then said he had to get back to vote.

This time, he started with a carefully constructed rollout, with a slick announcement video, a sit-down interview on CBS This Morning, and a media tour. “Sisters and brothers,” he wrote to his huge email list Tuesday morning, “together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution. Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.”

A full operation is being put together, with the assumption that he will have well over $200 million in online fundraising to draw from. That includes top leadership of the campaign meant to illustrate the diversity of his support, demographically and geographically. Faiz Shakir, a former aide to Harry Reid, is leaving his job as the political director of the American Civil Liberties Union to be the campaign manager. In addition to his deep political experience, he will be the first Muslim presidential-campaign manager in history. Analilia Mejia, an organizer of Colombian and Dominican descent who most recently directed the Fight for $15 and Earned Sick Days campaigns in New Jersey and previously worked for the New Jersey Working Families Party, will be the political director. The deputy political director will be Sarah Badawi, who was most recently the government-affairs director for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal group that led the effort to draft Elizabeth Warren into the 2012 Senate race, and later worked on her campaign.",Bernie Sanders Is the Democratic Frontrunner,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/bernie-sanders-democratic-frontrunner-president/583066/

Bernie Sanders is not shy about his ambitions for 2020. In the 2016 Democratic primary, the Vermont senator claimed about 43 percent of the votes and 46 percent of the (non-super) delegates, a remarkable showing against one of the biggest favorites in presidential nominating history. He says he’ll do far better this time. “We’re going to win,” he told CBS News on Tuesday as part of his official campaign rollout. “We are also going to launch … a grassroots network to lay the groundwork for transforming the economic and political life of this country.”

That is easier said than done. Bernie is still beloved by his base, but he’s not exactly picking up where he left off three years ago. He’s spent most of the past year polling in the teens, a worrisome development for a candidate who has remained in the spotlight. 2020 will also come with new problems for the septuagenarian: He can’t count on the support of the anybody-but-Hillary types who might not have agreed with him on policy but felt they had no other choice last time. And he already has plenty of competition from within the progressive wing of the party, many of whom can offer similar policy promises in far fresher packaging.

Still, Sanders won’t get lost in the shuffle. As an independent, technically, he stands firmly on the left flank of the left wing of the party, and his progressive bona fides will not be in doubt at a time when newcomers who claim to be progressive will face skepticism. Informed voters know what they’re going to get with Sanders, which will be central to his pitch. Among the top tier, Elizabeth Warren may be able to give him a run for his $27 when it comes to economic populism, but as a self-identified capitalist and a Democrat, she can’t offer the same full-throated anti-establishment jeremiad that Bernie can. Warren and Sanders both rail against the status quo, but she wants to work to fix the system from within, while he can credibly sound like he wants to blow it up. That alone offers Sanders a clear justification for getting in the race.

His case is similarly made stronger by the emergence of a center lane in the Democratic primary. A month ago, the early frontrunners were all veering to the left; more than a few are now easing off the gas. Every time someone like Kamala Harris or Cory Booker glances over to the center—or when Amy Klobuchar or Sherrod Brown talk about pragmatism—Bernie’s campaign will appear more compelling and even urgent to progressives, many of whom remain fearful that the eventual nominee will pivot hard to the middle in a general election against Trump.

Sanders’ most pressing problem, however, may be that as much as the Democratic Party now sounds like him, it looks less like him. The 2018 midterms suggest there is clear appetite among the party’s rank-and-file for candidates who are anything but an old white dude. How Sanders addresses that reality will be his first real test of his campaign.

His Tuesday rollout suggests he is serious about expanding his appeal beyond his white, male base—but he still has a high hurdle to clear. For instance, Sanders was quick to call Trump “a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe” in his announcement email to supporters, and his staff suggested Sanders will work to draw a stronger connection between economic inequality and racial inequality than he did in 2016. But asked by Vermont Public Radio on Tuesday morning whether he best represents “the face of the new Democratic Party,” Sanders still sounded like a man who’s not fluent in the language of lived experience. “We have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender and not by their age,” Sanders said. “I think we have got to try to move us toward a nondiscriminatory society which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for.” It’s unlikely that answer is going to satisfy his critics if that’s the beginning and end of his identity defense.",Bernie Can Offer Something His 2020 Rivals Can’t.

The discussion about moving American politics beyond the two-party system needs to become much more serious.

This thought is spurred by two factors: The decision by Grant Woods not to run for U.S. Senate. And the unappetizing choice the two parties are likely to offer for president in 2020.

Woods has been a close personal friend for five decades. Politically, however, we disagree at least as much as we agree. These days, probably more. So, this isn’t a brief that Woods should be our next senator.

But he is an appealing political persona, as evidenced by having been elected attorney general while in his 30s. Woods is a gifted orator, as the country learned from his eulogy for John McCain. And his comic skills are worthy of a professional.

His policy positions are best described as eclectic. He doesn’t have an ideological lens through which he views issues. He sort of picks and chooses as he goes along.

There are moments, and this may be one of them, when that fits the mood of the electorate. Woods would have a realistic chance of winning a general election for U.S. Senate.

But he does not have a realistic chance of winning either a Republican or Democratic primary for such.

Independent candidates aren't the solution

CLOSE The current system produces candidates that don't reflect what most voters want. That's a problem, azcentral columnist Robert Robb says. Diana Payan, The Republic | azcentral.com

He could run as an independent. That’s a steep hill. And a serious independent challenger in any race means that whoever wins will undoubtedly receive less than a majority of the votes.

Being governed by a plurality rather than a majority erodes legitimacy. More independent candidates isn’t a solution to the structural problem of a nominating system that precludes candidates voters might prefer.

Former Phoenix Mayor Paul Johnson, who also finds himself in no-man’s land in the two-party system, has championed the idea of a top-two primary. All candidates of all parties, and of no party, would run against each other in the primary. The top two vote-getters would run against each other in the general election. Someone like Woods would have a chance to make it to the finals in such a system.

Unfortunately, Johnson, so far, hasn’t been willing to go whole-hog and make the system entirely non-partisan, without party labels on the ballot. If there are party labels on the ballot, parties should have a say in who gets to run under their banner.

It’s more difficult to envision a way out of the two-party trap at the national level.

National choices are even more unappetizing

Unless the Mueller investigation turns up more than expected, Trump will undoubtedly be the Republican nominee.

It seems inevitable that the Democrats will nominate someone who proposes adopting European-style social democracy in this country. That means a gigantic expansion of the welfare state and massively greater government intervention in the economy.

The nominee will probably be cagey about how to pay for it. But the only revenue source capable of producing the needed sum is a value-added tax, the workhorse of public finance in Europe.

A continuation of Trump or European-style social democracy probably isn’t the choice a majority of voters would like to see.

Starbucks honcho Howard Schultz is mulling an independent run. He professes to be economically conservative but socially liberal. That’s the largest voting bloc that doesn’t fit comfortably in either party.

Schultz could throw the election to the House

I think that Schultz has the potential to be more than just a spoiler, siphoning off anti-Trump votes from the Democratic nominee. In this crazy political environment, and with what the Democrats are likely to offer, an independent candidate has a chance to be a contender.

But if Schultz could actually win some states, that would mean, realistically, that no candidate would obtain an electoral college majority. That would throw the election into the House of Representatives. Which in turn means that the presidential race would actually be decided by the outcome in swing congressional districts.

Wouldn’t that be lovely.

I’ve ruminated about a multiparty national system with a French-style runoff election. But it’s difficult to envision how to get from what we have to that or any other alternative.

Such visioning needs to start occurring, with some urgency. What we have isn’t working.

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said Monday that he would support Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and the founder of Bloomberg LP, if he were to run for president.

Buffett made the comments on Monday morning in an interview on CNBC's Squawk Box.

Both men are among the richest people in the world.

Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, said Monday that he would support Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and founder of Bloomberg LP, if he were to announce a 2020 presidential bid.

""If Mike Bloomberg announced tomorrow that he was a candidate, I would say, 'I'm for him,' and I think he would be a very good president,"" he said in an interview with CNBC's Becky Quick.

""He and I disagree on some things, but I think that he knows how to run things. I think that he's got the right goals for America, he understands people, he understands the market system, and he understands the problems of people that don't fit well into the market system.""

Buffett, who on Saturday released his annual letter to shareholders, told CNBC that he wasn't a Democrat through and through, though over the last three decades he's voted for more Democrats than Republicans.

""I'm not a card-carrying Democratic, but I never have been,"" Buffett said. ""I've voted for a fair number of Republicans, I've given money to Republicans.""

Both Buffett and Bloomberg are among the richest people in the world, according to Forbes. Buffett's net worth, as of Forbes' 2018 ranking, was $84 billion, while Bloomberg's was $50 billion.

While it's long been rumored that Bloomberg would run for the highest US office, he told the Associated Press in early February that he would decide by the end of this month if he would enter the race. He officially registered as a Democrat — again — last October.

Bloomberg has rejected the notion that he likely wouldn't enter the 2020 presidential race if Joe Biden, the former vice president, announced a bid.

""My decision doesn't depend on what other people are going to do,"" Bloomberg told the AP. ""My decision depends on whether or not I think I can make a difference.""

In his interview with CNBC Buffett also voiced his displeasure about Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, announcing he would consider running for president in the upcoming election.

""If he ran as an independent, I think he would take votes away from any Democrat, including Bloomberg, if he were running, so I think it would be a real mistake for him to run,"" Buffett said. ""I think, generally, third-party candidates, they're going to hurt one side or the other, and they're more likely to hurt the side that they actually favor, because they're closer to that view.""

He added: ""I hope no third-party candidate runs that pulls any significant amount of votes. I mean, there will always be a couple of people that file, but I think third-party candidates can thwart, actually, the will of the people.""

265,Empty,2019-02-25T13:35:03Z,Britain's parliament last month demanded Prime Minister Theresa May renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal that the other members of the European Union say they will not reopen.,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s parliament last month demanded Prime Minister Theresa May renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal that the other members of the European Union say they will not reopen.

With just 32 days until the United Kingdom is due by law to leave the EU, the options include a disorderly Brexit, a delay to Brexit or no Brexit at all.

May is pursuing a renegotiated deal, but faces a growing threat that she will need to choose to delay Brexit or be forced to do so by British lawmakers.

Below is a summary of what is due to happen next:

“HIGH NOON”- FEB. 27

On Tuesday, May will make a statement updating lawmakers on her progress and lawmakers will have an opportunity on Wednesday to debate and vote on the way forward.

Several lawmakers in May’s Conservative Party, including some ministers, have indicated this will be the last chance they give her to find a way through the impasse.

Opposition Labour Party lawmaker Yvette Cooper plans to use that debate to seek lawmakers’ support for legislation that would force the government to decide between leaving without a deal or extending the Article 50 negotiation period if it has not had a deal approved by March 13.

VOTE ON A REVISED DEAL - BY MARCH 12

May has promised to bring back a revised deal to parliament and hold a vote on whether to approve it by March 12.

Before a vote on the exit agreement in January, which May lost heavily, parliament held five days of debate. It is not clear whether there would be another lengthy debate this time.

May is required by law to get parliamentary approval for any exit deal.

EU SUMMIT - MARCH 21-22

EU leaders are due to meet in Brussels. This could be an opportunity for an eleventh-hour deal or it would be the last chance to agree an extension of the Article 50 negotiation period and delay Brexit to avoid no-deal disruption. If the summit goes badly and there is still no deal in sight then May will have to decide whether to delay or go for a no-deal Brexit.

LAST WEEKEND - MARCH 23-24

If a deal is seen as viable at the summit, officials could work through the weekend to nail down the details with a final deal - and a possible extension to June 30 conditional on British parliamentary approval - announced on Sunday, March 24-Monday, March 25.

FINAL WEEK - MARCH 25-29

If a deal could be clinched, then the British parliament could vote on it, possibly on March 26. The European Parliament could ratify the deal that week.

EXIT DAY - MARCH 29?

If May does not get a deal approved by parliament by March 29, Britain faces a disorderly exit or may be forced to seek an extension of Article 50 to give more time to reach an agreement. It is not certain the EU would agree to this.

Some lawmakers, including opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, have said it is now “inevitable” that the government will have to seek an extension, as there will not be enough time to pass the legislation for Britain’s exit before March 29.

The leader of Britain’s lower house of parliament, Andrea Leadsom, has said the date might need to be pushed back by a couple of weeks.

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS

The bloc will vote to elect a new European Parliament on May 23-26. The new chamber would sit from July 2, a date that is shaping up to be the EU’s limit for any extension of Article 50.

The EU says Britain would have to organize European Parliament elections on its soil if it were to delay Brexit beyond that as otherwise its people would be deprived of their democratic representation while still being in the EU. The bloc fears Britain would not do that.

Some in the EU also fear that, should Britain vote, it would elect a staunchly eurosceptic representation to the European Parliament that is already expected to have a larger contingent of EU critics influencing the bloc’s policies.

The main centre-right group, whose leaders include German Chancellor Angela Merkel, could also lose its place as the biggest in the European Parliament; UK Labour seats could help the European Socialists overtake the People’s Party, from which British Conservatives broke away to sit separately.

DELAYED BREXIT - JUNE 30 OR LATER

If a Brexit extension is sought, one date being talked about in Brussels is June 30, the Sunday before the new European Parliament sits at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) on July 2. Some argue for an exit before May 23, the day Britain would otherwise be due to hold an EU election.",Factbox: Through the Brexit Looking Glass - What happens next?,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-whatnext-factbox-idUSKCN1QE1P3

Pete Buttigieg is having a hard time getting noticed. One month after launching his presidential campaign, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, remains little more than a hard-to-pronounce afterthought in a field that is getting deeper by the week. According to the most recent polling from Morning Consult, 62 percent of Democrats say they’ve never heard of Buttigieg, while nearly half of those who do know his name say they haven’t heard enough to form an opinion. The top-line numbers are more daunting still: Buttigieg polls at 0 percent—as in zero, nada, nothing—among Democrats, both nationally and in the early nominating states.

This problem is not unique to Buttigieg, as everyone from former Rep. John Delaney to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand can attest. The former launched his presidential campaign 18 months ago and, like Buttigieg, fails to crack the margin of error in most national polls. The latter is a powerful senator from New York and yet sits at just 1 percent in the Morning Consult survey and no longer even merits a mention on RealClearPolitics’ 2020 aggregate page that runs nearly a dozen names deep. Everyone outside of the top tier faces the same immediate problem: How do you stand out in a year when the Democratic field is both so deep and so wide?

Buttigieg’s predicament is particularly illustrative. If elected, the former Rhodes scholar and Navy veteran would become both the nation’s youngest president and its first openly gay one, but he’s hardly the only candidate with such history-making potential. In the past, calling for a radical reimagination of the U.S. economy would surely get you noticed; this year, even the self-styled pragmatists in the race are willing to talk about it. Buttigieg is arguably best known for the fact that most everyone mangles his name, but even on that quality he has plenty of competition among the 2020 field.

Buttigieg, though, may have found the tiniest of openings this week—perhaps by accident.

During an event Tuesday in Philadelphia, an audience member asked him whether, if elected, he would be willing to pack the Supreme Court with liberal justices in response to the high court’s recent shift rightward. “I have not reached a considered position on the question of court-packing,” Buttigieg said over a few nervous-sounding laughs in the crowd. “Although I don’t think we should be laughing at it. Because in some ways it’s no more a shattering of norms than what’s already been done to get the judiciary to where it is today.”

It was an off-the-cuff, noncommittal answer, and yet it generated small but noticeable excitement in some corners of the internet. The 1/20/21 Project, a court-packing campaign with the backing of people like Harvard law professors Laurence Tribe and Mark Tushnet, celebrated the answer, as did NARAL president Ilyse Hogue. Progressive outlets like Common Dreams and Daily Kos likewise reacted positively, and ThinkProgress even went as far as to declare that Buttigieg had proved himself the only Democrat in the race who “seems serious about governing.”

Yes, @PeteButtigieg DID say that he is open to court packing! #PackTheCourts pic.twitter.com/JDJTQajCpu — Pack The Courts (@Project12021) February 20, 2019

A few tweets and effusive blog posts won’t turn Buttigieg into a national figure, but they do suggest that, even in a field that is proposing bold policies on everything from day care to climate change, there’s still room for a candidate to go big in other, less obvious areas. Buttigieg’s full answer, which didn’t make it into the clip originally shared online, points to a few such directions he might consider:

So, I have not reached a considered position on the question of court-packing—although I don’t think we should be laughing at it. Because in some ways it’s no more a shattering of norms than what’s already been done to get the judiciary to where it is today. I will say some of things I have decided I am prepared to advocate for are in the spirit of acknowledging bold reforms are needed—not just getting money out of politics, which we gotta do, not just redistricting, which we gotta do, but things that might require constitutional action, which interestingly, the court-packing would not, but things like, questioning whether it really makes sense to have an Electoral College that twice in my lifetime has overruled the American people. Asking whether it makes sense to continue to go on with fellow American citizens in places like D.C. and Puerto Rico denied full political representation. And the reality is you might not be able to end Citizens United without constitutional action. The reason I think it’s important to bring things up like this—part of this is maybe just a Hoosier streak, that 50 years ago, my home state senator, Birch Bayh, was authoring several constitutional amendments: The 25th amendment, which might come in handy one day, the lowering of the voting age, the Equal Rights Amendment, which sadly did not make it but should have. And we need to set that as the level of intellectual and policy ambition that we have, which does not come naturally to our party lately. So I haven’t reached a considered opinion on that one yet, but I do think very bold, very ambitious ideas deserve a hearing right now.

That’s a long answer bookended by I-have-no-official-position-on-court-packing caveats, but in between Buttigieg brings up the possibility of abolishing the Electoral College and granting statehood to Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. He’s “just asking” whether doing either “makes sense,” but if he’s ever ready to answer those questions in the affirmative, his campaign would instantly become impossible to ignore. Support for deciding the presidency by popular vote, for instance, has been on the rise since 2000, and one major poll from last summer found 81 percent of Democrats prefer that system to the Electoral College. Packing the courts or adding states to the union would be tougher sells, but they both have a sizable group of supporters—something Buttigieg hopes he can say for himself someday.",Pete Buttigieg May Have Just Found a Way to Get Noticed in the Crowded Democratic Primary,Slate.com,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/pete-buttigieg-court-packing-electoral-college.html

The election trolls have logged on. Except, despite the cleanup efforts of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube following the 2016 campaign, they never really logged off, with coordinated disinformation campaigns still trying to sow confusion on social media during the 2018 midterms. But now they’re getting ready for the big show. With 12 Democratic candidates already vying for the White House and more to come, memes and misinformation that appear to be coordinated and possibly connected to foreign propaganda efforts are already afflicting the race. According to a report Wednesday in Politico, Democratic contenders have been the targets of online propaganda aimed at sensationalizing missteps and promoting falsehoods. If these troll campaigns share a goal with the efforts of 2016 and 2018, then the point may be to widen societal divisions already prominent in American life and, in particular, weaken the Democratic Party. In particular, they seem intent on weaponizing a productive moment in our politics in which public figures are finally being held to account for their past actions, and Democrats are sometimes asking other Democrats to resign. The trolls want Democrats to eat each other.

So far, we don’t know the source of this activity—it’s not clearly linked to the Internet Research Agency, the Russian disinformation factory that was behind thousands of accounts stirring unrest during the 2016 and 2018 elections. Wherever it’s from, what has been found so far does appear to be coordinated and bears many of the traits of past foreign operations. Politico analyzed data collected by a group called Guardians.ai, a firm that specializes in protecting pro-democracy groups from cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns. Guardians.ai analyzed a network of 200 Twitter accounts that were active “in one of the largest influence operations of the 2018 cycle” in churning out extreme and divisive content, some of which displayed signs of automation. Looking at those same accounts again, the group found that since the start of this year, the network pivoted to focus on Sens. Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren as well as former Rep. Beto O’Rourke. The researchers found that over the course of 30 days this year, between 2 and 15 percent of all Twitter mentions of the four Democratic politicians originated from this network. In other words, a group of trolls that stirred the pot during the midterms is very, very busy once again.

Take one recent rumor that was boosted by the apparent troll network on social media, accusing Warren of having a piece of racist memorabilia on top of her kitchen cabinet. The meme was a blurry screenshot from a Warren Q&A on Instagram Live that posters claimed contained a Sambo figure biting into a piece of watermelon. The allegation was promoted by right-wing pundits on Twitter and Facebook—until it was debunked. It turns out the knick-knack wasn’t a racist memento at all, but rather “an ordinary reproduction of a Greek vase,” according to Snopes. The false allegation was shared on the New York City Republicans Facebook page in a now-deleted post, according to PolitiFact. The meme later traveled far enough that Warren’s campaign felt the need to debunk the claim on her campaign website. The intent was obvious, and it dovetailed with Warren’s cringe-worthy attempts to prove her Native American ancestry last year: The trolls didn’t just want Warren to look like she’s tin-eared on race, but like an actual racist.

This example of disinformation appears to have been initially promoted on the anonymous, anything-goes message board 4Chan—often an early stop of any effort to spread misinformation online—though it’s not clear who planted the meme or what their motivation was, other than adding to a narrative that paints Warren as racist. Right now, candidates on the left are particularly susceptible to such character attacks—if they are true, after all, they might be disqualifying. Beto O’Rourke was also targeted on Twitter by an account that had only tweeted once since it was created in May 2018. That one tweet, however, carried the allegation that the Texas politician once left a message on an answering machine in the 1990s that contained racist language. The single missive was quickly amplified by other accounts and reached as any as 1.3 million people, Politico reported.

These troll efforts aren’t only trying to smear candidates using issues of concern to the left—sometimes they’re just sexist and racist. Sen. Harris appears to be a favorite early target, according to Guardians.ai, which found that Harris attracted more activity on Twitter than any other Democratic presidential candidate in the 30-day period it studied. Days after Harris announced her candidacy, former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown wrote a terse op-ed for the San Francisco Chronicle admitting that he dated Harris, apparently because reporters had been calling him about it. That was on Jan 26, but even now, weeks later, chatter about their decades-old relationship is still proliferating on social media. On Facebook, videos made about their relationship have racked up hundreds of thousands of views, and on Twitter, replies to Harris’ tweets are saturated with lewd comments accusing Harris of using sex as a ladder to success.

Trolls of both foreign and domestic vintage helped make the 2016 election the cacophony we remember. Now, as candidates struggle to differentiate themselves at a time when voters on the left may punish a candidate who has crossed ethical lines, it’s safe to expect trolls on social media to play every misstep up to its fullest—potentially as part of another propaganda effort to ensure victory for Donald Trump. Even if a meme you see that disparages a Democratic candidate is based on truth, it’s important to remember that its goal might be to simply weaken Democrats by making candidates toxic for swaths of the left, and ultimately make 2020 a repeat of 2016.

Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders will challenge Donald Trump for president in 2020. Thanks to popular (rather than merely ""populist"") policies, and a strong primary run in 2016 against a Democratic party apparatus that did everything it could to stop him, he becomes an instant front-runner.

""We began the political revolution in the 2016 campaign, and now it's time to move that revolution forward,"" the independent senator told Vermont Public Radio in an interview airing Tuesday morning. ... Sanders pointed to the Democratic Party's leftward shift as a reason for a second run. ""It turns out that many of the ideas that I talked about – that health care is a right, not a privilege, and that we've got to move toward a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system: very, very popular. The idea that we have got to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour,"" he told Vermont Public Radio. ""When I talked about making public colleges and universities tuition-free and lowering student debt, that was another issue that people said was too radical. Well, that's also happening around the country.""

271,Empty,2019-02-25T14:32:08Z,Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett told CNBC Monday that he would support New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg for president.,"Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett told CNBC on Monday that he would support fellow billionaire and former three-term New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg for president.

""If Mike Bloomberg announced tomorrow that he was a candidate, I would say I'm for him,"" Buffett told Becky Quick in a ""Squawk Box"" Interview from Omaha, Nebraska. ""I think he would be a very good president.""

Buffett said he's never been a card-carrying Democrat, pointing out that he's voted for Democratic candidates and Republican candidates over the years. He said neither party has an edge on virtue.

Without elaborating, Buffett said he and Bloomberg disagree on some things.

However, he added, ""I think that he knows how to run things. I think he's got the right goals for America. He understands people. He understands the market system. And he understands the problems of people"" not in the market.

Bloomberg, 77, is seen as a possible 2020 candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Bloomberg ran as an independent during his last successful campaign, when was re-elected mayor for a third term in 2009. He was a Republican in his first two terms. Bloomberg switched his party affiliation from independent to Democrat in October.

In a recent email to CNBC, top Bloomberg advisor Howard Wolfson hinted at how much his boss would look to invest into his own potential campaign.

""Mike spent more than $100 million in his last mayor's race. Last time I looked, NYC is a fraction of the size of the country as a whole,"" Wolfson said.

For years, Bloomberg had flirted with an independent run for president. But he now believes it would be a mistake. In a January statement, after former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz floated a possible third-party run, Bloomberg said, ""In 2020, the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the president. That's a risk I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford to run it now.""

In Monday's interview, Buffett said he agrees with Bloomberg that a Schultz third-party would take votes away from any Democrat.

Making no evaluation of Schultz as a potential candidate, Buffett added, ""I think generally [that] third-party candidates, they're going to hurt one side or the other, and they're more likely to hurt the side that they actually favor, because they're closer to that view, and so they pull more people away that would otherwise go with the second-best with that view.""

""So I hope no third-party candidate runs,"" he added. ""I think third-party candidates can thwart, actually, the will of the people.""

Buffett was interviewed from the floor of the Berkshire-owned Nebraska Furniture Mart, following Saturday's release of his widely read annual shareholder letter.

Correction: This story was revised to correct when Bloomberg registered as a Democrat. It was last year.

New York (AFP) - Once dismissed by many as a fringe candidate with wacky socialist ideas, Bernie Sanders campaigned to the brink of the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and has now set his sights on the White House once again.

Sanders, a 77-year-old US Senator from Vermont, announced on Tuesday that he will join an already crowded field of candidates seeking to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020.

""I wanted to let the people of the state of Vermont know about this first,"" Sanders said on Vermont Public Radio.

He called Trump a national embarrassment and a pathological liar.

""I also think he is a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, somebody who is gaining cheap political points by trying to pick on minorities, often undocumented immigrants,"" Sanders said.

Like Trump, Sanders was an outsider when the 2016 presidential primaries began, little known to the public at large and initially not given much of a chance against the Hillary Clinton machine.

But he came close to pulling off the upset and ended up winning 23 primaries or caucuses against the better-funded Clinton.

Sanders galvanized a broad coalition with his anti-Wall Street rhetoric and talk of a ""political revolution.""

Though the oldest candidate in the field, Sanders garnered passionate support among young liberals with his calls for universal health care, a $15 minimum wage and free public university education.

He made the fight against income inequality, which he has called the greatest moral, economic and political issue of our times, the centerpiece of his insurgent campaign.

Four years later, Sanders' policies remain the same but much has changed on the political landscape.

Trump won the election and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a young congresswoman from New York, is a rising Democratic star, embracing many of the positions held by Sanders.

""We have had more success in ideologically changing the party than I would have dreamed possible,"" Sanders said in an interview with GQ magazine. ""The world has changed.""

- From Brooklyn to Senate -

Bernard Sanders was born on September 8, 1941 in Brooklyn, New York, into a family of Jewish immigrants from Poland.

He attended Brooklyn College and later the University of Chicago, where he was active in the civil rights movement, attending the 1963 ""March on Washington"" where Martin Luther King Jr delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech.

After graduating, Sanders worked on an Israeli kibbutz and moved to Vermont, where he worked as a carpenter and filmmaker.

In 1981, he was elected mayor of Burlington, the state's largest city, by a mere 10-vote margin and went on to win another three terms.

He served as mayor until 1989, winning election as an independent to the US House of Representatives in 1990.

Sanders served in the House until 2006, when he was elected to the US Senate. He was re-elected in 2012 and 2018.

While Sanders remains popular among many Democrats, some in the party are questioning whether their champion this time around should be a septuagenarian white man.

Multiple women have already joined the race, including Kamala Harris, an African-American senator from California, seen as the early front-runner.

Some #MeToo movement activists have also come out against a Sanders candidacy after several employees on his 2016 campaign complained of sexual harassment by staffers.

Sanders has issued an apology ""to the women on my 2016 campaign who were harassed or mistreated.""

""We can't just talk about ending sexism and discrimination,"" he said. ""It must be a reality in our daily lives.""

Famously short-tempered and irascible, Sanders also still displays the energy of a much younger man -- he campaigned tirelessly for Democratic candidates in the 2018 mid-terms.

Sanders claims that he does not have a burning desire to occupy the White House and that the priority is defeating Trump.

""If there's somebody else who appears who can, for whatever reason, do a better job than me, I'll work my ass off to elect him or her,"" he told New York magazine.

Sanders lives in Burlington with his second wife, Jane. Together, they have four children and seven grandchildren.","Bernie Sanders, from gadfly to serious White House contender",Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/bernie-sanders-gadfly-serious-white-house-contender-002519657.html

Donald Trump has been formally running for re-election for about a year now, and as with all modern campaigns, the Trump team sends regular emails to its supporters, offering updates on the candidate’s work and soliciting donations. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s emails sound a lot like the man himself. “Chuck & Nancy…forgot about the Hard-Working American a long time ago,” one January message read. “Americans not only want the wall, they DEMAND THE WALL,” read another. So far, so Trumpian. What is more surprising for a well-funded major-party presidential candidate—who happens to be the president of the United States—is the graphic design aesthetic. Which is to say: absolutely hideous.

Take a missive from last week that invited supporters to sign a Valentine’s Day card for the president and first lady. The “card” itself contains just 25 words, but it includes four separate typefaces, including Courier New, the ’80s fanciness signifier Chancery, and the much-mocked Comic Sans.

Other emails aren’t just ugly, but also contain minor errors. One message “from” Melania Trump, versions of which I received at least four times, referred to the moment when the president “placed his hand on the bible and took the oath of office.” That lowercase “bible” violates both the AP Stylebook and everyday usage by the Christians in Trump’s base. The Trump team doesn’t seem to have a style guide of its own, so punctuation choices are as erratic as they are in Trump’s tweets. In other emails, “Oath of Office” is capitalized, along with phrases like “Hard-Working American,” “Liberal Mega-Donors,” and “Hollywood Elites.” Trump’s emails sometimes use the capital letter “O” in place of the number zero, such as in a recent reference to “3O,OOO American Patriots.” (As it turns out, this is an old trick to get around spam filters. But it’s still unpleasant to look at!) To use a highly technical design term, the emails are a “hot mess.”

“In the email world, sometimes there’s a difference between good design and effective design,” said Damien Shirley, a Washington-based associate director at Bully Pulpit Interactive, an agency whose clients include Democratic political campaigns. “These are conscious design choices the Trump team is making. They’re doing it because it comes across as authentic.” Shirley said the Trump messages appear to him to be designed and coded under the surface the same way any relatively sophisticated email marketing campaign would be. But the trick is that they look like they could have been thrown together by anybody you know.

One email included four separate typefaces, including Courier New, the ’80s fanciness signifier Chancery, and the much-mocked Comic Sans.

Striving for a nonchalant vibe in official campaign emails is not a Trump innovation. In fact, it’s a proven strategy. The Obama campaign was famous for using cryptic, casual subject lines like “Hey” and “Me again.” During Elizabeth Warren’s 2012 Senate campaign, a single email with the subject line “I’m sorry” raised $430,000. Trump apes this approach with subject lines that have included “fw: {no entry}” and “Did you see Eric’s email?” And even Trump’s aesthetic is not totally his own. “These emails don’t look that much different from some of the messages you see from the Democratic side,” said Doug Foote, a digital strategy director at Veracity Media who has worked on digital campaigns for progressive causes. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, for example, regularly sends out emails that look almost as slapdash as Trump’s.

But just because Trump’s emails belong to a creative tradition doesn’t mean they’re, you know, good. “Trump’s emails are not the worst emails I’ve ever seen, but they’re all so bad,” said Matthew Smith, founder and director of the site Really Good Emails. “I wish politicians would take this stuff more seriously.” Smith is a supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, but when he signed up for Booker’s email list, he was also disappointed by what landed in his inbox.

Smith blames a few factors for the design gap between campaign emails and campaign branding in general, which is arguably stronger and more interesting than ever. It’s partly a technology problem. Smith pointed out that the widely used Microsoft Outlook uses relatively old and clunky technology that makes offerings like one-click donations difficult; that’s a problem for email marketing in general.

Still, how hard can it be to, say, choose any font other than Comic Sans when writing to supporters? That brings us back to Trump. Shirley said the Trump campaign’s haphazard design choices can’t be explained by sheer haste. “This really isn’t allowing them to send more emails or get them out the door more quickly,” he said. “It’s just how they’re choosing to talk to their supporters.” And it’s apparently working: Trump’s Make America Great Again Committee, the entity that emails his supporters updates and entreaties for donations, had raised $41 million in individual donations under $200 as of October.

Their views run the gamut, from when to end austerity to whether to nationalize the railways. But on their reasons for leaving their parties, they are somewhat in agreement. For one, both sides are frustrated by what they see as a hard-line takeover of their former parties, from the far-left loyalists of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to the outsize influence of the hard-line pro-Brexit lawmakers within the Conservatives. All 11 argue that it is not their values, but rather those of their parties, that have changed.

Alison McGovern: Let’s have another Brexit vote

In terms of hard policy, one thing has brought them together. They have all advocated for a so-called People’s Vote—another Brexit referendum. If their united goal is to persuade Parliament to back a second vote, though, their defections might have instead helped achieve the opposite.

For another vote to happen, it needs the parliamentary backing of at least one of the major parties, something neither Labour nor Conservative leaders have officially stated they are willing to do. And with MPs such as Labour’s Chuka Umunna and the Conservatives’ Anna Soubry—vocal supporters of a second referendum who have now defected—no longer affiliated with those parties, the likelihood of either party changing its stance seems to have only diminished further.

For now, the People’s Vote campaign does not appear to see it that way. In a statement responding to the defections on Wednesday, it said that while it respected the reasons put forward by the 11 lawmakers to resign, it would continue to work with MPs from both parties to secure support for a second referendum. “We are not a political party,” a People’s Vote spokesperson said, “nor are we ever going to allow ourselves to be associated with just one faction of any political party.”

The last time the Democratic presidential nomination was seriously in doubt, more than a decade ago, the major candidates all supported a proposal called the ""public option"" that would allow anyone to buy health insurance from the government. As his party's 2008 nominee, Barack Obama strongly backed a ""cap and trade"" plan that would require polluters to buy permits in order to emit carbon dioxide. By January 2009, Democrats had the White House and large majorities in both chambers of Congress, and neither of those things happened.

Part of this failure can be chalked up to the Obama administration having to deal with the financial crisis immediately after taking office. But the main culprit was a political system that allows a minority party ample opportunities to block legislation. The public option, wildly popular among Democrats, was passed by the House but killed by a small number of conservative Democratic senators who had an enormous amount of power because Senate filibuster rules require supermajorities of 60 votes to pass laws. A cap and trade bill was also passed in the House but died in the Senate, again largely thanks to the filibuster. (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has suggested she wants to pass a cap and trade bill just as she did a decade ago.)

In today's Democratic Party, those proposals seem quaint and tentative. The 2020 presidential contenders often favor more sweeping policies like Medicare for all and the Green New Deal; it's big news when a potential candidate says these ideas are impractical, as Amy Klobuchar and Sherrod Brown recently did. Big, bold ideas are a requirement in the unfolding 2020 primaries, and yet missing from these discussions is a clear explanation about how these progressive dreams are going to become reality. What will a future President Sanders or Gillibrand do to make sure Medicare for all doesn't go the way of the public option circa 2010?

Sometimes candidates are asked how they'll pay for the expensive government programs they want to create, but this is a fairly easy question to answer, especially in this freewheeling political moment. They can tax the rich, which is broadly popular among voters anyway, or else they can point to theories about how deficit spending isn't that big a deal and note that Republicans felt perfectly free to pass deficit-exploding tax cuts. The harder question is how they would legislate anything at all into existence.

Democrats currently control the House and could plausibly take back the Senate in 2020—but they'll almost definitely have a much smaller majority than they did at the outset of the Obama years. This creates a series of enormous challenges for any Democratic president who comes into office having made a bunch of promises about transformative change. Let's use Medicare for all as an example because it's popular both among most of the candidates and the public. The problem is, even if 100 percent of Democratic senators supported Medicare for all, that likely wouldn't be enough to overcome the 60-vote threshold. So what do you do?

One obvious answer is you get rid of the filibuster. But curiously, when asked about this, Democratic candidates have opposed that idea—even Sanders, who told CBS's John Dickerson, “I’m not crazy about getting rid of the filibuster.” He went on to say the real problem in DC is wealthy campaign donors and voter suppression. That might be true—but addressing those problems will also require legislation that will have to overcome the filibuster.

No one can impugn Sanders's leftist credentials or accuse him of not having progressive ideas. But if he's not going to eliminate the filibuster, what's going to happen to his ideas? Does he have a theory about how he could achieve his goals through executive action, as both Obama and Donald Trump have done? Would he try to get more Democrats in the Senate by expanding the number of states in the union, as some liberals have suggested?

A candidate could argue that the executive branch has acquired too much power and that rather than bending rules and upending the way Congress works, the next president should restore normalcy. But given that Republicans will oppose Democratic priorities to the hilt, that view is pretty much incompatible with the priorities most candidates have. You can have Medicare for all or the congressional rules of 2009, but not both.

That's why candidates should be made to discuss their governing plans, not just their goals: Promises are too easy to make. Saying you support a Green New Deal is easy when you know that there's no way such a bill will ever pass Congress. The trickier, and more important, question is about how you would put a Green New Deal into action—what parts could come from executive action, what parts could be passed through the convoluted process of ""budget reconciliation,"" and what parts are not likely to become reality.



Trump got through the Republican primaries promising a border wall that Mexico would pay for, and two years into his presidency isn't even close to fulfilling that vague, nonsensical pledge. If Democrats want to hold the next president to a higher standard, they'll need to ask for a lot more specifics than their GOP counterparts did.

Darcelle Slappy got crushed in 2018. Republican incumbent Aaron Bernstine defeated her by 56 points in the Tenth District race for Pennsylvania’s House of Representatives. Slappy, a lifelong Democrat, is a member of the Big Beaver Falls Area School Board, but she didn’t know how to make the transition to a higher office, and only had a few months to learn.

She got schooled by Bernstine, who in an unusual move won the Democratic primary through a rare write-in campaign, meaning he had the nomination of both major parties. He was going to run unopposed in the general, but in June, at the urging of local Democratic leaders, Slappy jumped into the race as the Green Party candidate. However, because she had switched affiliation, the Democratic Party in her suburban Pittsburgh district couldn’t help her. That meant no money and no assistance with campaign infrastructure, and the result was the kind of shellacking that would turn some away from politics.

Determined to rebound from her landslide defeat, Slappy attended an all-day course held by the National Democratic Training Committee (NDTC) earlier this month.

Founded in 2016 by longtime Democratic operative Kelly Dietrich, the NDTC is a hybrid PAC that aims to deepen the Democrats’ bench by providing free online and in-person classes to activists, campaign volunteers and staff, and candidates. The NDTC has 55 trainers spread across the country, with years of experience as political consultants, field directors, and community organizers. Last year, the organization held 64 free events in 46 states, and Dietrich said he hopes to schedule 80 more and hit all 50 states in 2019.

VICE shadowed Slappy during her training to understand how the NDTC intends to help keep the blue wave of 2018 rolling. Sixty-six people from western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio attended the event, held at the Community College of Beaver County, a 45-minute drive northwest of Pittsburgh. They were divided into four groups—volunteers, staff (campaign and local party infrastructure), and two classes of candidates—and each took four 75-minute courses on fundraising, communication, field work, and social media.

Heading into the day, Slappy, 43, was planning to run for Beaver County controller, a position that oversees the county’s financial affairs, instead of challenging Bernstine again in 2020. “Maybe I’m more suited for a smaller office right now,” she said. But Slappy began to doubt this idea during the first course. Titled “How to Develop Your Story of Self” and taught by Brittny Baxter, a coordinator for Maryland Working Families, the session focused on articulating “who you are and why you’re running.”

As Baxter used Stacey Abrams as an example of a politician who explained why they were seeking office through their personal story, Slappy questioned if she could relate to people looking for a controller. “I’m not passionate about being a controller,” Slappy said. “Education’s my passion, and I could improve schools in my district from [the state] house.”

Here’s Slappy’s story of self: Growing up in Beaver Falls, she dreamed of attending Georgetown University. But she dropped out of high school during her senior year because of an at-risk pregnancy. Doctors diagnosed her with twin-twin transfusion syndrome, a rare condition that occurs when identical twins share a placenta and blood flows unevenly between the fetuses. Slappy gave birth four months prematurely and one baby died. Over the next decade, Slappy earned a GED, attended a culinary school and then a beauty academy while raising six children with her husband, whom she had started dating at 13. In her 30s, she received an associate’s degree in criminal justice from community college and was offered a scholarship to finish her bachelor’s degree, but she had to turn it down. It was too much time away from her family. Slappy said that when she was a teenager and in her 20s, she didn’t receive guidance about continuing her education. She got into politics to make sure working-class students like her are aware of their options and to create more opportunities for them.

“I’ve been at the bottom,” Slappy said. “I can help because I know what it’s like to have people think you’re not worth their time, to have to do twice as much to prove yourself.”

Still, she was on the fence about what to run for. She could be county controller. She once owned a beauty salon. But the next course, “How to Fundraise Effectively,” convinced her to run for the state house again. Trainer Dallas Thompson, a political consultant who founded Bright Compass, an organization that advises campaigns on workplace policy and campaign operations, emphasized why potential donors need to hear why you’re running for office and what makes you uniquely qualified for that position. As an example, Thompson talked about how she responds to candidates who call her for a donation but fail to sell their vision.

“I’m like, ‘OK. Good luck with that,’” Thompson said to the class. “Maybe, ‘Here’s 50 bucks,’ but I know they’re not going to win.”

Thompson continued to lecture about organizing donor lists and practicing how to ask for a donation over the phone, but Slappy dwelled on that anecdote. She felt that if she ran for county controller, she’d receive a lot of “good luck with that” wishes. The realization that she should challenge Bernstine again in 2020 combined with the course material made her grateful she had signed up for the training.

“I wish I’d had something like this last year,” said Slappy during a break. “I was basically on my own and got over 20 percent [of the vote]. Imagine what I could’ve done if I knew what they’re teaching here.”

The NDTC is not the first organization created to groom Democratic candidates. Democracy for America and Re:Power, formerly known as Wellstone Action, offer similar services. But the NDTC is the only one that provides free in-person training, which is crucial considering many participants are working-class and lack the connections wealthier candidates have.

“Free in-person in states where it’s needed. That’s the golden parachute,” said Sarah Scanlon, an NDTC trainer who worked as the national LGBTQ outreach director on Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign. “We’re no longer allowing [operatives] to anoint somebody to run.”

Scanlon said Democrats have to take this approach to compete in rural areas, where church-based groups and Republican organizations like the Family Research Council have been grooming conservative politicians for decades. Slappy agreed. As a third-party candidate, she was invited to a few Republican events in 2018. “They operate like a machine,” she said. “Everyone knows their role and communicates.”

The NDTC’s afternoon courses, “How to Identify and Persuade Voters” and “How to Effectively Tell Your Story Online,” reiterated something Slappy had learned the hard way: the importance of campaign staff. In her 2018 race, she led a three-person staff, with a few volunteers who joined near election day. Each staff member shared in social media duties, and they didn’t have enough time to canvas and figure out turnout estimates or identify low-frequency voters, which NDTC trainer Joshua Norris said is crucial information.

When Slappy knocked on doors, she spent half of each conversation explaining why she was a Green Party candidate. “When I run as a Democrat, if I have a staff doing all the little things, then I can go out and meet people and talk about my vision,” she said.

She hasn’t wasted any time since the NDTC training ended. Slappy said she called her former staff and volunteers and started forming a new team the following week. And Slappy has already assigned their first assignment: opposition research on Bernstine, particularly his voting record. She also is filling her calendar with community events she plans to attend. “Church functions, school functions—I don’t care if it’s a yard sale, I’m going to be there talking to voters about my story and my vision.”

Ms Ocasio-Cortez addressed criticism she has faced from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress at a New York Hall of Science event.

“You know what? I don’t care anymore, because at least I’m trying and they’re not,” she said.

“I just introduced the Green New Deal two weeks ago and it’s creating all of this conversation, why? Because no one else has even tried.”

Her comments came during a discussion with Girls Who Code founder Reshma Saujani and young women of colour who have designed apps which address social issues.

Critics have claimed the Green New Deal resolution is too extreme and unworkable, with Donald Trump incorrectly suggesting it would “permanently eliminate all planes, cars, cows, oil, gas and the military”.

Ms Ocasio-Cortez added: “So people are like ‘Oh it’s unrealistic, oh it’s vague, oh it doesn’t address this little minute thing’ and I’m like ‘You try! You do it!’ Because you’re not, so until you do it, I’m the boss, How about that?”

The resolution, which has been proposed by Ms Ocasio-Cortez and senator Edward J Markey, sets out broad changes to American society which aim to reduce the effects of climate change.

It includes key goals of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero over 10 years and 100 per cent renewable energy in the US by 2030.

The proposal currently has the support of major Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand.

Senator Amy Klobuchar has said she would vote for the non-binding resolution but suggested she would oppose certain elements of the proposal when it came to the details of legislation.

Former vice president Al Gore and former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon have also supported the idea in principle.





However, the resolution has faced opposition from fellow Democrats, such as California senator Dianne Feinstein.

Ms Feinstein was recently filmed arguing with a group of school children over the proposal, saying she could not support it because “there’s no way to pay for it”.

“I’ve been doing this for 30 years. I know what I’m doing,” she said.

“You come in here and you say it has to be my way or the highway. I don’t respond to that.”

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has said he intends to bring forward a vote on the Green New Deal, which would force Democrats to formally decide whether to back the proposal.

The resolution is not expected to pass the Senate, which is controlled by a Republican majority, and the planned vote has been criticised by Democratic leader Chuck Schumer as a ""cynical ploy"" to split the party.",Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez delivers impassioned response to critics: 'I'm the boss.

Last fall, a tipster sent the progressive opposition research firm American Bridge an old video clip of Michigan Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Schuette. The 39-second scene opens with a woman off-screen asking a seated Schuette to move closer to a lamp to his right, as they prepare to tape a television interview. “I would be happy to move closer to the lamp,” Schuette tells her, making a kind of heavy eye contact recognizable to any woman. “I will do anything you want. Some things I may not let you run the camera on.” That was pretty much it. He doesn’t touch her, or explicitly proposition her. He’s simply and indisputably creepy.

Schuette’s subtle grossness might not have counted as a bona fide scandal a few years ago. But we’re obviously now in an era in which sexual harassment stories that might have been laughed off just a few years ago are more often taken seriously by both the media and the public. American Bridge decided to release the video via tweet, calling it “interesting.” That was all it took to take off. By the next day, Schuette was forced to address the incident in a debate, where he awkwardly explained he was “apparently trying to be funny.” The clip was eventually featured on Last Week Tonight With John Oliver—“I don’t know how she got through the interview without punching him in the dick”—and in an attack ad released by American Bridge a week before the election. Schuette lost the race to Democrat Gretchen Whitmer by more than 400,000 votes.

These are interesting times to be an opposition researcher. The job used to be pretty self-explanatory: Hurt a rival candidate by digging up evidence of past criminal behavior, ties to political extremists, or sexual infelicities. Now, the stuff of scandal is getting scrambled. “What meets the bar for opposition research—it’s not higher, it’s just different,” said Bradley Beychok, American Bridge’s co-founder and president. Some of the old bombshells no longer work, while formerly minor bits of gossip are now potential grenades.

We have a president who seems impervious to the longtime standbys of political embarrassment, including revelations of financial misdeeds and sexual impropriety. Trump’s Teflon-like reputation has caused some to ask whether opposition research still matters at all: If a man can be elected president just weeks after a tape emerges of him bragging about grabbing women “by the pussy,” then why bother digging up anything?

Trump is a singular figure whose awfulness is baked into his appeal to much of his base. Still, it’s true that cultural and legislative shifts have robbed many old-fashioned taboos of their shock value.

When presidential candidate Bill Clinton admitted in 1992 he had experimented with marijuana as a young man, it became a defining moment of that election cycle. Today, stories about dabbling in drug use are now offered up as charming personal anecdotes. When a radio host asked Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris last week* if she had ever smoked pot, she happily said she had—“and I inhaled.” The only whiff of “scandal” that came out of her confession was that Harris claimed she listened to Tupac while she smoked in college, when the rapper’s first album didn’t come out until years after she graduated.

“As an oppo researcher now, you’re going to say, ‘Let’s go back and look at this candidate 10 or 20 years ago and see how they were talking about women.’ ” — Tim Miller, America Rising founder

But in some categories of behavior, the standards have clearly grown stricter. Misbehavior brushed off as roguish a few decades ago can torpedo a candidate’s career in the post-#MeToo era. Take Sen. Al Franken’s resignation under duress in 2017 after multiple women accused him of groping them as they posed for photographs. Tim Miller, founder of the conservative opposition research group America Rising, said that many rumors about longtime Democratic Sens. Ted Kennedy and Christopher Dodd would now be campaign-killers. “If you’re an opposition researcher now, considering changing mores, you’re going to say, ‘Let’s go back and look at this candidate 10 or 20 years ago and see how they were talking about women.’ ” (Google “waitress sandwich” if you have the stomach for it, or revisit Carrie Fisher’s account of the time Kennedy asked her if she would have sex with Dodd.)

Stories about financial corruption are also hot right now, Beychok said, because they resonate with the larger political narrative of the Trump era. “You have to look at what the weather’s like,” he said. “Wasteful spending, corruption, graft, greed—voters are interested in them.”

It’s not just the substance of opposition research that is changing. The source material has changed, too. Yearbooks have long been a staple of well-funded opposition campaigns, but Miller said yearbook-sourced scoops have become more appealing to reporters after the Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and Brett Kavanaugh stories. “If someone found a minorly offensive comment in a yearbook, that would be bigger news now,” he said. “Reporters are interested in trends.” Social media is another clear font of source material. Facebook groups of alumni make it easier to contact old classmates. Beychok’s firm has internal algorithms to trawl targets’ past activities on social media, digging up problematic old faves and retweets.

Tim Miller argues that there’s a growing party divide when it comes to the stuff of scandal. Take the case of Northam, who is facing intense pressure from his own party to resign over a photograph on his medical school yearbook page depicting a man in blackface and another in a KKK robe; in a press conference denying he appeared in the photo, Northam said he had once applied shoe polish to his face to dress as Michael Jackson for a dance competition. The episode would have been plenty shocking 10 or 20 years ago. But today, Miller believes, “Democrats have put such an emphasis on racial justice, on leveling the playing field, on discrimination against women and gays [that] having a white man putting on blackface to dress like Michael Jackson, it’s particularly damaging within his party, given where the party is trying to go.” And opposition researchers try to use that to their advantage.

In this new landscape, a Democratic presidential candidate like Joe Biden could be newly vulnerable, Miller said. The left now views his handling of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings as a disaster, for example. He also has a reputation for the kind of interpersonal ickiness that has inspired headlines like “9 Times Joe Biden Creepily Whispered in Women’s Ears.” “Biden right now is dealing with oppo related to things that were in the mainstream of the Democratic Party 20 years ago,” Miller said. Biden, of course, is almost certainly aware of his own potential issues on this front. The shifting contours of what counts as “dirt” means candidates have to interrogate their own pasts for new kinds of potential pitfalls. “Self-research has been around a long time,” Beychok said. “But we’ve seen, in the last two and a half years, a volcano erupt of what you have to think about in terms of what happened in the past.”

And that would increase the odds that three or more candidates could remain viable well into the primary process—a dynamic Democrats have not experienced since the 1980s.

But for all his influence, Sanders still faces huge obstacles in his second bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Key among them is a history of resistance in 2016 from core groups in the party, including African Americans and voters who identify as partisan Democrats.

Read: Bernie Sanders is the Democratic front-runner

Sanders this week quickly demonstrated his greatest asset as a candidate: a passionate grassroots following that includes a massive base of small-dollar online donors. On Wednesday he reported that, in the first 24 hours after his announcement, he raised nearly $6 million online, far more than any of his rivals did after entering the race. He’s in a stronger position than in 2016, too, in the internal party debate. As Sanders noted in his announcement-day interview with CBS, more of the Democratic Party’s leaders, including several of his 2020 competitors, have moved toward positions he took in the last presidential campaign, supporting a single-payer health-care system and free four-year public college. “All of those ideas and many more are now part of the political mainstream,” Sanders crowed during the interview.

It’s unquestionable that more Democrats are supporting those ideas than when Sanders aired them in 2016. But all the policies remain contested: Klobuchar, for one, has already rejected both single-payer and free tuition. Other potential candidates targeting more moderate voters, such as Biden and several former governors eyeing the race, would be almost certain to follow. (It’s also worth noting that the Democratic-controlled House is unlikely to pass legislation on either matter.) Even some of the candidates who have echoed Sanders’s overall goals are likely to challenge some of his specific proposals as unaffordable or excessive, as Booker has done by rejecting Sanders’s call to virtually eliminate private health insurance.

In other words, Sanders hasn’t won the war of ideas in the party nearly as much as he’s suggested. In fact, he’s virtually certain to face tougher scrutiny over his agenda than he did in 2016, when Clinton made the misguided strategic choice not to criticize his proposals as undesirable or unaffordable, but only as unlikely to pass Congress.

Near Baghouz (Syria) (AFP) - US-backed forces evacuated over 40 truckloads of people from the Islamic State group's last Syria redoubt on Monday, as they sought to clear out civilians before a final push to crush the jihadists.

The Syrian Democratic Forces has slowed down its offensive on the final pocket due to the presence of civilians, with just a scrap of the IS ""caliphate"" remaining from a territory that once spanned Syria and Iraq.

An AFP correspondent saw at least 46 trucks crammed with men, women and children approaching an SDF outpost, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of the jihadist bastion.

One vehicle was packed with women clad in black and men who covered their faces. Wounded people were also among the latest evacuees.

Holdout IS fighters and civilians, mostly relatives of jihadists, are trapped inside less than half a square kilometre in the village of Baghouz near the Iraqi border.

The Kurdish-led SDF evacuated nearly 5,000 men, women and children from the jihadist redoubt on Wednesday and Friday, but none over the weekend.

Earlier on Monday, SDF spokesman Mustefa Bali, said thousands remained inside the IS pocket.

""According to what we heard from those who have left, there are nearly 5,000 people still inside,"" Bali told AFP.

At the SDF screening point outside the village, SDF fighters expressed hopes Monday's arrivals would be the last.

""We want it to be over,"" one of them, 29-year-old Mazloum, told AFP.

""Every day we say today is the day but we hope it will all end today and not tomorrow,"" he said.

- 'Potent threat' -

Kurdish foreign affairs official Abdel Karim Omar said the SDF would announce the end of the IS proto-state ""in the next few days"".

""But this does not mean that we have eliminated terrorism, which must be eradicated at the roots,"" he said.

Beyond Baghouz, IS still has thousands of fighters and sleeper cells across several countries.

In Syria, it retains a presence in the vast Badia desert, and the jihadists have claimed deadly attacks in SDF-held territory.

Iraq's President Barham Saleh warned Monday the jihadist threat remains high, despite gains made against IS over the past year.

""We've seen in the past that the mission is yet to be accomplished,"" Saleh said in a Paris speech, evoking the infamous 2003 Iraq claim by former US president George W. Bush.

""You have many, many extremists in many pockets in Syria, causing a potent threat to Syria, Iraq and the Western world,"" he said.

- Secret transfers -

Thousands of suspected IS fighters have attempted to blend in with civilians fleeing the crumbling ""caliphate"".

According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, around 46,000 people, including thousands of jihadists, have streamed out of the Baghouz pocket since early December.

The SDF screens those exiting at an outpost outside the village to weed out potential IS fighters.

After being vetted, women, children, and men not suspected of belonging to the extremist group are transported north to the Kurdish-run camp of Al-Hol, while suspected jihadists are sent to SDF-held detention centres.

""The international community is not currently taking responsibility towards the large number of people leaving the last IS pocket, especially children,"" said Omar, describing Al-Hol as overwhelmed by the arrivals.

At least 78 people, mostly children, have died on the way to the camp or shortly after arriving in recent weeks, according to the International Rescue Committee.

The Observatory on Monday said 1,400 people, mainly IS relatives, were secretly transported from orchards on the outskirts of Baghouz to neighbouring Iraq during the past 24 hours.

Kurdish foreign affairs official did not confirm the transfer, but denied the SDF was responsible.

""In principle, we do not hand over any person passing through our territories to Iraqi authorities or any other party,"" Omar said.

Such transfers can only happen if they were trucked from Baghouz ""by another party"", he explained, without specifying.

Baghdad on Sunday said the SDF have transferred 280 Iraqi nationals accused of fighting alongside IS to Iraqi authorities.

The Iraqi president said Monday his country's courts would prosecute 13 suspected French jihadists, who were turned over to Iraq after being captured by the SDF.",Syria force carries out major evacuation from last IS holdout,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/syria-force-carries-major-evacuation-last-holdout-162952545.html

NEW YORK (AP) — Can Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders recapture the magic that fueled his first presidential campaign?

To win the nomination, he may not need to.

As Sanders, a 77-year-old self-described democratic socialist, formally launches his 2020 campaign, the lessons of President Donald Trump's victory in the GOP's packed 2016 contest loom large.

With better-established Republican contenders dividing the GOP primary vote that year, Trump began racking up primary victories with 30 to 40 percent of each state's vote. He captured his party's nomination even as six or seven of every 10 primary voters backed another Republican candidate.

Sanders' team is betting that the bar for victory in the more-crowded 2020 Democratic field could be even lower. That simple math — and an extraordinary small-dollar fundraising operation — suggests that Sanders is poised to maintain his status as a political force in 2020 whether most of his party wants him to or not.

Sanders is showing no desire to change his approach to broaden his appeal, as is sometimes the case with ambitious second-time candidates. Nina Turner, president of Our Revolution, the political arm of Sanders' expansive network, said the 2020 campaign ""is really about him finishing what he started.""

In a political world in which windows of opportunity rarely stay open long, it's possible that Sanders' moment may have passed.

In 2016, he was the sole option for anti-establishment Democrats who didn't support Hillary Clinton. Today, Democrats are sorting through a far more diverse field that could ultimately exceed two dozen high-profile contenders. Many of them — and there are exceptions — have adopted Sanders' far-left policy priorities and anti-establishment rhetoric.

Signs of erosion are easy to find.

While many grassroots activists cheered Sanders' decision, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another self-described democratic socialist and a worker for Sanders' first presidential campaign, remained silent.

""We're excited to see so many progressives in the race,"" Ocasio-Cortez spokesman Corbin Trent said, declining to address Sanders' big announcement directly. ""We're not thinking at all about the next election.""

Sanders enters a field that already includes progressive favorites like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris. They have adopted much of Sanders' agenda to provide free universal health care, free college tuition and a $15 minimum wage. Still unknown is whether former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke or former Vice President Joe Biden will join the race, two prospects who could peel away some of Sanders' base of support beyond the ultra-liberal wing of the party.

At the same time, Sanders has little hope of winning over many establishment-minded former Clinton supporters, still bitter from their perception that he didn't work hard enough to defeat Trump once Clinton captured the Democratic nomination.

""Amazing how Bernie and his 3,708,294 fewer supporters squandered two years. They quadrupled down on their rigging rant and now there are 10 alternatives,"" longtime Clinton adviser Philippe Reines tweeted. ""Get ready to Feel the Fizzle.""

But it is Sanders' consistency that has endeared him to a passionate base of liberal activists across the country who remain deeply loyal to him and his decadeslong fight for income equality and universal health care. Some of his competitors — particularly Warren and Harris — have also developed nationwide followings, but no one starts out with the same kind of fundraising appeal or organized network of like-minded groups such as Our Revolution, Justice Democrats and the Democratic Socialists of America.

""We're more powerful than ever in the politics. We changed the game,"" said 28-year-old Moumita Ahmed, the co-founder of Millennials Want Bernie 2020. ""Bernie Sanders is still the only candidate that's not the status quo.""

Anticipating Sanders' decision, her organization had already organized chapters in Michigan, California, Nevada, New York, South Carolina and Washington state. She also donated $27 to Sanders on Tuesday, matching the often-touted average donation that fueled his first run.

Overall, Sanders raised more than $4 million from nearly 150,000 individual donors in the first 12 hours after launching his 2020 bid, his campaign said Tuesday.",Analysis: Sanders may not need 2016 magic to be 2020 force,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/analysis-sanders-may-not-2016-052921987.html
286,Empty,2019-02-20T11:00:00Z,A little recommendation algorithm goes a long way,"The Interface is a daily column about the intersection of social media and democracy. Subscribe to the newsletter here .

It’s been a big month for conspiracy theories. Last week, Rep. Adam Schiff sent a strongly worded letter to Google and Facebook about the way their platforms recommend anti-vaccination content to parents, potentially putting healthy populations at risk. This week, new reports are taking a deeper look the unintended consequences of YouTube recommendations, starting with the conspiracy theory that the earth is flat.

In the Guardian, Ian Sample has news of a recent presentation at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in which a researcher from Texas Tech University discussed her findings from interviewing 30 participants in a recent convention of flat-earthers. The takeaway: YouTube brought them there, Sample says:

Of the 30, all but one said they had not considered the Earth to be flat two years ago but changed their minds after watching videos promoting conspiracy theories on YouTube. “The only person who didn’t say this was there with his daughter and his son-in-law and they had seen it on YouTube and told him about it,” said Asheley Landrum, who led the research at Texas Tech University. The interviews revealed that most had been watching videos about other conspiracies, with alternative takes on 9/11, the Sandy Hook school shooting and whether Nasa really went to the moon, when YouTube offered up Flat Earth videos for them to watch next.

Flat-earth videos could fit the definition of “borderline content,” which YouTube said last month it would stop recommending to users as suggested next videos to watch. (YouTube also rolled out new disciplinary procedures today.) But as Kevin Roose writes in a sharp column for the New York Times, YouTube’s efforts may be thwarted by the fact that many of its most popular creators are thriving precisely because they create borderline content. Now that they have tens of millions of followers, how much does changing the recommendation algorithm really matter?

Roose focuses on star YouTuber Shane Dawson, who has 20 million followers and recently posted a smash hit, 104-minute documentary promoting various conspiracy theories. (Dawson has previously said, of the flat-earth theory, that it “kind of makes sense”.)

Innocent or not, Mr. Dawson’s videos contain precisely the type of viral misinformation that YouTube now says it wants to limit. And its effort raises an uncomfortable question: What if stemming the tide of misinformation on YouTube means punishing some of the platform’s biggest stars? [...] Part of the problem for platforms like YouTube and Facebook — which has also pledged to clean up misinformation that could lead to real-world harm — is that the definition of “harmful” misinformation is circular. There is no inherent reason that a video questioning the official 9/11 narrative is more dangerous than a video asserting the existence of U.F.O.s or Bigfoot. A conspiracy theory is harmful if it results in harm — at which point it’s often too late for platforms to act.

What makes this phenomenon insidious is that it can become dangerous even when no one even believes the conspiracy theory being floated, at least not initially. In 2015, The Onion published a satirical op-ed by an infant who claimed he wanted to eat “one of those multicolored detergent pods.” This was followed in 2017 by a satirical video from CollegeHumor titled “Don’t Eat The Laundry Pods. Seriously (They’re Poison.)”

If you were online at all last year, you probably know what’s coming next. From the Washington Post’s history of the Tide Pods challenge:

Last year, U.S. poison control centers received reports of more than 10,500 children younger than 5 who were exposed to the capsules. The same year, nearly 220 teens were reportedly exposed, and about 25 percent of those cases were intentional, according to data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers. So far in 2018, there have been 37 reported cases among teenagers — half of them intentional, according to the data.

The Tide Pods challenge was just a joke, until it wasn’t. Until a certain point, videos about it were pure entertainment. So when did that change? Imagine that you’re working at YouTube. When do you flip the switch declaring the whole subject to be “borderline content”?

I don’t think this question is unanswerable. There was almost certainly a moment in the evolution of the Tide Pods story where it became clear that it had taken on a life of its own. But determining that moment in real time would require platforms to take on more of an editorial role than they have historically been comfortable with. (Forcing platforms to take such a role is, incidentally, one of the chief recommendations in the UK Parliament committee report I covered here yesterday.)

Generally I find it tedious when reporters slag platforms for “not admitting they’re a media company.” “Media company” is not a legal definition, after all, and Facebook has already acknowledged that it bears responsibility for what users post.

And so I don’t care whether tech platforms identify as media companies. But when it comes to policing the conspiracy theories that they help flourish, I do wish that they would act like media companies. When the next Tide Pods challenge arrives — and it will — a little editorial intervention could go a long way.

FTC complaint accuses Facebook of revealing sensitive health data in groups

A new complaint filed with the Federal Trade Commission accuses Facebook of failing to prevent sensitive health data from being shared in its groups, Colin Lecher reports:

The complaint, filed with the agency last month and released publicly today, argues that the company improperly disclosed information on members of closed groups. The issue first came into the public eye in July, when members of a group for women with a gene mutation called BRCA discovered sensitive information, like names and email addresses of members, could be downloaded in bulk, either manually or through a Chrome extension. Around that time, Facebook made changes to Groups that ended the practice, but said the decision was not related to the BRCA group’s concerns. The company also said at the time that the ability to view the data was not a privacy flaw, and noted that there was also an option for “secret” groups, which are more difficult to join but also have more limited discoverability.

Twitter is bringing its ad transparency tools, which are based on ones developed by Facebook after the 2016 election, to the European Union member states, India, and Australia.

What Happens When Techno-Utopians Actually Run a Country

Here’s a compelling longread about how a populist web entrepreneur planted the seeds of democratic revolution in Italy, only to die as the party he helped found made alliance with the hard right. Before America had Trump, Italy had Berlusconi; we would do well to reflect on Italy’s recent experiments with direct democracy:

Five Star’s web portal now included a tool for subjecting important decisions to an online vote, and so the decision on whether to ally with UKIP was put to the movement: direct democracy in action. But in the days and weeks before the vote, Casaleggio published articles on the blog hailing Farage as a democratic crusader against a monolithic EU. “Farage Defends the Sovereignty of the Italian People,” read one headline. Another article, entitled “Nigel Farage, The Truth,” listed UKIP’s supposedly progressive credentials, such as being an “antiwar … democratic organization” where “no form of racism, sexism, or xenophobia is tolerated,” and which believes in “direct democracy.” The post that finally teed up the online vote made it very clear that the proposed alliance with UKIP was the best and only solution. According to Zanni, this was Casaleggio Associates’ modus operandi when it came to online votes: Provide a “cosmetic” appearance of choice while pushing for a particular option. In the end, 78 percent of the members who voted opted to join Farage. After years of studying how to shape online consensus, Casaleggio had mastered the art.

Russia’s Network of Millennial Media

Bradley Hanlon and Thomas Morley write about the latest Russian influence campaign to pop up on American social networks:

The video is short, digestible, and catchy. A young Twitter personality dives into the latest news from Venezuela while trendy music plays in the background. According to the video, President Donald Trump and his “right-wing” allies in South America are supporting a “straight-up coup” in the country. She continues, “My god – one week it’s Syria, today it’s Venezuela, next week it’s Iran. Pick a damn country America!” The video, which has over 300,000 views on Twitter and nearly 600,000 views on Facebook, has high production value and is clearly targeted at digital-oriented millennials. But this isn’t a BuzzFeed or Vice production. Instead a watermark for “Soapbox,” an online media company, sits in the right-hand corner. What many people watching and sharing the video probably don’t know is that – along with several other social media channels targeting young, digital consumers – Soapbox (@SoapboxStand on Facebook) is a product of Russia’s state-backed media.

Emoji are showing up in court cases exponentially, and courts aren’t prepared

Dami Lee explores the dilemma that emoji-based communication is posing for our courts:

Bay Area prosecutors were trying to prove that a man arrested during a prostitution sting was guilty of pimping charges, and among the evidence was a series of Instagram DMs he’d allegedly sent to a woman. One read: “Teamwork make the dream work” with high heels and money bag emoji placed at the end. Prosecutors said the message implied a working relationship between the two of them. The defendant said it could mean he was trying to strike up a romantic relationship. Who was right? Emoji are showing up as evidence in court more frequently with each passing year. Between 2004 and 2019, there was an exponential rise in emoji and emoticon references in US court opinions, with over 30 percent of all cases appearing in 2018, according to Santa Clara University law professor Eric Goldman, who has been tracking all of the references to “emoji” and “emoticon” that show up in US court opinions. So far, the emoji and emoticons have rarely been important enough to sway the direction of a case, but as they become more common, the ambiguity in how emoji are displayed and what we interpret emoji to mean could become a larger issue for courts to contend with.

Even Without Amazon, Tech Could Keep Gaining Ground in New York

In the wake of Amazon bailing on NYC, there’s been much clucking that the city squandered a once-in-a-generation chance to become a tech power house. But the tech jobs are likely still coming anyway, report Ben Casselman, Keith Collins, and Karl Russell:

Long before Amazon announced that New York had won a share of its second-headquarters sweepstakes, tech was a rising force in the local economy. Google, which already has thousands of workers in New York, plans to double its work force in the city and build a $1 billion campus just south of the West Village. Facebook, Apple, Uber and other companies are also expanding their presences, as is a rising generation of homegrown companies. Even Amazon itself said Thursday that it planned to keep adding to its New York work force.

Even years later, Twitter doesn’t delete your direct messages

Today’s extremely on-brand Twitter story is this joint from Zack Whittaker and Natasha Lomas reporting that the company cannot reliably delete the messages that you, uh, delete. (OK, this story is four days old but I’ve got a lot going on right now!)

Twitter retains direct messages for years, including messages you and others have deleted, but also data sent to and from accounts that have been deactivated and suspended, according to security researcher Karan Saini. Saini found years-old messages in a file from an archive of his data obtained through the website from accounts that were no longer on Twitter. He also reported a similar bug, found a year earlier but not disclosed until now, that allowed him to use a since-deprecated API to retrieve direct messages even after a message was deleted from both the sender and the recipient — though, the bug wasn’t able to retrieve messages from suspended accounts.

How loot boxes hooked gamers and left regulators spinning

A loot box is a digital good, most commonly found in a video game, that gives the player a random reward. Some items can only be found in loot boxes, leading players to buy many of them in the hopes of getting the thing they want. This is basically how I collected basketball cards in the 1990s — but is this maybe also illegal gambling? Makena Kelly takes a look:

Some countries in the European Union have already begun to act. Last September, the Gambling Regulators European Forum (GREF) put out a statement that was signed by regulators from 15 different EU countries that were concerned about the practice. Last May, the Belgian Gaming Commission decided that loot boxes fell under the jurisdiction of its gambling law, and studios like Blizzard, Valve, and EA all pulled loot boxes from their games in those countries. As the concern spread across Europe, it started to catch fire in the US, but that momentum has stalled, and the video game industry’s lobbying efforts over this $30 billion industry seem to have curbed any tangible progress to regulate the sale of loot boxes.

Slack off. Send videos instead with $11M-funded Loom

I always enjoy seeing social apps reborn as enterprise solutions. So here’s some sort of video-based … Slack competitor? Josh Constine reports:

If a picture is worth a thousand words, how many emails can you replace with a video? As offices fragment into remote teams, work becomes more visual, and social media makes us more comfortable on camera, it’s time for collaboration to go beyond text. That’s the idea behind Loom, a fast-rising startup that equips enterprises with instant video messaging tools. In a click, you can film yourself or narrate a screenshare to get an idea across in a more vivid, personal way. Instead of scheduling a video call, employees can asynchronously discuss projects or give ‘stand-up’ updates without massive disruptions to their workflow.

Global Britain can lead the world in confronting the dark side of big tech

Ben Scott, a former adviser to the secretary of state during the Obama Administration, says that Facebook succeeded in the rare feat of bringing together the major British parties in agreement about something:

Setting aside partisan battling for once, politicians of every stripe seem to agree that the titans of digital media should take responsibility for the harms their products can cause to public health, security, privacy and much more. And it would also be nice if they paid a fair share in tax. Despite the relentless turbulence of the Brexit debates, select committees in Parliament (led by the Tories and Liberal Democrats) have conducted serious investigations in the last few months into the social problems caused by the tech industry. Both have proposed major changes to the law.

The Pentagon Needs to Woo AI Experts Away From Big Tech

Amy Stern says the Department of Defense is losing in its effort to woo and retain talent from tech giants:

The future of AI—and, by extension, the future of humanity—is already controlled by just nine big tech titans, who are developing the frameworks, chipsets, and networks, funding the majority of research, earning the lion’s share of patents, and, in the process, mining our data in ways that aren’t transparent or observable. Six are in the US, and I call them the G-MAFIA: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, IBM, and Apple. Three are in China, and they are the BAT: Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent. The few government agencies built for innovation—the US Digital Service, the US Army’s Futures Command, the Defense Innovation Board, and the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) initiatives—are brittle in their youth and subject to defunding and staff reductions as the revolving door of political appointees spins. In practical terms, there is too little strategic collaboration between the G-MAFIA and our government agencies or military offices—at least not without a lucrative contract in place. While the G-MAFIA usually lobby for huge tax incentives and breaks to do business, they also must agree to the arcane, outdated procurement requirement policies of the military and government. This doesn’t exactly accelerate AI in our national interest. If anything, it shines a bright light on the cultural differences between Silicon Valley and DC, and it slows down modernization.

Instagram posts land former Trump confidant into deeper legal trouble

“Never tweet” has been a popular theme in this newsletter from the beginning. But this week Roger Stone gave us good reason to say: Never Instagram. From Makena Kelly:

Last night, former Donald Trump adviser Roger Stone posted an image on Instagram of the federal judge presiding over his case that displayed a crosshairs logo in the background near her head. Now, that same judge is calling for Stone to explain the posts in court this week. The original post with the crosshairs near US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson’s head was deleted soon after Stone published it. After the post was perceived as a direct threat to Jackson by many social media users, Stone deleted it and posted the same image, cropping out the crosshairs.

Some Instagram posts really could use a filter. The kind that stops them from being posted in the first place.

Speaking with reporters after accepting the El Pasoan of the Year award from the local …,"EL PASO — Beto O'Rourke could be a presidential candidate days from now — or not.

O'Rourke kept the political world on the edge of its seat Tuesday with his latest outing, an appearance at Fort Bliss to accept the El Pasoan of the Year award from the local publication El Paso Inc. Speaking with reporters afterward, he reiterated he is hoping to decide on 2020 by the end of the month — nine days away — and left open the possibility of going a different route, including running for U.S. Senate again.

""I'm trying to figure out how I can best serve this country, where I can do the greatest good for the United States of America, so yeah, I’m thinking through that, and it, you know, may involve running for the presidency, it may involve something else,"" O'Rourke said.

He repeatedly expressed hope he could reach a decision by Feb. 28 but noted he would not be ""limited by the end of this month."" And he indicated he has not given much thought to how he would announce his decision — or what a White House bid would look like beyond being similar to his past campaigns.

The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.

The comments contributed to a lingering suspense about O'Rourke's 2020 plans even as allies and supporters are increasingly optimistic he will run for president. They have been encouraged by his recent re-emergence in the national spotlight, which began in earnest with a Feb. 5 interview with Oprah Winfrey in which he first offered his timetable for a 2020 decision. The interview aired Saturday on TV.

""We think things are certainly looking good,"" said Michael Soneff, a Democratic consultant in California working for one of the groups trying to draft O'Rourke into the 2020 race. Soneff added that he was still willing to give O'Rourke time and space to make a decision with which he is fully comfortable. ""The more that this process reflects what he actually feels is the better,"" Soneff said.

While O'Rourke has shown little outward interest in taking on U.S. Sen. John Cornyn next year, some Democrats remain hopeful that he will ultimately see it as a more winnable race. A recent poll commissioned by Dallas Democratic consultant Jeff Dalton found O'Rourke trailing Cornyn by just 2 percentage points in a hypothetical matchup.

A Senate run is not O'Rourke's only alternative to running for president in 2020. He could also wind up as the nominee's running mate — something he also did not rule out while answering a reporter's question in Spanish on Tuesday.

Still, the White House race is rapidly taking shape, and the latest reminder came hours before O'Rourke's appearance, when U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., announced he was running for president again. That leaves O'Rourke and former Vice President Joe Biden among the potentially top-tier candidates who have not yet made up their minds about 2020.

Iowa Democratic strategist Jeff Link said he ""absolutely"" still sees an opening for O'Rourke in the race but noted, ""If you're not already in and you're still thinking about it ... once Biden makes a decision, that's going to start tipping a lot of dominoes.""

Since the Oprah interview, O'Rourke has had little problem with at least staying in headlines. He had a starring role in his hometown's response last week to a visit by President Donald Trump — a moment O'Rourke singled out Tuesday as perhaps his proudest as an El Pasoan. And in the days after Trump's trip, O'Rourke vaulted back into the national spotlight with an MSNBC interview in which he said he would ""absolutely"" take down El Paso's border wall if he could. That prompted a torrent of Republican criticism and led his fellow Democrats who are already 2020 candidates to face the same question.

During his Tuesday appearance — which the Republican National Committee bracketed with a statement deriding O'Rourke as ""No Borders Beto"" — O'Rourke made clear that his comment applied specifically to the El Paso wall.

""I think there is a role for physical barriers in some places,"" O'Rourke said, noting he was specifically referring to the El Paso wall because crime data suggests the city did not become safer as a result of it. On border barriers elsewhere, O'Rourke said he ""would work with local stakeholders, the property owners, the communities, those who actually live there to determine the best security solution.""

O'Rourke kept up his profile over the weekend, visiting Chicago and Wisconsin, a state that Democrats notoriously lost in 2016 after presidential nominee Hillary Clinton did not campaign there during the general election. Asked Friday in Milwaukee if the state was overlooked in 2016, O'Rourke told reporters, ""It sure seems that way.""

""It is clear to me that all our communities need to be listened to, heard and understood, regardless of their importance to the Electoral College or anyone's political prospects or the next election,"" said O'Rourke, who visited all 254 Texas counties in his Senate campaign. ""When we fail to show up, we get what we deserve.""

It was also on the Wisconsin trip that O'Rourke grappled with an issue that he'll only hear more of if he runs for president: his less-than-clear-cut political identity in an increasingly progressive Democratic Party. Fielding questions from students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, O'Rourke emphasized his long-running aversion to political labels as he referenced the different kinds of scrutiny his record has received as a statewide candidate in Texas versus a potential presidential contender.

""In Texas, Ted Cruz called me a socialist. I’m too liberal for Texas,"" O'Rourke said. ""Outside of Texas, people say, 'Is he really a Democrat? I think he’s a closet Republican.' I don’t know where I am on a spectrum, and I almost could care less. I just want to get to better things for this country.""

One label that O'Rourke has eschewed in recent days: socialist. In Wisconsin and El Paso, O'Rourke declared himself a capitalist when confronted with questions about the rise of democratic socialism, the ideology held by rising-star U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sanders. Addressing the topic in El Paso, O'Rourke told reporters he does not ""see how we're able to meet any of the fundamental challenges we have as a country without in part harnessing the power of the market.""

The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.

O'Rourke has nonetheless praised Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders, whose entrance into the 2020 race O'Rourke cheered on Tuesday. O'Rourke — a late and arguably reluctant endorser of Sanders' 2016 primary rival, Hillary Clinton — told reporters the Vermont senator ""added so much to the national conversation"" on issues like health care and campaign finance and that it's ""healthy for democracy"" for people like Sanders to run. As for Ocasio-Cortez, O'Rourke continued to speak positively about her Green New Deal while in Wisconsin, though he suggested the proposal be more narrowly tailored to focus on climate change.

Back in El Paso on Tuesday, O'Rourke found himself in less politically charged territory as he accepted the El Pasoan of the Year award, extolling the city for giving him opportunities in business after college and then public service. The impassioned speech was not without potential 2020 undertones as O'Rourke hailed El Paso's response to Trump's visit, lamented that the country is more divided than ever and predicted that ""El Paso, more than any other community in this country, can meet the challenge of this moment.""

El Paso Inc. hands out the award every year, but there was a ubiquitous sense inside the Centennial Banquet and Conference Center on Tuesday that this time was different. Speaker after speaker heaped praise on O'Rourke as a political phenom, and before he took the stage, the audience was shown two videos congratulating him on the award. One was from U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass., a close friend of O'Rourke who has already endorsed home-state Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president. The other was from U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, whom O'Rourke opposed for minority leader in 2016.

Opening his speech, O'Rourke thanked his fellow Democrats for the two videos — and seemed particularly surprised by Pelosi's appearance. O'Rourke jokingly said that until he saw the video, he didn't think Pelosi knew he existed.

O'Rourke was in a similarly lighthearted mood as he approached a gaggle of local, state and national media after the speech.

""Thank y'all for being here, huge honor to receive this award,"" O'Rourke said to reporters. ""I bet that's not what you want to know about, though.""",Beto O'Rourke keeps up the suspense ahead of expected 2020 election announcement,Texastribune.org,https://www.texastribune.org/2019/02/19/beto-orourke-keeps-suspense-days-until-anticipated-2020-decision/

So far it has mostly been used to create altered pornographic clips featuring celebrity women’s faces but once the techniques are perfected, deepfake revenge porn purporting to show people cheating on their partners won’t be far behind.

But more than becoming a nasty tool for stalkers and harassers, deepfakes threaten to undermine trust in political institutions and society as a whole. The White House recently justified temporarily banning a reporter from its press conferences using reportedly sped up genuine footage of an incident involving the journalist. Imagine the implications of seeing ultra-realistic but artificial footage of government leaders planning assassinations, CEOs colluding with foreign agents or a renowned philanthropist abusing children.

So-called fake news has already increased many people’s scepticism towards politicians, journalists and other public figures. It is becoming so easy to create entirely fictional scenarios that we can no longer trust any video footage at face value. This threatens our political, legal and media systems, not to mention our personal relationships. We will need to create new forms of consensus on which to base our social reality. New ways of checking and distributing power – some political, some technological – could help us achieve this.

Fake scandals, fake politicians

Deepfakes are scary because they allow anyone’s image to be co-opted, and call into question our ability to trust what we see. One obvious use of deepfakes would be to falsely implicate people in scandals. Even if the incriminating footage is subsequently proven to be fake, the damage to the victim’s reputation may be impossible to repair. And politicians could tweak old footage of themselves to make it appear as if they had always supported something that had recently become popular, updating their positions in real time.

There could even be public figures who are entirely imaginary, original but not authentic. Meanwhile, video footage could become useless as evidence in court. Broadcast news could be reduced to people debating whether clips were authentic or not, using ever more complex AI to try to detect deepfakes.

But the arms race that already exists between fake content creators and those detecting or debunking disinformation (such as Facebook’s planned fake news “war room”) hides a deeper issue. The mere existence of deepfakes undermines confidence and trust, just as the possibility that an election was hacked brings the validity of the result into question.

While some people may be taken in by deepfakes, that is not the real problem. What is at stake is the underlying social structure in which we all agree that some form of truth exists, and the social realities that are based on this trust. It is not a matter of the end of truth, but the end of the belief in truth – a post-trust society. In the wake of massive disinformation, even honest public figures will be easily ignored or discredited. The traditional organizations that have supported and enabled consensus – government, the press – will no longer be fit for purpose.

Blockchain trust

New laws to regulate the use of deepfakes will be important for people who have damaging videos made of them. But policy and law alone will not save our systems of governance. We will need to develop new forms of consensus, new ways to agree on social situations based on alternative forms of trust.

One approach will be to decentralize trust, so that we no longer need a few institutions to guarantee whether information is genuine and can instead rely on multiple people or organizations with good reputations. One way to do this could be to use blockchain, the technology that powers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Blockchain works by creating a public ledger stored on multiple computers around the world at once and made tamper-proof by cryptography. Its algorithms enable the computers to agree on the validity of any changes to the ledger, making it much harder to record false information. In this way, trust is distributed between all the computers who can scrutinize each other, increasing accountability.

More democratic society

We can also look to more democratic forms of government and journalism. For example, liquid democracy allows voters to vote directly on each issue or temporarily assign their votes to delegates in a more flexible and accountable way than handing over full control to one party for years. This would allow the public to look to experts to make decisions for them where necessary but swiftly vote out politicians who disregarded their views or acted dishonestly, increasing trust and legitimacy in the political system.

In the press, we could move towards more collaborative and democratized news reporting. Traditional journalists could use the positive aspects of social media to gather information from a more diverse range of sources. These contributors could then discuss and help scrutinisz the story to build a consensus, improving the media’s reputation.

The problem with any system that relies on the reputation of key individuals to build trust is how to prevent that reputation from being misused or fraudulently damaged. Checks such as Twitter’s “blue tick” account verification for public figures can help, but better legal and technical protections are also needed: more protected rights to privacy, better responses to antisocial behavior online, and better privacy-enhancing technologies built in by design.

The potential ramifications of deepfakes should act as a call to action in redesigning systems of trust to be more open, more decentralized and more collective. And now is the time to start thinking about a different future for society.

In the U.S., there’s a lack of services and programs for adults with autism, a problem that looks to only get worse:

“About half a million people on the autism spectrum will legally become adults over the next decade, a swelling tide for which the country is unprepared. When they turn 21, these people leave behind all the programming and funding they received under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act and enter a labyrinth of government services that vary wildly from state to state. Although people with other disabilities face similar problems, the staggering rise in diagnoses of autism creates a distinctly troubling dilemma in how to ensure that these people receive proper care.”

For more than 150 years, scientists such as Tim Caro have been puzzled about one of the most distinctive animal features: zebra stripes.

“Some researchers have suggested that the stripes act as camouflage—they break up zebras’ outlines or resemble fields of tree trunks. But that can’t be true: Amanda Melin of the University of Calgary recently showed that lions and hyenas can’t even make out the stripes unless they get very close. Another hypothesis says that the black stripes heat up faster than the white ones, setting up circulating air currents that cool the zebras. But a recent study showed that water drums cloaked in zebra pelts heat up just as much as those covered in normal horse skins.”

290,Empty,2019-02-22T17:58:53Z,"Republicans in Utah, Michigan, Wisconsin and elsewhere didn't like what voters chose last year, so they're simply undoing it.","Last Election Day, 555,651 Utahns ― 53 percent of voters ― backed a measure to expand Medicaid to low-income adults in the state. Last Monday, 79 Republicans made it clear they don’t care what those voters wanted.

All but four GOP members of the Utah legislature voted to repeal the voter-approved initiative and replace it with a more limited plan. Their plan will cover an estimated 90,000 people instead of the approximately 150,000 who would have received health benefits under the ballot initiative. This action came soon after the Utah legislature also weakened a voter-backed policy allowing the use of medical marijuana in the state.

Republican state legislators voted to pass the final version of the Medicaid bill last Monday, and Gov. Gary Herbert (R) signed it hours later. Though Utah Republicans backed away from an earlier version of the legislation that could have resulted in no expansion at all, they nevertheless decided to overturn the will of their constituents almost immediately after convening for the 2019 legislative session.

Citizen activists who spent countless hours knocking on doors and gathering signatures to get Medicaid expansion on the ballot in Utah are, unsurprisingly, upset, said Chase Thomas, the executive director of Alliance for a Better Utah, a Salt Lake City-based government watchdog group. The organization was among the many in the state that endorsed the Medicaid expansion and participated in the campaign to get it before the voters.

“It’s been all over our Facebook page, our Twitter: People saying, ‘How does my vote even matter if they’re allowed to do this?’ saying, ‘What’s the point?’” Thomas said. “That’s completely understandable. I even feel that way, like, why even have an initiative process if the legislature’s allowed to gut it right afterwards?”

This sort of thing is becoming a habit for Republicans when elections don’t go their way.

As events in Utah demonstrate, elected Republicans don’t always let voters have the last word. And what’s happening in the Beehive State is part of a pattern for Republican elected officials across the country, a pattern that also includes changing the rules when members of their party lose elections, which has included erecting barriers to voting and other anti-democratic measures.

It all amounts to a sustained campaign by one of the nation’s two major political parties to shield itself from citizens, entrench its own power and use every tool at its disposal to disenfranchise the rival party and its voters.

The action in Utah came after the state legislature hemmed and hawed about Medicaid expansion for years without resolving the question. In Utah and four other states in 2017 and 2018, hundreds of volunteer and paid canvassers, supported by state and national political and business organizations, took matters into their own hands in response to inaction by state policymakers and organized campaigns to make change via the ballot.

Voters did the rest, approving Medicaid expansion initiatives in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah last year, following a successful campaign in Maine in 2017. A similar Medicaid expansion initiative failed in Montana last year.",The GOP Keeps Changing The Rules After It Loses Elections,Huffpost.com,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-gop-keeps-changing-the-rules-after-it-loses-elections_n_5c6f0cede4b0f40774cd7232
291,Empty,2019-02-25T19:33:38Z,Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are trying something different.,"Barack Obama before attending fundraisers in 2012. (AP Photo/David Tulis)

Wealthy donors were a big part of how Barack Obama became president. Employees of Goldman Sachs were rivaled only by those of the University of California in powering his record-breaking fundraising totals in 2008. As the insurgent candidate wrestled control of the Democratic Party from the establishment—including frontrunner Hillary Clinton—that year, his inspiring speeches and consistent opposition to the Iraq War were obviously defining elements of a historic candidacy. But so were the eye-popping donations. He broke and then broke again the records for fundraising in a given month, setting the tone for the general election against John McCain with a $66 million haul in August of that year. And while small-dollar donors and the activist base they symbolized were instrumental in his success, Obama also glad-handed at plenty of fancy, exclusive receptions for rich donors both during and after his 2008 victory.

For Democrats hoping to follow in his footsteps, that path toward victory now looks a lot less appealing.

When Bernie Sanders ran for president four years ago, he made a point of largely shunning traditional high-dollar fundraisers, insisting he didn't need or want billionaires' money. It also might have been true that he couldn't get it: The self-declared democratic socialist from Vermont wanted to break up big banks like Goldman, hike taxes on the rich, and dismantle some of the late capitalist infrastructure that he argued was behind soaring income inequality and a broken, for-profit healthcare system. Sanders actually did have the occasional supporter on Wall Street, but with populist anger at Obama's failure to prosecute bankers behind the financial crisis still raging, and the lingering effects of the mortgage crisis and Great Recession still tangible, Sanders could forgo the most lucrative fundraising events and rely on a steady stream of mostly online support from fans. That strategy already seems to be panning out for him this go-around: Sanders raised nearly $6 million in the first 24 hours after announcing his 2020 candidacy last week.

Now Elizabeth Warren is making a point of joining him on the high road. As the New York Times reported Monday, the 2020 contender announced she would skip private, VIP-style fundraisers. She also plans to avoid the ""call time,"" the term for the common practice of politicians working the phones to plead for money from rich people.

""That means no fancy receptions or big money fund-raisers only with people who can write the big checks,” Warren said in an email to her fans. “It means that wealthy donors won’t be able to purchase better seats or one-on-one time with me at our events.""

This makes sense given that Warren has for years positioned herself as opponent of the ultra-wealthy and Wall Street.

""Her ceasing VIP fundraisers with mega donors is consistent with the messaging she's been using in campaign, and at this early point in the race, the energy is focused on generating excitement from the base and distinguishing each candidate's campaign from the rest of the pack,"" said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the influence watchdog the Center for Responsive Politics.

As Krumholz noted, it's also fair to assume she isn't actually passing on all that much money here; the party's wealthiest donors might be predisposed to back, say, Kamala Harris, or Kirsten Gillibrand, or Cory Booker, or (if and when he gets in) Joe Biden. All of them have been dinged by the left for relatively neoliberal stances on some issues, even if they have also inched leftward and embraced policies like Medicare for all and the Green New Deal to stay abreast of activist orthodoxy. (Gillibrand also declared she wasn't going to take money from corporate PACs, though she'll apparently still take money from individuals connected to the finance industry.)

Which brings us to what this is really about: Warren is sending a message, like the one Sanders has been sending for years now, to the party's most engaged partisans. After all, her move came just a week after the Times reported that a coterie of her rivals, including Amy Klobuchar, Sherrod Brown, and Cory Booker, ""auditioned"" before super-wealthy Obama donors, hoping to win their support.

It remains to be seen how much the larger universe of Democratic voters actually cares about who a candidate's donors are. But polling for years now has tended to find large majorities of Americans think the government is too focused on the needs of the rich and not enough on the poor and middle-class, and that money holds too much sway in their democracy.

Warren and Sanders are helping lay down a marker for their competitors, who will have to defend their own practices of holding fundraisers and taking money from industries the Democratic base isn't a fan of. Fundraising has been a consistent issue among those involved in Democratic politics, with a contentious fight over donations from the oil and gas industry unfolding last year in the Democratic National Committee. (The DNC ultimately decided to accept such donations.) In 2008, Obama made a show of skipping out on corporate PAC and lobbyist money, though he obviously wasn't actually missing out on all that much. In 2016, Clinton seemed to be on the side of accepting donations from anyone who would give them, leading to attacks from Trump about her family foundation's work and her paid speeches before audiences of bankers—even as he soaked up dark money donations from self-interested financial titans.

Whether Trump's attacks were fair, this time around the Democratic nominee may be someone who rejects the whole system of donors that Clinton was enmeshed in. If nothing else, the party is set for a real debate—with Warren and Sanders in particular poised to pressure their rivals—about who gets a voice in their government, and how much that voice costs them.

""It's a battle,"" Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, VICE contributor, and critic of the party's coziness with entrenched financial power, said in an email when I asked if Warren's move meant Obama donors were losing control of the party. ""To paraphrase Churchill: It isn't the beginning of the end, but it is the end of the beginning.""

From her ‘Green New Deal’ proposal to combat climate change to her clapbacks against Trump and her critics, here’s how AOC danced her way into the spotlight. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took on what her life could be like in another world, in another time where Donald Trump was not the president.

While appearing on the premiere of Showtime's new talk show ""Desus & Mero,"" Ocasio-Cortez was asked what she would have done if she hadn't decided to run for Congress, joining a large pool of women who ran in the midterms in direct response to Trump winning the 2016 election.

Mero asked if Trump hadn't become president, ""would you have run for Congress?""

""I don’t know!"" Ocasio-Cortez told the pair. ""I could just be like teaching in high school right now.""

She continued: ""But you know, times of great challenge can also bring out the best in people, too, and so I think that's what we're really seeing, even though things are hitting the fan right now, we're seeing people activate and educate themselves.""

Before running for Congress in New York's 14th district and beating out 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley, Ocasio-Cortez worked as a bartender at a restaurant. Her upset victory against Crowley gained national attention and put Ocasio-Cortez and some of her socialist policies, including a large hike in taxes on the wealthy and an ambitious idea to fight climate change, in the limelight.

Republicans have denounced the policies as radical and repeatedly pointed to socialist countries like Venezuela, which are failing and corrupt. They have pointed out the high taxpayer cost for her policies, including Medicare for All, and said her ideas seem to a glimpse at the future of the Democratic party.

Ocasio-Cortez was also asked about all that attention, especially from conservatives, and took on all the hate, trolls and memes that seem to follow nearly every one of her social media posts.

Desus pointed out that after they posted on Twitter about her appearance on the show, they also were exposed to the intense level of hate she gets on a daily basis and asked, when that stuff happens, do you regret getting into politics?""

""No, no. I mean it is heavy but in a weird way that stuff is validation that you're doing something real,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""Because if you're just flying under the radar, just trying to like get your check, like not rock the boat, then what's the point of being in politics?""

She also joined the hosts in making fun of some of the memes that are often sent to her, dubbing them ""so weak.""

""It's like how do you have a computer that runs both Windows 95 and Twitter at the same time?"" she said, sparking laughs in the audience.

The …","The new rules for the Democratic presidential primary debates have gone public. And for those concerned that the vast size of the candidate field means the Democratic contest will look like the Republicans’ melee in 2016, these rules offer little solace.

The party has capped the number of debate participants at 20, and to qualify to take the stage, a candidate will need to get at least 1 percent support in three national polls or polls of early primary states, or raise money from a minimum of 65,000 donors from 20 states, including at least 200 unique donors per state. If more than 20 candidates meet this criteria, the party will give preference to candidates who clear both the polling and fundraising thresholds, and if that’s still too many people, invitations will go to candidates who have the highest polling averages. And if the number of qualifying candidates is too unwieldy for a single debate, the Democratic National Committee said it’ll hold primary debates on multiple nights if necessary, assigning candidates randomly to the two debates rather than dividing them based on polling like Republicans did in 2016. The DNC told FiveThirtyEight in an email that this criteria only applies to the first two debates; later debates may have different thresholds for inclusion.

On the whole, the new rules make the barrier to entry in the Democratic primary debates … low. And this is probably intentional, given the backlash the DNC faced in 2016, when critics argued that its debate schedule favored longtime front-runner and eventual nominee, Hillary Clinton. If 2016 is any guide, unwieldy debates among lots of candidates who are polling in the low single digits won’t result in a few of the strongest competitors separating themselves from the pack, which is undoubtedly what the party would prefer. The problem is that there’s no real way for primary debates to resolve the party’s conflicting goals — inclusion and unity.

Primary debates are meant to winnow the field

Contemporary presidential nominations almost always have a clear front-runner. Since at least 1972, parties have fielded an average of about 10 major candidates for president each cycle (excluding primaries for parties that were fielding a president running for re-election). And most of the time, one or two candidates have an outsized advantage. There have been exceptions, though. The Democratic contest in 1988, with no clear dominant figure and several well-qualified senators and governors in possible contention, offers a rare parallel for this year’s contest. And, of course, the 2016 Republican primary is the most recent example of a crowded primary field, with 17 major candidates.

When the candidate field grows very large, as it did in 2016, participation in the early primary debates becomes contentious. The giant field meant that 2016 Republican debates were often split in two events — a prime time debate for the polling leaders and an “undercard” or “JV” debate for the rest of the qualifying candidates. Being relegated to the second-tier event did not sit well with some candidates, who pushed for rule changes that would get them onto the bigger stage, in some cases successfully.

Had the qualifying polling average been higher, it likely would have reduced the chaos of the early 2016 Republican debates by limiting the field to a more manageable number of candidates. For example, had the cutoff to qualify for the Oct. 28, 2015, “prime time” debate been 6 percent, rather than 3 percent, the number of participants would have dropped from 10 to six. And with a smaller group on stage, each candidate would have had more time to make their views known to potential voters. As it was, the crowded debate field greatly advantaged those candidates whose names and platforms were already widely known.

But winnowing has to be seen as legitimate

But while low thresholds invite chaos, the party’s efforts to slim down the field can anger voters and the media outlets who carry the debates. In 2008, the New Hampshire Republican Party withdrew from collaboration with Fox News when the network declined to include Republican then-Rep. Ron Paul of Texas. Fox was also accused of selectively enforcing its rules in 2007 when it didn’t invite Chicago businessman John Cox to debate in South Carolina — even though he was on the ballot there.

In addition to network complications, the party itself is stuck juggling a set of difficult tradeoffs. On the one hand, the party wants to assert some control over the process. It can’t invite the more than 180 people who have filed to run for the Democratic presidential nomination, and even including just the candidates who have some experience as elected officials leaves a daunting number of debate participants.

On the other hand, the party wants its attempts to control the process to be seen as legitimate. If a few candidates with decent followings and resources are excluded from the debates, they would likely complain, file lawsuits and hold press conferences claiming that the system was rigged and the nomination contest was illegitimate.

This is dangerous for any party, but it’s particularly dicey for Democrats in the wake of the 2016 nomination. Many voters were skeptical of that process, and leaked emails from the DNC suggested that the committee was biased against Sen. Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign rather than maintaining the strict impartiality it has often claimed. A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll released in October 2016 found that 64 percent of respondents said it was either “definitely” or “possibly” true that “both political parties rig the primaries so that outsider candidates have a hard time getting the nomination.” Distrust of the party has lingered, and party leaders are working to respond to concerns about fairness to all candidates, as the committee can’t afford to risk any more legitimacy problems.

The fundraising minimums imposed by the DNC this year are new, and while they may help lesser-known candidates with strong grassroots support earn a seat at the debates, they could leave the party vulnerable in other ways. Relying on small-dollar donors may help immunize candidates from allegations that they serve corporate interests, but those small donors are some of the most ideologically polarized political backers, which could push an extreme candidate to the front of the field and hurt Democrats’ chances in the general election. Alternatively, a self-financing billionaire with low name recognition might be left off the debate invitation list, which means that candidate would get less the vetting than others but would still be able to exert significant influence on the primaries and caucuses in 2020.

But more inclusive thresholds for who gets to debate might mean that the field remains fractured and chaotic for longer. As long as parties face pressure to both winnow the primary field and be inclusive of all kinds of candidates, they’ll have to choose one direction or another — it’s hard to do both at once.

Ian Austin, MP for Dudley North, said on Friday he was appalled at the treatment of Jewish legislators who had taken a stand against anti-Semitism and that the ""the party is tougher on the people complaining about anti-Semitism than it is on the anti-Semites"".

The party was ""broken"" and had been taken over by the ""hard left"", he told the Express & Star newspaper.

""The Labour Party has been my life, so this has been the hardest decision I have ever had to take, but I have to be honest and the truth is that I have become ashamed of the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn.""

Labour has been dogged by allegations the party has become hostile to Jews under Corbyn, a long-time supporter of Palestinian rights and critic of the Israeli government, despite him repeatedly stating anti-Semitism has no place in the party.

A Labour spokesman said the party regretted that Austin had decided to leave.

""He was elected as a Labour Member of Parliament and so the democratic thing is to resign his seat and let the people of Dudley decide who should represent them,"" he said.

Austin said he was not joining eight other former Labour MPs and three Conservatives who this week formed the centrist Independent Group.

The group hopes to gain members from disgruntled pro-Europeans in both Labour and Conservative parties and forge a new force at the centre of British politics.

They oppose the Conservative government's determination to take Britain out of the European Union on March 29, even if there is no divorce deal in place.

295,Empty,2019-02-22T11:37:40Z,New Jersey lawmakers are taking aim at President Trump's taxes by pushing a bill that denies a ballot spot to candidates who don't release tax returns.,"CLOSE In his first press conference after the midterms, President Trump repeated his claim that he cannot release his tax returns even with Democrats controlling the House. Here's why. USA TODAY

New Jersey Democrats are reviving a controversial effort to force President Donald Trump to release his tax returns or be denied a spot on the state's 2020 ballot.

The state Senate on Thursday approved a bill — which the Legislature passed once before, in 2017, but which then-Gov. Chris Christie blocked by issuing a scathing veto — that would prohibit candidates for president and vice president from appearing on the ballot unless they make their tax returns public.

Similar legislation has been introduced in at least 30 states but never enacted, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, meaning New Jersey would be the first to impose such a disclosure requirement if its measure is also approved by the Assembly and signed by Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat.

Story continues below gallery.

A spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, D-Middlesex, said the speaker would consult with his caucus about holding votes on the bill. Murphy’s office declined to comment when asked about the governor's position on the measure.

New Jersey's bill and the others like it, introduced in most cases by Democratic lawmakers angered by Trump's refusal to disclose information about his personal finances, have touched off a heated national debate over the constitutionality and appropriateness of such a law.

Supporters say states have room under the U.S. Constitution to create ballot access requirements and argue that voters should be able to review candidates’ tax returns in deciding whom to send to the White House.

“It is so obvious with this president that had voters known some of what seem to be his business interests, he may not have been elected president,” said state Sen. Loretta Weinberg, D-Bergen, a sponsor of the bill.

But critics say such a measure would be struck down by the courts and could lead to more demands on candidates in the future.

Story continues below gallery.

“Today we require tax returns, but what would be next?” former Gov. Jerry Brown of California, a Democrat, wrote in vetoing a similar measure in his state in 2017, according to The Associated Press. “Five years of health records? A certified birth certificate? High school report cards? And will these requirements vary depending on which political party is in power?”

“It’s just political pandering,” said John Carbone, an attorney specializing in election law at the Ridgewood firm Carbone & Faasse.

“They can impose no requirements for a candidate for federal office, let alone president,” Carbone added, referring to state lawmakers. “They’re thinking like Alabama Democrats during the Civil War: What can we do to get Lincoln?”

Trump’s tax returns have been a target of his opponents since the 2016 campaign. Trump, a Republican, broke with decades of precedent in refusing to release his taxes and has cited a “continuous” IRS audit when challenged on his insistence on withholding them.

Although they are not required to do so by law, presidential candidates in the past have released their tax returns as a matter of transparency so voters could learn about their financial status, business dealings and potential conflicts of interest.

Democrats who now control the U.S. House of Representatives are reportedly studying a century-old provision in the federal tax code to gain access to Trump’s tax returns and make them public. Separately, Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-Paterson, has introduced legislation to require presidents and presidential candidates to release their 10 most recent federal income tax returns.

The Democrats who control New Jersey’s Legislature are eyeing a different mechanism to force the disclosure, threatening to keep off the New Jersey ballot any candidate who does not share his or her five most recent tax returns at least 50 days before the 2020 general election.

The bill, S-119, would also prohibit New Jersey electors from voting for a non-compliant presidential or vice presidential candidate as part of the Electoral College process after a general election.

Whether that would hurt Trump is another story: New Jersey has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988.

Thursday's vote in the Senate was 23-11 and fell largely along party lines. One Democrat, Sen. Bob Andrzejczak of Cape May County, was opposed, while one Republican, Sen. Kip Bateman of Somerset County, was in favor.

The bill must still be approved by an Assembly committee and the full chamber before it can head to the governor's desk for final approval or a veto.

In his veto message in 2017, Christie, a Republican, blasted an earlier version of the bill as a “transparent political stunt” and said if lawmakers were really concerned about transparency, they would end the disclosure exemption for legislative records under the state’s Open Public Records Act. Democrats did not take Christie up on his suggestion.

In a similar spirit, state Sen. Joe Pennacchio, R-Morris, sought to amend the latest bill during Thursday’s Senate voting session to make it apply to all gubernatorial, state Senate and Assembly candidates as well as presidential and vice presidential candidates.

“What’s good for the goose is what’s good for the gander,” Pennacchio said in a statement explaining the move. “If this really is about making sure voters are well-informed, then common sense dictates that S-119 should apply to all of us.”

Democrats blocked the amendments.

Last week's publication of the final draft of the new EU Copyright Directive baffled and infuriated almost everyone, including the massive entertainment companies that lobbied for it in the first place; the artists' groups who endorsed it only to have their interests stripped out of the final document; and the millions and millions of Europeans who had publicly called on lawmakers to fix grave deficiencies in the earlier drafts, only to find these deficiencies made even worse.

Thankfully, Europeans aren't taking this lying down. With the final vote expected to come during the March 25-28 session, mere weeks before European elections, European activists are pouring the pressure onto their Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), letting them know that their vote on this dreadful mess will be on everyone's mind during the election campaigns.

The epicenter of the uprising is Germany, which is only fitting, given that German MEP Axel Voss is almost singlehandedly responsible for poisoning the Directive with rules that will lead to mass surveillance and mass censorship, not to mention undermining much of Europe's tech sector.

The German Consumer Association were swift to condemn the Directive, stating: ""The reform of copyright law in this form does not benefit anyone, let alone consumers. MEPs are now obliged to do so. Since the outcome of the trilogue falls short of the EU Parliament's positions at key points, they should refuse to give their consent.""

A viral video of Axel Voss being confronted by activists has been picked up by politicians campaigning against Voss's Christian Democratic Party in the upcoming elections, spreading to Germany's top TV personalities, like Jan Böhmermann.

Things are just getting started. On Saturday, with just two days of organizing, hundreds of Europeans marched on the streets of Cologne against Article 13. A day of action—March 23, just before the first possible voting date for MEPs—is being planned, with EU-wide events.

In the meantime, the petition to save Europe from the Directive—already the largest in EU history—keeps racking up more signatures, and is on track to be the largest petition in the history of the world.

297,Empty,2019-02-22T10:00:00Z,The Bulwark is on a mission to name and shame President Trump's most high-status supporters.,"Sykes admits that some of these early targets have constituted “low-hanging fruit.” But in the coming months, he tells me, The Bulwark will home in on a specific class of “grifters and trolls”—those opportunistic Trump enablers who still get invited on Meet the Press and write for prestigious newspapers. To Sykes, these are the true sellouts, and he wants to ensure that their public flirtations with Trumpism leave a stench on them.

“A lot of folks have had a free shot to get in bed with some of the most disreputable [people] out there, and they still have a veneer of respectability,” Sykes says. “We want to raise the opportunity cost.”

Asked for examples of prospective targets, Sykes doesn’t have to think long before rattling off a list of high-status commentators (Marc Thiessen, Hugh Hewitt), think tankers (Henry Olsen, Victor Davis Hanson), and politicos (Bill Bennett).

“The Sean Hannitys to me are not that offensive,” Sykes says of the Fox News Trump booster. “Because Sean Hannity is dumb as a box of rocks—he doesn’t know any better.” (Through a spokesperson, Hannity responded, “If Charlie and the rest of the sore-loser, establishment Never Trumpers had their way, Hillary would be president … I wish them well supporting the next radical socialist that runs for president.”)

Sykes says he is much more bothered by the writers and thinkers he used to respect—and he holds out hope that they can still be “salvaged.”

“This sounds naive, but I quite frankly feel they know better,” he tells me. “And at certain points of moral clarity, I could see them coming back to the faith of their fathers.”

Yet when I ask if he really believes The Bulwark’s coverage could be the catalyst that leads them back to the light, Sykes seems to second-guess himself.

“For me to think I’m going to psychologically change them … ” he pauses, and then shrugs wearily. “I don’t know. They may double down.”

Originally, The Bulwark was meant to be a simple news aggregator, a sort of Never Trump Drudge Report that compiled headlines and links from around the web. But that changed in December, when The Weekly Standard—the venerable conservative magazine that had emerged as a leading voice of the anti-Trump right—was abruptly shut down. Phil Anschutz, the Republican billionaire who owned the publication, had reportedly grown frustrated with its constant needling of the president.

Recognizing a void left in the conservative-media landscape, the Standard co-founder Bill Kristol—who had tried unsuccessfully to save the magazine—charged Sykes and a handful of laid-off writers and editors with beefing up The Bulwark with original content.

Kristol told me that he didn’t want to build a “Weekly Standard 2.0.” For all its esteem, it also carried a certain amount of baggage. “I think being a fresh upstart website, and not a magazine with years of relationships, has been a real asset,” he said. “At The Weekly Standard, we didn’t want to look like we were sniping too much at individuals … We didn’t want to waste our readers’ time worrying about various grifters. We liked to think we were publishing more important stuff.” In retrospect, Kristol conceded, “that may have been a mistake.”",The New Outlaws of Conservative Media,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/bulwarks-quest-shame-high-profile-trump-backers/583354/

Donna Shalala (D-FL) tells Politico","Florida Democrats are condemning Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for refusing to call Venezuela's socialist President Nicolás Maduro a dictator.

Sanders, the self-described ""democratic socialist,"" has not revealed whether he considers Venezuela's opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as the nation's interim president, which is the view of the U.S. and a host of European and Latin American countries.

Florida Democrats, according to new report from Politico, believe that Sanders' position will benefit President Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the Sunshine State. The president held a rally in Miami on Monday, where he denounced Maduro and socialism, in an attempt to appeal to the state's Venezuelan-American voters heading into the 2020 election. As Politico noted, many Venezuelans, who have experienced socialism first-hand, have moved to Florida as the country's economic and humanitarian turmoil worsened under Maduro.

Following Trump's Monday event, Democrats in Florida have expressed concern that Trump's attempt to solidify his Latino support could help him grab support from an otherwise-reliable Democratic voting block in the country's biggest swing state, where presidential races have been famously decided by razor-thin margins. They were quick to reject Sanders' comments.

""He is not going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party. He has demonstrated again that he does not understand this situation,"" Rep. Donna Shalala, a Miami Democrat who represents Venezuelan exiles, told Politico. ""I absolutely disagree with his imprecision in not saying Maduro must go."" (Shalala formerly served as secretary of Health and Human Services under former President Bill Clinton.)

Sanders did not embrace Maduro in his Tuesday interview with Univision's Jorge Ramos, who mentioned Guaidó being declared the interim president of Venezuela by the country's National Assembly following Maduro's contested election. However, when the Vermont Independent was asked whether he recognized Guaidó as the legitimate leader of the country, he answered, ""No.""

""There are serious questions about the recent election,"" Sanders added. ""There are many people who feel it was a fraudulent election.""

In a follow-up question, Ramos asked Sanders if he thought Maduro was a dictator who should step down. Sanders would not answer either ""yes"" or ""no.""

""I think clearly he has been very, very abusive,"" Sanders replied. ""That is a decision of the Venezuelan people, so I think, Jorge, there's got to be a free and fair election. But what must not happen is that the United States must not use military force and intervene again as it has done in the past in Latin America, as you recall, whether it was Chile, or Brazil, or the Dominican Republic or Guatemala.""

Sanders added that he believes ""the United States has got to work with the international community to make sure that there is a free and fair election in Venezuela.""

Meanwhile, Florida's Democratic Party has made its position on Maduro clear.

""Florida Democrats have been unequivocal: We recognize Juan Guaidó as the President of Venezuela, denounce the legitimacy of the Maduro regime and his efforts to remain illegally in power,"" the group said in a statement.

Christian Ulvert, one of the state's top Democratic consultants for Hispanic outreach, called Sanders comments ""extremely ignorant"" in an interview with Politico. He reportedly wrote to the Democratic National Committee chairman concerning the location of the party's 2020 presidential convention, noting that Trump was trying to make strides with South Florida's Hispanic community with his anti-socialism message, while Sanders was muddling that message.

""This helps Trump and it makes our job harder as Democrats,"" Ulvert said, according to Politico. ""What this will do is whip into a frenzy South Florida’s Hispanic community on both sides of the aisle. It’s an unnecessary distraction.""

The U.S. was the first to recognize Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela last month – and has suggested that it could use military force to ensure aid delivery or protect U.S. business interests. About 64 other nations have followed the U.S. in supporting Guaidó. The United Nations continues to recognize Maduro, although it has called for talks, as roughly 50-member nations have vowed to support Maduro, including U.S. political foes China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Syria.

The issue has entered the 2020 Democratic primary for president, with most candidates revealing their positions.

Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, along with former Vice President Joe Biden and former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland have affirmed their support of Guaidó as the legitimate leader of Venezuela. Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said ""Maduro is obviously a dictator"" and suggested she approved of the ""diplomatic part"" of Trump's support of Guaidó, although she criticized his ""saber rattling."" And Hawaii's Democratic Congresswoman and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard said the U.S. should not ""go in and choose who should be the leader of Venezuela.

SACRAMENTO — California’s establishment Republicans are making their final stand.

After decades of decline and a devastating 2018 election cycle that gutted an already decimated state party, the GOP’s more moderate wing is gearing up for a state convention this weekend that some argue is its last opportunity to avert collapse.

Story Continued Below

A battle over the state party chairmanship offers two competing visions for the future. One embraces President Donald Trump; the other focuses on the nuts and bolts of party building and organizing.

The two approaches aren’t complementary. Trump, who lost California by 30 percentage points in 2016, is highly unpopular there: Nearly two-thirds of California's voters disapprove of his performance as president.

“What it really comes down to is whether a party’s first obligation is to motivate its base — or to reach out beyond that base,’’ said Dan Schnur, a former GOP strategist and adviser to Sen. John McCain who is a professor at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and is now an independent. “We’ll see what they decide.”

As it stands, the Republican Party in the nation’s most populous state is barely breathing. The midterm elections saw the landslide victory of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, Democrats win supermajorities in both state legislative chambers and the flipping of seven GOP House seats.

Whomever California Republicans elect to succeed Jim Brulte, the former state senator who has led the party for six years, won’t be able to reverse the party’s fortunes anytime soon. But he or she might be able to halt the downward spiral. For weeks, candidates have been lobbying, mailing, phoning and campaigning up and down the state to offer their prescriptions.

Jessica Patterson, the CEO of the California Trailblazers — a candidate-recruitment program blessed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy — has racked up the lion’s share of endorsements from the state's GOP elected officials.

A Latina from a Southern California working-class family, Patterson voted for Trump. But she argues that her leadership of Trailblazers has armed her with the experience and the strategic knowledge necessary to build the state party back to its former strength — and reassure key donors regarding its rebound.

In her view, Republicans must “stay on message” — jobs, economy, education, pro-business policies — and concentrate on the damage the ruling party has done in Sacramento.

“Some people have already given up on my party, and they say it’s not salvageable,’’ Patterson told POLITICO. “I don’t accept that. I love my party too much.’’

But the two conservative grassroots activists who are challenging her lay the blame for the 2018 battering at her feet.

Former gubernatorial candidate Travis Allen, a former state assemblyman and a fire-breathing favorite of tea party activists, derides Patterson as part of a status quo that has ""produced a record of abysmal failure in GOP politics in California.""

""The GOP establishment has told Republicans for years that they need to look and sound more like Democrats — to be Republican-lite,"" he said.

Allen argued that the GOP establishment has not shown the robust support for Trump that the president deserves — and that he contends would fire up and energize the GOP base.

“Clearly, the Republican Party must stand for Republican values — and the Republican president,’’ he said. “This is truly a Republican president who has delivered — and among the 4.5 million Republicans in California, I have yet to find a room that is not overwhelmingly in support of him.’’

Allen, who backs Trump's anti-illegal immigration rhetoric and his call for a border wall, is reprising the populist rhetoric that marked his failed campaign for the 2018 GOP gubernatorial nomination — and helped him amass an unprecedented mailing list of 25,000 activist GOP donors and supporters.

The nominee, the more moderate multimillionaire businessman John Cox, admitted he didn’t vote for Trump and lost in a landslide to Newsom.

“I’m the candidate who has the energy to take back the entire state,’’ he said. “We need excitement in today’s California Republican Party ... a bold new vision that is built by Republicans, for Republicans — and who believe in Republican values.”

But Allen may end up splitting the conservative grassroots vote with another anti-establishment Republican, Stephen Frank, the publisher of the conservative newsletter California Political Review.

A former party official whose roots in state GOP activism go back decades, Frank lambastes the current state party leadership, saying it “has unilaterally disarmed,’’ failed to mount competitive candidates and voter registration campaigns, and was outplayed by the Democratic Party in the 2018 elections, in which Democrats flipped House seats with aggressive practices like ballot harvesting.

Worse, he said, the state GOP lacked a cohesive message on key issues like education and job opportunities — even while it ran away from President Trump.

“We were being told Trump is so poorly liked in this state that we shouldn’t talk about him,’’ said Frank, who’s a regular on conservative radio stations. “We should have been talking about the miracle of the economic recovery under Trump, his willingness to stand up in trade negotiations, his ability to stop ISIS, and his creation of 400,000 manufacturing jobs. …We were so afraid of saying 'Donald Trump' that they forgot the great stuff that Trump did.""

The political demolition derby underscores divisions that have dragged at the party for years.

“It’s a nightmare election,’’ said Hoover Institution fellow Lanhee Chen, a former adviser to the presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio. The establishment vs. grassroots contest is “the same fight we’ve been having since [former Gov. Arnold] Schwarzenegger left office,"" he said.

Those divisions mirror the battles waged within the national Republican Party, he said, in which Trump’s base defends the president’s positions and sees his leadership as the key to future electoral successes even as some mainstream Republicans in elected office wince at his rhetoric and effects on the GOP brand.

GOP consultant Robert Molnar, advising Frank, said 2018's results put the problem in stark relief. ""We have lost seats every cycle. ... How are you touting that a success?’’ he said. “It’s been a total failure. They’re not even an opposition party at this point. Right now, the California Republican Party is as dead as you can imagine. … It’s ashes.”

Leading Republicans say the situation will deteriorate even more if either Allen or Frank claims the chairmanship. Former Assembly Minority leader Chad Mayes pushed back against Allen's jabs at the GOP establishment and elected officials. He tweeted a prediction that if Allen wins the chairmanship, “more sitting legislators will leave” the California Republican Party.

“Winning in politics requires addition,” Mayes said. “Demagoguery and division proves to be a losing strategy.”

Brulte, the current chairman, shrugs off the criticism from grassroots candidates, saying that despite inheriting a party in disarray six years ago, he has rescued it from financial ruin and will leave the state GOP able to “pay all of its bills.”

“Campaigns for party office can be just as rough and tumble as a campaign for public office,’’ he said, estimating that the three candidates for chairman will collectively spend over $400,0000 reaching out to the 1,383 delegates at this convention.

Brulte rejects the notion that the party hasn’t supported voter registration efforts or reached out to its voters, calling that idea “factually incorrect.’’ He said in 2016, independent groups backing GOP causes spent more than $2 million registering GOP voters in California.

The next chairman will have to address those criticisms — and some more immediate matters of party operations. After years of unpaid fundraising and oversight in the job, Brulte began getting paid — $21,000 a month — after new party bylaws were adopted in October 2017. After Sunday’s election, the party’s board will decide if the new chairperson would be paid — and what the level of compensation would be.

“It’s incumbent on the delegates to decide which campaign and which candidate they believe and trust will do the job,” Brulte, who’s not endorsing any candidate, said. “They are all part of the establishment. Don’t let anybody fool you.”

Ending a lengthy period of deliberation, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who won over 1,800 delegates and captured 43 percent of the Democratic Party vote in 2016, announced his candidacy in an email to supporters this morning.

“Brothers and Sisters,” Sanders writes. “I have decided to run for president of the United States.”

Sanders goes on to promise “an unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign” that will “begin with at least a million people from across the country.”

The email contains a lengthy list of policy positions the senator is expected to elaborate upon in the coming weeks. Sanders pledges to create a “government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice,” then adds a coda to his familiar theme of taking on special interests, including those that have traditionally held sway as donors within his own party.

“I’m talking,” he writes, “about Wall Street, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military-industrial complex, the private-prison industry and the large multi-national corporations that exert such an enormous influence over our lives.”

In announcing his campaign four years ago on the shore of Lake Champlain in Vermont, Sanders laid out a message-based campaign that he said was not about him, “not about Hillary Clinton,” and “not about Jeb Bush or anyone else.”

This time around, his opening email seems crafted to leave the impression that winning, and beating Donald Trump in particular, is central to his thinking.

He writes about “running against a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and someone who is undermining American democracy,” adding that Trump is leading us “in an authoritarian direction.”

The Senator is expected to have a busy schedule of events in the next weeks to help introduce key themes of this campaign, which are expected to differ somewhat from the last race.

A second Sanders presidential campaign is bound to suffuse the Democratic primary with intense drama, as he represents one side of a profound argument tearing across the globe about populism.

From the “yellow vest” protests in France, to the rise of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party in Britain, to the anti-austerity movements seen in Greece, the Netherlands to Germany, voters are increasingly rejecting the neoliberal, corporate-backed economic policies that have dominated Western democracies for a generation.

The opening email by Sanders, as expected, argues the only way to unseat Trump is with a grand, sweeping message that’s in tune with this transformational moment in history. Sanders believes he will have to build an independent movement big enough to overcome deficits in corporate money and press attention.

“They may have the money and power,” he writes. “We have the people.”

He is running less against specific opponents like Sens. Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren than against decades of pro-corporate policies endorsed by both parties, dating back to NAFTA and the deregulation of Wall Street.

This system-wide criticism has not endeared him to party leaders. To say Sanders is a controversial figure in Democratic circles is a great understatement.

Campaign post-mortems from 2016 like Shattered and Chasing Hillary, as well as the WikiLeaks dump of DNC and John Podesta emails, made clear what everyone in Washington already knew: the apparatchiks who run the Party and sit in Democrat-aligned think-tanks dislike Sanders with the heat of a thousand suns. In some quarters, he may be resented more than Trump, among other things because he represents a brand of politics that takes aim at many Beltway sinecures.

Sanders can expect diffident treatment at best by the bulk of the commentators on TV and at papers like the Washington Post and the New York Times. In those outlets, he’s regularly derided as a line-jumping socialist peddling simplistic thinking, a “geriatric Che,” as Chasing Hillary chronicler Amy Chozick put it.

A Yahoo! report from earlier this year suggesting Sanders would “imminently” announce his 2020 run inspired outrage on social media. On Twitter, a seemingly bot-driven #NeverBernie hashtag coalesced almost immediately.

Sanders took the press by surprise in 2016, when pundits condescended to a “fringe” eccentric who “rarely kisses babies” and was over-focused on “high-minded politics.”

In 2016, reporters suffering from what even the Washington Post calls “Pundititis” refused all the way up until Election Day to detect fundamental changes in national voter attitudes that elevated the Sanders campaign.

The Times earlier this year ran a piece asking:

Will candidates sprint to the left on issues and risk hurting themselves with intraparty policy fights and in the general election?

This point of view is based upon the idea that the party’s mainstream of voters does not want reduced military spending, free college tuition, expanded Social Security, legalized marijuana, a $15 minimum wage, breakups of Too-Big-To-Fail banks and other policies deemed electoral liabilities.

The Sanders campaign is centered on the idea that a majority of voters long ago came to embrace these positions. For this reason, Sanders feels he may be pushing the party in a direction that’s more electable, not less.

A key criticism of Sanders last time was his alleged lack of legislative accomplishments. His camp believes his profile campaigns against companies like Amazon and Disney, as well as leadership on issues like ending our involvement in Yemen, will head off a lot of those criticisms. His campaign also feels voters will respond to the fact that Sanders positions on Medicare-for-All, that $15 minimum wage and other issues have already become mainstream thinking among Democratic voters. He’s long trumpeted a Green New Deal, an idea as symbolically central to this brand of politics as the Wall is to Trumpism. Polls show the plan has 92 percent support among Democrats, and 81 percent support overall.

Four years ago, Sanders and his camp were taken by surprise when his “Let’s send a message” presidential run suddenly began attracting huge crowds. This time around, there are very different expectations.

From strictly a betting standpoint, there are arguments both for and against Sanders as a likely captor of the Democratic nomination. On the nay side, he is running in a much bigger field, against opponents like Warren and Tulsi Gabbard who are closer to him politically than Hillary Clinton.

On the other hand, he consistently sits at near the top of most polls, often ahead of Kamala Harris and behind Joe Biden, who has yet to formally enter.

The Democratic field is already absurdly crowded, however, with Sanders marking the twelfth candidate to formally announce. The field may have as many as 30 names or more by the time the dust settles and people like Joe Biden, Beto O’Rourke, Sherrod Brown and Mike Bloomberg make up their minds.

This could set up a repeat of the “clown car” effect that paralyzed the Republican Party in 2016, when the over-large field of 17 entrants paved the way for a populist with high name recognition and a relatively insoluble base of support to ride consistent pluralities to the nomination, beating out a plethora of cookie-cutter Republicans who undermined each other at the ballot.

How many votes candidates like Warren, Gabbard and Sanders take from each other may end up determining whether something similar will happen in the Democratic field — whether a non-traditional candidate can prevail over a more “moderate” party favorite like Biden or Harris.

Sanders has drawbacks as a candidate. Currently 77, he would be sworn in as the oldest president in history. He has a not-insignificant public relations problem in regards to race, frequently branded as a white-only candidate backed by “Bernie Bros” (a term that has clear negative connotations even if its genealogy and social media ubiquity is suspicious).

Sanders also responded maladroitly to recent accusations of a harassing environment in his 2016 campaign, saying he didn’t attend to the problem because he “was a little busy running around the country trying to make the case.”

Time will reveal what voters think of the age issue, which will also come up with Biden (76). As to Sanders’ supposed weakness with minority voters, a Politico/Morning Consult poll showed him leading among potential Democratic candidates among Hispanic voters, and second to Biden among African-American voters.

His team already saw evidence last time that Sanders began to improve with nonwhite voters as he gained name recognition. His campaign also made some head-scratching decisions in 2016 that probably hurt him with nonwhite voters early.

A photo of Sanders being arrested at a 1963 Civil Rights march didn’t surface until the day of the Nevada primary, after more than half a year of campaigning, and after Georgia Congressman John Lewis famously said he “never saw” Sanders during the Civil Rights movement.

Nonetheless, Sanders years later is clearly still more comfortable talking about class than race — and what he does say doesn’t always aid his cause. This became clear in a recent GQ interview, when he drew criticism for saying, “There are people who are very big into diversity but whose views end up being not particularly sympathetic to working people, whether they’re white or black or Latino.”

Democratic opponents are sure to test Sanders here, to see if he’s found a way to make his core message about combating corporate influence and fighting for the working poor meld with modern ideas about diversity and social justice. He is expected to address these questions head-on in the coming weeks.

When first elected to the Senate, Sanders spoke to me of being surprised to learn how much power a Senator had. Instead of having to beg and plead for a few million dollars for a heating oil program or a regional health center, people like Ted Kennedy taught him that a Senator could make these things with a few words in the ear of the right committee chiefs.

That was over 10 years ago. Today, he speaks more often about frustrations with the limitations of legislative office. That frustration is one reason he resorted to using the bully pulpit in his recent successful campaigns to pressure Amazon and Disney to raise their company minimum wages.

The politician who has consistently said he’ll try anything to fix a problem has put himself in a place where the White House, and executive power, may be the only thing left to try. So as the last act in a long career, this flawed but compelling politician is running again.

In January, Greece ratified an agreement with the newly renamed Republic of North Macedonia. There are some who argue this is the first step towards recognising the existence of a Macedonian language and ethnicity - and yet Greece has denied the existence of its own Macedonian minority for decades, says Maria Margaronis. Will something now change?

Mr Fokas, 92, stands straight as a spear in his tan leather brogues and cream blazer, barely leaning on the ebony and ivory cane brought from Romania by his grandfather a century ago. His mind and his memory are as sharp as his outfit.

A retired lawyer, Mr Fokas speaks impeccable formal Greek with a distinctive lilt: his mother tongue is Macedonian, a Slavic language related to Bulgarian and spoken in this part of the Balkans for centuries. At his son's modern house in a village in northern Greece, he takes me through the painful history of Greece's unrecognised Slavic-speaking minority.

Mr Fokas takes care to emphasise from the start that he is both an ethnic Macedonian and a Greek patriot. He has good reason to underline his loyalty: for almost a century, ethnic Macedonians in Greece have been objects of suspicion and, at times, persecution, even as their presence has been denied by almost everyone.

Most are reluctant to speak to outsiders about their identity. To themselves and others, they're known simply as ""locals"" (dopyi), who speak a language called ""local"" (dopya). They are entirely absent from school history textbooks, have not featured in censuses since 1951 (when they were only patchily recorded, and referred to simply as ""Slavic-speakers""), and are barely mentioned in public. Most Greeks don't even know that they exist.

That erasure was one reason for Greece's long-running dispute with the former Yugoslav republic now officially called the Republic of North Macedonia. The dispute was finally resolved last month by a vote in the Greek parliament ratifying (by a majority of just seven) an agreement made last June by the countries' two prime ministers. When the Greek Prime Minster, Alexis Tsipras, referred during the parliamentary debate to the existence of ""Slavomacedonians"" in Greece - at the time of World War Two - he was breaking a long-standing taboo.

The use of the name ""Macedonia"" by the neighbouring nation state implicitly acknowledges that Macedonians are a people in their own right, and opens the door to hard questions about the history of Greece's own Macedonian minority.

When Mr Fokas was born, the northern Greek region of Macedonia had only recently been annexed by the Greek state. Until 1913 it was part of the Ottoman Empire, with Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia all wooing its Slavic-speaking inhabitants as a means to claiming the territory. It was partly in reaction to those competing forces that a distinctive Slav Macedonian identity emerged in the late 19th and early 20th Century. As Mr Fokas's uncle used to say, the family was ""neither Serb, nor Greek, nor Bulgarian, but Macedonian Orthodox"".

In the end, the Slav Macedonians found themselves divided between those three new states. In Greece, some were expelled; those who remained were pushed to assimilate. All villages and towns with non-Greek names were given new ones, chosen by a committee of scholars in the late 1920s, though almost a century later some ""locals"" still use the old ones.

In 1936, when Mr Fokas was nine years old, the Greek dictator Ioannis Metaxas (an admirer of Mussolini) banned the Macedonian language, and forced Macedonian-speakers to change their names to Greek ones.

Mr Fokas remembers policemen eavesdropping on mourners at funerals and listening at windows to catch anyone speaking or singing in the forbidden tongue. There were lawsuits, threats and beatings.

Women - who often spoke no Greek - would cover their mouths with their headscarves to muffle their speech, but Mr Fokas's mother was arrested and fined 250 drachmas, a big sum back then.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Macedonian villagers in Greece in 1947

""Slavic-speakers suffered a lot from the Greeks under Metaxas,"" he says. ""Twenty people from this village, the heads of the big families, were exiled to the island of Chios. My father-in-law was one of them."" They were tortured by being forced to drink castor oil, a powerful laxative.

When Germany, Italy and Bulgaria invaded Greece in 1941, some Slavic-speakers welcomed the Bulgarians as potential liberators from Metaxas's repressive regime. But many soon joined the resistance, led by the Communist Party (which at that time supported the Macedonian minority) and continued fighting with the Communists in the civil war that followed the Axis occupation. (Bulgaria annexed the eastern part of Greek Macedonia from 1941 to 1944, committing many atrocities; many Greeks wrongly attribute these to Macedonians, whom they identify as Bulgarians.)

When the Communists were finally defeated, severe reprisals followed for anyone associated with the resistance or the left.

""Macedonians paid more than anyone for the civil war,"" Mr Fokas says. ""Eight people were court-martialled and executed from this village, eight from the next village, 23 from the one opposite. They killed a grandfather and his grandson, just 18 years old.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A Greek protester wears a Balkan War uniform to oppose the agreement on ""North Macedonia""

Mr Fokas was a student in Thessaloniki then - but he too was arrested and spent three years on the prison island of Makronisos, not because of anything he'd done but because his mother had helped her brother-in-law escape through the skylight of a cafe where he was being held.

Most of the prisoners on Makronisos were Greek leftists, and were pressed to sign declarations of repentance for their alleged Communist past. Those who refused were made to crawl under barbed wire, or beaten with thick bamboo canes. ""Terrible things were done,"" Mr Fokas says. ""But we mustn't talk about them. It's an insult to Greek civilisation. It harms Greece's good name.""

Tens of thousands of fighters with the Democratic Army, about half of them Slavic-speakers, went into exile in Eastern bloc countries during and after the civil war. About 20,000 children were taken across the border by the Communists, whether for their protection or as reserve troops for a future counter-attack.

Many Slavic-speaking civilians also went north for safety. Entire villages were left empty, like the old settlement of Krystallopigi (Smrdes in Macedonian) near the Albanian border, where only the imposing church of St George stands witness to a population that once numbered more than 1,500 souls.

In 1982, more than 30 years after the conflict's end, Greece's socialist government issued a decree allowing civil war refugees to return - but only those who were ""of Greek ethnicity"". Ethnic Macedonians from Greece remained shut out of their country, their villages and their land; families separated by the war were never reunited.

Mr Fokas's father-in-law and brother-in-law both died in Skopje. But, he points out, that decree tacitly recognised that there were ethnic Macedonians in Greece, even though the state never officially recognised their existence: ""Those war refugees left children, grandchildren, fathers, mothers behind. What were they, if not Macedonians?""

It's impossible accurately to calculate the number of Slavic-speakers or descendants of ethnic Macedonians in Greece. Historian Leonidas Embiricos estimates that more than 100,000 still live in the Greek region of Macedonia, though only 10,000 to 20,000 would identify openly as members of a minority - and many others are proud Greek nationalists.

The Macedonian language hasn't officially been banned in Greece for decades, but the fear still lingers. A middle-aged man I met in a village near the reed beds of Lake Prespa, where the agreement between Greece and the North Macedonian republic was first signed last June, explained that this fear is passed down through the generations. ""My parents didn't speak the language at home in case I picked it up and spoke it in public. To protect me. We don't even remember why we're afraid any more,"" he said. Slowly the language is dying. Years of repression pushed it indoors; assimilation is finishing the job.

And yet speaking or singing in Macedonian can still be cause for harassment. Mr Fokas's son is a musician; he plays the haunting Macedonian flute for us as his own small son looks on. He and a group of friends used to host an international music festival in the village square, with bands from as far away as Brazil, Mexico and Russia.

""After those bands had played we'd have a party and play Macedonian songs,"" he says. ""None of them were nationalist or separatist songs - we would never allow that. But in 2008, just as we were expecting the foreign musicians to arrive, the local authority suddenly banned us from holding the festival in the square, even though other people - the very ones who wanted us banned - still hold their own events there.""

Greece's position

The Greek government officially recognises only one minority - the Muslim minority of Thrace

It has historically regarded the Macedonian Slavs of Greek Macedonia as a linguistic rather than a national group, referring to them as Slavophone Greeks or bilingual Greeks

A document issued in the early 1990s, says that ""almost all the bilingual inhabitants of the area whose national consciousness was not Greek moved to neighbouring states"" in the first half of the 20th Century - by implication, any bilingual people who remained possessed Greek national consciousness

The Prespa agreement says the nationality of the people of North Macedonia is ""Macedonian/citizen of the Republic of North Macedonia"" - which, as the Greek government emphasises, makes no presumption about the existence of a Macedonian ethnicity

At the last minute, the festival was moved to a field outside the village, among the reeds and marshes, without proper facilities - which, Mr Fokas's son points out, only made Greece look bad.

""And do you know why the songs are banned in the square but not the fields outside?"" his father adds. ""Because around the square there are cafes, and local people could sit there and watch and listen secretly. But outside the village they were afraid to join in - they would have drawn attention to themselves by doing that.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Protests against the agreement on the name of North Macedonia became violent

The ratification of Greece's agreement with the Republic of North Macedonia - and, as some argue, its implicit recognition of a Macedonian language and ethnicity - is a major political breakthrough which should help to alleviate such fears. But the process has also sparked new waves of anger and anxiety, with large, sometimes violent protests opposing the agreement, supported by parts of the Orthodox church.

An election is due before the end of the year. Greece's right-wing opposition has been quick to capitalise on nationalist sentiments, accusing the Syriza government of treason and betrayal. For Greece's Slavic-speakers, who have long sought nothing more than the right to cultural expression, the time to emerge from the shadows may not quite yet have arrived.

President Donald Trump on Friday blamed the “radical left” for Amazon’s decision last week to pull out of its plan to build a second headquarters in New York, calling it a “big loss” for his hometown.

“I think if you look at the deal, the deal was not a great deal from the standpoint of they could have made a better deal than that — a much better deal — but still, I think it's a loss to New York City,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

Trump has had his fair share of brush-ups with Amazon, frequently attacking the company and its founder Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post.

Amazon last week announced that it would no longer go forward with its so-called HQ2 project in Queens after liberal activists charged the development would exacerbate economic disparities in the area and decried Amazon’s aversion to employing union-backed workers.

Freshman Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became a poster child for the deal’s opposition, arguing that Amazon received too many incentives as part of the deal, which would have created 25,000 jobs.

She’s been criticized for saying that there were better ways for New York to invest the $3 billion in tax breaks Amazon would’ve received for the project, with many pointing out that amount was not equivalent to the state handing over a check.

Trump repeated that criticism Friday, taking the opportunity to bash the Democratic Party as a whole, despite the collapse of the deal splintering state party officials.

“The $3 billion wasn't a check. It was a form of taxes over a period of time that now they'll never see,” he said. “They were going to take in a lot of jobs, take in a lot of taxes. So I think it's a big loss for New York City. It's the kind of thinking that our country is going to on the left, on the radical left, but ultimately it's not good for jobs and it's not good for the economy.”

He added: “I come from New York City. I love New York City. I think it was a big loss for New York City.”

The policy platform has become a twisted parody of itself: abolish private healthcare, enact 90 percent marginal income tax rates, and entertain the idea of federalizing huge swaths of our election system. Welcome to the new Democratic Party.

Each contender is so desperate to out-left the others, the party has completely abandoned middle America and taken a swan dive into an unabashed socialist agenda.

Democrats have a long tradition of wanting to reduce the rights of the individual and increase federal control over nearly every aspect of our lives. However, even the most die-hard progressive would admit the direction of the party has taken a sharp left turn.

Socialism used to be a dirty word in our politics, but not anymore. Democratic politicians saw the wave of grassroots enthusiasm in 2016 surrounding the self-declared socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and they were quick to jump on the bandwagon.

Leading the charge of opportunistic socialism is Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. In the rare moments when Warren takes a break from lecturing us on her family history, she likes to go on a diatribe about the inherent evil of wealthy people. She recently suggested a massive tax on people with more than $50 million in assets but declined to share the details of the plan.

The Warren plan would include weaponizing the IRS once again to target a percentage of the country paying the tax with a mandatory “audit quota” every year. What percentage that is, we don’t know yet.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., told attendees of a CNN televised town hall that she plans to abolish private health insurance and enact a government-funded single-payer healthcare system. She did not share the details for how this plan will address our existing $122 trillion in U.S. unfunded liabilities, including federal debt, Medicare, Social Security, and federal employee and veteran benefits.

Not even Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s, D-N.Y., proposed 70 percent income tax could pay off that kind of invoice. Of course, figuring out how to pay for these programs is a problem for another day. Telling progressive voters what they want to hear in any given political moment costs nothing at all.

Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., unveiled their ridiculous “Green New Deal” earlier this month. The plan would implement carbon taxes falling disproportionately on lower income households, costing as much as $325 a year in higher energy prices.

It would also increase the cost of manufacturing, shipping, and transportation for businesses. Want to guess how these companies plan to offset these costs? They will pass them on to customers in the form of price increases.

Similar policies have been tried in Europe, and they resulted in the massive ""yellow vest"" protests in France that erupted over a fuel tax increase. All over the world, radical environmentalism is crushing the working class. Perhaps Democrats are too busy hobnobbing with wealthy political donors living in coastal cities to notice.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s refusal to negotiate on basic border security puts human lives at risk, regardless of their nation of origin. A growing number of Democrats have called to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement entirely.

How could the modern Democratic Party possibly be so out of touch? Are they even aware of how far they have wandered to the left? It must be difficult to hear the collective disgust of the electorate over the sound of Democrats applauding themselves.

The new Democratic Party will stop at nothing to achieve greater federal control over energy, healthcare, income, human life, elections, and political speech. If that’s not totalitarian, I don’t know what to call it. We should take their campaign promises literally and seriously.

In doubling down on this radical rhetoric, the Democratic Party is making it clear they are not interested in connecting with America. They are only interested in controlling America.

The EU Commission has been forced to retract a Medium post in which it patronised and dismissed opponents of the controversial Article 13 proposal that will force platforms to surveil and censor users' postings with copyright filters, calling them a ""mob.""

The Commission characterised the opposition as being stooges for Google, hoodwinked by the company to carry water for it, despite the fact that Google has quietly supported the idea of filters as an acceptable alternative to other forms of regulation (Facebook, too, has supported the proposal).

The Copyright Directive -- which contains the offending Article 13 -- is coming up for a vote this spring, just before EU elections; the Commission has, it seems, chosen a side in that vote and is attempting to sideline and marginalise EU voters who might put pressure on their elected representatives.

The Commission's piece has been removed (read an archived copy here), and replaced with a message that blames readers for not understanding it correctly.

This patronising dismissal marks a new phase in the effort to force the Directive through the Parliament; it supercedes an earlier tactic of characterising opponents of the Directive as ""bots"" (one German politician tweeted his suspicion that Google had unleashed bots on him, citing the fact that the voters who'd contacted him were using Gmail accounts!).

The tactic is backfiring. This weekend, thousands marched against the Directive in Cologne, carrying signs that mocked the ""mob"" and ""bot"" characterisations. More events are planned for March across the EU, ahead of the final vote. This vote will come weeks before the EU elections, and parties will be extremely sensitive to pressure from voters. Indeed, in Germany -- the key EU nation whose support or opposition will make or break the Directive -- the trending hashtag #NieMehrCDU (never again Christian Democratic Union, a reference to Germany's leading political party) has spooked politicians.

What is even more bewildering is that the Commission is not sorry for what was written. The article was removed not because it was incorrect, but because the public apparently doesn’t have the capacity to understand it. Evidently, a simple update and clarification wouldn’t have been understood either, hence the deletion of the entire piece. Mentioning SOPA in the same breath as Article 13 always raises hackles among entertainment industry groups because there are plenty of legitimate reasons why they want it to be forgotten. Now, seven years on, they might finally get their wish because what is happening now is arguably much more ugly. This could be the new benchmark, the new low.

When hip-hop radio host Charlamagne tha God asked Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris if they had a “specific agenda” for black Americans on his show, “The Breakfast Club,” earlier this month, it was clear that neither did.

“I have a specific agenda for the American people,” started Booker. But for Charlamagne, and many other black Americans, a generalized American agenda isn’t a substitute for a plan that specifically addresses the needs of black folks.

“They always say a rising tide lifts all boats,” Charlamagne interrupted, “but we don’t really see that in our communities.”

Charlamagne elaborated on this idea during his interview with Harris: “I think when it comes to black people in America, Democrats, for whatever reason, when you ask them … usually we get that whole ‘rising tides raise all boats’ or ‘all Americans’ rhetoric, and I think black people just want to hear specific things for them, and I always wonder, ‘Why are people afraid to say what they would specifically do for black people?’”

The desire expressed by Charlamagne is understandable and legitimate. After committing overwhelmingly to the Democratic Party for decades, black Americans have seen the racial wealth gap widen, not shrink. As a result, some are increasingly skeptical of the value of programs that aren’t narrowly tailored to accrue to our benefit.

While it is true that the neoliberal strategies embraced by the Democratic Party since the 1980s have failed to close the racial wealth gap, the growing disdain for programs that don’t accrue to the exclusive benefit of black Americans is a red herring.

The problem isn’t that universal or economically driven programs can’t significantly close the racial wealth gap. It’s that the means-tested programs backed by the Democratic Party simply don’t go far enough.

Sen. Bernie Sanders was buffeted repeatedly by criticism that he didn’t do enough to connect with black Americans in the course of his 2016 presidential run. Much of that criticism was fair. But Sanders’s failure was in articulating how his policies would benefit black Americans, not in advancing policies that would benefit us.

Prior to the 2016 election, Ta-Nehisi Coates, who ultimately voted for Sanders, wrote, “Sanders’s basic approach is to ameliorate the effects of racism through broad, mostly class-based policy — doubling the minimum wage, offering single-payer health-care, delivering free higher education. This is the same ‘A rising tide lifts all boats’ thinking that has dominated Democratic anti-racist policy for a generation.”

But the Democratic Party has never backed anything approaching the redistributive goals contemplated by Sanders’s 2016 agenda. The party’s economic plan has historically focused on economic mobility, “access” to “opportunity,” and removing barriers to participating in a capitalist economy. Child care programs, paid sick leave, and job training initiatives are promoted as strategies to ensure that all Americans can participate in what most Democrats see as a fundamentally functional system.

By contrast, politicians like Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren challenge the system itself, because they view it as fundamentally inequitable. Leftists support traditional interventions that meaningfully ease the burdens of those struggling under capitalism. But they also seek to change the fact that profits in this country currently flow disproportionately to a privileged few at the very top — at the expense of wage growth for the workers whose labor generates those profits. As Sanders argues, if 90 percent of profits go to the top 1 percent, having technical “access” to the 1 percent isn’t enough; the system itself must change.

This structural approach is a game changer for African-Americans. Because the value of wealth compounds, capitalism rewards the historical possession of wealth; the ability to invest today is worth more than the ability to do so in the future. That being the case, how can black Americans, first enslaved and then legally barred from participating in capitalism for the overwhelming majority of this country’s history, begin to catch up without a systemic adjustment to the system?

The answer is we can’t. There will be no racial equality under capitalism.

It would take an estimated 228 years for black Americans to earn as much wealth as white Americans possess today, at which point blacks still would not have drawn even, because whites would presumably have accrued more wealth during that time as well. Simply put, closing the racial wealth gap demands a systemic approach.

It is true that universal programs without race-specific interventions are not enough. The failures of the New Deal illustrate how universal solutions can inadequately provide for the needs of the marginalized. But the reality that universal programs don’t always go far enough should not be perverted into an argument that universal programs aren’t integral to the task of closing the racial wealth gap.

During his “Breakfast Club” interview, Booker tried to explain that the issue with the “rising tides raise all ships” argument is not that the thesis is fundamentally flawed, but that universal programs historically were designed to either exclude African-Americans or, at best, were indifferent to structural reasons why African-Americans were less able to access benefits. “A lot of the programs that built the middle class in this country, African-Americans were excluded from,” said Booker, pointing to the Fair Housing Act and the GI Bill. “You had devaluations of American communities through mortgage lending and the like.”

But that’s not to say that a new New Deal shouldn’t be a goal. After all, New Deal programs like the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps employed over 600,000 African-Americans. The Public Works Administration established quotas for the number of blacks to be hired for construction jobs, and New Deal education programs taught more than a million African-Americans how to read and write. It was in part because of the New Deal that African-Americans shifted their political allegiances to the Democratic Party in the first place. In the course of ensuring that we improve upon the New Deal’s mistakes, we shouldn’t lose sight of its benefits and the potential benefits of similar programs.

Unfortunately, in some circles, that’s exactly what’s happening.

Some liberal commentators affect indifference to the racial implications of policies that directly target the wealth gap because they aren’t explicitly cast as race policies. “If we broke up the big banks tomorrow, would that end racism?” Hillary Clinton famously asked in the course of her 2016 campaign. “I would love to wake up in the morning and have my first thought be ‘I hate Wall Street,’” tweeted journalist Imani Gandy. “That’s the whitest shit I’ve ever heard.”

Similarly, when Booker offered up his baby bonds plan as part of a black-centric agenda, Charlamagne was skeptical on the basis that it wouldn’t exclusively help blacks. It “addresses all Americans,” Booker explained, “but it actually helps the racial wealth gap in a significant way,” by creating a savings account for low-income students.

Booker went on to make the case for his criminal justice bill, the beneficiaries of which are overwhelmingly African-American: “When you fix the system, you help poor white folks who get screwed by the system as well, but disproportionately, you’re gonna help those people who are most affected by an unjust criminal justice system,” he argued.

Booker is right. The unfortunate overlap between poverty and some historically marginalized identity groups means that when programs are equitably designed, a rising tide will disproportionately improve their fates: Since 1 out of 3 non-elderly Latinos and 1 out of 4 non-elderly blacks lack health insurance, those groups stand to be some of the biggest beneficiaries of “Medicare for All.” Blacks and Latinos are more likely to rely on Social Security benefits as an exclusive source of retirement income than whites, meaning attacks on Social Security threaten those groups disproportionately as well. Blacks and Latinos are overrepresented among minimum wage jobs, meaning we stand to gain more from a $15 minimum wage. And on, and on, and on.

In fact, most programs embraced as “race-specific” are economic programs or criminal justice programs — many of which, like bail reform, are race-neutral. Various “welfare programs” may be coded as “for black Americans,” but few are narrowly tailored to exclusively benefit us.

Arguably, Affirmative Action is race-based, but the biggest beneficiaries have been white women. And even though it was designed to address race-based disparities, it’s not clear that it has the intended reparative effect: The beneficiaries of Affirmative Action are disproportionately recent African and Caribbean immigrants, whose parents and grandparents were not victims of the pre-civil rights-era discrimination for which Affirmative Action is ostensibly supposed to compensate.

The one initiative that truly targets black people exclusively is reparations, for which Coates famously made a compelling case. But although he was incredibly successful at proving why African-Americans deserve reparations, at the end of his argument Coates is honest about not having a clear answer to how to deliver them, beyond Rep. John Conyers’s H.R.40 bill, which would provide resources to explore possible avenues for reparations. It’s a good start. But it’s just that — a start. That being the case, a push for reparations or any other unspecified, racially targeted policy shouldn’t come at the expense of the most radical redistributive policies this country has seen since the New Deal.

That’s especially true since the growing popularity of universal programs may actually lead to increased support for race-based reparations.

In a recent article, Vann Newkirk II spoke to William A. Darity, a professor at Duke University who is a foremost thinker on the question of reparations. “I have to say that the policies that have received the [most enthusiastic] reception are those that I might describe as universal policies that are not race-specific, but they are race-conscious,” Darity told Newkirk, referencing Booker’s baby bonds program as well as Warren’s housing grant initiative. But Darity thinks that the growing popularity of universal policies might “begin warming Americans up to the idea of reparations.”

As Newkirk tacitly admits, programs that target poverty do seem to be the best way to target the racial wealth gap — at least until more research is done. What’s not clear, however, is whether that message will go over well with a black electorate that is understandably skeptical of the notion that universal programs will ever “trickle down to them.”

For some, a black face heading a campaign will be reassurance enough that African-American interests are being advanced. But following Barack Obama’s presidency, the assumption that a black president will put black interests first has been complicated. Obama’s approach to the mortgage crisis famously bailed out big banks before homeowners, and black Americans were hit harder than any other group — losing 40 percent of our collective wealth in the crisis.

If online chatter is any indication, black voters are increasingly skeptical of representation that ends at the epidermis. Widespread criticism among African-Americans of Harris’s criminal justice record seems to suggest that identity isn’t a perfect defense for anti-black actions, though some have defended her on the basis that she had no other choice than to be tough on crime as a black woman held to higher standards.

Still, during her appearance on “The Breakfast Club,” Harris encountered none of the pushback Booker received, despite the two giving similar answers to the “black agenda” question. Harris argued that the black agenda “must include HBCUs,” and she pointed to her LIFT bill, which would give families making under $100,000 a year a monthly tax credit. She also referenced criminal justice reform and maternal mortality.",Beyond the Rising Tide: Reparations for Slavery Has to Be More Than a Threat,Theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2019/02/20/2020-candidates-reparations/

""I'm running for president.""

Bernie Sanders announced his 2020 run Tuesday morning on NPR and social media, promising ""an unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign"" that would once again upend the political order in the Democratic Party and the country as a whole. Running for president for the second time in four years, Sanders is betting that his program of liberal social democracy that almost upset Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary will be enough to carry him to the nomination this time around against a much larger field of Democrats. Sanders, whose prioritization of economic equality and social justice has made him one of the country's most popular politicians, has a built-in base of supporters and high name recognition from the last race.

Still, he's headed into choppy waters. The Vermont senator is already weathering a storm centered around multiple sexual harassment scandals involving aides who served on his 2016 campaign, and he'll also have to contend with a group of candidates who are poised to siphon off his support. In addition, Sanders will face a party establishment still rooting for him to lose.

Winnie Wong, a cofounder of the political advocacy group People for Bernie, told VICE that the establishment needs to wake up. Attacks thrown at Sanders about his positions on racial versus economic justice and his electability (both long-running criticisms of Sanders) show that the party is more interested in beating Bernie than beating Trump.

""Democratic and Independent voters of all races could support him for President and party insiders are out of touch with that reality,"" Wong said in an email.

But not all former Sanders supporters feel that way. Masha Mendieta, California outreach director for the 2016 Sanders campaign, told VICE that she sees the Vermont senator's chances at the nomination dwindling.

""I think people are overestimating his support,"" said Mendieta. ""After 2016, a lot of his supporters splintered off into different parties, focused on local politics instead, shifted into issue-based activism, or slid back into disillusionment once he sidled closer with the DNC establishment. True or not, that's the reality of how the last two years played out among the grassroots.""

Sanders’s insurgent 2016 candidacy, and the party base activism that came with it, has pushed the party to take several left-leaning stances—Senate Democrats helped pass a Sanders-backed bill calling for an end to US involvement in the Yemen war, and Democrats moved to strip some of the power of superdelegates in choosing the party's presidential nominee. This movement comes especially in contrast to the direction of the party in the past three decades, and there’s been a backlash. Third Way, a centrist DC-based think tank, started to attack Sanders even before he officially declared his candidacy, claiming that the policies he promotes, like free college and a single-payer healthcare system, are electoral suicide.

""Sen. Sanders' ideas were crushed in the midterms - they're not the way to win,"" the organization tweeted in December.

The Sanders message terrifies the wing of the party represented by Third Way, so much so that the group brought conservative Democrats together in Columbus, Ohio, last June for ""Opportunity 2020,"" a forum where 250 Democrats from across the country met to discuss strategies to beat back the progressive tide in general, and Sanders in particular.

Attendees of the Third Way retreat told reporters they were ""sick of losing"" elections and placed the blame for those failures squarely on the party's progressive wing. (The event was held before Democrats took back the House of Representatives in the midterms.) The general mood of the affair was summed up by Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, who has indicated he may run for president himself.

""You're not going to make me hate somebody just because they're rich,"" Ryan joked to the gathering. “I want to be rich!""

Neil Sroka, communications director for the pro-Sanders PAC Democracy for America, said that Democratic power centers have it in for Sanders, and that could threaten his chances.

""It's true that the establishment has its knives out for Bernie,"" said Sroka. ""You're seeing that in terms of the effort to boost Beto O'Rourke.""

O'Rourke became a flashpoint for the 2020 race in December, after his surprisingly close loss in a Texas US Senate race fueled speculation he could be a top-tier 2020 presidential candidate. Criticism of the former Texas Congressman generated backlash; Neera Tanden, the head of progressive group the Center for American Progress who has defended O’Rourke against criticism from his left, implied that the focus on Texan’s donations from oil and gas industry employees was directed by Sanders's camp.

“Oh look,"" wrote Tanden. ""A supporter of Bernie Sanders attacking a Democrat. This is seriously dangerous. We know Trump is in the White House and attacking Dems is doing Trump’s bidding. I hope Senator Sanders repudiates these attacks in 2019.”

Tanden didn't reply to a request for comment. But her comments on social media don't reflect CAP's position, said Daniella Leger, the organization's senior vice president for communications and strategy. ""Neera’s tweets are personal to her,"" Leger said.

In a statement, Navin Nayak, former director of opinion research for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign and today the executive director for CAP's Progress Action Fund, said that the group was looking forward to the primary and that Sanders would have a lot of support if he won the race.

“In a broad and talented field, there’s no question that if Senator Sanders gets in he’d have a lot of assets to draw on,"" said Nayak. ""We are excited to watch that robust 2020 debate unfold in a way that strengthens the party and ensures that President Trump is a one-term president.”

But even if the party rallies around Sanders in the event of him coming out on top in the primary, it’s clear that the more moderate establishment will hope to reject him and his message before it gets to that point.

What drove voters in 2016 was, in part, Sanders's populist and inclusive agenda. Thus, said Sroka, the Vermont senator would enter the 2020 race with probably the highest floor of support and a group ready for the race after being battle-tested in the tough campaign in 2016.

""The question is, where is his ceiling?"" Sroka said. ""And is there a ceiling?""

Sanders supporters like Wong think the sky's the limit. Wong detailed the Senator's advantages in an email, citing Sanders's name recognition, the small donor money machine that's already in place, and the organizing capabilities of Sanders's team.

""In 2016, Bernie Sanders' volunteers self organized 80,000 events, made 85 million phone calls; knocked on 5 million doors and sent 10 million peer-2-peer text messages,"" Wong wrote. ""This should give you an idea of the power of the Sanders grassroots forces.""

""He would head into 2020 with all systems go and a highly skilled volunteer base of tens of thousands of grassroots volunteer leaders who will know exactly what they need to do,"" added Wong.

But he’ll also be facing a much different environment than he was during his surprisingly strong challenge to Hillary Clinton in 2016. The field will be crowded with party favorites and there are closed primaries—contests that non-Democrats cannot vote in—in 18 states, with two right at the top of the season.

With Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and senators Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand already in the mix, and Senator Sherrod Brown expected to join the fray, there's competition for Sanders's lefty base. He'll have to contend with a number of other candidates that are both younger than him and have their sights set on the same voters.

The wide-open field will present challenges for Sanders, who benefitted in 2016 by being able to make a clear distinction between himself and Clinton. The two candidates represented different visions for the party and Sanders made a credible play for an insurgent candidate against the establishment favorite—but that promise of ""political revolution"" is no longer a viable selling point in a party where the culture has been shaped by Sanders, even if the senator himself remains a divisive figure. (Sanders and his office did not provide comment on the record for this article.)

Underscoring those changes is a December report from the New York Times which found that not all former Sanders supporters are automatic backers this time around. “It’s not a given that I’m going to support Bernie just because I did before,” Lucy Flores, a board member of Our Revolution and former Nevada assemblywoman, told the Times.

Compounding the difficulty presented by that potentially eroding support, Sanders will face closed caucuses in two of the first four contests, Iowa and Nevada, in which only registered Democrats can vote, depriving Sanders of any advantage he’d have among independent voters. In the first month of primaries, momentum is essential—and if Sanders can't make a strong showing in those two states, he might lose out in New Hampshire, where he won by double digits in 2016. Mixed and open primaries don't necessarily mean that Sanders will win those states, either, as voters will have to be motivated to come out in large numbers.

And then there are the harassment scandals involving allegations of misconduct and a culture of misogyny from the 2016 campaign. Sanders had to weather a barrage of accusations of sexism from Clinton supporters last time around, and though many of the attacks were substance-free, reporting over the last two years—including an investigative article from this writer at HuffPost in December 2017—indicates that the campaign was not the best place for women (nor was its misconduct unique; the Clinton campaign also had issues around abuse and harassment).

Mendieta, who was herself one of the victims of harassment in the 2016 campaign and detailed the experience in a March 2017 post on Medium, said that Sanders's response to the scandals reflects poorly on the senator. In January, Sanders told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he ""was little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case"" for the nomination and that was one of the reasons for missing the allegations.

""If Bernie had handled this correctly, and he had so many opportunities to do so beginning two years ago when I first went public after being ignored behind the scenes, there would be no harassment scandal,"" Mendieta told VICE. ""It could've been an example of leadership on this issue. Instead, it has been an unflattering revelation into him and his team.""

Whatever the challenges faced by Sanders, the senator can't be counted out, said Democracy for America's Sroka. Pointing to the recent past, Sroka told VICE that while Sanders has an uphill battle to win the nomination, that doesn't make things different for the Vermont senator—and reports of his demise are almost certainly premature.

""The lesson from 2016 for anyone should be that the Democratic establishment underestimates Bernie Sanders at their peril,"" said Sroka.

Bernie Sanders jumps into the race, raises $6 million and immediately mixes it up with the president.","Welcome to 2020 Vision, the new Yahoo News column covering the presidential race. Reminder: There are 348 days until the Iowa caucuses, and 619 days until the 2020 presidential election.

It was a big week for Bernie Sanders. The Vermont independent senator formally launched his 2020 Democratic presidential campaign on Monday. On Tuesday, the Sanders campaign said it raised nearly $6 million in its first 24 hours, or roughly four times as much as Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., raised in the first 24 hours of her campaign’s much-heralded launch.

The same day, the Daily Beast reported that Sanders had hired Faiz Shakir, national political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, to serve as his campaign manager. “Shakir, 39, is almost certainly the first campaign manager of a major presidential campaign who identifies as a Muslim,” the Daily Beast noted.

Jeff Weaver, Sanders’s 2016 campaign manager and longtime friend, had been eyeing a different role for Sanders’s second run and will likely serve as a senior adviser.

Then on Thursday, Sanders announced his campaign’s four national co-chairs, who together with Shakir fill out a diversity full house: former Ohio State Sen. Nina Turner, U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz and Ben & Jerry’s co-founder Ben Cohen.

“To win this election and build a movement to defeat Donald Trump, we must bring together a team prepared to fight for economic, social, racial and environmental justice,” Sanders said. “And that’s exactly what Nina, Ro, Carmen and Ben have been doing their entire lives.”

But Sanders wasn’t the only 2020 candidate to make staffing moves this week. Harris named three women of color to her presidential campaign: Emmy Ruiz, who served as Barack Obama’s Nevada state director in 2012 and Hillary Clinton’s state director in Nevada and Colorado in 2016, to be a senior adviser; Missayr Boker, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee’s director in 2018; and Julie Chávez Rodriguez, granddaughter of civil rights leader Cesar Chávez. The women will serve as Harris’s national political co-directors.

Meanwhile, the Trump campaign named its communications team, tapping veteran GOP operative Tim Murtaugh as communications director; Mark Lotter, a former aide to Vice President Mike Pence, as director of strategic communications; and Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany as national press secretary.

McEnany’s first task? Issuing the Trump campaign’s official response to Bernie Sanders joining the 2020 field.

Trump’s ‘robust’ primary challenge

President Trump may be happy to handicap the 2020 Democratic presidential field, but there’s been a lot of talk in recent days of a possible Republican primary challenge — the first serious one to a sitting president since Ted Kennedy tried to wrest the Democratic nomination from President Jimmy Carter in 1980.

Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told Yahoo News’ Alex Nazaryan that he believes Trump will face a “robust challenge” for the GOP nomination. And that, Steele said, is as it should be.","2020 Vision: Bernie Sanders launches, like a rocket",Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/2020-vision-bernie-sanders-launches-like-rocket-192320064.html
308,Empty,2019-02-20T12:00:00Z,Here’s how Jayapal plans to make Democratic leadership take progressives seriously.,"Pramila Jayapal came to Congress in 2016 as a progressive outsider, but she’s quickly adapted to become the activist insider — negotiating with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with the goal of turning progressive ideas into real policy.

The new co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus along with Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), Jayapal immigrated from Chennai, India, as a teenager and now represents a district that covers most of Seattle. She’s at the forefront of the fight for a long list of ambitious left-wing priorities, from Medicare-for-all to the Green New Deal. Jayapal’s job is trying to convince House Democratic leadership to give these ideas a real shot, and readying legislation in the hope Democrats take back the Senate and White House in 2020.

The 53-year-old representative has shown she knows how to navigate the halls of Congress. Already, she’s persuaded Pelosi to hold committee hearings on Medicare-for-all, and worked to boost a progressive presence on key House committees. As the new co-leader of the largest values-based caucus in the House of Representatives, she wields important power on Capitol Hill to move Democrats to the left — if she can keep her caucus unified and on message.

“The progressive caucus hasn’t leveraged its power strategically before,” Jayapal told reporters last month. She seems game for the challenge.

During her first term in the House, Jayapal was an early, outspoken member of the progressive pressure campaign to pull the national Democratic Party to the left. She endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the party’s presidential primary in 2016; Sanders returned the favor by endorsing her that same year in a House race she won handily against a fellow Democrat (thanks to Washington state’s top-two primary system).

Jayapal is tasked with trying to make these progressive ideas a reality — or at least give them serious traction on Capitol Hill. A former immigration activist, she has the trust of many progressive groups. But she also needs Pelosi and moderate House Democrats to trust her.

Jayapal’s tactics, which involve negotiating with Pelosi, differ from those in her caucus like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who has shown she is adept at using outside pressure and social media to move the national Overton window to the left.

Instead, Jayapal is playing the inside game, quietly pulling the levers of power inside Congress to move the progressive agenda forward. It’s a time-tested strategy, one that Pelosi has mastered. And it’s getting Jayapal noticed.

“I’ve said that of all the progressives in the building, she has the best chance of becoming one of the top three leaders in Congress in the next generation of leadership,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA). “I think she’s struck that balance of how to navigate progressive priorities, but do so as a coalition.”

Jayapal has adopted Pelosi’s negotiating tactics

So far, Jayapal and House progressives have taken a cooperative approach with Pelosi and her allies, rather than the more confrontational style the conservative House Freedom Caucus adopted with Republican leadership.

“We don’t like to surprise,” Jayapal said. “We don’t like to be surprised; we don’t like them to be surprised. We do try to let leadership know if we have a problem.”

Behind the scenes, there’s a push and pull going on. The Democratic base may be clamoring for bold ideas like Medicare-for-all and a Green New Deal, but they need the support of moderate lawmakers to pass these bills in Congress.

Realistically, it’s all about preparing for 2021; progressive hopes hinge on Democrats being successful in their bids to win back the Senate and the White House in 2020, as well as keeping their House majority.

Even if everything goes right, there’s still no guarantee Democrats will enact a sweeping progressive agenda, especially if the party wants to hold on to the red districts it flipped blue in 2018. But Jayapal is quietly working to give progressive ideas a real foothold in Congress. Her most potent victory so far has been a commitment from Pelosi to hold hearings on Medicare-for-all. She won it during a separate negotiation over the “pay as you go” rule, also known as PAYGO, something first enacted in the 1990s and implemented again during the Obama years.

Progressive Democrats are skeptical of PAYGO; it’s a rule that says that a major piece of legislation like entitlement reform, or a tax cut that will increase the deficit substantially, must be offset with budget cuts to mandatory spending or tax increases.

As Vox’s Tara Golshan wrote, the rule can only be waived with a majority vote — and progressives want to use their majority to junk it. But Democrats largely won their majority by picking up Republican-leaning suburban districts, and moderate Democrats aren’t nearly as eager to ditch PAYGO.

Jayapal took a page from Pelosi’s own dealmaking playbook to get the Progressive Caucus to agree to support a House rules package (including PAYGO) in exchange for getting hearings on Medicare-for-all.

“‘I need to be able to take back something that I can put in the bank around hearings on Medicare-for-all,’” Jayapal remembered telling Pelosi during rules negotiations (Jayapal later introduced a bill repealing PAYGO as well). Fellow progressives who watched Jayapal negotiate recalled her “not giving an inch” but also being respectful.

“I’ve seen her style, which is principled and bold but not personal,” Khanna said. “I’ve never seen her go after someone personally or be snarky.”

Pelosi committed to helping Jayapal get Medicare-for-all hearings in the House Rules Committee and House Budget Committee. To be clear, Jayapal sees this as a starting point, albeit a significant one.

“I think that was a significant victory — not that I couldn’t have negotiated something separate from that — but it matters as you know, for the speaker to be supportive of it,” Jayapal told Vox. “I’m not necessarily thinking she’s going to be the No. 1 champion for Medicare-for-all, but I think the fact she’s supporting these hearings, I think that’s all a really, really good sign.”

She’s also clear-eyed that the hearings will be broadly focused on America’s health care system and how Medicare for all could change things, rather than hearings on her forthcoming bill. She’s hopeful Democrats can have a bill ready to go if they can manage to take back the White House and Senate in 2020. To that end, Jayapal is working on her own bill — a revision of the existing Medicare-for-all bill from House progressives.

This bill would give every American health insurance provided by the federal government, and would include coverage for mental health services and long-term care, the Washington Post’s Paige Winfield Cunningham reported. It would also get rid of employer-sponsored health insurance, a provision that has stirred a lot of debate in the Democratic Party.

Democrats like House Budget Committee Chair John Yarmuth (D-KY) agree they must be ready to strike on universal health care when the iron is hot, but they’re not sure if Jayapal’s bill is the one they want.

“The danger is you throw something out there — like, you throw Pramila’s bill out, which is Bernie-plus — and that kind of creates a brand that maybe is not the most effective way to approach it. I’m concerned about that,” Yarmuth told Vox. “Any bill that tries to reshape what will then be 20 percent of the economy, the situation is going to be so fluid that I think it’s important we have a starting point.”

Even though Yarmuth is wary of pushing the health care debate too far to the left, he has nothing but praise for Jayapal herself.

“People consider her a serious thinker, a serious legislator, and so I think she has a very significant place at the table,” he said.

Jayapal’s theory of change starts with a diverse Congress

Jayapal believes real change can’t happen unless Congress looks like the people it represents.

“People across the country don’t trust either Republicans or Democrats, and so the way we do that is by having people I think are more representative, more grounded in a movement for change, and come from the movements,” she said.

In the age of President Donald Trump’s harsh immigration policies, Jayapal has spoken out forcefully and repeatedly. A former activist and immigrant, she knows what it feels like when your country doesn’t want you.

“So much of it is ‘you’re not really one of us,’” she said. “That feeling accompanies me through my journey.”

She first came to the United States at the age of 16 from Chennai, India, to attend school. Years later, after she married an American citizen and was working toward obtaining full citizenship, she nearly lost her legal status during a health emergency in her home country.

On a fellowship in India in the early 1990s, a pregnant Jayapal went into labor very early, giving birth to her son at 26.5 weeks. Jayapal had thought she had plenty of time to travel back to the US to renew her green card and prepare for a home birth.

“Best-laid plans, you know?” she quipped. Jayapal was at her son’s side constantly after his birth, unsure if the tiny baby would live to see another day. All the while, US immigration authorities were reminding her that if she did not come back, she was in danger of losing her green card.

“Six weeks where we literally went into the ER every day and we had no idea if he was going to make it through the day,” she said. “My son was a US citizen because he was born to a US citizen father, and I was facing the prospect of not being able to come back to the United States to be with him because he was really, really sick.”

After a long back-and-forth, Jayapal was able to get her green card reinstated, but she had lost her status. The experience of nearly losing her child had almost cost her citizenship as well; it would take her another three years to start from scratch and redo the process.

“For years, I had this deep worry that I was not going to be let into this country, which had become my home, but I wasn’t a citizen,” Jayapal said.

Jayapal knows that feeling has intensified for thousands of immigrants living in Trump’s America. She feels it acutely herself, even though she is a member of Congress.

“Even today, the first thought I had when I read about the denaturalization efforts of the Trump administration was, ‘He’s going to take away my citizenship,’” she told Vox in December.

A progressive vision for immigration

On immigration, Jayapal is ready to be a progressive answer to Trump. It’s not enough to simply call out Trump’s harsh policies; she believes Democrats need to present their own clear vision.

“What Trump has done is not only turn immigrants into scapegoats, but also, he has basically simplified everything, but with lies. We just have to reclaim that,” Jayapal said.

Much of Jayapal’s plan includes reversing the trends of the Trump administration, but she also wants to reform an immigration system that has been bloated and broken for decades. She envisions an immigration system where the border is demilitarized, migrants who come into American ports of entry and detention facilities are treated humanely, and where the US can clear its 4 million-person backlog in the family immigration system. Then she wants to have a serious conversation about expanding legal immigration.

“If we have needs in the fastest-growing sectors, align those sectors with the work visas,” she said. “Home care, nursing care, domestic workers, that’s one of the fastest growing industries for us in terms of our needs between now and the next 10 to 15 years. We should be having work visas that match those needs.”

There have been missteps along the way; at the height of the family separation crisis last year, Jayapal and her fellow progressives introduced a bill that would have abolished US Immigration and Customs Enforcement within a year, and looked for alternatives to the agency, among other things. Though “Abolish ICE” had become a progressive rallying cry, it proved divisive among the House Democratic caucus.

The bill infuriated the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who complained they hadn’t been consulted on it beforehand. They came out against legislation, and ultimately Jayapal and others decided to vote against their own bill when Republican leadership tried to force a vote. Though the bill ruffled feathers, it may well have been a valuable lesson in the need for coalition-building.

Jayapal hopes Democrats can someday enact her longterm immigration vision, but for the short term, she plans to bring the Trump administration’s harshest immigration policies into clear focus. During a recent Judiciary Committee hearing, Jayapal took acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to task for Trump’s family separation policy — which he denied even existed.

Jayapal has many tools she’s using during her time in Congress, but she says her most important strength lies in people underestimating her.

“I don’t mind tussling — as you’ve probably noticed,” she said. “I think there’s a lot of people who, because I’m a woman, because I’m a person of color and because I look younger than people think I am, they take me for granted. And that’s helpful sometimes, because you don’t always need to be loud from day one.”",Pramila Jayapal is Congress’s activist insider,Vox.com,https://www.vox.com/2019/2/20/18141001/pramila-jayapal-congressional-progressive-caucus-house-democrats

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) announced his first ever presidential run, more than three-quarters of the electorate had no idea who he was.

Sanders, of course, went on to give former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton a run for her money in the 2016 Democratic party primaries. His rallies attracted both enormous crowds and a healthy supply of young voters, for whom he articulated — in a thick Brooklyn accent — a vision of a government that he said would work for everybody, not just millionaires and billionaires.

Four years later and after much speculation, Sanders announced he is officially entering the 2020 Democratic primary. Now, according to Gallup, he is the rare candidate who is almost universally known.

In the time between these two primary seasons, much ink has been spilled in the service of chronicling the way Sanders has transformed the Democratic Party, where the key policy ideas of his 2016 run — such as Medicare for All, free college tuition, and a $15 minimum wage — have become more widely embraced and more deeply rooted among its members. Much less attention had been paid, however, to the way that 2016 race has transformed Sanders.

But people close to Sanders say that in the past few years, the senator has endeavored to learn from his first foray into presidential politics. He has begun to think more about racial justice and its connections to his economic message. He’s become much more comfortable with the daily work of campaigning and has bought into the value of polling. Moreover, he’s spent a considerable amount of time building bridges with longtime political operatives and activists outside of his inner circle, they say.

The 2016 campaign, as one former aide told ThinkProgress, was like “putting the plane together as we flew.” This year the campaign won’t be as improvisatory. Rather, there will be a comprehensive plan that runs “through Iowa, beyond New Hampshire, past Super Tuesday, all the way until the general election,” said the former aide, who, like several others, requested anonymity to speak freely about Sanders. The Sanders campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

One sign of Sanders’ growth as a candidate is his selection of Faiz Shakir to serve as campaign manager, said former aides and advisers. Hiring Shakir, who most recently was national politics director for the American Civil Liberties Union and previously was the editor of ThinkProgress, demonstrates a fresh dedication to a more expansive campaign platform and a more diverse team than in 2016, they said.

The early going hasn’t been free of stumbles, however. Sanders, in an interview with Vermont Public Radio on Tuesday, rankled many progressive activists and former Clinton backers when he said, “We have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender and not by their age. I mean, I think we have got to try to move us toward a nondiscriminatory society which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for.”

Sanders has also had to provide assurances that his rebooted campaign will be more professionally structured after a number of former staffers came forward with allegations of sexual harassment at the hands of a top Sanders staffer during the 2016 campaign. In the wake of the allegations, Sanders went on CNN in January promising to “do better next time.” To that end, he announced that his 2020 campaign would have strict rules to prevent workplace harassment.

“We are going to have the strongest protocols to protect women and anybody else against any form of harassment,” he told CBS. “We are going to be training every employee who works for us, and we’re going to give people who feel they’ve been harassed the opportunity to talk to people outside of the campaign.”

One adviser told ThinkProgress that Sanders recently offered an apology to to members of his inner circle for the way he micromanaged certain aspects of the 2016 campaign. That adviser said the candidate has grown more open to listening, particularly on issues like race.

Sanders has changed in other ways, according to former aides. For instance, he used to bristle at having to discuss polling but now sees its value. And he has worked hard to sharpen his foreign-policy chops — an area in which he repeatedly stumbled in 2016 debates — and plans to articulate an expansive, progressive worldview, one former aide said.

That change is apparent in these early days of Sanders’ campaign. While his 2016 campaign website did not even have a foreign policy section, Sanders went so far as to touch on foreign policy in his presidential announcement, touting his work to end the United States’ involvement in Yemen.

Perhaps the starkest difference between Sanders’ first presidential campaign and this one comes in the form of money: In the 24 hours after his announcement, he raised close to $6 million, blowing his early rivals for the Democratic nomination out of the water. Not only does the initial cash haul demonstrate Sanders’ overwhelming name recognition, it demonstrates that he’s an immediate contender, rather than the dark-horse candidate he was last time around.

But for those close to Sanders — and for many of his most ardent supporters — the most exciting aspect of his entrance into the 2020 race are all the things that will stay the same. And they’re hopeful that despite Sanders’ elevation in the pecking order, he will continue to play the role of the outsider and pull the rest of the field — and the national conversation about public policy — even further to the left than he already has.

“I think his policies… are going to be the gold standard against which these other campaigns are going to be measured,” one former aide said, noting in particular Sanders’ work on economic and environmental issues. “He’s the only one generating real new ideas. To the extent that [the rest of the candidates] have new ideas, they’re all sort of watered down versions of his — not to put too fine a point on it.”",Bernie Sanders’ 2016 run changed politics.

Near Baghouz (Syria) (AFP) - US-backed forces evacuated over 40 truckloads of people from the Islamic State group's last Syria redoubt on Monday, as they sought to clear out civilians before a final push to crush the jihadists.

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have slowed down their offensive on the final pocket due to the presence of civilians, with just a scrap of the IS ""caliphate"" remaining from a territory that once spanned Syria and Iraq.

An AFP correspondent saw more than 46 trucks crammed with men, women and children, approaching an SDF outpost, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of the jihadist redoubt.

One vehicle was packed with women clad in black and men who covered their faces. Wounded people were also among the latest evacuees.

Holdout IS fighters and civilians, mostly relatives of jihadists, are trapped in less than half a square kilometre in the village of Baghouz near the Iraqi border.

The Kurdish-led SDF evacuated nearly 5,000 men, women and children from the jihadist redoubt on Wednesday and Friday, but none over the weekend.

Earlier on Monday, SDF spokesman Mustefa Bali, told AFP that thousands remained inside the IS pocket.

""According to what we heard from those who have left, there are nearly 5,000 people still inside,"" Bali said.

At the SDF screening point outside the village, SDF fighters expressed hopes that Monday's arrivals would be the last one.

""We want it to be over,"" Mazloum, a 29 year-old SDF fighter told AFP.

""Every day we say today is the day but we hope it will all end today and not tomorrow,"" he said.

- 'Secret' transfers -

Kurdish foreign affairs official Abdel Karim Omar told AFP on Monday that the SDF will announce the end of the IS proto-state ""in the next few days"".

""But this does not mean that we have eliminated terrorism, which must be eradicated at the roots,"" he said.

Beyond Baghouz, IS still has thousands of fighters and sleeper cells across several countries.

In Syria, it retains a presence in the vast Badia desert, and the jihadists have claimed deadly attacks in SDF-held territory.

Thousands of suspected IS fighters have attempted to blend in with civilians fleeing the crumbling ""caliphate"".

According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, around 46,000 people, including thousands of jihadists, have streamed out of the Baghouz pocket since early December.

The SDF screens those exiting at an outpost outside the village to weed out potential IS fighters.

After being vetted, women, children, and men not suspected of belonging to the extremist group are transported north to the Kurdish-run camp of Al-Hol, while suspected jihadists are sent to SDF-held detention centres.

The Observatory on Monday said that 1,400 people, mainly IS relatives, were secretly transported from orchards on the outskirts of Baghouz to neighbouring Iraq over the past 24 hours.

Kurdish foreign affairs official did not confirm the transfer, but denied that the SDF was responsible.

""In principle, we do not hand over any person passing through our territories to Iraqi authorities or any other party,"" Omar said.

Such transfers can only happen if they were trucked from Baghouz ""by another party"", he explained, without specifying.

Baghdad on Sunday said the SDF have transferred 280 Iraqi nationals accused of fighting alongside IS to Iraqi authorities.

Fourteen suspected French jihadists were among those transferred, an Iraqi government source told AFP on Monday.

Hisham al-Hashemi, an Iraqi expert with intimate knowledge of the issue, said the transfer had taken place in coordination with the US-led coalition fighting IS.

- Criticism of international response -

The mass outpouring of men, women and children from the IS foothold has overwhelmed the Kurdish-run Al-Hol camp, six hours north of Baghouz.

""The international community is not currently taking responsibility towards the large number of people leaving the last IS pocket, especially children,"" Omar said.

The International Rescue Committee said Friday that new arrivas had pushed the camp's population to over 45,000, exacerbating already dire conditions at the crammed facility.

At least 78 people, mostly children, have died on the way to the camp or shortly after arriving in recent weeks, the IRC said.

A warehouse fire on Friday caused by a gas cylinder explosion ""destroyed 200 family tents"" and five larger ones and injured 16 workers, it said.

The UN's humanitarian coordination office OCHA on Friday warned the camp was struggling to keep up with the flood of evacuees.",Syria force carries out major evacuation from last IS holdout,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/syria-force-carries-major-evacuation-last-holdout-144732631.html

With 13 confirmed candidates, three exploratory committees, and multiple “maybes,” the Democratic field for the 2020 presidential nomination is crowded. Winnowing them down could be particularly tough for voters and contributors, because most of the candidates seem to be running on pretty similar platforms—promoting universal healthcare, pushing for regulations to curb climate change, reducing inequality, and improving conditions for the American middle class.

Here is a look at who is officially running—in the order they entered the race—followed by those who have formed committees, and those seen as likely to run:

Who is officially running?

John Delaney

AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall Delaney in Iowa last year.

The former congressman from Maryland started two publicly listed lending companies before running for office in 2012. The first generation in his family to go to college (he stresses his electrician father’s union membership on the campaign trail), he was the very first Democrat to announce he was running back in July 2017. He’s already visited every county in Iowa, the first state in the primary contest, attempting to jumpstart his national campaign from there.

Age: 55 Years in politics: 6

Who gives him money: Funded by banks, housing, and construction companies in his congressional race. Independently wealthy, funding himself now.

Biggest idea for the economy: Build a public and private international coalition against China’s intellectual property theft, and compete against China in Asia with a TPP-style trade deal.

Andrew Yang

Reuters/KC McGinnis Yang in Iowa last year.

A former tech entrepreneur who started a nonprofit to promote startups, Yang entered the race Nov. 6, 2018 on essentially a single issue: protecting Americans from job-stealing robots. The son of Taiwanese immigrants, he sells himself as the opposite of Trump—an ego-free Asian man who likes math.

Age: 44 Years in politics: Less than one

Who gives him money: Individual contributors, some who donate in bitcoin. He’s also using some of his own money.

Biggest idea for the economy: A $1,000 monthly check sent to every American over 18, so they can pay their bills as robots take over jobs.

After growing up in a poor San Antonio neighborhood, Castro—and twin brother Joaquín—went on to earn Ivy League degrees and take on careers in national politics. Onetime mayor of San Antonio, Castro was US secretary of housing and urban development under Barack Obama. That experience, along with his mother’s activism with Latino groups, is a central part of the narrative he’s pitching to voters. He entered the race on Jan. 12, 2019.

Age: 44 Years in politics: 18

Who gives him money: He’s pledged not to take “a dime” from political action committees. There are no public records about who contributed to his runs for mayor, because San Antonio is only required to keep campaign-finance documents for two years. The PAC he created to support new Democratic candidates in the 2018 election, Opportunity First, has vowed not to take donations from corporate PACs.

Biggest idea for the economy: Though he hasn’t released many details of his platform, he’s been a strong advocate of free trade, which has benefitted his hometown. He’s defended free trade deals, arguing that instead of scrapping them, they should be reworked to strengthen protections for workers and the environment. (His campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)

Social media following: Twitter: 179,000, Facebook: 102,400, Instagram: 24,400

Who gives her money: In the past five years, 35% of Harris’ campaign funds have come from small donors, according to a Center for Responsive Politics analysis of Federal Election Commission data. Her top sources of funding include attorneys, retirees, financiers, and the entertainment industry. Her biggest contributors by employer were WarnerMedia, the University of California, Google-parent Alphabet, Inc., 21st Century Fox and the law firm Venable. Her presidential campaign won’t accept donations from corporate PACs.

Biggest idea for the economy: The LIFT Act, a working- and middle-class tax cut akin to the Earned Income Tax Credit that she says will provide up to $500 a month to families. To pay for it, she wants to reverse Trump’s 2017 tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy—but it’s not clear if she’ll tackle the radical structural changes that bill made in how US multinationals operate.

Social media following: Twitter: 2.37 million, Facebook: 1.22 million, Instagram: 1.5 million.

People who will like this candidate: Fans of Obama’s progressive pragmatism looking for a candidate who can combine a compelling personal biography with the promise to unite the party’s multi-ethnic coalition.

People who will hate this candidate: Progressives who thought Obama was a sellout, particularly those who question her mixed record on reforming the justice system.

Who will hate this candidate: Democrats to her left may be opposed to Klobuchar’s centrist appeal.

Bernie Sanders

AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin Sanders during his 2016 run.

A Brooklyn-born self-described democratic socialist, Sanders was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont in 1981 by a margin of just three votes. He was elected to the US House of Representatives in 1990, and the US Senate in 2006, where he remains today—the longest-serving independent senator in the history of the US. He challenged Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries in 2016 and entered the 2020 race on Feb. 19, promising “change from the bottom up.”

Age: 77 Years in politics: 38

Who gives him money: Over the past five years, 75% of Sanders’ campaign funds have come from small donors in amounts of less than $200, according to a Center for Responsive Politics analysis of FEC data. His top sources of funding include liberal advocacy group MoveOn.org, University of California employees, two postal-employee unions, and the Communication Workers of America. Just $177,000 of $12.7 million raised during that period came from PACs.

Biggest idea for the economy: Sanders would like to make public colleges tuition-free, increase Social Security benefits, and make corporate America more union-friendly. Sanders has proposed paying for the tuition costs by taxing financial transactions and the Social Security expansion by subjecting all incomes above $250,000 to the 6.2% payroll tax.

Social media following: Twitter 8.1 million, Facebook: 7.5 million, Instagram: 2.9 million.

People who will like this candidate: Loyal “Bernie Bros” who still think he would have won in 2016, new converts to the idea of universal healthcare and higher taxes for the wealthy.

People who will hate this candidate: Democrats who see Sanders as a “spoiler” who siphons votes away from defeating Trump, Clinton fans still smarting over her loss, people of color alienated by Sanders’ last campaign.

Jay Inslee

Reuters/Max Whittaker Inslee after the 2014 Oso mudslide in Washington state.

The Washington state governor and veteran Congress member threw his hat in the ring on March 1, on a platform of environmental protection and stopping climate change. “This is our moment,” Inslee and a host of supporters, including Bill Nye, the “science guy” declare in his introductory video. As governor, Inslee is pushing privacy regulations for the tech industry, and new technology in the maritime industry to make it more efficient.

Age: 68 Years in politics: 24

Who gives him money: A new super-PAC, Act Now on Climate, was formed in February to support Inslee’s run. It won’t accept corporate donations, and Inslee’s campaign says it will shun money from the fossil-fuel industry. In the past, he’s been funded by the electronics and tech industry and affiliated unions, particularly Microsoft, which is headquartered in his state.

Biggest idea for the economy: Stopping climate change can boost economic growth, and create millions of new jobs as the US transitions to “100% clean energy and net-zero greenhouse gas pollution,” Inslee says. He proposes removing subsidies and tax breaks for the fossil-fuel industry, and supports the Green New Deal.

Social media following: Twitter 158,000, Facebook 125,000 (personal page) and 110,000 (governor page), Instagram 5,200.

People who will like this candidate: Inslee’s long history of sounding the alarm on climate change will endear him to anyone worried about looming environmental disaster; his tech-focused solutions for the country’s woes are likely to appeal to that industry.

People who will hate this candidate: Climate science deniers, fossil-fuel industry executives, wealthier individuals opposed to his capital gains tax proposals in Washington state.

John Hickenlooper

A geologist and businessman, John Hickenlooper served two terms as Denver mayor before being elected Colorado governor in 2010. His campaign announcement, delivered via video on March 4, highlights his personal successes—he reinvented himself by starting a brewery after being laid-off. He also touts his experience of running rapidly growing Colorado, including by shepherding its economy and enforcing gun-control laws in the state. A moderate with bipartisan appeal, he pitches himself as the right person to take on Donald Trump, whose presidency he calls “a crisis that threatens everything we stand for” in his video.

Age: 67 Years in politics: 16

Who gives him money: Government workers, lawyers and lobbyists, and real-estate firms funded his gubernatorial races. He also received contributions from energy and telecom companies.

Biggest idea for the economy: Cutting red tape to reduce the cost of doing business and increase compliance with regulations.

Social media following: Twitter: 130,000, Facebook: 107,000, Instagram: 6,370.

Who will like this candidate: Centrists, Democrats who believe in bipartisanship, never-Trump Republicans.

Who will hate this candidate: Progressive Democrats.

Beto O’Rourke

Reuters/Adria Malcolm Beto O’Rourke.

Virtually unknown outside Texas until last year, O’Rourke now has a national fan base thanks to his plucky campaign against US senator Ted Cruz. After months of speculation, the former US representative and El Paso, Texas city councilman, tech-company founder, and onetime punk rocker announced his presidential bid in a March 14 video. His upbeat message and multicultural background—he grew up on the border with Mexico—played well with Trump-fatigued voters, but he’s short on experience and policy proposals.

Age: 46 Years in politics: 14

Who gives him money: His race against Cruz was mainly funded by individual contributors but he took PAC money in previous elections.

Biggest idea for the economy: His economic proposals during his Senate run last year were focused on reducing inequality, though they were rather vague. They included stronger anti-trust regulations to break up monopolies and encouraging companies to invest profits in their employees and communities.

Social media following: Twitter: 1.26 million, Facebook: 854,000, Instagram: 832,000.

Who will like this candidate: Democrats disillusioned with party leadership (especially millennials), immigrants, veterans.

Who will hate this candidate: Voters hungry for nitty-gritty details on what his policies would be, Democrats who want the party to stay away from divisive, culture-war issues.

The former corporate lawyer and New York congressional representative became known as the “Me Too senator” after calling out Trump’s sexism and leading the push for Democratic senator Al Franken to resign after sexual-misconduct allegations. Gillibrand announced she was exploring a run Jan. 16 on Stephen Colbert’s CBS late-night show, stressing assistance for public schools, job training, and support for the middle class. She officially entered the race with a campaign video March 17.

Age: 52 Years in politics: 11

Jay Inslee’s long-shot position in the Democratic presidential field. | David Ryder/Getty Images 2020 elections Dem operative launches super PAC backing Inslee for president The super PAC, Act Now On Climate, is run by former Democratic Governors Association political director Corey Platt.

Close allies of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee have created a super PAC to support his presidential campaign, with Inslee expected to jump into the 2020 Democratic primary soon.

The unlimited-money group, called Act Now On Climate, was formed by veteran Democratic operative Corey Platt, former political director of the Democratic Governors Association. Inslee chaired the governors group in 2018, when he traveled the country campaigning for Democratic governors and introducing himself in key states. Platt also served in the role when Inslee ran for reelection in Washington in 2016.

Story Continued Below

The super PAC’s launch illustrates Inslee’s long-shot position in the Democratic presidential field — and how he will focus on the environment to make a mark in the campaign. The primary is already full of candidates who have disavowed big donors and support from outside groups, but Inslee is much less known than many of his 2020 rivals and he does not have the same broad grassroots donor base that candidates like Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, making a super PAC a more alluring option.

Platt told POLITICO the super PAC will not accept corporate PAC money, and he added that the group will remain active in the 2020 race even if Inslee does not kick off a campaign.

""We hope Jay Inslee runs, because he has been the leading champion of solving climate change in the Democratic Party,"" Platt said. ""If he doesn’t, we will continue to work to make sure Democratic presidential candidates make this issue the priority.""

Act Now On Climate has also brought on Christy Setzer as a communications adviser. Setzer is a veteran Democratic consultant who has worked for the Service Employees International Union and former Sen. Chris Dodd’s 2008 presidential campaign.

Inslee has made clear in public comments that he has been “actively considering” a run for president, and he told POLITICO in 2018 that Democrats had to nominate a climate-change fighter in 2020. Inslee has taken steps to limit carbon emissions in Washington and was a major backer of a 2009 federal ""cap and trade"" bill when he was in the House.

In recent weeks, Inslee has taken additional steps toward the presidential race.

Inslee visited New Hampshire in January, telling an audience at Saint Anselm College that “we’ve got about 10 or 12 years to act in this regard or basically it will be too late to stop catastrophic climate change,” the Concord Monitor reported. Inslee added: “We have one chance to defeat climate change, and it’s right now.”

Behind the scenes, Inslee’s political team has been soliciting résumés for digital and fundraising staff, while Inslee himself has been prospecting for donor support for a 2020 bid.

Inslee has also retained political aides who would form the nucleus of a presidential campaign. Jamal Raad, a veteran Democratic strategist who has worked for Inslee and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), is handling communications for the governor.

Inslee’s political group, Vision PAC, has also paid vendors including Newman Partners, a longtime fundraiser for Inslee, and former Inslee campaign manager Aisling Kerins’ consulting firm in Seattle.

Act Now On Climate will start the presidential campaign with little super PAC company.

House Democrats will vote next week on a resolution to block the national emergency declaration issued by Donald Trump in order to access billions of dollars Congress refused to give him to build a wall along the border with Mexico.

“The president’s act is lawless and does violence to our constitution and therefore to our democracy,” House speaker Nancy Pelosi said on a conference call, announcing that the chamber would vote on Tuesday. “Not only is he disrespecting the legislative branch and the constitution of the United States, he is dishonoring the office in which he serves.”

Though the effort is unlikely to succeed, it sets up a highly charged confrontation between the legislative and executive branches of government over the separation of powers outlined in the constitution. The move will also put pressure on Republicans who are uncomfortable about the precedent such a declaration might set – and the long-term consequences for Congress.

The one-page resolution was authored by Texas congressman Joaquín Castro, a Democrat and the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who called Trump’s action an “unconstitutional power grab”.

“This is an historic power grab,” Castro said. “It will require historic unity by members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, liberal and conservative, to counteract the president’s parasitic movement.”

He added: “The president is declaring a national emergency to fulfill a campaign promise, not because there is an actual emergency on the United States border.”

The resolution, which states that Trump’s emergency declaration “is hereby terminated”, has at least 226 co-sponsors, Castro said. Despite an effort to attract bipartisan support, so far only one Republican has signed on: Justin Amash, a libertarian from Michigan. Democrats will work to add more ahead of the vote, which is expected on Tuesday.

Trump declared a national emergency on the border with Mexico last week, after signing legislation to avert a second government shutdown which provided far less than he demanded to build his wall along the border.

In his run for the White House, the president promised to build the wall and have Mexico pay for it. Neither part of the promise has been fulfilled.

Congress has approved nearly $1.4bn to build 55 miles of new fencing and barriers along the border in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley. Trump previously triggered a 35-day shutdown – the longest in history – after Congress rebuffed his demand for $5.7bn to begin construction on more than 200 miles of barriers.

The national emergency declaration allows the administration to transfer money from the defense department and other federal agencies. Trump has said that will give him access to an additional $6.6bn.

The action is being challenged in federal courts, including one case brought by a coalition of 16 states with Democratic attorneys general. Pelosi said the relevant House committees were studying alternative legal options but said Democrats’ focus at the moment was on passing the resolution.

With more than half of the members of the House signed on, the resolution will all but certainly pass. But the effort is likely to fall short in the Senate, where only a few Republicans have expressed interest, or to a Trump veto. It is unlikely either chamber could gather enough support to override a presidential veto.

Even so, the resolution is likely to put pressure on Republicans running for re-election next year in districts and states where Trump is unpopular.

Several Republican lawmakers have expressed concern that Trump’s action could set a precedent for a future Democratic president to declare a national emergency related to climate change or gun violence.

Susan Collins, a moderate Republican senator from Maine who is up for re-election in 2020, was the first in her party to publicly state support for a resolution blocking the emergency declaration.

With Republicans in the majority in the Senate, at least three more GOP senators would have to join her, if all of the Democrats voted for the resolution, for it to succeed.",Democrats file resolution to block Trump's 'unconstitutional power grab',Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/democrats-file-resolution-block-trump-170750684.html

They will also choose a future aligned with Europe or one aligned with Russia.","For many here, the EU represents a vision of how they wish their country would function: The bloc is seen as a largely transparent, rules-based society where leaders work for the people’s interests and where opportunities are available for those who put in the effort. The EU has steadily expanded eastward, and the possibility of joining can encourage significant reforms and better behavior from prospective member states.

But the failures of pro-European parties in power since 2009—not to mention the EU’s own struggles, from the aftermath of the eurozone debt crisis to the near exit of Greece from the bloc—have dulled that enthusiasm. Moldova currently ranks 117th in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, down from 89th in 2009, while support for continuing on the path toward the European Union dropped from 65 percent in 2010 to 40 percent in 2016, according to public-opinion polls conducted by the Institute for Public Policy, an independent research group based in Chisinau.

Despite Sandu’s conviction that Moldova should remain focused on attaining EU membership—admittedly an unlikely prospect anytime soon—surveys of Moldovan voters now put support for closer ties with the EU neck and neck with backing for Russia, if they had to choose just one (a significant number also say they don’t know which they prefer).

“I haven’t decided who I will vote for,” says Ilian, a detergent seller in Chisinau’s sprawling open-air market, where much of the population still comes to buy their groceries. The 33-year-old, who declined to give his last name, continued: “If there’s a space where you can say that you don’t support any candidate, I will tick that box.”

On the opposite end of the spectrum from Sandu sits Dodon, the former leader of the Socialist Party, who has been president since December 2016. Moldova’s presidency is meant to stand apart from party politics, and so Dodon is not officially campaigning in these elections, but his views are clear. While running for president, Dodon said that he would be ready to call a referendum on whether to extricate Moldova from its EU agreement, in favor of membership in the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union. (His rhetoric since taking office has been more nuanced, but he was nevertheless temporarily suspended by Parliament in January 2018 for vetoing a bill aimed at stopping Russian news broadcasts in Moldova, one of several occasions that legislators have taken such action against him.)

Critics say Dodon has been pursuing a pro-Russian path, but he maintains that he is simply rebalancing the country’s alignment after a decade of what he described as anti-Russian rhetoric. “I think the greatest mistake is to make a choice,” he told me in an interview in his oversized office in the heart of Chisinau. “Moldovan society is split into two parts; one half wants to be friends with Russia, and the other half wants to be friends with Europe … We need good relations with Europe and all those agreements, and we need Russian sales markets for our goods.

His aides counter he could upend the electoral map.

When Bernie Sanders was mulling a 2020 campaign last year, he said he would likely pull the trigger if he thought he was the “best candidate” to defeat President Donald Trump.

Now that he’s officially in the race for the White House, a key element of his argument is that he is — in a way that flies in the face of conventional wisdom. His campaign is gearing up to take direct aim at one of the central cases made against him: That the 77-year-old democratic socialist, far from being unable to win a general election, could blaze a nontraditional path to victory on the electoral map unlike any other Democratic candidate.

Story Continued Below

This month, Ben Tulchin, Sanders’ pollster, circulated a memo about an online survey he conducted in late 2017 for progressives who were hoping to flip state legislative seats in West Virginia. The poll found that Sanders would beat Trump by 2 percentage points in the state — despite the fact that Trump won West Virginia, 69-27, and that no Democratic presidential candidate has carried the state since 1996.

To operatives in both parties, the notion that Sanders could defeat Trump in one of the president’s strongholds strains credulity. But the Sanders team is convinced the Vermont senator’s appeal to independent voters, the white working class and people of color is underestimated — and could pay dividends in unexpected places in a general election. They argue that his anti-establishment and populist economic message, as well as his many years of representing rural voters, makes him competitive in not only the Rust Belt states where Hillary Clinton faltered but also potentially in deep-red states, too.

They’re not just talking about West Virginia. Some in the Sanders camp envision possibly making a play for Iowa, Ohio, and Indiana, as well as states such as Kansas, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Montana — six states that, together, have voted for the Democratic nominee just twice in the past half-century.

“It could just radically change the map,” Tulchin told POLITICO. “As Bernie has showed, as Trump has showed, I don’t think we are in a binary, two-dimensional, left-right paradigm anymore.”

Convincing the primary electorate that he can defeat Trump in a general election looms as one of Sanders’ biggest challenges in 2020: His rivals, as well as pundits from both parties, will likely paint him as an extremist who could never win over the moderate voters who helped Democrats take back the House in the 2018 midterms.

With Democrats desperate to oust Trump, “electability” is a major concern for voters at this stage of the race, particularly among some groups that Sanders struggled to win over in 2016.

A recent Monmouth University poll showed a majority of Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters of all ages prioritize the ability to win the general election over ideology in a 2020 nominee. However, larger percentages of older voters, women and people of color want a candidate who can conquer Trump, even if they disagree with most of their platform.

Most older voters, especially those of color, favored Clinton over Sanders in 2016 — and Sanders’ top allies and aides have acknowledged that he has much to do to change that.

poster=""https://static.politico.com/85/56/5b8a2cba484fbbe21678f6f247be/sanders2020-thumbnail.png"" true

“His peer group is harder on him across the board,” said Nina Turner, president of the Sanders-founded Our Revolution, referring to older voters. “He’s definitely going to have to work on bringing his peers into the fold.”

One adviser to the Vermont senator said those efforts will likely need to include a persuasive argument that he can oust Trump.

His aides argue that he is well-liked in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan — the three Rust Belt states that helped hand Trump the keys to the White House — so Sanders begins with a foothold.

“I don’t think anybody can dispute with a straight face that Bernie Sanders is very popular in those places,” said Jeff Weaver, an adviser to Sanders. “That’s because he’s popular with the progressive base, he’s increasingly popular with the emerging electorate in the Democratic Party, and he is popular with traditional, working-class, industrial workers in those places.”

Sanders’ aides also point out that he has years of experience speaking to rural voters, and has enjoyed crossover appeal in his home state of Vermont. They hold up his 2016 primary victories in Wisconsin and Michigan, as well as his rallies with candidates in the 2018 midterms in those states, including with now-Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

“It’s no secret that many candidates throughout the Midwest wanted him to campaign for them in 2018,” Weaver said.

Among the soft spots in the campaign’s case: In the Pennsylvania primary, Sanders lost to Clinton by 12 points. And Sanders has had past troubles connecting with key components of the Democratic coalition, whose turnout will help determine the nominee’s fate.

According to an analysis of exit polling in 25 primaries , Sanders narrowly won black voters under 30 in 2016, but lost older African-Americans by large margins, who turned out at higher rates than their younger counterparts. To beat Trump, the Democratic nominee will need robust support from black voters, the most loyal part of the party’s base.

Sanders’ team believes he’s in a much stronger position with black voters now than in 2016: They argue he has high favorability ratings among African-Americans, and unlike in his first presidential bid, starts with strong name ID.

Sanders’ aides also note his current position among Latinos: In several recent 2020 surveys, he is in first place among Latinos, placing better than even former Vice President Joe Biden.

It’s unlikely that Sanders, who eschews talking publicly about political strategy, will argue much if at all about “electability” himself.

""I think he needs to stay on his message,"" said Turner, ""and that message is going to make people aware that he is electable.""

But his advisers may make the case for him, directly and indirectly. Surrogates can address the “electability” issue in their messaging, and staff could strategically place primary rallies in red states and throughout the Rust Belt.

Other candidates have taken that route: When Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar kicked off her 2020 bid earlier this month, she said her first two stops would be in Iowa and Wisconsin, adding that “we’re starting in Wisconsin because, as you remember, there wasn’t a lot of campaigning in Wisconsin in 2016.”

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has highlighted her time representing a rural New York district. And Biden’s allies have argued that he can win back white working-class voters who have strayed from the Democratic Party, touting the positive reception he received while campaigning for 2018 candidates in swing states such as Pennsylvania and Florida.

Even Sanders, if not talking about electability outright, is hinting at it.

Joe Crowley, the congressman who lost in a stunning primary upset to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last year, will step down from his role as chairman of the Queens Democratic Party, Queens Democrats confirmed Tuesday night. The move came after Squire Patton Boggs, one of the largest lobbying firms in Washington D.C., announced Crowley as their new hire earlier that day.

For a brief moment on Tuesday, it appeared Crowley would remain as county leader while going to potentially lobby on behalf of some of America’s largest corporations, like Coca-Cola, Proctor & Gamble and UnitedHealth. This would not be unprecedented in New York City politics: the leader of the Manhattan Democratic Party, former Assemblyman Keith Wright, directs governmental relations for Davidoff, Hutcher & Citron, one of New York’s most well-connected lobbying firms.

Wright’s decision to lead the Manhattan Democrats, where he can play a role in picking judges and setting the agenda for the party, while working for a lobbying firm drew scathing condemnations from good government groups and reformers in the party. Wright, unlike Crowley, was undeterred by the criticism. (Wright did not return a request for comment, neither did Crowley.)

Throughout Tuesday, progressive members of Queens’ county committee were calling on Crowley to resign. “We can’t even pretend this charade is any kind of democracy,” Erica Manney, a county committee member from Oakland Gardens, told Gothamist.

It’s unclear whether Crowley was motivated by these calls at all or he decided it simply didn’t make sense for him to lead the Queens Democrats while working as a lobbyist and no longer representing the borough. “It’s the right choice for my life,” Crowley told the Daily News.

Crowley lives in Virginia, and the move to K Street, following his loss to Ocasio-Cortez last June, was long anticipated. Still, he was re-elected county leader in September.

In the short term, there will be no seismic political changes in Queens. June Bunch, a party loyalist, will be the interim chair until a new county leader is selected by the borough’s 72 Democratic district leaders. (Several posts are vacant.)

Gregory Meeks, a Democratic congressman, is already vying to replace Crowley. Meeks, who has been embroiled in various ethics scandals, has long been a power broker in heavily African-American Southeast Queens, which has traditionally been where the most Democrats show up to vote in the borough. Another Southeast Queens politician, State Senator Leroy Comrie, has also been floated, as well as newly-elected State Senate John Liu. (Congresswoman Grace Meng was mentioned as a contender in a news report but can’t seek the post because she isn’t a Democratic district leader.)

All would be the first person who isn’t white to lead the Queens Democrats. Crowley was the handpicked successor of Tom Manton, the powerful Queens congressman who died in 2006.

While the Queens machine faced a humiliating defeat at the hands of Ocasio-Cortez, it has quietly chugged on. Gerard Sweeney, Frank Bolz and Reich, the three attorneys who live on Long Island but have effectively run the party apparatus for over 30 years, are still in charge. An overwhelming number of district leaders, the unpaid elected officials who choose the county leader, remain loyal to the three attorneys, who make millions in Surrogate’s Court and off home foreclosures.

Court records show that while the firm’s foreclosure work has tapered off in recent years, Sweeney continues to rake in Surrogate’s Court cash at a startling rate. Since Ocasio-Cortez’s victory last June, he has collected at least $1 million in fees. The staggering sum mostly came from cases that began before June but the fees were approved afterwards, each time by Peter Kelly, the Surrogate’s Court judge. Kelly is the brother of Ann Anzalone, Crowley’s former chief of staff and a Democratic district leader.

For the Queens machine, retaining control over the borough’s judicial system has been a top priority. Civil court and State Supreme court judges are still only elected with the blessing of the three men, especially Sweeney, who specializes in processing the estates of those who die without wills. Ocasio-Cortez, at least so far, has not altered this reality.

The Queens Democratic Party faces another test in June. The machine has thrown what weight it has left behind Melinda Katz, the Queens borough president, for the open district attorney’s post. Katz said earlier this month she was “honored” to have their backing.

As of January 13th, Katz has raised a million dollars, with the help of some cash transfers from prior accounts, and is emerging as a clear front-runner. A major union, the Hotel and Motel Trades Council, is in her corner, as well as Meeks and most of the African-American elected officials in vote-rich Southeast Queens.

Why does this matter? The retiring district attorney, Richard Brown, rarely pursued political corruption cases in the borough, leaving machine elected officials virtually untouched. His office could be a source of patronage. And judges Crowley helped elect would often share familial ties with assistant district attorneys in Brown’s office.

Party insiders still have relationships to trade on. Queens Democratic sources say they lobbied the Democratic state legislature, particularly the Assembly, to ensure the state primary was moved up to June this year instead of 2020, when it would be consolidated with the federal primary. A June date is beneficial to Katz or Rory Lancman, a well-funded Queens councilman and fellow party loyalist, and gives less time for insurgents, especially the Democratic Socialist of America-supported Tiffany Cabán, to lay the groundwork for a campaign.

Allies of Ocasio-Cortez may be getting ready to strike back. Veterans of her campaign have founded an organization called Movement School to train people to run for office and organize with a focus on impacting local elections. One goal will be to target entrenched elected officials who, like Crowley, have not faced challenges in many years, if ever. Another will be to infiltrate the party apparatus, electing more progressives to county committee or even deposing the district leaders who elect the county leader.

What direct role Ocasio-Cortez will play remains unclear. A spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment. Early targets could be Assemblywoman Cathy Nolan, a Long Island City lawmaker who backed the Amazon deal, and Assemblyman Michael DenDekker, a white man representing a majority Latino district in Jackson Heights.

Unlike Brooklyn, Queens does not have a decades-long, reform-oriented tradition, though the movement has undoubtedly gained strength after Ocasio-Cortez’s win. An anti-machine political club, New Queens Democrats, has added members and some clout. County committee members, especially those elected this past September, are strategizing about what to do next.

“I don’t want people to fixate on one guy,” said Radha Vatsal, a novelist and newly-elected county committee member. “The whole system needs reform...it’s undemocratic, inaccessible, and not inclusive.”

MANCHESTER, N.H. — Kamala Harris herself referred to it as the “elephant in the room.”

The question of whether the California Democrat will compete in the first-in-the-nation primary hung over her Presidents Day town hall in Portsmouth — even after 1,000 people packed the church to see her and 500 more were turned away because the space was too full.

Story Continued Below

Harris, at the event, went out of her way in pledging to be active in the state, “to shake every hand that I possibly can.”

But history is not on her side. And her chances of capturing New Hampshire were viewed with such a jaundiced eye by local media that one of Harris’ first exchanges during a two-day swing — with an in-state reporter — included a not-so-subtle reminder that she waited weeks after announcing her White House bid to travel to the Granite State.

“We’re glad you’re here,” the reporter told Harris. Then he asked whether her absence helped feed the perception that New Hampshire isn’t a high priority.

Another interviewer — this one on ABC affiliate WMUR — was more direct: “We haven’t seen much of you in the previous two years. Why was that?” he asked. “The narrative is out there, I guess, that ‘Sen. Harris is focusing elsewhere.’”

New Hampshire has been the province of New Englanders back to John F. Kennedy — with the notable exception of Ted Kennedy in 1980. Ahead of the 2020 primary, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont have spent months courting support from the state.

“It’s going to be tough for her,” Stefan Mattlage, of the progressive grassroots group Kent Street Coalition in Concord, said of Harris. “I think there’s a home-area advantage here.”

Sen. Cory Booker has tried to make inroads, pitching in on the ground ahead of the midterm elections and returning for a December victory lap in which the state Democratic chairman praised the New Jersey senator as “the best friend New Hampshire Democrats had in 2018.”

Booker held six events in New Hampshire over the Presidents Day weekend, including a packed house party Monday morning in Nashua, in which he channeled former President Barack Obama while mopping sweat from his head. “All of us have to decide to be agents of hope,” Booker told a rapt room.

Others have been dashing in and out. Sen. Amy Klobuchar sat for a CNN town hall in New Hampshire on Monday night. “I am someone that comes from the heartland, a north country state a little similar to New Hampshire,” she said at one point.

Harris didn’t campaign in New Hampshire in the midterms — and her team has sketched out paths to the Democratic nomination that run through the other early states and to Super Tuesday. Harris traveled to South Carolina before and after her presidential announcement and was in Iowa for her recent CNN town hall. She launched her campaign in Oakland, Calif., and has returned to her home state to raise money and lock down endorsements.

Some of it may be structural. New Hampshire’s open primary, which allows independents to participate, can favor mavericks and ideologues. Harris doesn’t fit in either camp.

Asked by a reporter Monday whether she considers herself a democratic socialist, Harris said she doesn’t, putting some distance between herself and Sanders, who maintains a following in New Hampshire.

“The people of New Hampshire will tell me what’s required to compete in New Hampshire, but I will tell you I am not a democratic socialist,” Harris said before posing for selfies at a bookstore.

“I believe that what voters do want is they want to know that whoever is going to lead, understands that in America today, not everyone has an equal opportunity and access to a path to success, and that has been building up over decades and we’ve got to correct course,” she added.

A Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll released last week found former Vice President Joe Biden had the highest favorability rating among Democratic candidates, at 80 percent. Sanders and Harris, at 65 percent and 63 percent, respectively, were ahead of Booker and Warren, who were at 61 percent and 60 percent.

Democratic state Rep. Kris Schultz, who leads a group of progressives, said she and her neighbors relish the opportunity to size up Harris and others from outside the region.

“If you’re going to vet more than one woman for president, what better place than New Hampshire?” she said, noting her state had two former female governors serve in the Senate, a female speaker of the state House and female state Senate leader, and an entire congressional delegation made up of women. “I’ve been impressed with her, but I like several others, too.”

Harris ate lunch at the Common Man in Concord with Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire, who has been guiding 2020 Democratic hopefuls. Speaking at Gibson’s Bookstore, Kuster introduced Harris as being from California. “She’s excited about the weather,” the congresswoman joked as snow fell outside.

Harris appeared to appreciate her host. “Those of us who are not from New Hampshire know that if we want to enter New Hampshire and have any information about how one should enter the state, you call Annie,” she said.

While New Hampshire has favored New Englanders, it hasn’t always picked the winner: Bill Clinton earned his “comeback kid” nickname after finishing second to Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts in 1992. Hillary Clinton beat Barack Obama in the Granite State in 2008. And Sanders won big in the state over Clinton in 2016.

Harris, as she told reporters and reminded at her town hall Monday evening, isn’t close to giving up.

“I intend to compete for the votes here, and I’m going to put a lot of effort into doing that,” she said. “It’s an important state. It is a state of people who have a lot of needs and need to be seen and heard.”

At the town hall in Portsmouth, she drew cheers after committing to issues taken up by liberal activists in the party. Harris touted her support for ""Medicare for All"" and the ""Green New Deal"" and pledged to push for automatic voter registration, making Election Day a federal holiday and replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day.

“I want to talk with you. I want to listen to you. I want to be challenged by you,"" Harris told the crowd. ""I want to ensure that at the end of this process we are relevant. And the only way that will be achieved is by spending time with leaders such as those in this church.”

318,Empty,2019-02-19T11:49:28Z,Ireland is one of Europe’s worst performers on climate change—and its people want change.,"Ireland’s struggle with climate change cuts to the heart of people’s daily lives and reflects the country’s revival after recession: more cars on the road and thriving cattle farms.

That makes it a political hot potato that Irish governments have tended to kick down the road—until it came to an assembly of 99 randomly selected citizens, tasked with weighing in on some of the country’s most contentious social issues.

The Citizens’ Assembly spearheaded Ireland’s vote to overturn an abortion ban in 2018, after a similar public consultation led to the vote to allow same-sex marriage in 2015. Now, the assembly could force Dublin’s hand on divisive and expensive new measures to tackle climate change, including raising the carbon tax on road fuels and extending it to agricultural emissions.

How closely the government sticks to the citizens’ 13 recommendations on climate change remains to be seen in the next few months. But Ireland’s bottom-up approach to policymaking is at the vanguard of a trend towards more participatory, consultative democracies aimed at building consensus—and political cover—on thorny issues such as Brexit and French tax reforms.

The key: strip out the party politics and arm the public with information.

“Politicians are looking over their shoulders the whole time at the next elections,” said Mike Loughnane, one of the Irish assembly’s members, from Dublin. “If the model is constructive, in such a way that encourages honest and open debate, then honest and open debate will result. If you bring in less baggage, there’s less contention.”

British politicians, including former prime minister Gordon Brown, are pointing to the Irish example in calling for a series of citizen assemblies on Brexit. This would lead to “constructive reconsideration by parliament of our relations with Europe”, Brown wrote in a Guardian op-ed last month.

It could also help build support for climate change efforts, as the focus spreads from big industries such as fossil fuels to sectors that touch the wider public, such as transport, home heating, food, and farming.

The UN’s intergovernmental panel of climate scientists said as much in its report on limiting global warming to 1.5C last October. Education, information, and community approaches can accelerate changes in behavior, as long as the changes are seen to be distributed fairly, it said.

Perhaps taking that cue, French president Emmanuel Macron launched a ‘great national debate’ in January on four issues, including climate change, in an effort to quell the gilets jaunes protests sparked by his attempt at raising the diesel tax.

The Irish government, on the other hand, points to those French protests to explain why it is treading more carefully.

“As the taoiseach [Leo Varadkar] has indicated, we need to get this right—we need to bring people with us,” MP Hildegarde Naughton, from Varadkar’s centre-right Fine Gael party, told a Dublin City University conference this month. “Taxing or carbon pricing or whatever you want to call it—it’s not an easy issue in any country, and we saw what happened in France in relation to the protests.”

Naughton chairs the cross-party parliamentary committee that is debating the Citizens’ Assembly’s recommendations on climate change. It expects to publish a report at the end of February. Climate action and environment minister Richard Bruton said he will then set out climate targets across all government departments.

Irish climate advocates were initially sceptical about giving such a touchy, broad, and complex issue to the Citizens’ Assembly. Then they were surprised by the strength of recommendations published last April.

Reuters/Clodagh Kilcoyne Ireland’s biggest problem is with farming, cars and industries like cement, food and aviation, not energy.

The citizens backed a higher and wider carbon tax—something Varadkar chose not to announce in his October budget, saying he wanted to ensure there was cross-party support. They also favoured incentives for electric vehicles, especially in rural areas; an end to subsidies for peat extraction while protecting workers’ rights; and the expansion of public transport and bus and cycle lanes.

These would be significant changes for one of Europe’s worst performers on climate change.

Ireland has won praise for its renewable electricity growth and the parliament’s vote last summer to make it the first country to fully divest from fossil fuels. But its biggest problem is with farming, cars, and industries like cement, food, and aviation, not energy.

The country is on track to miss an EU-mandated emissions reduction goal for 2020, according to the Irish Environmental Protection Agency. Agricultural emissions edged up in 2017 due to more dairy cows. Transport emissions slipped for the first time in four years, but that was attributed to a Brexit-related anomaly: fewer drivers crossed from Northern Ireland to buy fuel, because the British pound was cheaper. The number of Irish drivers still increased.

The question now is whether policymakers take up the citizens’ mantel. Naughton said the cross-party committee has not yet decided which sectors should pay a carbon tax, but stressed that farmers will need to reduce their emissions while increasing and diversifying their food production.

Touted as an “exercise in deliberative democracy”, the Citizens’ Assembly started in late 2016 with members chosen at random and varying in age, gender, social class, and location.

They were tasked with weighing in on five policy issues including abortion, how to deal with an ageing population, and climate change, and met over 12 weekends until it wrapped up in mid-2018. They listened to experts, broke out into discussion groups, and voted on recommendations.

“The Citizens’ Assembly showed that if you structure the debate around information, discussion, questions and answers, and allow citizens to really thrash things out with expert advice—in a manner that is intelligible to them—very often people will shift their positions,” said Sadhbh O’Neill, an expert adviser to Naughton’s parliamentary committee and a PhD candidate on environmental policy at University College Dublin.

Given that success, Ireland should now make this people power an institutionalized fixture that works “hand-in-glove” with the government, said Loughnane.

“The capacity of your average citizen to tackle such things, including myself to a large degree—I was hugely impressed,” he said. “Politicians can fob things off, they can go back to their political agendas, they’re looking over their shoulders for elections. They’re kicking the can down the road.”

Votes are being counted in Nigeria's closely-fought general election, with voting hours extended in some places following delays in the morning.

The main challenger to President Muhammadu Buhari, 76, is the former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, 72.

Whoever wins will have to address power shortages, corruption, security threats, and a sluggish economy.

The election had been due to take place a week ago but was delayed at the last minute for logistical reasons.

President Buhari cast his ballot in his hometown of Daura in the northern state of Katsina. Asked if he would congratulate his rival if he lost, he said: ""I will congratulate myself.""

Reported attacks

About two hours before polls were due to open on Saturday, residents of the town of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state in the country's north-east reported hearing several blasts and gunfire.

State police said in a statement that there was no threat to public safety. ""The gunfire were not targeted at members of the public but was for security purposes,"" the statement said.

Borno is the birthplace of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which had said it planned to disrupt the elections.

In the north-eastern state of Yobe, suspected Islamist militants attacked the town of Geidam, forcing people to flee, the Reuters news agency reported.

Why was the election delayed?

The initial vote was rescheduled in a dramatic press conference in the early hours of Saturday 16 February, just five hours before polls were due to have opened.

Image copyright AFP Image caption President Muhammadu Buhari (l) is expected to face a strong challenge from Atiku Abubakar (r)

The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) has given several reasons for the delay, including attempted sabotage and logistical issues such as bad weather and problems with delivering the ballot papers.

Inec has said that everything is in place for the poll to take place this time round.

How will the election work?

The candidate with the most votes is declared the winner in the first round, as long as that person gains at least 25% of the votes in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states.

There are 73 registered candidates in the presidential election, but campaigning has been dominated by the two political giants and the established party machines behind them.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The ballot paper has to be extra long in order to fit on all 73 presidential candidates

The president's All Progressives Congress (APC) has promised to take the country to the ""next level"", arguing that in his first four-year term Mr Buhari has done a lot of ""foundational work"" that may not be immediately obvious.

Mr Abubakar and his People's Democratic Party have pledged ""to get Nigeria working again"", saying that the president has wasted the last four years.

Both men are from the mainly Muslim north of the country. While they are in their 70s, more than half of Nigeria's 84 million registered voters are under 35.

What are the main issues?

Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer but corruption and a failure to invest the proceeds from the industry have hampered development in the country.

It slipped into a recession in 2016 and a slow recovery has meant that not enough jobs have been created to cope with the large number of young people coming into the employment market. Currently nearly a quarter of the working age population is unemployed.

Mr Buhari has quelled a militant Islamist rebellion in the north-east of the country, but Boko Haram remains active. There has also been an upsurge in violence in the country's Middle Belt as traditional herders and more settled farmers have clashed.

Up until 1999 Nigeria was governed by either short-lived civilian administrations or military rulers. But this year marks 20 years since the return of democracy.

It’s official: Bernie Sanders announced today that he’s going to run for president and lay the groundwork for transforming the economic and political life of this country. His decision comes not a moment too soon.

After all, if you think things are bad now, imagine if Bernie Sanders hadn’t run for president in 2016. Imagine if Hillary Clinton had swept the primaries that year, easily parrying Martin O’Malley’s feeble blows and a few charming Lincoln Chafee debate performances.



Trump would have still beaten Clinton, but his charlatan, rightwing populism would have been the only outlet for those angry at the status quo. More than anything else, dejection would reign among voters. The Democrats would have heightened their focus on winning over “respectable” anti-Trump Republicans in the suburbs, with depoliticized calls to “fix” Obamacare, find “realistic solutions” to climate change, and make higher education “accessible”.





Forget Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: in the early days of 2019 this would be the party of Michael Bloomberg. No surprise, in this scenario, that Trump would be polling narrowly ahead of all his contenders, the billionaire Michael Bloomberg included.

But Bernie did run in 2016 – and not just for a single campaign, but something far greater. Sanders reintroduced working-class politics in the US. It was a style based on a simple message: you work hard, we’re going to get you the dignity and security you deserve, and we’re going to fight the millionaires and billionaires standing in the way. It was a politics, in other words, that created a common narrative of struggle in which the protagonists were those trying to get by in an unfair and unequal country.

Sanders expertly communicated this message, by being as clear, direct, and honest as possible. His stump speeches used an even more limited vocabulary than Trump’s. His lines were so predictable that crowds would finish his sentences. In May 2015, he said: “This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders ... This campaign is about the needs of the American people, and the ideas and proposals that effectively address those needs,” and what endured from his campaign were precisely those ideas and proposals.

Democrats can’t call him kooky and radical this time around

Bernie Sanders talked about the need for a Green New Deal, for Medicare-for-All (now supported by a sizable majority of Americans), for tuition-free higher education, for a jobs guarantee – all now part of the mainstream debate. Most importantly, as a democratic socialist he banded these policies together in a political framework, a way of understanding the challenges facing working people and possible solutions. Sanders also encouraged his supporters by the thousands to run for elected office. Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez and Rashida Tlaib are among those who answered the call, building off Bernie’s program and reaching new audiences.

Before 2016, who could forget that the Democratic party was dominated by charter-school supporting politicians and anti-public-sector-union types like Cory Booker and Rahm Emanuel? Now 2020 candidates who were silent during the 2012 Chicago teachers’ strike are keen to show their solidarity with Los Angeles educators. It might not yet be the political revolution Sanders was calling for, but it’s testament to his influence.

The spirit of 2016 may not last forever, and it’s vital that we use the coming presidential campaign to do battle with the country’s powerful economic and political establishment. We’ll have to wait until 2024 for AOC to be eligible – for now Bernie Sanders is the only one capable of reaching millions of working Americans with the message that politics can indeed improve their lives. And not only can he continue to lay the groundwork for a left opposition to Trumpism: Bernie can actually win this time around.","Sanders started a revolution in 2016.

The DA faces a resurgent ruling African National Congress (ANC) under new President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has also vowed to root out graft and boost growth in Africa’s most industrialized economy..

The ANC has comfortably won every parliamentary election since it swept to power under Nelson Mandela at the end of apartheid in 1994 and the DA has made ruling South Africa a long-term ambition.

Still, corruption is perceived as a weakness for the ANC after years of rule by former President Jacob Zuma, who was removed from the presidency last year by the ANC after years of corruption probes. He denies any wrongdoing.

“The South Africa I want to build will have no place for corruption and corrupt politicians,” DA leader Mmusi Maimane told supporters at the party’s manifesto launch in Johannesburg.

He said his party would have “zero tolerance for corruption” and wanted to see corrupt politicians spend 15 years in jail.

The DA, which has roots among white liberals from the anti-apartheid era, elected its first black leader in 2015 to widen its appeal among voters, and improved its national credentials by winning control of three major cities in 2016.

Maimane also outlined manifesto pledges to create jobs by offering tax incentives to encourage new business and maximize the manufacturing, agriculture and tourism sectors to build the economy.

“If we can put a job in every home we can transform our society,” said Maimane

The first New Hampshire Democratic Primary Poll since Sen. Bernie Sanders announced he’s running for president finds Sanders at a slight advantage with 27% of the vote, former Vice President Joe Biden with 25% and Sen. Kamala Harris at 12%. No other candidate clears double digits. The NH poll was conducted February 21-22 of registered voters, the Democratic primary ballot test had a sample of n=405, +/-4.8%.

Among voters ages 18-34, Bernie Sanders has a large lead with 44% of the vote. Joe Biden follows at 11%, Elizabeth Warren has 9%, and Kamala Harris is tied with Beto O’Rourke with 8% apiece.

Voters 35-54 years old prefer Biden (30%), then Sanders (26%). Harris takes 14%, Sen. Amy Klobuchar takes 10%, and Warren receives 7% of the vote.

Among voters aged 55-74 years, Joe Biden leads with 30%, followed by Sanders (18%) and Harris (13%), with Warren and Klobuchar tied in fourth with 8% apiece.

Among voters aged 75 and older, Biden leads with 39%, followed by Warren (18%), Klobuchar (11%), Sanders (10%) and Harris with 8%.

Republican Primary

While President Trump has a 52% disapproval and 43% approval in the Granite State, he has an 80% approval and 14% disapproval among GOP primary voters. This would help explain why in the ballot test between Trump and former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld, Trump has 82% of the vote and Weld has 18%. The Republican primary ballot test had a sample of n=328, +/-5.4%.

US Senate 2020

In a potential US Senate match up for 2020, current Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D) is tied with Governor Chris Sununu (R) at 44% each, with 12% of voters undecided. Shaheen leads among independents 44% to 39%. The NH poll had a sample of n=910, +/-3.2%.

2020 Ballot

President Trump trails in all his head-to-head matchups against potential Democratic nominees, his toughest opponents being Biden and Sanders, who both lead Trump 55% to 45%. When Trump is up against Warren he trails 52% to 48%, but when Howard Schultz is added to the ballot, Trump takes a 2-point lead (45% to 43%) with Schultz at 12%.

To a lesser extent, Schultz also tightens a race between Trump and Sanders from a 10-point lead to 6 points, 48% to 42%, with 10% voting for Schultz.

Ideal Candidate

Voters were also asked about which characteristics they seek in an ideal candidate. The most highly prioritized characteristic is truthfulness, as cited by 42% of respondents, followed by being on the same side of the issues at 25%. Experience (14%) and authenticity (13%) were the third and fourth most highly prioritized characteristics. The poll also finds the following preferences among voters regarding potential characteristics of a presidential candidate:

85% of voters agree that the president should make efforts to work with the other party, 6% disagree and 9% are unsure.

70% of voters agree that the president should be transparent about their financial background. 11% disagree, and 19% are unsure.

68% of voters want the president to be an aggressive leader. 10% disagree, and 22% are unsure.

50% of voters want a president that has held elected office before. 22% disagree, and 28% are unsure.

42% of voters don’t want candidates to talk about their religious beliefs, 20% do want them to talk about their religious beliefs and 38% are unsure.

38% think a woman should be either president or vice president, while 15% disagree, and 47% are unsure.

Military experience is a non-issue for a plurality (45%) of respondents. While 30% are not looking for military experience, 25% are.

Caller ID

The New Hampshire Emerson College poll was conducted February 21-22, 2019 under the Supervision of Professor Spencer Kimball. The sample consisted of registered voters, n=910, with a Credibility Interval (CI) similar to a poll’s margin of error (MOE) of +/- 3.2 percentage points. The data was weighted based on 2016 voter model, age, party affiliation,. It is important to remember that subsets based on gender, age, party breakdown, ethnicity and region carry with them higher margins of error, as the sample size is reduced. Data was collected using both an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system of landlines only (n=605) and an online panel provided by Amazon Turk and Dynata (n=305).

323,Empty,2019-02-25T06:42:23Z,Elections are the hinge connecting social dynamics to India's liberal democratic structures.,"The paradox of the coexistence of democracy and mass poverty is deeper in India than in many other societies. Some of the common reasons why democracies do not care for their poor do not hold true for India.

First of all, the institutional design of Indian democracy (parliamentary system, asymmetrical federalism, flexible Constitution amendment) is not “demos-constraining” in that it does not put significant obstacles to the democratic popular will. There are not too many veto points that might account for the failure of floor-securing social policies to be legislated and implemented.

Some of the common reasons why democracies do not care for their poor do not hold true for India.

Second, the party system is intensely competitive with very high electoral volatility. The first-past-the-post system accentuates the effect of voters’ volatility into dramatic change in seats and government formation. Though the level of volatility has come down in this decade as compared to the previous one, a ruling party in an Indian state has just about a 50% chance of coming back to power. Parties cannot afford to be complacent and overlook issues that might concern a significant proportion of population.

Third, the state capacity in India is higher than most comparable poor countries; it still commands the force to impose its will and is not crippled by absence of resources to meet some of its key projects. All this makes it even more intriguing that the ruling parties/coalitions should not (be able to) muster adequate political will to carry out anti-poverty policies.

Finally, what makes it truly intriguing is that the poor have not opted out of democratic politics in India, at least not from routine participation in electoral politics.

Why elections have gained primacy in Indian democracy

Across countries in terms of the impact of the electoral system, the structure of political choices offered by the party system, the social basis of political preferences, agenda-setting and public opinion formation, the invisible role of issues and ideologies, interests and identities are seen to be the keys to making sense of elections.

Yet we simply assume that elections perform the same role everywhere. The end result of this similarity is that the experience of electoral politics in societies like India is interpreted in the light of the narrow historical experience of Western Europe and North America.

Hence the need to understand the distinctiveness of the Indian experience of elections.

One of the first things that strikes any observer of Indian elections is their centrality in India’s political life. Banners, posters, and crowds fill the streets; massive processions and rallies are a norm; the media is full of election news and every street corner is buzzing with political gossip. Though on a steady decline of late, this kind of visibility in Indian elections symbolises the pivotal role elections have come to play in Indian politics.

If tension between pre-existing social form and borrowed legal-political structure provides the basic frame for understanding Indian democracy, the history of Indian politics is an attempt by millions of ordinary people to write their own political agenda in an alien script.

An election is an occasion for the transfer of energy and resources from the “unorganised” to the “organised” sector of democracy.

An encounter such as this, if it is to lead to meaningful outcomes, requires bridges or hinges that connect the two different worlds.

The institution of elections came to perform this crucial role in India. It became the hinge that connected the existing social dynamics to the new political structures of liberal democracy, allowing for reciprocal influence. An election is often the site for a fusion of popular beliefs and political practices with high institutions of governance.

Thus an election is an occasion for the transfer of energy and resources from the “unorganised” to the “organised” sector of democracy. This is the moment when the legal-constitutional order of liberal democracy makes contact with the messy social and political reality of India. The “formal” sector is highly visible, it leads a legal-constitutional existence, it involves “civil society” groups and NGOs or a certain segment of political parties, it speaks a familiar modern language, mobilises secular identities and is easy to incorporate into a global register of democracy, even if it draws modest energy and participation.

Every political actor is aware of another “informal” sector, often seen as a source of embarrassment. Political organisations and movements that inhibit this sector speak a homespun hybrid language and fall back upon identity-based mobilisation. Though political practices in this sector lead an invisible, often paralegal, existence below the radar, this sector remains the most happening political site in terms of popular mobilisation and energy. The chasm that separates the two worlds and the absence or non-functioning of the other possible bridges has resulted in the unusual salience of the institution of elections.

This unique role is what accounts for the continued dynamism of the electoral process in India, while a number of other imported institutions and processes are floundering.

A festival of collective identity

Elections in India perform many more functions. For a postcolonial country like India, successful elections are still a symbol of a national political community, something of a festival of collective identity. For the poor and the marginalised, who are excluded from the normal functioning of the state, elections are an affirmation of their citizenship and are seen as a sacred ritual of political equality. Notwithstanding a robust media that routinely uses public opinion polls, elections are still the principal site for the dissemination of political ideas and information and also the only reliable method to gauge public opinion on the big issues facing the country.

Elections force political parties to consider ideas, interests, and entities that do not lend themselves to easy aggregation through instrumentalities of the “organised” sector. Thus, elections often appear as the only bridge between the people and power, as the only reality check in the political system.

Elections often appear as the only bridge between the people and power, as the only reality check in the political system.

Elections are also an occasion for settling, unsettling or resettling local equations of social dominance and the arena of struggles for social identity and dignity. Elections are a site for contestation for social dominance in a locality, leading to assertion by dominant social groups and protests by subaltern groups.

Attempts by clever political entrepreneurs to manufacture a social majority often involve building a local coalition of castes and communities. This often leads to an invention of community boundaries and sometimes the jerrymandering of settled boundaries. In a micro as well as macro setting, elections are an occasion for distribution and redistribution of resources. This is the time for patronage distribution as well as the occasion for the ordinary citizens to collect their “dues” from the political class.

All this accounts for the festival-like character of the Indian elections and the fierceness with which they are contested here. At the same time, this compression of multiple decisions into a single act also results in an under-emphasis on the representational functions of elections.

Democrats’ embrace of sweeping progressive ideas like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal is about to get its first reality check on Capitol Hill — as both parties make huge bets about which message will sway voters in 2020.

For liberal Democrats, proposals to provide universal health care, combat climate change and create a fairer economy represent the kind of bold agenda they will need to unseat President Donald Trump, a candidate unafraid to make his own brash moves on trade and immigration. But Republicans are seizing on the same proposals to paint Democrats as socialist radicals, while trying to widen the ideological splits already emerging among Trump’s would-be challengers.

Story Continued Below

Senate Republicans plan to force a vote as early as next week, S.J. Res. 8, on progressives’ Green New Deal climate resolution, which has drawn support from almost all of the chamber’s declared and potential Democratic presidential hopefuls. House Democrats, meanwhile, are set to unveil legislation guaranteeing government-funded health care for all Americans — amid conflicting poll numbers about voters’ willingness to upend the existing health insurance market.

It’s the beginning of what promises to be a series of high-stakes tests that both parties insist will work to their advantage.

“The Republicans are misreading the moment,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), an outspoken liberal on issues like climate change. “We have never been more fired up.”

In fact, some progressives have invoked Trump’s upset 2016 win as an argument for taking a bold strategy into 2020 — evidence that Democrats should focus more on articulating popular core values and less on worrying about the practicalities. In the same way Trump fired up his base with pledges to build the wall and make America great again, progressives believe Democrats can piece together an even bigger coalition by branding themselves as the party of universal health care and economic equality.

“You could actually credit Donald Trump for this,” said Faiz Shakir, the new campaign manager for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2020 run. “The kind of not giving a crap what others think, or what his critics think, and just plowing ahead with a vision has made progressives hungrier for a version of, well, what would that look like [on the left]?”

But top Republicans say they see Democrats veering off a socialist cliff — citing the Green New Deal, H. Res. 109 (116), and S. Res. 59, co-authored by New York freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a prime example.

“It’s entirely fantasy, it’s unrealistic. These are just talking points designed to appeal to the fringe of their party,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). He added, “It’s ended up causing quite a headache for our colleagues across the aisle who’ve tried to explain exactly what they’re trying to do and how they’re trying to do it.”

The debate in Congress’ opening months follows more than two years of arguments by progressive activists that Democrats need to be more than just the anti-Trump party to succeed in 2020. They say transformative policies are also increasingly necessary to counter major crises like a changing climate and the growing power of the super-rich.

“The center of energy in the Democratic Party is with these kinds of bold, progressive, populist ideas around transforming our economy and democracy,” said Waleed Shahid of Justice Democrats, a group inspired by Sanders’ 2016 run and crucial to the rise of Ocasio-Cortez. “We’re making change happen pretty fast.”

Yet it’s also generated unease among party moderates. And while progressives point to strong polling in support of Medicare for All and aggressive climate action, the GOP is eager to spend the next several months chipping away at it.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s call for a vote on the Green New Deal is aimed purely at driving a wedge through the Democratic Party, forcing liberal senators and vulnerable centrists alike to weigh in on a proposal that envisions remaking the U.S. economy in just a decade. Already, moderate Democratic senators like Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Joe Manchin of West Virginia have groused publicly about the plan as moving too far, too fast.

Republicans in the House, meanwhile, are pressing for a series of hearings on Medicare for All, certain that enthusiasm for single-payer health care will plummet as voters study the details and trade-offs.

“Democrats’ Medicare for All proposal would force over 150 million Americans to lose their employer or their union-sponsored insurance,” said Oregon Rep. Greg Walden, the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “You want to talk about sabotage? That’s what we should be having a hearing on.”

Democrats’ liberal wing vows to meet that challenge head on. And they’re expecting the party’s growing list of presidential candidates to stand with them through the long, bruising 2020 campaign.

Already, all six Democratic senators running for president have co-sponsored the Green New Deal, and five signed on last year to Medicare for All legislation. Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have sought to further separate themselves from the pack — Sanders is running as a democratic socialist in favor of free college and a break-up of the big banks, while Warren has rolled out plans for a wealth tax and universal child care.

In Congress, House progressives next week are rolling out a detailed road map to single-payer health care — even as party leaders urge a focus on the more immediate, incremental health issues that sparked their midterm electoral wave just months ago.

“What we’re proposing is really a transformation of the health care system to get out the pieces that are so embedded in it that it continues to make health care costs equivalent to 19 percent of GDP,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), a Congressional Progressive Caucus leader who’s penning the Medicare for All bill. “The majority of the American public believes we should have what almost every other industrialized country in the world has.”

Still, Democrats acknowledge they’re inviting intense scrutiny of such transformative proposals — and the reckoning that’s in store if they miscalculate voter enthusiasm for policies that would upend broad swaths of the economy.

One presidential contender, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), faced immediate blowback for suggesting at a CNN town hall in January that she would support eliminating private health insurance as part of a Medicare for All system. Similarly, the Green New Deal drew an early wave of confusion and gleeful GOP attacks after Ocasio-Cortez’s staff mistakenly distributed a document that included principles not endorsed by the resolution’s supporters — including phasing out nuclear energy and building high-speed rail “at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.”

And some moderate Democrats have privately pointed to House progressives’ difficulties securing 100 co-sponsors for their single-payer health care bill as evidence the party’s vocal left wing is overstating support for its policy ideas.

Some 2020 contenders are consciously tacking toward the center in the meantime. On Monday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar cast the Green New Deal as “aspirational” despite her endorsement of it, and Medicare for All as something to shoot for down the road — positioning herself instead as a more pragmatic candidate.

“It could be a possibility in the future,” Klobuchar said of single-payer health care. “But I’m looking for what’s working now.”

That’s a balancing act that several Democrats in Congress say they hope the party can strike — aligning with the progressive rhetoric that’s resonated with voters, while pursuing more incremental policies.

“It’s a great conversation starter,” Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, a freshman Democrat facing a tough reelection in 2020, said of the Green New Deal. “What’s proposed in there is a little too aggressive and a little too far right now, but we have got to have a conversation about climate change and what we’re doing to this planet.”

Democrats are similarly warning against litigating the details of moving to a single-payer health system, for fear of bogging down their advantage on health issues and giving Republicans new avenues of attack.

“What’s important is to get your values and your core principles out there,” said Democratic pollster and strategist Celinda Lake. “It’s classic for Democrats to jump right into the middle of the policy.”

Liberals, though, are chafing at the suggestion they limit their ambitions. They contend the GOP will try to paint all Democrats as left-wing firebrands anyway, so there’s little reason not to lean into big solutions that the public finds popular.

“This is actually politicians catching up to the people and the economic realities that they live in,” said former Virginia Rep. Tom Perriello, a Democrat who lost his seat in 2010 after backing Obamacare and a cap-and-trade proposal on climate change. “Taking a good idea and cutting it in half used to make it more popular. Now it sounds tone deaf.”

Indeed, the super PAC aligned with House GOP leadership is already targeting moderate freshmen Antonio Delgado of New York and Colin Allred of Texas over the Green New Deal — even though neither signed onto the resolution.

Those are divisions Republicans aim to exploit in the coming weeks on climate and health care, marking the first in what’s likely to be a string of tough tests for 2020 Democrats grappling with the left’s newfound power and heightened expectations.

“We’ll really see in the 2020 presidential campaign who is actually committed to prioritizing and fighting for these policies,” Shahid said, ""and who just wants to be part of the hashtag.""",2020 Democrats’ progressive gamble is about to get real,Politico,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/23/2020-democrats-progressive-gamble-is-about-to-get-real-1198006

This is a week replete with challenges for President Donald Trump.

He faces a second summit with North Korea’s leader, a Democratic challenge to his emergency border declaration and public testimony from a key figure in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into alleged Russian election meddling, which could be nearing completion.

Mueller: Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer who has said the president directed him to make illegal hush money payments, is set to testify on what he knows about the 2016 campaign. Border: House Democrats have set a vote for tomorrow on a resolution to block Trump’s emergency declaration to build a wall on the southern U.S. Border with Mexico. The measure will force Republicans to take a stand on whether the president exceeded his authority over federal spending. Summit: The president said yesterday he doesn’t expect to lift sanctions on Kim Jong Un’s regime, as he prepares for a summit with the North Korean leader this week on U.S. demands that Pyongyang end its nuclear program.

Another pressing issue has already been punted. Trump said late yesterday that he’ll extend Friday’s deadline to raise tariffs on Chinese goods, citing “substantial progress” in the latest round of trade talks in Washington.

Global Headlines

Venezuela standoff | U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will meet opposition leader Juan Guaido in Bogota today and plans to announce new actions against Venezuela that may include forms of economic or diplomatic pressure, according to an administration official. Guaido’s efforts to deliver aid convoys to Venezuela from Colombia this weekend were violently quashed by forces loyal to Nicolas Maduro, but nothing has really changed on the ground. The nation is still hungry, scared and wondering what comes next.

Raising the stakes | Theresa May again put off a final parliamentary ballot on her Brexit agreement, this time until March 12, as she seeks concessions from the European Union. But the delay risks further angering ministers who fear the premier’s strategy is pushing the country to the brink of a catastrophic no-deal departure. They’ll have a chance to force her hand on Wednesday, when lawmakers are due to vote on an amendment to delay Brexit to avoid the economic damage of crashing out.

War and peace | Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might declare a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War during their summit this week in Vietnam, South Korea said. While the move may help fulfill the U.S. leader's pledge to cease “endless wars,” it also risks undercutting arguments for maintaining the American troop presence on the Korean Peninsula.

Taking a hit | Italian Deputy Premier Luigi Di Maio’s Five Star Movement suffered another blow in a regional vote, this time on the island of Sardinia, where exit polls showed the party’s support tumbled. That's bad news for the stability of the alliance with the League because of growing pressure on Di Maio to increase his influence and prove Five Star is getting something out of the governing coalition.

New direction | China’s Politburo laid out a broad outline on how the nation’s more than $40 trillion finance sector should transform itself through supply-side reform – and by further opening up the industry. The government's push to control risk appears to be giving way to a desire to support its economy, as signaled by comments President Xi Jinping made at the gathering of China’s 25 most senior leaders.

What to Watch Today

Nigeria’s electoral commission plans to start announcing state-by-state results from the tight presidential race between the incumbent Muhammadu Buhari and his main challenger, Atiku Abubakar.

And finally ... Algerians have been protesting against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s decision to seek a fifth term in elections in April. In response to the peaceful rallies – which started Friday and are the biggest in the North African oil producer in years – the new head of the ruling FLN party, Mourad Bouchared, said God had sent the president, now in his 80s and ailing, to look after the country and reform it. Social media pundits saw the humor and the TweetCommeMouad hashtag appeared.

MIAMI — Miami fears the fix is in.

Local Democrats increasingly believe that the Democratic National Convention in 2020 will be sited in Milwaukee, Wis., a conclusion that’s led Florida politicians, donors and insiders to mount a final lobbying blitz to turn the tide.

Story Continued Below

The last-ditch effort began in earnest in recent days as speculation mounted that Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez would pick Milwaukee, where he has both family ties and the pressure of the Democratic governors of Wisconsin and Illinois weighing on him to go with a Midwestern location.

Perez has denied making up his mind or favoring any of the three finalist cities, a shortlist that includes Houston.

Still, the state’s Democratic congressional delegation has been pressed into service to persuade him. Hotel worker unions are also making a pitch to choose Miami — labor has a greater presence in the hospitality industry here than in Milwaukee.

Miami’s stable of Democratic donors — many of whom have hosted President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton multiple times and are already being hit up by numerous Democratic presidential hopefuls — are applying their clout to the city’s bid. Some of them say they’re already leaning on potential 2020 candidates — they won’t say which ones — to get them behind Miami’s convention bid.

Underpinning Miami’s pitch: It’s the heart of the largest Democratic county in the nation’s biggest swing state. Losing Florida — which is worth 29 Electoral College votes, compared to Wisconsin’s 10 — would likely cost President Donald Trump his reelection.

“We’re making a final effort to convince the DNC that Miami is the best place to go, that this could be a boost to the nominee,” said Chris Korge, the top financier of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and a co-chair of Miami’s convention effort.

Korge said he was limited in what he could say due to a DNC request that the discussions not be made public.

Behind the scenes, the convention site selection has been a proxy fight over how the presidential campaign could play out, pitting the Rust Belt, and the white working-class voters there who deserted the party in 2016, against a diverse coastal megalopolis, where minority voter turnout will be essential to Democratic hopes in 2020.

Milwaukee officials play up their heartland connections and mild summers, contrasting those with Miami and the risk of hurricanes. It’s a talking point that irks Miami officials so much that they’ve researched historic storm data to make the case that hurricanes are a rarity in early July, when the convention would be held.

Miami officials have made a quality-of-life argument as well by claiming the accommodations in Milwaukee are so limited that California’s large delegation can’t fit in a single hotel in the city — an issue the Miami convention boosters expect to raise with California’s best-known politician, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, to curry her support.

Midwest Democrats are approaching the decision with something of a chip on their shoulder. They contend Clinton snubbed Wisconsin and Michigan, and that the party needs to repair its relationship with the Midwest.

“Florida is a swing state. But we’re a swing region. The Midwest sticks together, and a convention has not been in the Midwest since 1996,” one Wisconsin official involved in the convention discussion said. “We are isolated from natural disasters. We don’t get tornadoes. We don’t get hurricanes. We don’t get earthquakes.”

As for Miami’s paranoia about Milwaukee, the official said, “they’re more confident than we are. It’s a jump ball ... it seems to change every day.”

There’s a sense among Democratic insiders that Houston is out of the picture, a victim of muggier summers than Miami, a relatively small Democratic delegation and concerns about the specter of oil money funding a convention for a party that believes in climate change and scaling back fossil fuel use.

In the run-up to the final decision, the mayors of Miami and Miami Beach have reached out to each of Florida’s 13 Democratic members of Congress in Florida to get them engaged. Some have called Perez already. Rep. Donna Shalala of Miami, who was Perez’s boss when she was President Bill Clinton’s health secretary, personally spoke to him about the Miami bid at a dinner hosted by former U.S. Ambassador to Belgium, Paul Cejas, a major Democratic donor. A former Justice Department colleague of Perez, former South Florida U.S. Attorney Willy Ferrer, has chimed in as well.

The singer-songwriter couple Gloria and Emilio Estefan have also lent their star power and former New York Yankee Derek Jeter, now a part-owner of the Miami Marlins, has been “very eager” to help make his new club’s baseball stadium available for the convention, said a source.

Joe Falk, a major South Florida donor involved in supporting Miami’s bid, said Miami should be able to sell itself because it’s multi-ethnic, gay-friendly and a place where donors are much more likely to open their wallets than Milwaukee.

“How do you get the donor to dig deeper? Show him a good time,” Falk said. “The donors are here and we know how to treat donors. We have the facilities to make those incredibly wealthy people comfortable. And we know how to throw a good party.”

Another top Democratic donor from Miami who didn’t want to be identified said he’s already being besieged by presidential hopefuls for contributions. And he’s making sure to press the issue of Miami’s convention bid.

“If you want Florida’s support, you should support Florida. It’s a simple message,” the donor said. “You hear people say ‘Florida, Florida, Florida.’ They don’t say ‘Wisconsin, Wisconsin, Wisconsin.’ There’s a reason for that.”

But it’s not just stars, ambassadors and high-rollers helping out. UNITE HERE, a hotel-worker union, is calling Perez, DNC members and other top Democrats to boost Miami’s efforts.

“For our union in particular, it’s a no-brainer,” said Wendi Walsh, a UNITE HERE international vice president. “For this DNC, we’ve got almost 4,000 union hotel rooms here in South Florida compared to zero in Milwaukee.”

Wisconsin officials note, however, that they have a far-more union-friendly state than Florida.

Walsh, who said the public employee union AFSCME is also being engaged, said there’s a purely political dimension to the effort: “Florida matters a lot, and we want to win Florida.”

The convention would help inject a sense of energy into South Florida that could help cure the liberal bastion’s longtime turnout problems, which have led Democrats to lose recent statewide elections by about a percentage point or less, according to a Wednesday letter to Perez written by Christian Ulvert, a top Democratic consultant who has advised Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber and his predecessor, Philip Levine, a co-chair of the convention effort with Korge.

Ulvert noted that Trump on Monday campaigned in Miami as part of an outreach effort to court voters of Venezuelan heritage and shore up support among Cuban-Americans.

“Republican strategy has been to maximize gains outside of South Florida and erode our support here,” Ulvert wrote. “Florida is ground zero for presidential elections — Miami-Dade is clearly ground zero for Florida.”",Miami makes last-ditch convention pitch,Politico,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/21/miami-democratic-national-convention-bid-1176840

But Howie Hawkins wants to set th…","The question is whether the public will listen. Once widely accused of spoiling a presidential election that led to two wars, the Green Party has been mostly relegated to a political punchline, thanks in part to the foibles of its former leader Jill Stein. Now, the Green New Deal—which helped to differentiate the eco-socialists Greens from the Democrats—has been coopted. The Democrats are even warming to socialist ideas. So does America even need a Green Party anymore? Or does America need it now more than ever?



The Green Party barely registered notice in 1996 when it fielded its first presidential candidate, who only made it onto the ballot in 22 states. But four years later, nominee Ralph Nader qualified in 43 states and won about 2.7 percent of the popular vote nationwide. Because he drew 95,000 votes in Florida, the famously decisive state in that election, he was accused of handing the presidency to George W. Bush. Nader and his supporters—among others—reject the argument that he spoiled the election, but there’s no denying that the 2000 election established the Greens’ legitimacy and influence as a third party.

Nearly two decades later, the Green Party has lost some of both—though it might still have enough support to tip the results of a presidential election. The party’s two-time nominee, Jill Stein, received just .4 percent of the vote in 2012, but 1.1 percent in 2016. The latter was “enough votes to tip the scales for Donald Trump in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,” claimed Vanity Fair. (More accurately, her vote total in the three key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania was higher than Trump’s margin of victory, but there’s no evidence that Stein’s supporters would have voted for Clinton otherwise. They may have chosen no one at all.) Stein also potentially compromised her party’s legitimacy with her connection to multiple scandals related to the Russia investigation—not to mention her curious comments on vaccines and the health affects of Wi-Fi.

Stein has suggested she won’t seek the party’s nomination in 2020, so there’s potential for a new Green voice. But it’s not yet clear who that will be. Aside from Hawkins and Schlakman, only 12 people have officially declared their candidacy for the Green Party nomination. It’s hard to tell which are serious. Kanye Deez Nutz West most likely is not. But Dario Hunter is, and he’s about as diverse as candidates come: black, gay, Iranian, and Jewish. He’s also an ordained rabbi, a former environmental attorney, and a school board member in Youngstown, Ohio. These qualities all make him an ideal new voice for the party, he said. “If we want to cut through the lack of attention given [to Greens], we need someone who has a loud and clear voice and a tough skin,” he said. “It takes a tough skin to be an openly gay black son-of-an immigrant Jewish rabbi.”

Why should there be attention given to Greens, though, now that Democrats have embraced the Green New Deal? Simple, said Hunter: “This Democratic version of the Green New Deal is watered down. It pales in comparison to ours.”",Will the Democrats Kill the Green Party by Stealing Its Best Idea?,Newrepublic.com,https://newrepublic.com/article/153127/will-democrats-kill-green-party-stealing-best-idea

Twitter’s favorite large adult son, Donald Trump Jr., produced one of his most thought-provoking self-owns earlier this month, when he attempted to impugn the patriotism of the Democratic women of Congress. On February 6, Trump tweeted a post–State of the Union photo of a white-clad group of congresswomen huddled around Nancy Pelosi with the superimposed caption “NOT ONE AMERICAN FLAG PIN AMONG THEM.” Ironically, Trump also wrote that the photo “speaks for itself and no one is at all surprised.”



At the top of his replies, above the cracks about the Trump family’s preference for Russian flags or the gallery of Republican politicians wearing flag pins in mugshots, were a pair of photos from that same SOTU. One was of the Trump children. The other was a crowd shot of the Republican side of the speech audience. Not a flag pin in sight in either picture.

Junior’s posting may have been just another attempt to rile his father’s dwindling base, but he unwittingly may have exposed a noteworthy zeitgeist shift. Could the decades-long rule of the flag pin finally be over?

Pins depicting Old Glory first made their way into politics on lapels of Republican candidates during the 1970 congressional race, according to an old Time piece—a subtle counterpoint to the anti-Vietnam War protestors who were then regularly burning the flag at the time. But it was Richard Nixon who helped usher the accessory to True Patriot shibboleth status. As biographer Stephen E. Ambrose wrote, the president began to wear flag pins after the idea had been suggested to him by his chief of staff H. R. Haldeman, “who had seen it done in a movie called The Candidate.” Nixon would wear the pin throughout his presidency, including while lying to the American public about his involvement in Watergate, and later while resigning from office.



The flag pin returned with a vengeance after 9/11, when grand displays of patriotism were requirements for both Democrats and Republicans alike. This political science phenomenon of increased patriotism in times of crisis is fittingly known as the ""rally 'round the flag effect."" Even the media participated in the hawkish theatrics of the time. Some pushed back and caught plenty of flak for it: When ABC continued to uphold its longstanding anti-pin policy after 9/11, it resulted in chain emails urging boycotts of the network and its sponsors along with claims the network had instituted a new policy to ban the pins and patriotism itself.

While other outlets pontificated on the ethics of allowing anchors to wear pins, Fox News went all in from the jump. ""Why would it ever be inappropriate?"" asked Fox News’s Brit Hume. ""It doesn't stand for the Bush administration or for a certain party or even the government. It stands for the country. Why is wearing a symbol of the country of which you're a citizen a problem?""

The problem, some people said, was that the flag pins could stand for not just patriotism but also an uncritical view of the US government at a time when the country was marching toward what turned out to be a disastrous war in Iraq. Those attitudes may have even pushed Americans to seek impartial reporting from foreign outlets. Greg Dyke, the director general of the BBC at the time, noted the increased American audience for his channel’s coverage of the Iraq war and said that “many US networks wrapped themselves in the American flag and swapped impartiality for patriotism,” and in doing so, “misjudged some of their audience.”

By 2007, the Iraq War was no longer being viewed so positively, and a few Democratic politicians began to toy with the idea of discarding the flag pin. One of those was Senator Barack Obama. That October, when asked why he was not wearing a pin on his lapel, the presidential candidate told KCRG-TV in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that while he wore the pins after 9/11, he had stopped during the Iraq War after noticing they’d become a substitute for “true patriotism, which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security.” He added that he hoped telling Americans what he believed would make the country great would be an adequate “testament to his patriotism.”

This prompted such a huge outcry that Obama changed course and went on to wear a flag pin for the rest of his candidacy and presidency. Stupidly, that did not end the controversy: Subsequent racist urban legends popped up about him sometimes wearing his pins upside-down as a Carol Burnett ear-pull to his Muslim Brotherhood friends.

Seeing Obama attacked for such farcical reasons pushed many on the left to start challenging the flag pin. “New Rule: Show me a man wearing an American flag pin in his lapel, and I'll show you an asshole,” Bill Maher snarked in Salon after the original Obama pin scandal. “Make wearing a flag pin the 28th amendment,” John Roland Martin facetiously suggested in a CNN article about all the hand-wringing.

By the 2016 presidential election cycle, major cracks had emerged in flag pin dogma. The press was again openly challenging the practice and, though the right was still mostly committed to the bit, the Democratic primary debates were nearly pinless, save for Martin O’Malley. And after Donald Trump's election-night upset, the flag pin tradition seems to have sputtered out entirely.

From the administration’s first days, it became clear that the flag pin reverence of the Bush era was long gone. While covering John Kelly’s confirmation hearing, Washington Post reporter Robert Costa overheard a friend of the general suggest he put on a pin, to which the general replied “I am an American flag.” This bucking of orthodoxy earned Kelly praise from Ann Coulter. A year later, Sean Spicer’s accidental upside-down flag pin during one press briefing spawned jokes about how he was sending a distress signal. Cheapening the brand further was Donald Trump Junior, who was mocked for wearing a flag pin with “deplorable” written across the middle to the 2018 White House Easter Egg Roll.



Brandon Lenoir, a political science professor at High Point University, told VICE it was only a matter of time before this shift happened. ""We are now many years removed from 9/11, even though we're still a nation at war, people are not as engaged,"" he said. ""That's why I think we're seeing a loosening of the expectation that every elected official will be wearing an American flag.""



That said, Lenoir doesn't see Republican politicians ditching the baubles any time soon.



""We really do have a divide in the political ideologies of the parties with patriotism,"" he explained. ""For some, that means an outward expression of wearing the flag, while others think upholding the Constitution and fighting for the issues that are important to them is more patriotic.""

The flag pin's decline might simply show that certain symbols inevitably fall out of favor—these days, conservatives instead stick flag emoji to their Twitter profiles. But it also shows a fundamental change in discourse. Prior to the Trump administration, the Republican Party had largely favored dog whistles rather than coming out with their ugliest views. Attacking Obama over his flag pin was an easy way to target him as alien and un-American without saying that the black son of a Kenyan was plotting to destroy the US. The GOP's new figurehead, Trump, is both unwilling and unable to participate in that approach. He always says the quiet part loud, and only occasionally wears a pin.

The current government wants closer EU integration and warns of catastrophe if the country falls back into Russia’s sphere of influence.

But corruption scandals and worries over the health of its democracy have tarnished the country’s image and weakened the appeal of the pro-Western political class.

The opposition Socialist Party, which favors closer ties to Moscow, took a slight early lead at 29.5 percent, with 30 percent of votes counted. The ruling pro-Western Democratic Party trailed with 28.8 percent, while an opposition bloc called ACUM, campaigning to fight entrenched corruption, was third with 22 percent.

A clearer picture of the final tally will emerge on Monday.

An inconclusive election or one marred by allegations of fraud could tip the country back into instability just as it has recovered from a $1 billion banking scandal in 2014 and 2015.

If the results are split, it could set the stage for weeks of coalition talks or another election.

“If no one has a parliamentary majority, I think that there will be attempts to form it, but the risk is high that it could come to a snap election in the coming few months,” President Igor Dodon told reporters.

On Saturday, Dodon, the former Socialist Party chief, called the campaign “one of the dirtiest in our entire history”. He and leading opposition figures have threatened to launch street protests and raised concerns about vote-buying.

“If the elections are rigged even more than they have already been rigged to this day, we will come out to protect our vote,” ACUM leader Maia Sandu said.

POISONED POLITICS

The campaign has already been dogged by controversy.

In the past few days alone, ACUM’s leaders said they were being poisoned on the orders of the authorities, which the Democratic Party swiftly dismissed as a “strange accusation”.

Russia’s interior ministry announced an investigation into Democratic Party leader Vladimir Plahotniuc, accusing him of involvement in organized crime, prompting Plahotniuc’s party to accuse Moscow of election meddling.

The Democratic Party had already been accused of trying to bend the electoral system in its favor by introducing changes in 2017 on how votes are cast.

Previously, Moldovans voted on party lists, but the Democratic Party introduced a mixed system of party lists and first-past-the-post constituency races, against the advice of European rights experts. The Democratic Party rejects suggestions it benefits most from the new voting system.

It has in turn accused Dodon of colluding with Russia to put the Socialists in power, which the president denies.

“Moldova has the potential for development, it’s only necessary that the authorities not be corrupt, that they should think about the people, and not only about their own pockets,” said Alexandra Ciorescu, a 72-year-old pensioner.

BELIEVING IN THE FUTURE

The EU forged a deal on closer trade and political ties with Moldova in 2014 but has become increasingly critical of Chisinau’s track record on reforms.

One of Europe’s poorest countries, which is squeezed between Ukraine and EU member state Romania, Moldova plunged into crisis in 2014 and 2015 after $1 billion was pilfered from three banks.

The EU froze aid after a court struck down the victory in the Chisinau mayoral race of one of ACUM’s leaders, Andrei Nastase, on a technicality last year. The European Parliament declared it “a state captured by oligarchic interests”.

Plahotniuc’s party has trumpeted the achievements of its government under Prime Minister Pavel Filip. The economy is growing, the banking system has stabilized and cooperation with the International Monetary Fund resumed.

“I believe in the future of Moldova,” Filip said after casting his vote. “We are ready to continue reforms and all social programs, the implementation of which will change the lives of Moldovan citizens for the better.”

Dodon and the Democratic Party have clashed over issues ranging from relations with Russia to ministerial appointments. But some Moldovans suspect that the Socialists and Plahotniuc collaborate behind the scenes to carve up the state between themselves - a suggestion rejected by Dodon in a Reuters interview in January.",Moldovans vote for new government amid talk of protests and poisoning,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-moldova-election-idUSKCN1QD03K

WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Liberal Democratic presidential contenders' rush to embrace the left's most ambitious proposals has some Democrats worried there could be a price to pay when they try to defeat President Donald Trump next year.

Party activists have been energized as Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and other candidates endorsed plans to provide Medicare coverage to every American, some form of tuition-free college, a national $15 minimum wage and the so-called ""Green New Deal"" advocated by U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

But Trump and his allies in the Republican Party have seized on those stances to attack the Democratic 2020 field as outside the American political mainstream — a claim the president plans to make throughout his re-election campaign, according to sources with knowledge of his strategy.

Some Democrats fear the argument has potency. They worry the primary may produce a nominee who will not appeal to centrist working and middle-class voters who voted for Trump in 2016 but whom Democrats believe they can win back.

""The big progressive programs are popular in a caucus or primary electorate, but probably don't move the needle among voters who want to find someone who will change Washington by tilting the system to favor people in the middle — not the very rich or the very poor,"" said Jeff Link, an Iowa Democrat who worked for former President Barack Obama's campaign.

A person familiar with the president's thinking told Reuters that Trump had been looking for a ""big contrast issue"" to help power his 2020 bid.

His last Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, was widely known to the voting public before her campaign. This time, Trump may face someone new to the national stage, and he is looking to brand that candidate before she or he emerges as the nominee.

In recent speeches, including his State of the Union address and again this week in Florida, a key 2020 battleground, Trump used the crisis in Venezuela to equate Democrats with socialists.

""There's no question this is a deliberate strategy on his part,"" said Matt Bennett, a political analyst with Third Way, a Democratic centrist think-tank. ""It is a bit scary to think about what it could do to us in a close, tough election next year.""

GOING GREEN

Democrats have already seen the risks of catering to progressives.

Senators Booker of New Jersey, Harris of California, Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts almost immediately backed Ocasio-Cortez's push earlier this month for the Green New Deal, a sweeping 10-year blueprint for combating climate change that involves reducing carbon emissions and retrofitting infrastructure.

Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democratic socialist who announced this week he is running for president a second time, plans to introduce his own version of the climate plan.

Ocasio-Cortez, who has enjoyed disproportionate influence for a first-term congresswoman because of her social media presence, was forced to backtrack when an information sheet contained policy goals not in the plan, including doing away with nuclear power and airplanes and providing income to Americans ""unwilling to work.""

That didn't stop Trump and other Republicans from treating those goals as fact, suggesting that Democrats want to destroy air travel and expand the welfare rolls.

Republicans also jumped on Ocasio-Cortez's proposal to hike the marginal tax rate to 70 percent as a way to finance her environmental initiative. Even so, Warren followed by suggesting a ""wealth tax"" on Americans with large fortunes to help finance her child-care plan.

Democrats are ""afraid to tell their base what is practical"" and instead are offering policies that have little chance of being enacted, said Bryan Lanza, a former campaign aide to Trump who regularly defends the president on cable news.

Recent Democratic presidential nominees such as Clinton, Obama and John Kerry ran as centrists. This is the first election in the modern era, Lanza said, in which progressives ""are sucking up all the oxygen and energy.""

Democrats as a whole, however, have been moving in a more leftward direction for years. According to Gallup polling, the number of Democrats who identify themselves as ""liberal"" has risen from 32 percent in 2001 to 46 percent as of 2018.

That shift has largely been among white, highly educated Democrats. African-American and Hispanic voters remain more moderate — which could present a challenge as the party tries to mobilize those groups to vote in greater numbers.

So far, the moderate wing of the party is under-represented in the 2020 field. Some Democratic strategists are concerned the party did not heed the lesson from last year's congressional elections, when it took power in the U.S. House of Representatives largely through moderate candidates who won over suburban voters by focusing on ""kitchen-table"" issues such as coverage for preexisting medical conditions.

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota is one of the few Democrats in the presidential field to push back at the progressive agenda. At a CNN town hall this week, she called the Green New Deal ""aspirational"" and suggested Medicare for all was only a potential long-term goal.

John Delaney, a former Maryland congressman and a centrist who has gotten little traction as a presidential contender, this week said the 2020 primary ""is going to be a choice between socialism and a more just form of capitalism.""

Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist in the early primary state of South Carolina, said candidates must soon balance sweeping agendas with more pragmatic proposals.

""It has to be a mixed bag of what makes sense and will not cause us long-term political damage,' he said. (Reporting by James Oliphant; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Cynthia Osterman)

""We are looking at what can be done within our system to give this family a little solace in a time of unbelievable tragedy,"" the prime minister said after a funding announcement in Halifax.

""I can't comment on specific cases, but in heartbreaking cases like this we're certainly looking at doing what we can to bring this family that has suffered such a devastating loss together.""

Kawthar Barho and her husband Ebraheim arrived in Nova Scotia with their children as privately sponsored refugees in September 2017.

Early Tuesday, a fast-moving fire killed all seven of their children, prompting a outpouring of grief and support from across the country.

With his wife at his side in a Halifax hospital, Ebraheim Barho remains in a medically induced coma.

A funeral for the children, who range in age from three months to 14 years, is expected either Friday or Saturday.

Trudeau said Halifax MP Andy Fillmore had already contacted Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen about expediting the immigration process for family members.

Kawthar Barho has no other relatives living in Canada.

I think it's absolutely critical that we get those family members here as quickly as we can. Halifax MP Andy Fillmore

""I can tell you that this is a case that the minister is giving personal attention to,"" said Trudeau, who was among hundreds of people who gathered for a vigil in Halifax's main square Wednesday night in support of the Barhos.

Fillmore said immigration applications were being reviewed Thursday.

""This is an absolute priority to get this done as quickly as possible,"" he said. ""I think it's absolutely critical that we get those family members here as quickly as we can.""

The Liberal MP said he had met with Kawthar at the hospital, where she was asked if there was anything federal officials could do to help.

""She made it clear that it was her family,"" Fillmore said.

At Wednesday's vigil, Ali Duane, a member of Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency, urged all Canadians to pressure Ottawa to bring Kawthar Barho's family members to Nova Scotia.

Refugee claims can take years

Natalie Horne, vice-president of the community group that sponsored the Barhos' refugee claim, said some family members from Syria have already registered with the UN refugee agency, which should help speed up the process.

Typical refugee claims can take several years to complete.

""Once (the Barhos' story) leaves the headlines and people go back to their lives, there's still going to be a wake of tragedy for Kawthar and for Ebraheim,"" said Horne, vice-president of the Hants East Assisting Refugees Team.

""It will be a long road to recovery ... It's really important for us to get family here who can support them on that journey.""

The Barhos had lived in the Halifax suburb of Spryfield for only a few months, having moved to the city from nearby Elmsdale, N.S., to take advantage of language training and other immigrant services. They had planned to return to Elmsdale next month.

The Canadian Press





HALIFAX -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced up to $86.5-million to improve an expressway into Halifax, predicting the work will make commutes safer and swifter.

Trudeau said Thursday the federal money would help extend the Highway 107 Burnside Connector and build a high-speed bypass to connect Highways 101, 102, and 118.

""We know that families are going to get to work and back home quicker because of this investment,"" the prime minister said.

""We know that moving forward on something that's been talked about for so many decades . . . is something that a lot of families around here have been waiting for.""

The federal money from the Building Canada Fund is in addition to $107-million announced by the province, while the Halifax Regional Municipality will provide the remainder.

Later on Thursday, Trudeau is expected to take part in a tour of historical exhibits at the Black Cultural Centre in the community of Cherry Brook.

He is also to meet with a youth group before delivering a speech in recognition of black history. It's expected Trudeau would also extend a personal apology to those who were part of a group that were singled out in an apparent case of racial profiling during a visit to Parliament Hill earlier this month.

The incident took place during an event called Black Voices on the Hill, prompting a complaint to the Speaker from Liberal MP Greg Fergus.

The Federation of Black Canadians said several participants in the lobbying event were referred to as ""dark-skinned people"" and asked to leave a parliamentary cafeteria.

The Parliamentary Protective Service apologized at the time and said the force was investigating the incident.

In the House of Commons on Tuesday, Speaker Geoff Regan called the service's apology a welcome first step, but said it shouldn't be seen as closing the issue or as a way to erase the harsh and unacceptable reality of what happened.

""What was reported as happening was completely unacceptable,"" Trudeau said Thursday. ""The Parliament Buildings belong to all Canadians and the opportunity to access them freely in a moment . . . of celebration of Black History Month should not have been tarnished by these actions that we've heard about.""

Trudeau said he was looking forward to meeting with the group.

""We all have a responsibility as parliamentarians as Canadians to ensure that everyone is fully welcome everywhere in this country,"" he said.

""We have to recognize unfortunately that there are still barriers, there is still systemic racism in this country -- anti-black racism that can rear its head at surprising and unfortunate times and we need to make sure that we are responding appropriately.""

Michael MacDonald, The Canadian Press





HALIFAX -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed Thursday his government is responding to a desperate plea from the grieving mother who lost all seven of her children in a recent house fire, saying he wants to ""give this family a little solace in a time of unbelievable tragedy.""

Kawthar Barho, whose husband Ebraheim is in a medically induced coma to recover from extensive burns, has told local politicians and religious leaders in Halifax that she wants to be reunited with family members living overseas because she has no other relatives in Canada.

The prime minister, in Halifax on Thursday for a funding announcement, said Halifax MP Andy Fillmore had already contacted Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen about expediting the immigration process for some family members.

""I can't comment on specific cases, but in heartbreaking cases like this we're certainly looking at doing what we can to bring this family that has suffered such a devastating loss together,"" said Trudeau, who attended a vigil in Halifax's main square Wednesday night in support of the Barhos.

The Barhos arrived in Nova Scotia with their children as privately sponsored refugees in September 2017.

Early Tuesday, a fast-moving fire killed all of their children: Ahmad, 14; Rola, 12; Mohamad, 9; Ola, 8; Hala, 3; Rana, 2 and Abdullah, who was born in Canada on Nov. 9.

The cause of the fire remains unclear.

Fillmore said immigration applications were being reviewed Thursday.

""This is an absolute priority to get this done as quickly as possible,"" he said. ""I think it's absolutely critical that we get those family members here as quickly as we can.""

The Liberal MP said he had met with Kawthar at the hospital, where she was asked if there was anything federal officials could do to help.

""She made it clear that it was her family,"" Fillmore said.

Natalie Horne, vice-president of the community group that sponsored the Barhos' refugee claim, said some family members from Syria have already registered with the UN refugee agency, which should help speed up the process.

Typical refugee claims can take several years to complete.

""Once (the Barhos' story) leaves the headlines and people go back to their lives, there's still going to be a wake of tragedy for Kawthar and for Ebraheim,"" said Horne, vice-president of the Hants East Assisting Refugees Team.

""It will be a long road to recovery ... It's really important for us to get family here who can support them on that journey.""

Horne said Kawthar Barho told her the fire was caused by an electric baseboard heater that ignited a couch.

However, deputy fire Chief David Meldrum said residents should be wary of reading too much into that kind of speculation.

""We're aware of the reports that are in the media, as well as other information on social media,"" Meldrum said in an interview. ""I want to remind everyone this information is not coming from official sources. Our investigation is ongoing.""

Meldrum said if the investigation uncovers anything that would affect community safety, that information will be released to the public as soon as possible.

Still, he said it was unclear how long the investigation would take.

Ehab Zalok, an expert in fire safety engineering at Carleton University in Ottawa, said the fact that neighbours heard a bang before flames spread rapidly through the house suggests something non-solid, like a gas, may have caused the fire to spread rapidly.

He said the scale of the fire, which destroyed much of the home's top floor, suggests it was ""much more than just (a) structure burning or furniture burning"" because that kind of fire usually takes longer to grow.

""If you have something burning for a few minutes you would expect that people will smell something like smoke, smoke alarms will sound -- something to prepare people for what's coming, which is a bigger fire,"" he said in an interview.

A funeral for the children is expected either Friday or Saturday, said Imam Abdallah Yousri of the Ummah Mosque in Halifax.

Though the mosque can hold about 2,000 people, Yousri said the ceremony will be moved to a larger venue. That site had yet to be selected by Thursday afternoon.

The Barhos had lived in the Halifax suburb of Spryfield for only a few months, having moved to the city from nearby Elmsdale, N.S., to take advantage of language training and other immigrant services. They had planned to return to Elmsdale next month.

Neighbours say the children missed their old school and the friends they had made there.

The Barho family was among 1,795 Syrian refugees who have come to Nova Scotia in recent years.

The Trudeau government granted asylum to 40,000 Syrian refugees in 2015-16.

A brutal civil war has raged across Syria since 2011, claiming more than 400,000 lives.

That, in sum, is what Jody Wilson-Raybould told reporters when she turned up at the Liberal government’s cabinet meeting Tuesday. The opposition continues to call on Wilson-Raybould to talk about allegations first reported by the Globe and Mail Feb. 7 that officials in the Prime Minister’s Office pressured her to settle fraud and corruption charges against SNC-Lavalin.

Liberal MP Jody Wilson-Raybould leaves the Parliament buildings following Question Period on Tuesday. Experts say the former attorney general may be hampered by more than just solicitor-client privilege when it comes to answering questions about the SNC-Lavalin affair. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

But Wilson-Raybould said it’s not so simple. She was Justin Trudeau’s justice minister and attorney general when the pressure was allegedly applied. That means she is bound by “solicitor-client privilege,” a centuries-old principle that cloaks what is said between a lawyer and her client in legally protected confidentiality. “The rules and laws around privilege, around confidentiality, around my responsibility as a Member of Parliament, my ethical and professional responsibilities as a lawyer, are layered and incredibly complicated,” she said. Let’s go over the basics:

Article Continued Below

What is solicitor-client privilege? The Supreme Court of Canada has described solicitor-client privilege as a fundamental principle of our justice system. It means that communications between a lawyer (in this case, the then-attorney general Wilson-Raybould) and her client (the Liberal cabinet led by Trudeau) are protected secrets. This is considered vital to the legal process, because people need to be able to trust their lawyers, and lawyers need their clients to tell them everything if they want to represent them in the best way. “It’s meant to cover everything you say to your lawyer,” said Paul Champ, a litigation lawyer in Ottawa. “For your lawyer to present the best defence possible, you should feel free to say anything to your lawyer ... without fear or concern.” The principle remains in place even after the lawyer’s relationship with the client is over, said Andrew Martin, an assistant law professor at the University of British Columbia. “It’s for the benefit of the client,” he explained. “If you knew that once the person was no longer your lawyer they could tell people what you told them, you wouldn’t be that eager to tell them everything.”

In 2006, the Supreme Court ruled that solicitor-client privilege “recognizes that the justice system depends for its vitality on full, free and frank communication between those who need legal advice and those who are best able to provide it ... The resulting confidential relationship between solicitor and client is a necessary and essential condition of the effective administration of justice.” Can it be lifted?

Article Continued Below

Yes. That’s what the opposition has been pleading Trudeau to do. As the head of the Liberal cabinet, Trudeau is the client in the solicitor-client relationship, and can therefore waive any confidentiality that relationship affords, said Howard Anglin, a lawyer and executive director of the Canadian Constitution Foundation, who worked as prime minister Stephen Harper’s deputy chief of staff. Anglin said it’s important to note that only the client—and not the lawyer—can waive privilege. Former Conservative justice minister Peter MacKay is among those who argue that Trudeau has already waived solicitor-client privilege by denying his office pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case, and describing his conversation with her about the matter on Sept. 17.* Anglin said that, in general, the client waives privilege when he starts revealing previously confidential details about what he has disclosed to his lawyer. In his view, Trudeau has “probably now crossed the line into waiving privilege.” This is called “implicit” waiving. But Martin said the principle is considered so sacrosanct that lawyers would likely be wary of publicly discussing matters previously considered confidential just because the client revealed some information. Besides, as Wilson-Raybould said Tuesday, this situation is more complicated than that. How so? This isn’t just any solicitor-client relationship. This involves Canada’s attorney general, the Prime Minister’s Office and cabinet, and a criminal prosecution against a multibillion-dollar engineering company. Champ said the fact that the discussions in question involved ministers of the Crown in some cases adds another layer: cabinet confidentiality. This is a fundamental principle of our Westminster governing system, which makes secret what is said around the cabinet table. On top of that, there is the “ethical duty” of confidentiality that a lawyer has for conversations with their clients, which Martin said is considered “wider” than solicitor-client privilege. It covers information a lawyer might glean about a client that is irrelevant to the case they’re working on, such as corporate secrets or personal circumstances. And then there’s what is known as “litigation privilege,” which the prime minister has alluded to in this case. As Champ explained, this confidentiality exists to protect information about legal strategy in an upcoming trial—such as the criminal case against SNC-Lavalin, and the company’s judicial appeal calling for mediation. It makes for a thicket of confidentiality considerations that Wilson-Raybould will have to navigate when—and if—she finally speaks about what happened.

Ahmed, 15, Rola, 12, Mohammed, 10, Ghala, 9, Hala, 4, Rana, 3 and four-month-old Abdullah died in the early morning blaze at a home on Quartz Drive on Tuesday.

All seven children were from the Barho family, Syrian refugees who came to Nova Scotia in 2017.

The children’s parents, Ebraheim and Kawthar, were taken to hospital.

Ebraheim, the children’s father, was badly burned while trying to rescue his kids and is in life-threatening condition. Kawthar Barho was also injured but is expected to survive.

She noted they were all unique and individual.

“Ahmad, the oldest, was a jokester who had the best sense of humour, and like many 14-year-old boys, he loved girls,” said Horne, evoking laughter from the crowd.

“Rola, who was 12, was a little mother to all of the children and she excelled academically and wanted so much to do well in school.”

Mohamad was an excellent athlete, Ola loved to dance, Hala had a big personality, Rana was sweet and Abdullah was adored by his mother, said Horne, who works with Hants East Assisting Refugee Team Society.

“One of the fundamental responsibilities of any government is to look for good jobs, to defend jobs and to make sure that our economy is growing in ways that give a real and fair chance to everyone,” Trudeau told reporters in St. John’s, N.L., when asked about his conversations with then Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.

After Canada’s director of public prosecutions ruled on Sept. 4 that the trial should proceed, Trudeau and senior officials raised the matter three times with Wilson-Raybould, who had the power to overturn the decision.

CBC News First post-SNC-Lavalin p…,"Jody Wilson-Raybould wants to speak her truth, the question is whether Justin Trudeau will let her.

The PM’s former attorney general made the comments moments before a vote calling for a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair that has seen Wilson-Raybould resign from cabinet and Trudeau’s top advisor Gerry Butts walk the plank all over allegations the government doesn’t want to talk about and wishes would go away.

Wilson-Raybould said she would not vote on the motion since it dealt with her personally and she didn’t think that right.“I understand fully that Canadians want to know the truth and want transparency.

Privilege and confidentiality are not mine to waive and I hope that I have the opportunity to speak my truth,” Wilson-Raybould said.Moments after those comments, Justin Trudeau stood to lead the Liberals in shutting down the possibility of a public inquiry into this matter.

All but two Liberals, Wayne Long and Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, voted against a public inquiry.The vote came hours after it was revealed that the PM had spoken to Wilson-Raybould about SNC-Lavalin and the possibility of a sweetheart deal for the company after it was already decided not to grant them one.

According to court documents disclosed by The Globe and Mail, SNC-Lavalin was informed on Sept. 4, 2018 that they would not get the special deal.

On Sept. 5, Wilson-Raybould met with the PM’s former right hand man Gerry Butts at Ottawa’s historic Chateau Laurier hotel.

It was two weeks later that Trudeau himself met with Wilson-Raybould to discuss the SNC-Lavalin file.

The accusation facing Trudeau and his office is that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured Wilson-Raybould to give the well connected SNC-Lavalin the sweetheart deal.

If the conversations between Trudeau, or his staff, veered into pressuring the former attorney general not to prosecute SNC-Lavalin, then it could be a case of obstruction of justice.

Obstruction of justice is a crime that comes with a sentence of up to 10 years in jail.Trudeau has denied doing so but always with carefully worded statements.

Asked about this in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Trudeau bobbed and weaved.

“Who asked for the meeting was it the prime minister or the former attorney general?” Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asked. “I can assure all Canadians — that unlike the leader of the opposition — we will always stand up for good jobs right across this country every step of the way while making sure we respect the independence of the judicial system,” Trudeau said.

It didn’t answer the question and it would be shocking news to the truckers and farmers parked outside the House of Commons for a second day calling on the government to help the oil industry.

Time and again Trudeau was asked by Scheer if he had expressed support for a deal to Wilson-Raybould during his discussions with her, each time Trudeau reverted to talking points that avoided the question.

Scheer called it “very telling” that Trudeau would not answer, saying this was not how an innocent person acts.

Liberal caucus united?

Liberal MPs left their weekly caucus meeting claiming to be united but the sales job wasn’t always convincing.

The Liberals were holding their first caucus meeting since the SNC-Lavalin controversy rocked the government with claims of obstruction of justice, the resignation of a cabinet minister and the departure of the prime minister’s top advisor.

“Very respectful,” said Liberal MP Marc Miller when asked about the reception Wilson-Raybould received in caucus.

Veteran MP John McKay sounded like a kid that had been ordered to eat his Brussel sprouts as he said, “Everything’s fine,” while leaving the caucus meeting.

“We’re all a team with individuals, it was great,” said MP MaryAnn Mihychuk.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel Erskine-Smith called it an “ongoing conversation.”

The Trans Mountain project took a step back into reality Friday with the National Energy Board approval that everyone expected.

But it’s still a cancelled pipeline after the disastrous Federal Court of Appeal decision of last Aug 30.

Trans Mountain will be legally extinct until the Trudeau cabinet re-approves it, ostensibly within the 90-day guideline for these decisions.

It’s absurd to imagine the cabinet failing to grant a new certificate, after spending $4.5 billion to buy the whole works from Kinder Morgan.

Cabinet rejection would combine with the SNC-Lavalin fiasco and likely drive the Liberals from office in the federal election this fall. No government can survive two spectacular regional fiascos in the same year.

Approval has to come at some point, obviously.

But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wounded cabinet have a very tricky choice here, and it’s all about election timing.

Under the worst scenario, the cabinet may just let the decision ride until after the election. That would push the construction reboot well into 2020.

The simplest and best solution would be to approve the pipeline by the end of May and get construction moving as quickly as possible.

There would be controversy on the coast, and more legal challenges, but at least the thing would be a fait accompli by federal voting day, likely in October.

The pipeline could well be a fading national issue by then. And the Liberals would win back approval among many westerners.

Premier Rachel Notley doesn’t expect approval within 90 days, but she sure wouldn’t object. Federal approval before her own election would be an NDP bonanza.

A quick approval would take courage and decisive leadership, though. The Liberals don’t show much of either these days.

For one thing, cabinet isn’t bound by this 90-day guideline for approving or rejecting an NEB approval. In fact, it’s usually ignored.

Notley points out that with both Northern Gateway and the first Trans Mountain approval, the gap between NEB approval and cabinet certificates was about six months.

Federal sources suggest there’s hope of getting this one done within the guideline. It’s less complicated because this is the second round and many details are already decided.

But the feds also won’t specifically promise to decide within 90 days because that would suggest there’s a cutoff date for Indigenous consultation.

That impression helped bring down the first approval. So they’re avoiding any hint of a deadline.

Notley is probably right, then — federal response to the NEB, and work on the First Nations engagement, could extend well beyond the 90-day period that began Friday.

She doesn’t see that as a threat to cabinet approval that would allow construction to start again by fall.

But then, she’s a self-professed optimist. You must be, to see the Liberals making a highly contentious decision that benefits Alberta with an election very close.

Trudeau’s federal caucus and cabinet are not entirely united on the pipeline. The more ardent climate-change activists don’t like it at all. From the moment the Liberals were elected in 2015, it was obvious that some key players don’t even like to talk about the project.

Related

That same crew (including Finance Minister Bill Morneau) were then forced to buy the project when Kinder Morgan threatened to pull out.

Having done that, and then swallowing the federal court rejection, can we really imagine the Liberals staking their electoral survival on the pipeline?

But they must. This is hugely important to a country that has already lost $100 billion in resource investment, according to the C.D. Howe Institute.

As another PM once said, roll the dice. Approval no later than June, construction starting in late summer.

Go ahead, Liberals. Amaze Alberta.

Two capital cities, two raging scandals.

In Ottawa, the SNC-Lavalin affair is producing steady eruptions of bad news for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

And in Victoria, Speaker Darry Plecas keeps swinging his political wrecking ball in the shocking legislature spending scandal.

Both could get even wilder and crazier in the days ahead, with immediate impacts set to be felt in the crucial Burnaby South byelection.

Monday’s byelection battle pits federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh against Liberal candidate Richard Lee.

This one looked like a walk in the proverbial park for Singh after the Liberals’ original candidate, Karen Wang, was replaced for singling out Singh’s South Asian ethnicity in a social-media post.

The Liberals brought in an emergency pinch-hitter in Lee, a former provincial MLA who won four straight elections for the B.C. Liberals.

Ironically, the Wang affair may have actually helped the Liberals because Lee is arguably a better candidate.

But then things went berserk back in Ottawa, where Trudeau’s office was accused of pressuring former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to give a cushy plea-bargain deal to Montreal-based corporation SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal corruption charges.

The timing was perfect for Singh, who demanded a public inquiry.

“Canadians deserve to know if their government is working for them or for a massive corporation with deep ties to the Liberal party,” Singh said.

Will the SNC-Lavalin scandal help Singh beat his Liberal opponent on Monday? He’d better hope so.

If Singh loses — and the Liberals came awfully close to winning the riding less than four years ago — he will likely be forced out as NDP leader with a federal election looming in the fall.

Lee has tiptoed carefully around the SNC-Lavalin affair, avoiding direct comments while insisting he stands for clean, honest government.

“I believe in transparent, better politics,” Lee said.

On paper, Singh should finally win a seat in the House of Commons Monday. In reality, he is in tough, in a riding where he’s seen as an outsider from Ontario.

Ironically, many Liberals might be secretly hoping Singh wins the byelection and continues his uninspiring leadership of the NDP, which is trailing badly in national polls.

But, even if they still have Singh to kick around, the SNC-Lavalin affair is still damaging Trudeau.

The drama has unfolded in the worst possible way for the prime minister and his Liberal government: A daily drip-by-drip series of damaging revelations. And the worst could be yet to come.

Wilson-Raybould is now set to testify in front of the federal justice committee. Her appearance could come as early as Monday, at the same time Burnaby South voters are heading to the polls.

What will the former AG have to say? She has so far refused to comment, insisting her former role as the country’s top lawyer prevents her from speaking because of solicitor-client confidentiality.

She clearly wants to tell her story. Ottawa is awash in whispers that she already told cabinet colleagues that she was pushed to give SNC-Lavalin a get-out-of-jail-free card.

If Wilson-Raybould tells the committee this week that she was inappropriately pressured to let a Liberal-linked company off the hook on criminal charges, Trudeau’s troubles are going to deepen.

In Victoria, meanwhile, the Darryl Plecas Show continues to shake the people’s house to its foundations.

Last week, the Speaker released yet another report on the legislature spending scandal, insisting suspended officials Craig James and Gary Lenz took lavish “business” trips that were more like vacations.

A trip to study earthquake preparedness was really a whale-watching adventure, Plecas wrote, while a getaway to Seattle to review “emergency evacuation procedures” at Safeco Field turned into a group outing to a Seattle Mariners baseball game.

“What in fact appears to be the case is that their extensive ‘work’ travels served as their de facto holidays,” Plecas wrote.

The sour cherry on top of this rotten sundae for taxpayers? Plecas said James and Lenz routinely demanded cash payouts for their vacation time, insisting they didn’t take holidays.

Where does it all go from here? The all-party committee that “manages” your money at the legislature voted last week to bring in a retired judge to review the whole stinking mess.

Alan Mullen, the Speaker’s chief of staff, said he expects the former judge to review the findings in a matter of weeks rather than months.

Could that lead to James and Lenz being fired? The two men, who insist they have done nothing wrong and want their jobs back, are currently on paid leave.

“I don’t think the information contained in these reports is leadership,” Mullen said.

“I’m not a member of the house, so it would be inappropriate for me to say whether they should or should not be fired. But as a British Columbian, that’s not leadership.”

Plecas, meanwhile, has no plans to stop swinging his wrecking ball and will issue more reports on wrongdoing at the legislature.

Said Mullen: “We’ve got a job to do and British Columbians are screaming loud and clear, ‘Please don’t stop. Please keep going.’ Oh my goodness, are we going to keep going? That’s a big Yes.”

In this tale of two political cities, don’t expect the drama to end.

Ken Price, father of one of the injured victims, told the media on Friday that a group of families have sent a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The letter requests that the government addresses what they say is a lack of action to curb gun violence.

“Are we going to learn from our experience or are we going to express grief in the moment and move on? We are better than this as a nation,"" the open letter reads. ""We are urging that Canada follow the lead of other like-minded countries such as the UK, Japan and Australia and impose a ban on the private ownership of handguns and military style assault rifles.""

The gathering on Friday marked not only the seven month anniversary of the shooting but also the first time victims and their families rallied together publicly.

On July 22, gunman Faisal Hussain opened fire into crowded restaurants and patios killing 18-year-old Reese Fallon, and 10-year-old Julianna Kozis. Thirteen other people were injured. Investigators say the gunman later killed himself.

Price’s daughter Samantha was on Danforth Avenue eating ice cream with Fallon and a group of friends on the night of the shooting. A bullet pierced Price’s thigh.

Fallon's younger sister, Quinn Fallon, also spoke during the press conference at Danforth Music Hall and said her family now feels ""incomplete.""

""Reese always talked about her future — her future at McMaster [University], becoming a nurse and how many kids she wanted and where she wanted to raise a family,"" she said, adding the pain her family feels is “indescribable.”

""Because of this tragedy, Reese and Julianna will never get to experience a day past that July 22. They both wanted love and peace, not hate or violence,"" she said. Noor Samiei, a friend of Fallon, told CTV Toronto she could never accept Fallon’s death. “It’ll always affect me.”

""We miss Reese and we miss Julianna. We have to live with that,"" Samiei said at the press conference. ""But we don't have to live with the laws that could be changed to help prevent this from happening again.""

Price said “the shootings took the lives of two girls we miss very much,” Price said. “We’re grieving still, every family here still feels affected … however there are some of us who do want to stand up today and say we do need to change.”

He said Canadians have gone through an “unprecedented year” in gun violence, particularly in Toronto. He stressed this wasn’t a “referendum on firearms in general, but on specifically handguns and assault rifles.”

Price said the group was “unanimous” in asking elected officials at all levels of government to advocate for these changes. Several of the family members wore shirts which read “protect kids, not guns.”

'We don’t want this to be you'

“We want to see this country move in this direction. We think it will benefit the country and we think it will prioritize public safety,” Price said. “We don’t want this to be you in the future and we can improve our odds of that not being the case if you’re supportive now.”

On Friday, Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders said their investigation into the shooting had finished but he didn’t say when more information would be released.

Toronto’s city council has already called for a ban on handguns and assault rifles. Mayor John Tory previously sent a letter to the families of the Danforth shooting victims, and that he has also reached out to Trudeau.

The Liberal government is already exploring a potential handgun ban but affected families worry it won’t be enough.

""The families fear that the initiative will fall short of recommending a handgun and assault rifle ban, and they want to ensure they see action,"" the letter states.

Canada’s current firearms legislation doesn’t contain a definition of what constitutes as an assault rifle. But a recent federal government paper on new gun legislation took the definition from the United States Department of Justice, which states: “assault weapons are semi-automatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire.”

Although Canada has long prohibited possession of automatic guns, some semi-automatic firearms are not restricted and can be bought if purchasers obtain a basic possession and acquisition licence.

350,Empty,2019-02-21T13:49:39Z,CANADA’S Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing a difficult election campaign after a new poll saw the scandal-hit leader’s approval ratings plummet.,"Canadians are due to go to the polls in October but Mr Trudeau is battling to maintain his popularity after becoming embroiled in claims his aides pressured former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to ensure construction firm SNC-Lavalin avoided a corruption investigation. The 47-year-old insists there was no wrongdoing but 41 percent of Canadians disagreed with Mr Trudeau in a Leger poll for news agency The Canadian Press. Just 12 percent believed he hadn’t done anything wrong following the allegations which has left his Liberal Party in turmoil. JUSTIN TRUDEAU ROCKED BY CRISIS: WHO IS JODY WILSON-RAYBOULD?

The poll read even worse for Mr Trudeau on a question regarding which party respondents would vote for in the autumn election. Leger found 36 percent of people said they would vote for the opposition Conservative party while 34 percent would support Mr Trudeau’s Liberals. It marks the first time since the 2015 general election the Conservatives have been ahead of the Liberals who were once way out in front in the polls. The results have left Mr Trudeau’s inner team fearing he could be ousted outright or forced into a coalition government in eight months time.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has seen his approval plummet in a new poll

Also worrying for Mr Trudeau was the response to a question on which party’s leader would make the best Prime Minister. Despite receiving the most support, just 26 percent of respondents answered for Mr Trudeau - a seven point nosedive from a similar Leger poll conducted in November last year. Opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer received 21 percent while Green leader Elizabeth May scored eight percent and the New Democratic Party’s Jagmeet Singh gained six percent. Leger’s executive vice president Christian Bourque said the results proved Canadians were increasingly suspicious of their prime minister. Mr Leger told Canadian media: “I think a lot of it leads back to how the prime minister himself has handled the crisis over the last week or so. “He’s not found a way to reassure Canadians or … been clear enough about his involvement, what he said or did not say, so that a lot of Canadians right now are holding it up against him because they don’t know all the ins and outs to make up their own mind.” However Mr Bourque added the polls do not necessarily mean Mr Scheer is destined for victory. He said: “There’s nobody right now that’s capturing the minds and hearts of Canadians and probably explains why voting intentions are so close while we see that the Prime Minister is actually showing signs of weakening in terms of support.”

Mr Trudeau is facing allegations members of his team pressured Jody Wilson-Raybould over corruption

The poll comes as a top Trudeau aide denied suggestions Ms Wilson-Raybould was pressured into using a deferred prosecution agreement to grant SNC-Lavalin a reprieve at an extraordinary Canadian House of Commons justice commitee session. Mr Wernick told lawmakers: “It is my conclusion and my assertion, based on all the information I have, that there was no inappropriate pressure on the minister of justice in this matter.” In yesterday’s committee appearance, Mr Wernick admitted Ms Wilson-Raybould may have felt pressure to “get it right” on SNC-Lavalin and would likely “express concern” about three meetings. The first would be a September 17 meeting she had with Mr Trudeau while the second “is a conversation between the PMO’s staff and her former chief of staff when she was minister of justice on December 18.” Mr Wernick added: “The third is a conversation I had with her in the afternoon of December 19.” The chief public servant said all three meetings were about SNC-Lavalin and in his discussion he explained the “context” and “consequences” a criminal prosecution would have on the Quebec company. He said: “How Ms Wilson-Raybould interprets and perceives those conversations she can tell you next week.”

Mr Werner added: “I can tell you my view very firmly is they were entirely appropriate, lawful, legal.” Mr Trudeau has been hit by a series of resignations from his administration and met with members of his Liberal Party to calm anger about how he is handling the SNC-Lavalin affair. He has dismissed calls for a full public inquiry into claims relating to the Montreal engineering firm’s government contracts in Libya, saying the ethic commissioner has launched a probe into suggestions staff in the Prime Minister’s Office pressured Ms Wilson Raybould when she was justice minister. Wilson-Raybould, who was demoted in a cabinet reshuffle last month, resigned as veterans affairs minister on February 12. She has been invited to speak to the Canadian House of Commons’s justice committee and is currently consulting lawyers as to how much she can reveal on SNC-Lavalin. She defiantly told reporters on Wednesday: “I hope to have the opportunity to speak my truth”. Meanwhile Mr Trudeau’s principal private secretary and close ally Gerald Butts quit on Monday insisting he had not pressured the former Attorney General. Mr Trudeau’s position is not in immediate danger after Wednesday’s three hour clear-the-air meeting with members of his party with one source saying no leadership challenges are being plotted. Mr Trudeau can not be replaced by parliamentary vote of no-confidence in the same way Theresa May fought off a Labour initiated challenge in January as Canadian party leaders are confirmed at formal conventions.

Seven young children, all believed to be from the same family, have died in an early morning house fire in the Canadian city of Halifax, police say.

A man and a woman were also injured in the fire that broke out around 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Tuesday.

Fire crews encountered a blaze that had quickly engulfed the first and second floors of the building.

Police did not identify the victims but CBC News has reported that a Syrian family lived in the destroyed home.

The family had been in Canada for almost a year-and-a-half and had arrived in Halifax about six months ago, Imam Abdallah Yousri told the BBC.

He said the family attended the Ummah Mosque, where the funeral will be held.

Mr Yoursi said the youngest child killed in the fire was just four months old and the oldest was 15.

A Halifax refugee resettlement organisation who sponsored them identified them as the Barho family in a Facebook post.

The father's injuries have been described as ""life-threatening"" and he was in a critical condition.

Authorities say it took about an hour to get the flames under control when fire and emergency services arrived on the scene.

They had been receiving multiple calls of a fire in the residence in Spryfield, Halifax, in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.

The two-storey home appeared completely gutted by the fire.

Halifax authorities confirmed that an investigation into the house fire is under way and said it is too early to speculate on its cause.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among those who offered his condolences.

""Words fail when children are taken from us too soon, especially in circumstances like this,"" he said on Twitter.

""My heart goes out to the survivors of the horrible fire in Halifax this morning, and the loved ones who are mourning this tremendous loss.""

Halifax Mayor Mike Savage also offered words of condolence, saying the community ""is heartbroken and our thoughts are with the loved ones of the family"".

A fundraising campaign has been set up to assist the surviving family members.",Police confirm seven children dead in a house fire in Halifax,BBC News,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47299551

353,Empty,2019-02-24T15:35:00Z,Transport Minister Marc Garneau is warning U.S. lawmakers that Canada will struggle to ratify the new North American trade deal if U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum exports remain in place much longer.,"

The Canadian Press





WASHINGTON -- Parliament will struggle to ratify the new North American trade deal if U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum exports aren't lifted soon, Canada's transport minister warned Sunday during a high-profile gathering of American state lawmakers.

Marc Garneau said time is running out for the federal government to get the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ratified before the House of Commons rises for the summer break, and it remains an open question whether it will happen without the tariffs being lifted.

""This will present us with real challenges as we begin the process of ratification in Canada, and I don't know if we're going to get there,"" Garneau told a free-trade panel during the winter meeting of the National Governors Association in Washington.

""I'm making a plea here to the governors. I'm making a plea here that you bring up with the president of the United States the fact that these tariffs are a serious impediment to us moving forward on what is the best trade deal in the world.""

Larry Kudlow, President Donald Trump's economic adviser and one of Garneau's fellow panellists, acknowledged the tariff issue, which the minister raised multiple times.

""We are hard at work on that to solve that issue,"" Kudlow told Garneau. ""I got the message loud and clear.""

Following the panel, Kudlow struck a positive tone on hopes for finalizing USMCA, but more commonly in Canada as the ""new NAFTA."" He even told a story about how Prime Minister Justin Trudeau embraced him in a hug when the three countries gathered in Argentina last year to sign the deal.

""We've had a great coming together in Argentina,"" he said, recalling the animosity that erupted last spring after the G7 meetings in Quebec, when Trump lashed out at the prime minister on Twitter over comments he made about the ongoing trade talks.

""In Argentina, he came up to me -- this is a true story -- after the USMCA ceremony, he walked across the hall to come up and grab my hand and give me a hug,"" Kudlow said. ""I asked him if we could please turn the page on any of that stuff that happened last spring, and he said, 'Absolutely,' and then we started having some policy discussions.""

Kudlow had his own request of the governors gathered Sunday: to lobby members of Congress to support the agreement, which has received decidedly mixed reviews on Capitol Hill, particularly among Democrats who want to see sharper enforcement teeth for the deal's labour and environmental provisions. A number also oppose extending protection for drug patents by two years.

And afterward, Kudlow urged Canadians to be patient, acknowledging the anxiety the tariffs have caused. Garneau ""mentioned it 13 times in our meeting,"" he joked.

""I acknowledged that he's correct, and that we're working on that, and I believe he knows that,"" Kudlow said. ""We're negotiating for a vote in Congress, and we're negotiating with our friends in Canada and Mexico on that subject.""

Garneau called it ""illogical"" that the White House is using national security to justify the tariffs, which were imposed last May and remain in place despite the signing last year of USMCA.

But he also said Canada would move quickly to approve the agreement once the tariffs are lifted.

""We want to see USMCA ratified in Canada,"" Garneau said. ""If the tariffs on steel and aluminum are removed, Canada will move expeditiously towards ratification of the USMCA; we believe very strongly in it.""

Garneau also said Canada would lift its own tariff countermeasures on $16.6 billion worth of U.S. imports, ""which we know are affecting many American companies.""

Canada's ambassador to the U.S. David MacNaughton said last week he believes the tariffs could be lifted in a matter of weeks, but refused to provide additional details.

Trump ended a Canadian exemption from the tariffs last spring in a move he later acknowledged was a negotiating tactic, and the president has also said the tariffs would be lifted once the deal was signed.

Kudlow was asked why, since the deal was signed late last year in Buenos Aires, the tariffs remain in place and what role they serve.

After a pause, he said: ""It's part of the rules of the game, that's what I'll say.

""There's no animosity, it's just that if you flip switches on and off, you really can't do that ... the steel and aluminum tariff discussion is an integral part of the larger legislative picture discussion, and don't take that negatively. It's actually a positive. We're going to figure it out.""","Tariffs could jeopardize new NAFTA deal in Parliament, Garneau warns - CTV News",Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/tariffs-could-jeopardize-new-nafta-deal-in-parliament-garneau-warns-1.4310267

HALIFAX — Seven children, all members of a Syrian refugee family, died early Tuesday in a fast-moving house fire described as Nova Scotia's deadliest blaze in recent memory.

The children ranged in age from about three months to the mid-teens, according to a woman who lives next door in the suburban Spryfield neighbourhood.

A man and woman who escaped the fire remained in hospital Tuesday afternoon, the man with life-threatening injuries. The woman was expected to survive.

In a brief interview from the hospital, Imam Wael Haridy of the Nova Scotia Islamic Community Centre said the Syrians — whose family name is Barho — had fled that country's civil war.

""We're here in hospital with a desperate mother who lost seven of her kids,"" he said, noting that officials are conducting DNA tests to confirm identities before they can proceed with a traditional Islamic burial process.

""She's saying to us, 'Am I going to get my children back?' ... It's so hard. It's so sad.""

Many people from Halifax's tight-knit Muslim community had gathered at the hospital, he said.

""People want to try to help, but how can we ... how can we provide her with anything?"" said Haridy. ""It's a shock. It's a tragedy.""

The family is among the 1,795 Syrian refugees who have come to Nova Scotia in recent years, including 345 privately sponsored refugees.

Halifax Fire Deputy Chief Dave Meldrum told reporters it was the deadliest fire anyone could remember in the East Coast province.

""Words fail when children are taken from us too soon, especially in circumstances like this,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a tweet.

""My heart goes out to the survivors of the horrible fire in Halifax this morning, and the loved ones who are mourning this tremendous loss.""

Danielle Burt, who lives next door to the Barhos on Quartz Drive, said she heard a loud bang and a woman screaming just after 12:30 a.m. Tuesday.

Burt fled the house with her four children and saw the parents outside in a harrowing scene.

""The mother was on the grass, praying I guess, bowing her hands down, and pulling on my husband's arm to call 911,"" said Burt, her voice breaking.

""She said the kids were inside and the dad was sitting on the steps. I think he had gone back in because he was really burnt. It was just awful.""

Burt said her kids had become good friends with the Barhos children.

""They were just over at our house yesterday,"" she said. ""It's just something out of a horror movie that you just never would wish on anybody.""

Rich Farrell, who lives down the street, said he and other neighbours ran up to the house as soon as the fire broke out to see if they could help. First responders were not yet on scene.

""It's so frightening but in the space of 30 seconds, it went from what looked like a little bit of flame to the whole thing just becoming engulfed,"" said Farrell, standing on his porch on a bitterly cold, sunny day.

""You can't say for sure what happened, but it makes you think about fire safety and what you might be able to do to protect your family.""

The Barhos have been in Canada almost two years, Imam Abdallah Yousri of the Ummah Mosque and Community Centre in Halifax said.

Yousri said the family was from Raqqa, Syria, and originally settled in Elmsdale, north of Halifax. The family moved to Halifax three months ago, he said.

Yousri said the funerals would likely be held Wednesday or Thursday.

""Our entire municipality is heartbroken and our thoughts are with the loved ones of the family,"" Halifax Mayor Mike Savage said in a tweet.

Jennifer Watts, the CEO of the Immigrant Services Association of Nova Scotia, said in an interview that staff members who worked directly with the family teaching English and providing services are heartbroken by the deaths.

""It is very, very sad this has happened ... for the Syrian community here and the wider community in Halifax,"" she said in a telephone interview.

She said the Barhos came to Canada from Syria after being privately sponsored by a Nova Scotia group and they were using the centre's services.

""It's shocking and very sad. It's had an impact on our clients who knew them and on our staff who were working with them,"" she said.

Doug Hadley, a spokesman for the Halifax Regional Centre for Education, said four of the children attended schools in the area — two at Central Spryfield Elementary and two at Rockingstone Heights.

""This is a tremendously difficult day for both school communities,"" he said in an emailed statement.

""We have additional staff in place at both schools to provide support to students. They will provide support on site for as long as necessary.""

The home, which was extensively damaged in the blaze, is situated in a newly built residential neighbourhood.

A neighbour who did not want to be identified told The Canadian Press she was startled awake by screams.

""We heard horrible screams and then got up and saw the flames,"" she said. ""It was horrible. We called 911 but it took a long time to get through because apparently everyone was calling 911 at the same time.""

The fire spread very quickly as they watched, she said.

""It was really scary,"" she said.

""I was nervous it was going to hit the house next door but it didn't. And then the fire crews finally got here, but there were flames shooting out the front of the house, like shooting out the windows. It was horrible.""

When Meldrum was asked why a fire would spread so quickly through a new home, he declined to speak about the nature of the fire in question.

But in general terms, he said: ""New homes are built with light-weight construction. Once fire barriers are penetrated, rapid fire spread is possible in new construction.""

Meldrum said he couldn't comment on whether the home was supplied with natural gas or if it had a barbecue.

Halifax District Fire Chief Mike Blackburn said the fire was very heavy when they arrived, but firefighters were able to ""knock it down"" quickly. He suggested firefighters were deeply affected by what they saw inside the home.

""They'll process this over time but it's very difficult and it's not going to get any easier,"" said Blackburn.

Watts said the immigrant services association was providing trauma counselling to friends and people shaken by the tragedy.

""This is a moment for all of us in our communities to think about reaching out to immigrants and newcomers who don't have all the family and friends in the community and building those relationships ... so that people don't feel alone and disconnected when something like this happens,"" she said.

Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press

Clusters of seven stuffed animals were set on Halifax doorsteps and hundreds gathered after sundown for a moment of silence Wednesday as the city grieved the deaths of the children of a Syrian immigrant family.

All seven of the Barho family’s children, ranging in age from four months to 15 years, perished in a house fire early Tuesday morning in the suburban community of Spryfield. Ebraheim Barho was severely burned while trying to rescue his children and remains critically injured. His wife, Kawthar, survived. Their children were Abdullah, Rana, Hala, Ola, Mohamad, Rola and Ahmad.

Details emerged Wednesday on a possible cause of the fire. Natalie Horne, a spokesperson for the citizens’ group that sponsored the family’s immigration to Canada in 2017, said Ms. Barho told her through a translator that a baseboard heater in the family room had caught fire. Ms. Horne said Ms. Barho had told friends there had been problems with the heater and attempts to repair it.

“What we were told from Kawthar is that she had come downstairs and noticed that the heating register behind the couch was on fire. It then quickly spread to the sofa and from there moved up to the stairs, where the children were sleeping.”

Ms. Barho has family in Lebanon, Ms. Horne said. Her group had been working “with all levels of government” to try to arrange travel for Ms. Barho’s relatives. It is not clear whether visa restrictions will allow them to arrive in time for the children’s mass funeral, which is being planned by a coalition of Halifax imams.

“Not very many communities – if any, in Canada – have had a taste of what we have here,"" Halifax deputy mayor Tony Mancini told The Globe and Mail in an interview. “To have a Syrian refugee family leave their country to come to Canada for a better life – that in itself is so brave. It’s pretty rare in Canada to have seven children. To lose them all, it has touched everyone.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attended the Wednesday night vigil, but did not make any remarks.

Ms. Horne told The Globe Wednesday she had visited the mother in hospital. Ms. Barho told her through a translator that she woke up and went downstairs to the kitchen to get the baby some milk and found the couch on fire. She called her husband to put it out. He could not.

Mr. Mancini said the city will offer any municipal facility deemed suitable to host the funeral, which is expected to be too large for any local mosque. It may be held as early as Friday. The timeline hinges largely on the office of Nova Scotia’s medical examiner, which is conducting its own probe into the cause of the deaths.

Heather Fairbairn, a spokesperson for the medical examiner, said it is unclear how long the investigation will take, but added the office is “working to complete their work as quickly as possible.”

Several efforts to support surviving members of the Barho family are under way. A GoFundMe campaign organized by the Imam Council of Halifax and the Hants East Assisting Refugees Team (HEART) had raised more than $400,000 by 1 a.m. (AT) Wednesday. The goal for the fund was set at $1-million. All of it will be “gifted to the family,” according to a webpage for the fund.

“It’s hard to estimate how much they’ll need to restart their lives,” the page reads. “But we urge Haligonians and the people of Nova Scotia to do their best.”

Caitlin Stanley, a spokesperson for GoFundMe, said that donations were made from at least 10 countries.

Mr. Mancini, the deputy mayor, said the city has been inundated with calls from people asking what they can do to support the Barhos, but there are few answers so far.

“They need to be able to help when someone in the community passes away,” he said. “I grew up in rural Nova Scotia and what did we do? Somebody made a casserole. You knocked on the door, you took out the garbage for the family. We just want to do something.”

Kim McGinn, a group-home worker, used her afternoon break Wednesday to lay a bouquet of white carnations at the curb in front of the Barhos’ burned house. The pile was already thick with stuffed pink bunnies and other toy animals.

“It’s the smallest thing I can do,” she said. “My heart is just broken for this family.”

She watched as fire investigators climbed a ladder to the roofless third floor, where they appeared to examine wires. Behind the house, one investigator used a hoe to dig through frozen ash beside a barbecue. A single pink and purple child’s running shoe sat outside the front door. Across the street, a pile of used blankets remained at the base of a tree of a house where a blue Care Bear was affixed to the porch railing.

Ahead of the evening vigil, Mr. Mancini offered advice for those at a loss for what to do.

“If you’re able, come together and have a moment of silence for this beautiful, beautiful family,” he said.

He also had advice for those grieving from afar.

“If they think about us, just hug the person that they love,” he said. “It doesn’t take much for life to change direction.”

Taking questions from reporters after an event in St. John's today, where he visited the Core Science Facility under construction at Memorial University, Trudeau called Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick an ""extraordinary public servant"" who has served Canada with ""integrity and brilliance.""

Wernick told the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair that he warned Wilson-Raybould — who was justice minister at the time — that there would be economic ""consequences"" from prosecuting SNC-Lavalin, including big job losses. But he maintained that he, Trudeau and officials in the Prime Minister's Office did not impose any inappropriate pressure on the minister.

Asked why Wernick and PMO officials pressed Wilson-Raybould to consider what was at stake in an SNC-Lavalin prosecution — given that the decision had been made already to proceed with that prosecution — Trudeau said the government has a fundamental responsibility to preserve jobs and promote economic growth while respecting the rule of law and an independent judiciary.

""That is something this government has always done,"" he said. ""I would recommend that people pay close heed to the words of the clerk of the Privy Council. His service to this country over decades in the public service leaves him well-positioned to understand what institutions are grounded in, and make sure that we're doing the right things as a government.""

The Public Prosecution Service told SNC-Lavalin on Sept. 4, 2018, that it would not negotiate with the company on a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, which would have applied alternative penalties to avoid criminal proceedings against the Quebec-based global engineering firm on bribery and fraud charges related to contracts in Libya.

Wernick said he called Wilson-Raybould on Dec. 19, 2018, to discuss various issues — including the option of a remediation agreement.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau endorses the testimony of Canada's top public servant, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, in the SNC Lavalin affair during an appearance in St. John's Friday. 0:51

During that call, Wernick said he spoke of the implications of prosecuting the company for employees, suppliers and communities. He said he told Wilson-Raybould that the prime minister and ""a lot of her colleagues"" were anxious about what they were hearing and reading in business media — articles warning that the company could close down or move if criminal proceedings went ahead.

Pressured to 'get it right'

""I am quite sure the minister felt pressured to get it right, and part of my conversation with her on Dec. 19 was conveying context that there were a lot of people worried about what would happen ... the consequences not for her, the consequences for the workers, and the communities and the suppliers,"" he told MPs on Thursday.

Wernick said he did not cross any line in his exchanges with Wilson-Raybould, insisting the conversations were ""lawful and appropriate.""

The justice committee is examining the growing controversy touched off by a Feb. 7 Globe and Mail report that said Trudeau's aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the Justice portfolio.

Wilson-Raybould has remained silent on the issue, citing solicitor-client privilege. This week, she told the House of Commons that privilege is not hers to waive, and she hopes she is able to speak her ""truth.""

Opposition Conservatives and New Democrats have been demanding the prime minister waive privilege so Wilson-Raybould can speak freely when she appears before the committee, which she is expected to do next week.

Wernick said Thursday he doesn't believe Wilson-Raybould is bound by solicitor-client privilege, but Trudeau said again on Friday that there are serious implications at play.

""This is something we do have to take very seriously because it's a fundamental part of our justice system and, indeed, in this case there are two ongoing court cases,"" he said.

Wilson-Raybould's successor, Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti, is reviewing the matter, but has offered no indication of when he could provide advice to the prime minister on privilege.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says waiving solicitor-client privilege is a complicated matter and doesn't want to impact the two ongoing court cases involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair while taking questions from reporters during an appearance in St John's Friday. 1:15

As the controversy around SNC-Lavalin heats up, the company itself is facing headwinds. It reported Friday that it had slashed its dividend by 65 per cent and recorded a fourth-quarter loss of $1.6 billion.

The company said it will now pay a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, compared to its earlier payment of 28.7 cents per share.

'A political hockey game'

SNC-Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce told a news conference today that the company and its current employees have done nothing wrong.

""Our employees are being used as puck in political hockey game,"" he said. ""They don't deserve it and, frankly, we've had enough.""

Bruce said the company requested that the charges against it be ""circumvented"" through a remediation agreement — that it didn't ask for them to be dropped entirely. He argues that a remediation arrangement would be in the public's interest.

The company will ""vigorously defend"" itself in court, Bruce said.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau was asked Friday whether he thinks SNC-Lavalin can survive if the criminal prosecution proceeds.

""I really can't speak about the potential success of any individual business,"" he said in Toronto after meeting with private sector economists. ""I think in the case of SNC-Lavalin, it's an organization that's been very successful over a long period of time and we obviously want to see a business like that, that employs that many Canadians, continue to be successful.""","'Pay heed' to words of top bureacrat on SNC-Lavalin affair, Trudeau says",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-snc-lavalin-privy-council-st-john-s-1.5029516

So, my suggestion for the big political headline of the day:

""Nothing Happened, So I'm Quitting"" — Gerald Butts

Now, Gerry Butts — until Monday Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's principal secretary — is a smart fellow. No denying that. He can be eloquent in person, and loves being the guy who commandeers the discussion with an original take.

But he's going out with a message track so hackneyed and wheezing that it could've been written by the superannuated PR hacks who used to hang around the Press Club bar, when Ottawa still had a Press Club.

'Simply not true'

In a published statement, he indignantly scolded anonymous sources for saying he or Trudeau had pressured the former justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. As though anonymous sources are necessarily dodgy and wrong (they're not).

""I categorically deny the accusation,"" said Butts. He'd acted only with integrity, he declared, always honouring Wilson-Raybould's office. ""I have served the public interest.""

The accusation that he or his staff pressured the attorney general ""is simply not true.""

So, naturally, he has no choice but to resign.

Why? Because ""this accusation exists."" Its very existence, untrue as it is, is forcing out this good public servant.

Then Butts continued: ""It cannot and should not take one moment away from the vital work the prime minister and his office is doing for all Canadians.""

Therefore, ""It is in the best interests of the office and its important work for me to step away.""

In other words, Butts went for the old ""distraction"" ploy.

Well, at least he has lots of company. A few other recent examples:

A year ago, Trudeau's minister of sports and persons with disabilities, Kent Hehr, said he was not leaving cabinet because he had been accused of sexual harassment, but because he'd ""become a distraction."" (Trudeau accepted, saying ""harassment of any kind is unacceptable."")

'He didn't want to be a distraction,' said U.S. President Donald Trump of Scott Pruitt's resignation as chief of the Environmental Protection Agency. (Andrew Harnik/Associated Press)

Remember Scott Pruitt, U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-climate change chief of the Environmental Protection Agency? The guy who travelled first class on questionable trips, used official staff for personal errands and skived money from lobbyists?

He quit last July, but not because of ethics concerns.

""He didn't want to be a distraction,"" said Trump, accepting the resignation.

Ditto Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary accused of using his position for personal gain. Vicious political attacks, he declared, had ""created an unfortunate distraction"" from the president's important work.

Maria Miller, British culture secretary in former prime minister David Cameron's Conservative government, didn't quit in 2014 because she'd padded expenses, but because ""this has become an enormous distraction, and it's not right that I'm detracting from the incredible achievements of this government.""

And so on, and so on.

Now, none of this is to say Butts is a sleaze. I don't know anyone who thinks he is. He's not terribly popular among MPs, but that goes with the job. Trudeau, in accepting his resignation, basically declared his friend a great Canadian.

So why did he have to go?

Butts hasn't confided in me — he prefers to talk about wine and literature over the dinner table — but I'll take a stab at it anyway.

Gerry Butts has been done in, at least partly, by the ethos of identity politics and virtue signaling he himself helped create around our prime minister.

A clear-eyed look at the Raybould-Wilson controversy cannot conclude it is a matter of ""rule of law,"" as opposition critics claim.

Had Wilson-Raybould wished, she could have decreed a deferred prosecution agreement and fines for SNC-Lavalin as punishment for charges of bribing foreign officials. The law itself allows it.

If Trudeau, through Butts, indicated that was his preferred legal outcome, so what? Is the prime minister not allowed to weigh in on a question that affects thousands of Canadian jobs? By suggesting an outcome allowed under the law? That constitutes ""pressure""? And define ""pressure,"" please.

In any case, if there was pressure, it failed. Wilson-Raybould decided not to issue such a decree, which was her prerogative as attorney general.

Legally, the system worked.

Wilson-Raybould's demotion

The sin for which Butts and the prime minister are actually paying is the subsequent demotion of Wilson-Raybould to veterans affairs minister last month.

Wilson-Raybould, by all accounts, was a competent justice minister. She was obviously angry about the demotion, but she's hardly the first competent minister to be demoted, or to be upset about it.

After the Lavalin story broke, Trudeau loyalists put it about that Wilson-Raybould is not a team player, that she is hard to work with, that she berates colleagues, and that she went through four chiefs of staff for a reason. A Liberal staffer I know, a fellow who doesn't shy from discussing the PM's own shortcomings, describes her as ""mean.""

Again, nothing new there. Plenty of competent ministers, Liberal and Conservative, have been unpleasant people. I can name a few dozen. That's politics. A cabinet minister serves at the pleasure of the prime minister and can be demoted for any reason, or no reason at all.

But she is also the first Indigenous woman to hold the post of attorney general. More to the point, she was elevated by a prime minister who holds himself out not just as Canada's most prominent feminist, but as a tattooed champion of Indigenous rights and determined advocate of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples after centuries of oppression.

Set yourself up like that, and happily take bragging rights for trailblazing appointments like Wilson-Raybould's, and you narrow your options down the road. The characterizations of Wilson-Raybould quickly blew back on the PMO, which wound up proclaiming its agreement that such language is racist and sexist.

Justin Trudeau insists Jody Wilson-Raybould was not pressured to steer the corruption and fraud case against SNC-Lavalin away from a courtroom. 2:10

The power of this story, of this ""narrative arc,"" to use a term Trudeau himself is fond of, is the snatching away of Trudeau's feminist/Indigenous advocate mantle by an Indigenous feminist — Trudeau being hoisted by his own moralizing petard.

It's actually a bit like those pious Christian conservative leaders and politicians in the U.S. who get caught soliciting gay sex in a bathroom or smoking meth with a prostitute. The irony is what makes journalists lick their chops.

Wilson-Raybould has handled it beautifully and methodically. She has taken her revenge without saying a public word about the Lavalin affair. Criticism of her leadership skills, however valid such criticism might be, is not on. Were it another minister, or a different prime minister, it would probably be a different calculation. But it's not.

Wilson-Raybould no doubt has an end game, and we'll see it eventually. Maybe she crosses the floor, maybe she decides to become the most influential Indigenous leader in Canadian history. Maybe she'll make history. She has options. And Butts is now roadkill.

But at least he isn't a distraction anymore.

359,Empty,2019-02-25T14:46:09Z,Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer wants Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to appear as a witness at the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair.,"The Trudeau government issued a broad waiver on Monday allowing former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to tell the Commons justice committee details of her conversations with government officials about the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In an order-in-council (OIC) posted online, the government says Wilson-Raybould — ""and any persons who directly participated in discussions with her relating to the exercise of her authority under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin"" — can report to the committee and to the federal ethics commissioner any cabinet confidences ""in any information or communications that were directly discussed with her respecting the exercise of that authority while she held that office.""

The OIC also ""waives ... to the extent they apply, solicitor-client privilege and any other relevant duty of confidentiality to the Government of Canada"" regarding what Wilson-Raybould discussed with other government officials as justice minister ""respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin while she held that office.""

The waiver does not extend, however, to any communications between Wilson-Raybould and the director of public prosecutions on SNC-Lavalin while she was justice minister — ""in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,"" says the text of the order.

The order sets the stage for what could be an extraordinary session of the justice committee. Wilson-Raybould was expected to speak before the committee this week; a time has not yet been set for her appearance.

The justice committee is examining the growing controversy touched off by a Feb. 7 Globe and Mail report that said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin to help the company avoid criminal prosecution on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya — and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the Justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs.

Wilson-Raybould quit cabinet entirely on Feb. 12. She's offered no comment since on the SNC-Lavalin affair or the company's attempts to secure a remediation agreement to avoid criminal prosecution, arguing that she's still bound by solicitor-client confidentiality from her time as federal attorney general.

The OIC clears a few things up in advance of Wilson-Raybould's appearance before the committee. The ex-minister, who said she is ""anxious"" to testify before the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair, wrote to committee chair Liberal MP Anthony Housefather today saying it would be useful for the committee to have an ""authoritative statement"" on the scope of what she can say prior to her appearance.

""I am anxious to appear at the first available time,"" she wrote. ""However, I believe that in advance of my appearance the members of the committee and I should have as much clarity as we can in relation to the possible constraints on the matters about which I may properly testify.""

Wilson-Raybould, who has retained retired Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell as counsel, also requested an extended period of 30 minutes to make an opening statement to the committee.

Under pressure to waive solicitor-client privilege for his former justice minister and attorney general, Trudeau said earlier today Wilson-Raybould would be given leeway to speak.

Earlier today, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau to testify at the committee, insisting Canadians should be outraged by the allegations of political interference in a criminal case.

A motion tabled by the Conservatives said Trudeau should be called to answer questions given his ""alleged direct involvement in a sustained effort to influence SNC-Lavalin's criminal prosecution."" It called on the prime minister to appear at a two-hour televised committee under oath sometime before Mar. 15.

The motion was defeated in the Commons this evening.

During a news conference on Parliament Hill Monday, Scheer described the SNC-Lavalin affair as an unprecedented attempt to alter the course of justice through political interference.

""Politicians don't get to execute our justice system,"" he said.

""What we've seen unfold over the last two weeks is a textbook case of government corruption, with those at the very top of the Prime Minister's Office implicated in what could be the obstruction of justice.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer outlines the motion he will introduce calling on the Prime Minister to appear before the Justice Committee . 1:25

It's rare for a prime minister to appear before a committee.

On Sept. 7, 2006, then-prime minister Stephen Harper appeared before a special committee on Senate reform.

Former prime ministers have occasionally appeared before Commons committee hearings. Former prime minister Paul Martin appeared before a committee on the Kelowna Accord on Nov. 9, 2006 and Brian Mulroney spoke before a committee looking into the Airbus settlement on Dec. 13, 2007.

Last week, Canada's top civil servant Michael Wernick told the justice committee that he warned Wilson-Raybould that there would be economic ""consequences"" from prosecuting SNC-Lavalin, including big job losses. But he maintained that he, Trudeau and officials in the Prime Minister's Office did not impose any inappropriate pressure on the minister.

Trudeau said Friday that Wernick is an ""extraordinary public servant"" who has served Canada with ""integrity and brilliance.""

""I would recommend that people pay close heed to the words of the clerk of the Privy Council,"" the PM said. ""His service to this country over decades in the public service leaves him well-positioned to understand what institutions are grounded in, and make sure that we're doing the right things as a government.""

In September 2018, the government amended the Criminal Code to allow for remediation agreements, enabling prosecutors to use them as an alternative to a criminal trial ""at their discretion to address specified economic crimes if they consider it to be in the public interest and appropriate in the circumstances,"" according to the Department of Justice website.

If the accused organization upholds the terms and conditions of the agreement, charges can be stayed and a criminal prosecution avoided.

Shawcross doctrine

According to the government website, the purpose of remediation agreements is to denounce wrongdoing and hold the organization to account, while reducing harm to innocent employees, shareholders and other third parties. The organization would have to accept responsibility for the wrongdoing and pay a financial penalty.

In the case of SNC-Lavalin, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada opted not to pursue a remediation agreement and chose instead to proceed with prosecution. It advised the company of that decision on Sept. 4, 2018.

Wilson-Raybould, as attorney general at the time, had authority to override the decision and halt prosecution. Wernick confirmed last week several meetings were held on the topic — including a telephone call on Dec. 19 he initiated, during which he warned Wilson-Raybould of the economic consequences of prosecuting a company that employs about 9,000 people.

He insisted there was never ""inappropriate"" interference.

According to the so-called Shawcross doctrine, the attorney general must consider the impact of prosecution on the public interest. The attorney general can consult with cabinet colleagues, but those discussions are limited to hearing advice, not receiving directions.

Delay advising investors

Arguing in favour of calling Trudeau to speak to the committee, Conservative justice critic and deputy leader Lisa Raitt said it's in the public interest to have the prime minister testify in order to bring together the various threads of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Raitt also asked why SNC-Lavalin was told of the prosecutor's decision on Sept. 4 but didn't disclose that information to its shareholders until Oct. 10.

""Who in the Prime Minister's Office, what cabinet minister, or even did the prime minister give assurances to SNC-Lavalin that they would not have to disclose a material fact to their shareholders because they were going to sort it all out?"" she asked.

Five legal experts appeared before the committee today; some couched their comments by saying they don't have all the facts yet.

Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond is a senior associate counsel at Woodward and Company LLP and a professor at the Peter Allard School of Law, University of British Columbia. She told the committee the law imposes limits on anyone trying to influence an attorney general acting in the role of chief prosecutor.

'Crisis' in rule of law

""Those engaging in that must point to lawful authority that actually backs up their actions, and I would say the Shawcross doctrine is a flimsy authority,"" she said.

Turpel-Lafond said she believes it's important to hear from all of those involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair, not just Wilson-Raybould, because the situation is escalating to the level of a ""crisis in the rule of law.""

She said the RCMP integrity unit could investigate the matter — if it isn't doing so already — to determine if there was a ""subtext"" to the discussions between various officials and Wilson-Raybould regarding the criminal prosecution.

""If there's evidence that a prosecutor is fired and there was an attempt to influence or direct her attention to something that didn't have lawful authority, then it does raise the spectre of obstruction of justice, because obstruction of justice requires this sort of fear-favour element,"" she said.

Maxime St-Hilaire, associate professor at the Faculty of Law, Université de Sherbrooke, said he finds it difficult to understand how information conveyed to an attorney general would be useful after a decision had been made to not overturn a prosecution.

""If there are cabinet discussions after that decision has been made, then I find that quite difficult to understand,"" he said.

Wendy Berman, lawyer and partner at Cassels Brock and Blackwell, explained the role of remediation agreements, noting they can take several years and are meant to prevent situations where companies might ""wither away"" and cause collateral damage.",Scheer wants Trudeau to testify on SNC-Lavalin affair,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/scheer-snc-lavalin-trudeau-1.5032214

""There are seven fatalities resulting from the incident,"" police in the Atlantic seaboard city said on Tuesday.

""All deceased are believed to be young children from the same family. A woman and a man remain in hospital.""

Police said that the man had ""life-threatening"" injuries.

Canadian media reported that the children were aged between four months and 15 years.

The family moved to Canada in 2017 as refugees from Raqqa, Syria and had lived in their home in the province of Nova Scotia for about five months, according to local news reports.

Fire quickly engulfed the house after it started at around 12:30 am on Tuesday. An investigation into the fire's cause is under way and could take months to complete.

The children's father, 39-year-old Ebraheim Barho remains in hospital in critical condition along with their mother Kawthar al-Hamad, 40.

Neighbour Danielle Burt told Canadian media that she heard a woman screaming and jumped out of bed.

""I heard a huge bang, and I was laying in bed with my daughter, followed by a woman screaming, so I jumped up out of bed and looked out the back window and all I could see was flames shooting out from the back door going out onto their deck,"" she said.

""It happened all so fast. The house went up really quickly.""

Burt said she grabbed her four children, ran outside, where she met the parents and called 911.

""[Kawthar] said that their kids were inside. The dad was sitting on the steps. I think he had gone back in because he was really burned,"" Burt told Canadian CTV news. ""It was just awful.""

Another neighbour says he called 911 and rushed over to help but says there wasn’t much they could do as the flames took over very quickly. A photo from the back of the house shows the devastating damage. pic.twitter.com/G0rPzNAEep — Alicia Draus (@Alicia_Draus) February 19, 2019

Imam Ibrahim al-Shanti of the local Al-Barakah Mosque which the family attended said that the father is facing life-threatening injuries after running back into the house to try to save his children, while the mother is emotionally distressed.

""The mother, you know, she is trying to cope with it,"" Shanti told CBC. ""We all have hopes that they will survive this.""

In a Facebook post, the mosque identified the children as Abdullah, Rana, Hala, Ghala, Mohammed, Rola and Ahmed.

Shanti has launched a GoFundMe campaign for the parents which collected the equivalent of more than $150,000 within one day.

""We need to support them in facing their calamity and help them finding a new shelter and pay for expected expenses,"" the campaign read.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered his condolences on Twitter.

It quoted anonymous sources as saying that Ms Wilson-Raybould was being punished for resisting pressure from someone in the prime minister’s office to drop the prosecution for fraud of SNC -Lavalin, a construction and engineering firm. The company, which is accused of paying bribes in Libya during the rule of Muammar Qaddafi, would have been let off with a fine, the report alleged.

Mr Trudeau denied that he gave such instructions to Ms Wilson-Raybould. Her presence in cabinet, as minister of veterans’ affairs, was proof there was nothing to the story, he said on February 11th.

This is a grievous loss to Mr Trudeau. Mr Butts was a close friend, who helped him lift the Liberals from third-party status to win the election in 2015. Both men no doubt hope that Mr Butts’s departure will calm the controversy before the next election due in October. The Liberals trail behind the Conservatives in the polls.

That seems a vain hope. Mr Butts’s resignation “does not in any way settle this matter”, said Andrew Scheer, the Conservatives’ leader. The scandal has brought Mr Trudeau’s foes together. Conservatives and the New Democrats, a left-leaning opposition party, had already secured investigations by the parliamentary ethics commissioner and the House of Commons justice committee. Now they are demanding a separate independent inquiry into the government’s handling of the SNC -Lavalin case.

The next surprise happened at the Commons justice committee — in the form of an exhortation from Liberals for Wilson-Raybould to come before the MPs and air whatever grievances led to the implosion inside Justin Trudeau’s government. Suddenly it’s a little harder to make this whole saga into a story about a strong-arming Liberal government and a victimized former minister, tantalizing as that tale may be. Liberals themselves, outside the Prime Minister’s Office, seem keen to get to the bottom of the mess that has now cost Justin Trudeau one minister and one principal secretary. Apart from everything else, though, all this activity at cabinet and committee on Tuesday raises another intriguing prospect: has this crisis for Trudeau’s government jolted it into fulfilling the promise to loosen the iron grip of the power in the Prime Minister’s Office? Is Monday’s resignation of Gerald Butts, the principal secretary, an occasion to finally follow through on that old Trudeau promise to dilute the power of the PMO?

Trudeau no doubt has many regrets about how life in government has unfolded, especially lately. But one wonders whether it’s occurred to him that much of what has happened in recent days and weeks would have rolled out very differently — or maybe not at all — if he had actually loosened the power of the PMO, as he once vowed. “One of the things that we’ve seen throughout the past decades in government is the trend toward more control from the Prime Minister’s Office,"" Trudeau said in an interview with CBC’s Peter Mansbridge during the 2015 election campaign. “Actually, it can be traced as far back as my father, who kicked it off in the first place … I actually quite like the symmetry of me being the one who ends that.” In the beginning of Trudeau’s mandate, it looked like he might be handing some power back to ministers. The media was once again given notice of when and where cabinet meetings were taking place — a practice stopped during Stephen Harper’s years. Cabinet ministers actually returned calls from reporters and lobbyists in the capital soon learned that they had to make their pitches to individual ministers and their departments, instead of just focusing all their efforts on the PMO, as they had in the Harper years. Then came the talking points and the terse replies, and rewards for the ministers and staffers who exhibited the most obedient message discipline. Ministers in this Trudeau government don’t hire their own staff, as a rule — they are appointed and shuffled around from time to time by the PMO. This is not a decentralization of power by any stretch. Much of the controversy around Wilson-Raybould’s dramatic exit from cabinet revolves around what pressure was (or was not) being applied to her to approve a plea deal for SNC-Lavalin on fraud and corruption charges.

The pressure is alleged to have come from the PMO — and we should stress “alleged” here, since we only have anonymous reports of such, and on-the-record denials from Trudeau and Butts. But it is undisputedly true that SNC-Lavalin didn’t lobby Wilson-Raybould, according to the lobby registry — it focused a lot of attention on the PMO. As CBC reported in its timeline of the SNC-Lavalin lobbying efforts: “The company’s initial lobbying efforts were focused entirely on the PMO and top economic ministries, even though the lobbyist registry says the meetings were to discuss justice and law enforcement.”

Clearly no one sent the memo to SNC-Lavalin that Ottawa no longer works on the “who you know in the PMO” principle. That’s because it still has — and the people one had to know were Butts and chief of staff Katie Telford. Butts’s departure, as some people were telling me on Tuesday, will be a test of whether the centre can hold in this government, even if Telford remains as a formidable force within the PMO. The more correct question to ask, though, is: should the centre keep holding? The shock and awe that followed the announcement of Butts’s departure from cabinet was confirmation that this PMO is as dominant in this government as it was in Harper’s time — if not more so, and certainly more than was the case during Trudeau’s father’s time. The very fact that people were finding it hard to imagine a world without the hand of the PMO in everything, as personified in Butts, tells us that Trudeau never did get around to undoing what his dad started. It may be too late in this mandate for a culture change in the Trudeau government, but seeing Liberals seizing some power to take back this story at cabinet and committee on Tuesday may tell us that some of the reins are being loosened, at least temporarily.

While Jody Wilson-Raybould’s split with the Prime Minister’s Office is not apparently linked to any leadership ambitions, it is abundantly clear now that the former justice minister is driving the bus in this whole saga over SNC-Lavalin .

Once again, without uttering a word about the specific grievances, Raybould is forcing everyone around her to react. Last week, she managed to get a hearing from cabinet and caucus — and this of course came after the resignation of Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts.

On Monday, on the eve of her much-anticipated appearance at the Commons justice committee, Raybould demurred, issuing instead a long letter setting out the conditions under which she intended to speak.

So while Wilson-Raybould is not the leader or even a would-be leader of her party, she definitely has forced Liberals to follow her — if only to try to anticipate her next move.

That’s pretty impressive clout for a rookie politician, new to cabinet and government a little over three years ago and a relative newcomer to the Liberal party.

When Lucien Bouchard left Brian Mulroney’s cabinet in 1990, that Conservative government carried on without him. Ditto for Paul Martin’s exit from Jean Chretien’s cabinet in 2003. Damage was done in both cases, certainly in the long term, but neither prime minister seemed overly concerned with keeping the departed minister in the fold.

In fact, it’s difficult to remember any other politician who retained the power to keep dictating rules of engagement to a Prime Minister’s Office after leaving cabinet.

Trudeau’s reaction to this whole saga has been curious. For several days after the story of Wilson-Raybould’s grievances about SNC-Lavalin first broke in The Globe and Mail earlier this month, the prime minister did not speak to her.

Then he spoke to her a couple of times in Vancouver and seemed to be confident she would stay in cabinet — until she quit, hours later. He apologized to her behind the closed door of the cabinet room last Wednesday, only to have her stand up in the Commons and warn that she was waiting a chance to “speak my truth.”

Late last year, Trudeau was asked in one of his year-end interviews to sum up U.S. President Donald Trump in a word. “Unpredictable,” Trudeau replied, which summed up a lot of things, especially his disciplined silence in the face of Trump’s trade-related tantrum after the G-7 meeting in Charlevoix last June.

In the end, Canada and the U.S. did end up signing a new trade deal a few months later and Trump stopped calling Trudeau and Canada names on his angry Twitter feeds.

Trump’s unpredictability isn’t Trudeau’s biggest problem now — Wilson-Raybould’s is. But when you think about it, the prime minister is handling them the same way, which is probably a mistake.

Trudeau’s strategy on Trump, distilled to its essence, was basically this: say nothing, don’t rise to the bait and fan out to seek allies and experts while the situation cools down. A similar strategy seems to be under way now, inasmuch as the Trudeau government’s response can be called a strategy.

But Wilson-Raybould’s disaffection with Trudeau and how she’s been treated is looking far more methodical than Trump’s episodic outrage of last year.

What’s more, in Trump’s case, Trudeau could count on most of Canada to be on his side. With some exceptions, Canadians were more likely to stick up for their prime minister in any battle with the unpredictable Trump.

This confident streak — maybe overconfident streak — is at the nub of the Wilson-Raybould saga now. It is striking to see the ways in which Trudeau and his team have just left the slate blank in this whole tale, banking on the conviction that Canadians will give them the benefit of the doubt.

Each day in the Commons, this is basically what Trudeau says — that Canadians know his government is balancing concern for jobs and the law. “Trust us,” he says, while the government fans out, looking for experts and allies to attest to Trudeau’s integrity and hoping that the mess will go away.

Sometimes scandals do blow themselves out; sometimes ministers — or angry presidents — just go away, and governments carry on in their absence.

Nothing in this nearly three-week-old saga over Wilson-Raybould and SNC-Lavalin gives any indication of following that pattern. Trudeau and his government aren’t leading themselves out of the controversy — they’re following and reacting — and Wilson-Raybould is doing the leading.

This is a grievous loss to Mr Trudeau. Mr Butts was a close friend, who helped him lift the Liberals from third-party status to win the election in 2015. Both men no doubt hope that Mr Butts’s departure will calm the controversy before the next election due in October. The Liberals trail behind the Conservatives in the polls.

That seems a vain hope. Mr Butts’s resignation “does not in any way settle this matter”, said Andrew Scheer, the Conservatives’ leader. The scandal has brought Mr Trudeau’s foes together. Conservatives and the New Democrats, a left-leaning opposition party, had already secured investigations by the parliamentary ethics commissioner and the House of Commons justice committee. Now they are demanding a separate independent inquiry into the government’s handling of the SNC -Lavalin case.

This was never going to be an easy year for Mr Trudeau. Canada’s relations with the United States are tense.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government ordered a review of the Trans Mountain Project taking into account its impact on killer whales after the Federal Court of Appeal blocked it over concerns for the marine mammals.

The National Energy Board (NEB) said the project would have ""significant adverse environmental effects"" on the whales and an oil spill could have equally horrendous impacts on the marine environment.

But it concluded ""that they can be justified in the circumstances, in light of the considerable benefits of the project and measures to mitigate the effects.""

The federal government has 90 days to decide whether to give final approval for the project, but has signaled it may delay until after a general election in October.

The expansion of the 715-mile (1,150-kilometer) pipeline was to move 890,000 barrels of oil a day from landlocked Alberta province to the Pacific coast, replacing a smaller crumbling conduit built in 1953.

The Trudeau administration approved the project in 2016 after an initial environmental review, saying it was in the ""national interest"" to ease Canada's reliance on the US market and get a better price for its crude oil.

The pipeline has faced opposition from environmentalists and indigenous tribes (protest pictured March 2018) worried that increased shipping from a mraine terminal in Vancouver would impede the recovery of the local killer whale population

But it has faced opposition from environmentalists and indigenous tribes worried that increased shipping from a marine terminal in Vancouver would impede the recovery of local killer whale populations.

Ottawa bought the project for Can$4.5 billion (US$3.5 billion) in August, effectively nationalizing it in a bid to bring a swift end to legal challenges and protests at construction sites.

But on the same day, the Federal Court of Appeal ordered ministers to take a second look at the project, taking greater care to consult with indigenous tribes and consider marine traffic impacts.

Opponents of the pipeline said Friday the NEB recommendations do not satisfy their concerns, and vowed to continue their fight against it.

After Trudeau’s Liberal government used its parliamentary majority Wednesday to defeat the idea of a swift judicial inquiry into allegations the PMO pressured Wilson-Raybould, the woman at the heart of the political firestorm rose to say she abstained from the vote because she did not think it “appropriate for me to vote on a matter that has to do with me personally.” “I understand fully that Canadians want to know the truth and want transparency,” she said. “Privilege and confidentiality are not mine to waive and I hope I have the opportunity to speak my truth.” Wilson-Raybould again abstained on the main vote when Liberals defeated the NDP’s motion 160-134, and again addressed the Commons, explaining she didn’t cast a vote because the matter “deals with me personally.”

Opposition MPs erupted in cheers and demands that the prime minister’s vote not count because of his own perceived conflict of interest. The PMO stands accused of pressuring Wilson-Raybould to cut a deal to allow SNC-Lavalin to escape conviction on criminal charges, which would prevent it from bidding on federal contracts. Trudeau voted against an inquiry, but Liberal MPs Nathaniel Erskine-Smith (Beaches-East York) and Wayne Long (Saint John-Rothesay) voted with the NDP and Conservatives. The defeat puts a bigger spotlight on the workings of the Commons justice committee, which begins to hear witnesses Thursday, starting with Justice Minister David Lametti. The Opposition has already called it an exercise in stonewalling after Liberals on the committee blocked efforts to hear testimony from Gerald Butts, who abruptly resigned as Trudeau’s principal secretary on Monday. Wilson-Raybould is likely to appear before the committee next week but suggested she may not be able to reveal much of substance unless the government waives its solicitor-client privilege.

NDP Charlie Angus charged that Wilson-Raybould continues to be gagged by Trudeau. “She said that she wanted to speak the truth but she was unable to speak,” he said after the vote. “There’s a gag order on the former justice minister. She’s unable to do her work and the prime minister is shutting down an independent inquiry.”

Wilson-Raybould has maintained a public silence about whether anyone in the PMO pressed her to intervene in the bribery and fraud trial of SNC-Lavalin. She spoke in private to her former cabinet colleagues on Tuesday, and to the Liberal caucus on Wednesday. Some of her former cabinet colleagues say their concerns are allayed, however two Liberal caucus sources said MPs are still in the dark about what Wilson-Raybould’s “truth” is. That’s because she also told fellow MPs she was unable to speak due to solicitor-client privilege. Opposition members are charging that the Liberal government is engaged in “damage control” and a coverup. Trudeau rejected the Opposition accusations, telling reporters he allowed Wilson-Raybould to address cabinet in private on Tuesday because “I think it’s extremely important that everyone have an opportunity to hear the different perspectives in this situation.” But he faced a grilling in the House of Commons as Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer demanded to know why Trudeau met with his then-attorney general about the SNC-Lavalin matter on Sept. 17, given that the independent director of public prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, had already informed the company two weeks prior that she would not negotiate a remediation deal with the company. “Was the Prime Minister aware of Canada's top prosecutor's decision when he had the meeting with the former attorney general, yes or no?” said Scheer, who later accused the prime minister of hiding behind “talking points.” Trudeau did not directly respond to Scheer’s challenges, saying only that his government would always protect jobs and the independence of the justice system. He cited cabinet confidentiality for refusing to reveal anything about his meetings with Wilson-Raybould. He said he is awaiting advice from Lametti, the current justice minister, about how much can be publicly discussed yet warned against potential “unintended consequences” of any disclosures on two ongoing court cases involving SNC-Lavalin. The Globe and Mail newspaper on Feb. 7 quoted unnamed sources saying Wilson-Raybould refused to bow to PMO pressure to direct the director of public prosecutions to cut SNC-Lavalin a deal that would see it escape a criminal conviction on bribery and fraud charges. The report suggested that was the reason Wilson-Raybould was shuffled out of the justice minister’s job in mid-January. Trudeau said she was not “directed” or pressured in any way to intervene. Wilson-Raybould has thus far refused to confirm or deny Trudeau’s claim that there was no political pressure put on her to offer a deferred prosecution to SNC-Lavalin. The prime minister has said that he told her on Sept. 17 any decision on a “deferred prosecution agreement” was hers alone — a conversation that occurred two weeks after the director of public prosecutions first advised SNC-Lavalin’s lawyer on Sept. 4 that she would not issue an invitation to negotiate a remediation agreement. SNC-Lavalin began actively reaching out to the prosecutor’s office last April shortly after the Liberal government first introduced a proposal to establish the “deferred prosecution” regime, and even before the new legal provisions for such deals took effect on Sept. 21. The director of public prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, advised the company again on Oct. 9 that she rejected its repeated request to negotiate a remediation agreement, as well as its request for a face-to-face meeting with SNC-Lavalin lawyers and CEO. Trudeau and Butts admit they each spoke to Wilson-Raybould about the SNC-Lavalin request that the attorney-general enter negotiations toward a “remediation agreement” that would spare the company the consequences of a criminal conviction while requiring it to pay a fine and agree to a corporate compliance regime. A conviction would limit the company’s ability to bid on federal contracts. Tonda MacCharles is an Ottawa-based reporter covering federal politics.

367,Empty,2019-02-22T17:24:30Z,"As UFC legend Georges St-Pierre retires from mixed martial arts, BBC Sport explores why he is the sport's greatest of all time.","Georges St-Pierre is considered a national hero in Canada

Former UFC welterweight champion and middleweight title holder Georges St-Pierre officially retired from mixed martial arts on Thursday.

He is one of only six UFC fighters to have held titles in multiple weight classes having also been welterweight champion for 2,204 days and won 26 of his 28 fights from 2002-17.

But what kind of legacy does the 37-year-old Canadian leave?

Here are five reasons he should be considered MMA's greatest of all time.

Champion's mentality

Throughout the 28 fights of his MMA career, St-Pierre displayed the heart of a true champion with his ability to not only go to the proverbial well to get the victory, but also by beating rivals at their own game.

He out-grappled Matt Hughes, Matt Serra and Jon Fitch, just like he out-struck Josh Koscheck, BJ Penn and Nick Diaz.

He went to war with Carlos Condit and Johnny Hendricks, and conclusively avenged the two losses he suffered inside the octagon.

Between 2007 and 2013 he dominated his weight class, defeating every leading welterweight contender the world could offer.

Even four years away from competition couldn't stop him from weathering a storm to choke out Michael Bisping in November 2017 and add a second weight-class world title to his incredible legacy.

A true martial artist

St-Pierre dedicated his life to martial arts and reaped the rewards.

In a sport, prior to GSP, littered with tough-talking street-fighting men, and more recently, with athletes as focused on the celebrity and entertainment aspect of prize-fighting as they are on training, St-Pierre bucked the trend.

He was always a true professional. Respectful, strategic and athletic, his behaviour was more reminiscent of the characters in the Bruce Lee or Jean-Claude Van Damme movies he adored than that of an overly aggressive, cauliflower-eared, toothless warrior.

Throughout his career, St-Pierre also searched out the best possible coaching to further his lifetime of marital arts education.

His journey took him to Renzo Gracie's in New York, Greg Jackson's in New Mexico, onto the mats with Muay Thai master Phil Nurse, the boxing ring with iconic coach Freddie Roach and, of course, he forged a long-time partnership with head coach Firas Zahabi.

He was always ahead of the curve, too, employing a sports psychologist early on in his title reign to stay on top.

A national hero

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted on Twitter following St-Pierre's retirement

When Bisping retired last year, where was the reaction and tribute from British prime minister Theresa May? Likely she has never heard of MMA, the UFC or 'The Count'.

In Canada, however, GSP's career achievements enthralled the nation.

He was voted Canadian Athlete of the Year three times in a row between 2008-2010, and when he announced to the world he was walking away from the sport, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was one of the first dignitaries to take to social media to offer his admiration.

When he fought Jake Shields in April 2011, GSP proved he also didn't necessarily need the right dance partner to sell tickets, when 55,724 fans (the second biggest gate in UFC history) packed into the Rogers Centre in Toronto in to watch their hero retain his belt.

He makes his own rules

Long before Conor McGregor became the breakout superstar he is, there was another pay-per-view champion in the UFC who wasn't afraid to push back at the top brass.

When you get to the big show, most fighters are all about the three letters - UFC. But St-Pierre had three of his own that were always given priority - GSP. Once he was established as champion, he only took fights when he was ready.

He knew his worth, would push back on contract deals and danced by his own tune. He never swerved anybody, but he never took fights that weren't for the benefit of his own brand either.

He returned last year, beat Bisping and walked away from the 185lb belt. His terms. And that is part of the reason he quit for good this week.

He would have liked to face lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, the unbeaten Russian who rag-dolled McGregor back in October. But having St-Pierre end the unbeaten reign of a fighter starting out on his PPV journey didn't appeal to the UFC.

After all, St-Pierre would only of likely stuck around for a Conor superfight in victory. Again, always on St-Pierre's terms.

He kept it clean

Long before the UFC partnered up with the US Anti-Doping Agency and employed Jeff Novitzky in a defiant move to clean up MMA, St-Pierre campaigned long and hard for a cleaner sport.

He even walked away from the octagon at one stage in protest at the lack of testing. And while that may not, on the face of it, seem relative to his GOAT potential, his legacy is untarnished. The same cannot be said of his two most decorated rivals.

Anderson Silva, a long-time potential crossover opponent for GSP, and the incredibly gifted Jon 'Bones' Jones both have comparable skill-sets, dominant title reigns and a similar long list of acclaimed opponents inside the octagon.

Yet both of their careers are now stained with multiple drug test failures. St-Pierre has never failed a test. He has never cheated, cut corners or broken the martial arts code of conduct.

368,Empty,2019-02-25T21:13:47Z,"Former justice minister says she is “anxious to appear at the first available time,” but remains constrained by what she say by solicitor-client privilege, cabinet confidence and ongoing cases still before the courts.","“It may well be that we have a situation where we have a prosecutor that was removed from her role, as opposed to an attorney general that should have resigned,” Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a former Saskatchewan provincial court judge, told the Commons justice committee.

OTTAWA—Discussions the Prime Minister’s Office had with former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould about criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin are “troubling,” lack a strong legal justification and may have led to her being “fired,” a respected jurist said Monday.

The director of public prosecutions decided last fall to proceed with criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin, rejecting the company’s request for a remediation agreement that would have spared it a conviction and, with it, a 10-year ban on government contracts.

“Perhaps this is an instance where a prosecutor was actually fired for establishing a boundary that was not popular or accepted. I’m not sure of that. I think there is some suspicion and concern here about that.”

“In fact, prosecutors should not resign. Lead prosecutors, when they’ve taken a decision, should hold firm to their position and that is consistent with the rule of law,” Turpel-Lafond said.

Now those interventions are in the spotlight amid questions whether lines were crossed.

Wilson-Raybould appears to have stuck by that decision in the face of meetings with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s senior aides and the top civil servant, despite concerns about the future of the Quebec company if the charges went ahead.

Turpel-Lafond, who currently practises law and teaches in Victoria, expressed serious doubts about the government’s claim — articulated by Wilson-Raybould’s successor, David Lametti, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick and Liberal MPs — that officials are permitted to hold robust discussions with an attorney general under the so-called Shawcross Doctrine.

Once a decision is made to pursue a prosecution, there is “limited authority for anyone to intervene at that decision point and going forward,” Turpel-Lafond said.

She said if the talks went beyond a “more passive and respectful approach,” and the purpose “was to persuade the attorney general as prosecutor to take a different position on a prosecution, it triggers a serious rule-of-law concern.”

And she cast doubt on Lametti’s and Wernick’s assertions that the decision to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin is one that still remains open to the attorney general, even with the preliminary inquiry underway.

She said there should be a “full” airing of what was said to Wilson-Raybould, adding it would be something she’d expect the RCMP’s sensitive investigations or “integrity” section would already be looking into.

Two other legal experts agreed that the Shawcross Doctrine — a concept imported from the United Kingdom — does not justify any pressure put on an attorney general to make or change a prosecutorial decision.

That decision, they said, is the attorney general’s alone to make.

“The attorney general should not be put under pressure by colleagues and in particular should not be put under partisan political pressure,” said Mary Condon, interim dean of Osgoode Hall Law School.

Maxime St-Hilaire, an associate law professor at the University of Sherbrooke, said the clear line would be better drawn if Canada’s attorney general did not also serve as justice minister inside a federal cabinet.

Trudeau told the House of Commons he would partially lift confidentiality obligations on his former attorney general so she can testify about allegations that his office was at the centre of what the Opposition says was a “sustained effort” to influence the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Under fire in the House for weeks, Trudeau told question period Monday that Wilson-Raybould would be able to appear at the justice committee and “will be able to address relevant matters at the committee while ensuring that the two active court cases are not jeopardized.”

Monday night, the Trudeau cabinet issued an order-in-council waiving cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege for Wilson-Raybould for discussions she had on SNC-Lavalin, clearing the way for her testimony to the committee.

However, “in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,” the waiver did not extend to communications Wilson-Raybould had with Kathleen Roussel, director of public prosecutions concerning SNC-Lavalin.

It was not entirely clear when her long-awaited appearance will be scheduled, as her expected appearance Tuesday was postponed.

In a letter sent earlier Monday to the committee, Wilson-Raybould stated that she is “anxious to appear at the first available time.”

But she said that she remained constrained by what she can say by solicitor-client privilege, cabinet confidence and the ongoing cases involving SNC-Lavalin still before the courts.

“The government can waive solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence. I cannot, Wilson-Raybould said in her letter to Liberal MP Anthony Housefather, chair of the committee.

She said she wants to delay her testimony until “we all have whatever clarity we can have about these issues.”

When she does appear, Wilson-Raybould said she wants to make an extended opening statement of about 30 minutes to provide “my best recollection of all relevant communications.”

Trudeau has denied he or anyone in his office applied any inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould. She has not yet spoken publicly to confirm or deny the allegation, saying she is bound by solicitor-client privilege.

Late Monday, the Commons voted 155-106 against compelling Trudeau to testify before the committee, as the Conservative and NDP opposition wanted.

The prime minister again defended his actions, telling the Commons that “at every stage,” his government did what it promised Canadians, to stand up for jobs and growth while protecting the rule of law and the independence of the justice system.

“We’ve consistently and continually stood up for the 9,000 jobs at SNC-Lavalin and good jobs right across the country,” Trudeau said.

“That’s exactly what we’ll continue to do and we will continue to do it in a way that ... always respects the rules and norms that govern our institutions.”

SNC-Lavalin and two former employees were charged in 2015 under the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act with one count of bribing former members of the Libyan regime of Muammar Gaddafi, and one count of fraud under the Criminal Code.

The divide is at once simple and complex, logical and emotional—a fiery chasm that threatens to split our staff apart and turn us into brother soldiers on opposite sides of a bloody civil war. So what is the fulcrum? What is the point at which this potentially disastrous schism tips?

As it turns out, hockey.

Some among us believe it to be a peasant's sport, policing colleagues with #TMP (Too Many Pucks) every time an ice-borne story piques their interest. Others are compromised by the thrum of the boards beating ceaselessly in their hearts . No matter what side we choose in the battles to come, however, today, NHL Trade Deadline Day, antagonist and acolyte alike have found ceasefire in perhaps the most gloriously Canadian thing in the history of Canada itself: Canadian prime minister and international heartthrob Justin Trudeau stopping by TSN's trade deadline special to break down all the movers and shakers in the weird, wild world of pucks.

Draft legislation by the Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) has triggered the suspension of 18,000 applications made under existing laws from immigrants seeking to live in the predominantly French-speaking province. The CAQ, which won power in October, has said that the reforms would improve newcomers’ integration into the workforce.

Lawyer group Association québécoise des avocats et avocates en droit de l’immigration asked Quebec Superior Court Justice Frederic Bachand to order the government to process existing newcomers’ applications as the bill is being debated.

“This situation is a catastrophe for us,” said Seeun Park, a nurse and plaintiff in the case who came to Quebec with her two children from South Korea in 2017.

“We already invested a lot of money and efforts end energy to work in Quebec,” she told reporters on Friday outside the courtroom in Montreal.

A spokesman for the province’s immigration minister declined to comment on Friday, saying the matter was before the court.

The CAQ campaigned on a pledge to cut immigration from 50,000 to 40,000 people a year and expel new residents who fail to pass tests on French and Quebec values within three years.

The policy could put Quebec on a collision course with the Liberals of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who are hoping to make gains in the province to offset expected losses elsewhere in a federal election this October.

The group of almost a dozen people were at a morning news conference to make their first public remarks since the deadly rampage last July that left two people dead and 13 wounded.

""What happened to us was a tragedy, and we think we could have had better odds had attitudes toward handgun ownership been different before that night,"" said shooting victim Noor Samiei, who was out with friends celebrating her 18th birthday on the night of the attack.

The group also revealed an open letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and a petition calling for the ban.

Watch: Victims and families of Danforth shooting call for ban on handguns and assault rifles

The group says they would like to see handguns used for sport shooting owned by licensed shooting facilities, and not the people who take part in the activity. 2:02

""We acknowledge that this action is not the only step that needs to be taken to stem gun violence; however, we believe it will be impactful and effective,"" the letter reads.

The news conference coincides with the seven-month anniversary of the attack on an otherwise quiet Sunday evening on July 22 along Danforth Avenue in Toronto's Greektown neighbourhood, in an area also known as the Danforth.

Reese Fallon, 18, of Toronto, and Julianna Kozis, 10, of Markham, Ont., died.

'Are we going to learn?'

The group is calling out a perceived ""lack of action"" by governments to combat gun violence in the aftermath of the shooting.

""We miss Reese and we miss Julianna. We have to live with that, but we don't have to live with the laws that could be changed to help prevent this from happening again,"" Samiei told reporters.

""The pain and loss we feel without Reese and Julianna is indescribable,"" added 15-year-old Quinn Fallon, Reese Fallon's younger sister.

""Because Reese and Julianna don't have a voice anymore, we are doing this in their honour.""

The group says that despite the best intentions of responsible gun owners, too many firearms end up stolen and on streets across the country. They would like to see handguns used for sport shooting owned by licensed shooting facilities, and not the people who take part in the activity.

""Are we going to learn from our experience or are we going to express grief in the moment an move on? We are better than this as a nation,"" the open letter reads.

Ken Price, the father of a surviving victim, called on Canadians to sign a petition supporting the ban. 'We can improve our odds if you are supportive now,' he said. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)

The Liberal government is in the process of exploring the possibility of a national handgun ban.

Bill Blair, minister of border security and organized crime reduction, is touring the country gathering information about the proposed ban, but the Danforth victims and family members worry the government will back off the plan.

""The families fear that the initiative will fall short of recommending a handgun and assault rifle ban, and they want to ensure they see action,"" according to the letter.

Blair is expected to make a recommendation to cabinet this month.

Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders said Friday the investigation into the shooting is now complete. He said the force will release more information about the attack, though he didn't say when.

372,Empty,2019-02-21T15:28:38Z,Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti will be first in the hot seat today as the Commons justice committee begins hearings on the SNC-Lavalin affair.,"Canada's top civil servant insists there was no inappropriate pressure on Jody Wilson-Raybould to override a decision to prosecute SNC-Lavalin, but says he warned her about the dire economic ""consequences"" of criminal proceedings.

In blunt testimony before the justice committee Thursday, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick said he called the then-justice minister and attorney general on Dec. 19, 2018 to discuss various issues — including the option of a remediation agreement that would serve as an alternative to prosecution for the Quebec-based global engineering company, which is facing bribery and fraud charges related to contracts in Libya.

During that call, Wernick said, he spoke of the implications of prosecuting the company for employees, suppliers and communities. He said he told Wilson-Raybould that the prime minister and ""a lot of her colleagues"" were anxious about what they were hearing and reading in business press — articles warning that the company could close down or move if criminal proceedings went ahead.

""I am quite sure the minister felt pressured to get it right, and part of my conversation with her on Dec. 19 was conveying context that there were a lot of people worried about what would happen ... the consequences not for her, the consequences for the workers, and the communities and the suppliers,"" he told MPs probing the scandal now engulfing the Liberal government.

Wernick insisted he did not cross any line in his exchanges with Wilson-Raybould.

""I can tell you with complete assurance that my view of those conversations is that they were within the boundaries of what's lawful and appropriate. I was informing the minister of context. She may have another view of the conversation, but that's something the ethics commissioner could sort out,"" he said.

In the end, Wernick said, the matter may boil down to an interpretation of what constitutes 'pressure'.

""I think the matter may come down to the ethics commissioner's view on a conversation between two people, between what was sent and what was received. And I think the ethics commissioner is the appropriate person to decide what was undue and what was inappropriate,"" he said.

Wernick's extraordinary testimony sets the stage for what could be a fierce rebuttal from Wilson-Raybould, who is expected to appear before the committee early next week.

Michael Wernick the Clerk of the Privy Council spoke to the Commons Justice committee Thursday 0:27

Wernick also attacked the bombshell Feb. 7 Globe and Mail report that touched off the political scandal and triggered the resignation of cabinet minister Wilson-Raybould and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's principal secretary, Gerry Butts.

""I'm here to say to you that the Globe and Mail article contains errors, unfounded speculation and, in some cases, is simply defamatory,"" he said.

The article — citing unnamed, anonymous sources — said that Trudeau's aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the justice portfolio.

Wernick repeatedly denied any undue pressure from Trudeau or any officials in the PMO.

Michael Wernick the Clerk of the Privy Council spoke to the Commons Justice committee on Thursday 3:39

""At every opportunity, verbally and in writing in December, the prime minister made it clear that this was the decision for the minister of justice to take. She was the decision-maker,"" he said.

Wernick, who met with representatives of SNC-Lavalin on Sept. 18, 2018 — after the company had been turned down on its request to avoid criminal proceedings — said the firm was ""making the rounds"" to make a pitch to avoid prosecution. He said he could not remember whether the company advised him that it had been told the Public Prosecution Service of Canada had rejected its request.

Wernick said that if she had felt she was being put under pressure at any point, she could have filed a complaint with the ethics commissioner or reported any perceived wrongdoing to the prime minister.

In his opening remarks to the committee, Wernick said he's worried about the state of politics in Canada right now, citing the threat of foreign interference in the coming election and the use of words like 'treason' and 'traitor' in political discourse.

""Those are the words that lead to assassination,"" he said. ""I'm worried that somebody's going to get shot this year during the political campaign.""

Earlier today, Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti told the committee he has never faced inappropriate pressure from the prime minister or anyone in the PMO, and would take action if any official tried to direct his actions improperly.

‘I'm here to say to you that the Globe and Mail article contains errors, unfounded speculation and, in some cases, is simply defamatory,’ Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council, said. 5:31

Lametti said he would not ""speculate"" on ""what others might or might not do,"" but would only explain how he would respond to political pressure.

""I would take, under the circumstances, a number of different actions,"" he said.

Trudeau appointed Lametti to the post in a January cabinet shuffle that demoted Wilson-Raybould from the Department of Justice to Veterans Affairs.

She resigned from that position a month later, just days after the Globe and Mail reported that she had been pressured by officials in the Prime Minister's Office to stop criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based global engineering and construction firm facing charges of bribery and fraud related to contracts in Libya.

The Globe and Mail said PMO officials pushed her to direct the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to draft a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — a legal tool resembling a plea deal — for SNC-Lavalin.

The Liberal government changed the Criminal Code in 2018 to introduce such remediation agreements as an option for cases of corporate wrongdoing in Canada.

Lametti said the legislative regime was addressing a perceived ""gap"" in the law and is meant to hold corporations to account while protecting bystanders who could be harmed by a criminal prosecution and possible bankruptcy — such as a corporation's employees, subcontractors and third-party suppliers.

Similar compliance tools — which can impose fines in lieu of prosecution — are also available in the U.S. and the U.K.

Lametti said he only had general knowledge of the SNC-Lavalin case before he was appointed to cabinet and did not discuss it with Trudeau before his appointment.

A Globe and Mail report published today says Wilson-Raybould told federal cabinet ministers Tuesday she believed it was improper for PMO officials to press her to help SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution.

Wilson-Raybould took the unprecedented step of requesting permission to address cabinet Tuesday, and was allowed to do so after vigorous debate among ministers.

​Today, Wernick said Lametti exited the meeting during her address to cabinet.

""He saw it right away, the need to recuse, left the room and was not present for that discussion,"" he said.

Polling fallout

The political fallout since the Feb. 7 Globe and Mail report has been heavy for the Trudeau government.

The opposition Conservatives and NDP have called for a public inquiry and have demanded Trudeau waive solicitor-client privilege so Wilson-Raybould can speak freely on the matter during her appearance before the committee, expected sometime next week.

The CBC's Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polls, shows the scandal is taking a toll on the Liberals. It puts the Liberals and Conservatives neck-and-neck in voting intentions and virtually tied in the number of seats each party would be likely to win if an election were held today.

On Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould abstained from a vote in the House of Commons on an NDP motion calling for an inquiry because she was personally involved in the matter. She said she can't waive client-solicitor privilege on her own.

""I understand fully that Canadians want to know the truth and want transparency,"" she said. ""Privilege and confidentiality are not mine to waive, and I hope that I have the opportunity to speak my truth.""

​During an event in Halifax Thursday, Trudeau said he remains ""surprised and disappointed"" by Wilson-Raybould's resignation from cabinet. He cited cabinet confidentiality and said the government is working to create good jobs and protect an independent judiciary.

""We will always do that in the right way,"" he said.

Lametti said the issue of waiving solicitor-client privilege is ""complex and layered."" He said he is seeking a way to ensure transparency and fairness without compromising cabinet confidentiality or legal proceedings, but could not say if he would make a decision before Wilson-Raybould appears at committee.",Canada's top lawyer to testify at committee probing SNC-Lavalin scandal,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/lametti-justice-committee-snc-lavalin-1.5027617

Mr Trudeau’s government has been tainted by allegations first made on February 7 in the Globe and Mail that his officials possibly prevented a criminal prosecution being launched against the Canadian construction company. The allegations concern former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould who was reportedly pressurised to drop trial charges against SNC-Lavalin for bribery and corruption in Libya and to levy a fine instead. Mr Trudeau has denied any involvement or knowledge of the claims.

Mr Scheer is proposing an opposition motion asking MPs to “order the Prime Minister to appear, testify and answer questions at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, under oath, for a televised two-hour meeting, before Friday, March 15, 2019”, as reported by Global News. The publication stated Mr Scheer told reporters on Monday morning: “We are a country of the rule of law and nobody, no matter their status, their wealth or their connections, should be entitled to special treatment under it. “What we’ve seen unfold over the last few weeks is a textbook case of government corruption.” Ms Jody Wilson-Raybould, who has remained silent until now, will appear in front of a House of Commons justice committee on Tuesday.

Their rivals, the Conservatives, were up two points at 36 percent, eight months ahead of the Canadian federal elections.

The top political adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada resigned on Monday, deepening a political crisis over allegations the government tried to interfere in a criminal court case.

In a statement announcing his departure, Gerald Butts, who has been a close friend of Mr. Trudeau’s since their university days, linked his leaving to the allegations that he, the prime minister and others improperly pressured Jody Wilson-Raybould, when she was the justice minister and attorney general, to quash the criminal prosecution of a major Canadian engineering and construction company.

Mr. Butts repeatedly denied in his resignation letter that any such action took place.

“Any accusation that I or the staff put pressure on the attorney general is simply not true,” Mr. Butts wrote. “But the fact is that this accusation exists. It cannot and should not take one moment away from the vital work the prime minister and his office is doing for all Canadians.”

In a statement released Monday, Butts, who directed much of Trudeau’s ideological agenda, directly addressed the scandal.

The statement reads:

Recently, anonymous sources have alleged that I pressured the former attorney general, the Honourable Jody Wilson-Raybould, to assist SNC-Lavalin with being considered for a deferred prosecution agreement. I categorically deny the accusation that I or anyone else in his office pressured Ms. Wilson-Raybould. We honored the unique role of the attorney general. At all times, I and those around me acted with integrity and a singular focus on the best interests of all Canadians.

Butts denied any interference in the SNC-Lavalin matter. (RELATED: Canadians Furious With Attorney General For Objecting To Jury’s Verdict)

Butts continued:

The Prime Minister of Canada’s Office is much larger and more important than any of its staff. I have served it to the best of my abilities, and I have at all times given the Prime Minister free and unfettered advice. I have served the public interest, not the interests of any individual or any narrow private interest of any kind, at any time. Life is full of uncertainties, but I am absolutely certain of that. Any accusation that I or the staff put pressure on the Attorney General is simply not true. Canadians are rightly proud of their public institutions. They should be, because they work. But the fact is that this accusation exists. It cannot and should not take one moment away from the vital work the Prime Minister and his office is doing for all Canadians. My reputation is my responsibility and that is for me to defend. It is in the best interests of the office and its important work for me to step away.

Butts claimed that his “relationship” with Wilson-Raybould “has always been defined by mutual respect, candor and an honest desire to work together.”

The former star cabinet minister, who is Aboriginal, was repeatedly touted by Trudeau as evidence of his government’s commitment to reconciliation with Canada’s First Nations.

377,Empty,2019-02-21T09:00:00Z,The Liberals were on track for re-election at year's end - but the SNC-Lavalin affair has taken its toll on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.,"The fallout from the SNC-Lavalin affair is only beginning to rain down on Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government but it seems to be having an impact — one that could put the Liberals on track to defeat in this fall's federal election.

The controversy surrounding allegations about political interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, a major Quebec-based engineering firm, and the subsequent demotion and resignation from cabinet of former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould (followed by the resignation of the prime minister's principal secretary, Gerry Butts), is evolving on a daily basis.

The first polls published since the Globe and Mail initially reported the allegations on Feb. 7 suggest that the Liberals have taken a significant hit in public support.

The CBC's Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polls, puts the Liberals and Conservatives neck-and-neck in voting intentions and virtually tied in the number of seats each party would be likely to win if an election were held today.

Right now, there's no clear indication of which party would emerge with the most seats in a general election — a significant shift from where things stood at the end of 2018, when the Poll Tracker gave the Liberals a better than 90 per cent chance of winning an election.

For the Liberals, the trend line might only get worse.

Three polls that were conducted entirely after the initial Globe reports emerged have been published in recent days — from Campaign Research (Feb. 7-11), Ipsos/Global News (Feb. 14-18) and Léger/Canadian Press (Feb. 15-19). The last two surveys were conducted after Wilson-Raybould's resignation from cabinet and include some data gathered since Butts stepped down on Monday.

Campaign Research showed the Conservatives ahead with 37 per cent to 32 per cent for the Liberals, while both Ipsos and Léger put the margin at 36 to 34 per cent in the Conservatives' favour. Since December, when both polling firms were last in the field, the Liberals have lost one point in Campaign Research's polling and four percentage points in the Ipsos poll, while the party is down five points since November in the Léger poll.

The Conservatives have gained two to three points over that time.

The only shift that appears statistically significant is the five-point Liberal slide recorded by Léger — but the fact that all three polling firms are picking up similar trends suggests that the swing between the Conservatives and Liberals is real.

SNC-Lavalin wearing on Trudeau

Campaign Research also picked up a drop of four points in Trudeau's own approval rating (to 35 per cent), while Ipsos found the number of respondents saying the Liberals deserve to be re-elected has plummeted eight points since December to 38 per cent.

Léger reports satisfaction with the government is down nine points and Trudeau's own score on Canadians' preference for prime minister is down seven points to 26 per cent. That this drop did not result in any sizeable gain for any of his opponents suggests it's more about Trudeau himself than it is about the performance of any other party leader.

The Léger/Canadian Press poll provides some indications of the impact of the SNC-Lavalin affair in particular. The poll finds that Canadians are paying attention, with 67 per cent reporting some awareness of the story.

Of those with some knowledge of the controversy, 41 per cent agreed with this statement: ""Yes, the prime minister did something wrong."" Only 12 per cent said that the prime minister ""did not do anything wrong.""

Another 41 per cent said that they were ""not sure either way,"" suggesting that many Canadians are still waiting to learn more before coming down on one side or the other. That might be the silver lining here for the Liberals: most Canadians polled either believe the prime minister or are still giving him the benefit of the doubt.

But it also means that if the story generates more negative headlines for the government (and there are few indications so far that it won't), there aren't very many Canadians predisposed to believe the Liberals' side of the story.

Liberals hurting in Quebec, but mostly Ontario

While the impact of the affair has sapped the Liberals in every part of the country, there is a difference between what the polls are saying in the two largest provinces that inevitably will decide the next federal election.

Across the three surveys, the Conservatives made gains in both Ontario and Quebec while the Liberals lost support. (The NDP also is down consistently in Quebec and the Bloc Québécois up, but that was a pre-existing trend that probably has little to do with the SNC-Lavalin affair.)

The swing was more pronounced in Ontario than it was in Quebec, where concerns about the impact of the affair on SNC-Lavalin's future have been more prevalent. The Conservatives gained between three and six points in Ontario in the three surveys, averaging a gain of just under five points. The Liberals lost between three and seven points, for an average loss of just over five points.

Both Ipsos and Léger recorded slides for the Liberals in Ontario sizeable enough to be statistically significant.

Andrew Scheer's Conservative Party has made gains in the polls in Quebec and particularly in Ontario in recent weeks. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)

In Quebec, however, the Conservative gain was only three to four points, with the Liberals dropping two to four — all within what would be the margin of error for probabilistic samples of the sizes surveyed in the province.

The trend is pointing in one direction, which is notable. But so far, the impact in Quebec seems less pronounced. Both Léger and Ipsos still give the Liberals a double-digit lead in Quebec, while the race is now either tied or leaning Conservative in Ontario.

That could have some important electoral implications if the trends hold. As it stands now, the Liberals are still projected to gain seats in Quebec — perhaps about a dozen — but are also on track to lose as many as 30 in Ontario. Even if the Liberal slide in support halts, that alone would make it nearly impossible for Trudeau to secure another majority government in the fall.

Of course, October's federal election is a long way off. The SNC-Lavalin story and the polling trends might change (and change again, and again) between now and then. But based on where the story and the trends are heading now, the Liberals have to hope for a swing back in their direction.",First post-SNC-Lavalin polls look bad for Trudeau Liberals,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-polls-snclavalin-1.5026798

Pall, PhD and Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry and Basic Medical Sciences at Washington State University outlines in a new report the many health risks associated with 5G technology and wireless radiation in general.

Reflect On: 5G is gaining attention, and it might make us a little fearful of the effects, but we must observe this fear and bring things back to awareness of the issue so we can make better choices, but not be fearful. Check out our CE Protocol for this.

We are in the midst of a 5G wireless technology rollout, and politicians have yet to address safety concerns. I recently used Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as an example, but it’s happening worldwide. It’s one of many examples that illustrates how large corporations completely control politics. I also recently wrote about Robert F. Kennedy explaining how this came to be, and how they’ve been able to completely compromise government, big media, and our federal regulatory agencies that are supposed to be protecting and informing us.

In the video, he uses Big Pharma as an example, as they provide the most money to congress; even more so than big oil and gas. In that article I also outline multiple examples of fraud so readers can get a clearer picture of what’s going on and see some actual evidence of it.

It’s clear that we are not being protected, and politicians are simply abiding to the the will of their masters, the big corporations, who in turn act as slaves to their ‘financial overlords,’ the big banks. We continue to see products and services being approved and implemented without ever going through any safety testing. This is a big problem, and one of the main reasons why we could be seeing a drastic rise in multiple diseases and ailments, especially when it comes to neuropsychiatric disorders. A study titled “Microwave frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) produce widespread neuropsychiatric effects including depression” published in the Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy outlines this quite clearly, and it’s only one of thousands of peer-reviewed studies raising multiple concerns in regards to this type of technology.

Is there really any concern for the well being of humanity within these institutions? If not, why do we continue to support them? Is it because we’re under the illusion that there is actual concern? And why do we continue to take power away from ourselves by electing corrupt politicians?

Anyways, in this article, I’d like to draw your attention to Dr. Martin L. Pall, PhD and Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry and Basic Medical Sciences at Washington State University. Taken from his report titled “5G: Great risk for EU, U.S. and International Health! Compelling Evidence for Eight Distinct Types of Great Harm Caused by Electromagnetic Field(EMF) Exposures and the Mechanism that Causes Them,” he states that:

“Putting in tens of millions of 5G antennae without a single biological test of safety has got to be about the stupidest idea anyone has had in the history of the world.” advertisement - advertisement - learn more

That report goes through a lot of science, which only adds to all of the science that’s already available regarding the harmful effects of 5G technology. If you’re looking for more information, I often point people toward the Environmental Health Trust because it’s a great resource that gives you access to more science.

This is not new information. For years, numerous studies have been published proving the health concerns regarding 5G technology and hundreds of scientists have petitioned the United Nations about them. These initiatives started as a result of the work done by Dr. Marin Blank from Columbia University’s Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics.

According to him, with regards to wireless radiation in general:

“We have created something that is harming us, and it is getting out of control. Before Edison’s light bulb there was very little electromagnetic radiation in our environment. The levels today are very many times higher than natural background levels, and are growing rapidly because of all the new devices that emit this radiation. Putting it bluntly they are damaging the living cells in our bodies and killing many of us prematurely.”

Again, it’s unbelievable that these technologies are being rolled out without any safety testing done. How is this even allowed to happen? The thing is, if there was safety testing done, there would likely be no changes made anyways, and these corporations would be allowed to rollout and utilize these technologies.

Seeing how this article is about the work of Dr. Pall, below is a lecture that goes into detail about his research and why we should be concerned with 5G technology.

It’s alarming that some people have been made to believe that this is “pseudoscience.” Not only is this surprising, but it’s also very concerning.

During the “Health in Buildings Roundtable” sponsored by the NIH and co-organized by the US CDC and several other organizations, Dr. Martin Pall from Washington State University (WSU) concluded that the “5G rollout is absolutely insane.” In this short presentation, Dr. Pall confirmed that the current 2G/3G/4G radiation the population is exposed to has been scientifically linked to: lowered fertility, insomnia, fatigue, depression, anxiety, major changes in brain structure in animals, cellular DNA damage, oxidative stress, hormonal disruption, cancer, and much more. Dr. Pall briefly explained the mechanisms of how the electro-smog emitted by our cell phones, wifi routers, cell phone antennas, and other wireless technologies affect human cells.

Related CE Articles & What You Can Do. We Don’t Have To Be Afraid

We’ve written about this topic in depth, and below are some recent articles we’ve published that go into more detail if you’re looking for more information.

On a side note, a lot of this information can spark a fearful reaction, and that’s normal. It could elicit the same fearful reaction you may have to other humanitarian issues including the massive amounts of pesticides being sprayed in our environment and on our food, the rising deforestation rates, and several other aspects of the human experience that need to be changed. As important as it is to not react with fear and panic, it’s even more important not to completely ignore these things and think everything will magically be okay.

Earth has become engulfed with this mess as a result of our ignorance, as a result of us ignoring important scientific findings such as these. If we continue along this path, disease rates will continue to rise. Awareness is key, and simply being informed about this issue is a huge step in the right direction.

So, what can you do? You could purchase some EMF protective clothing and bedding, or you could even paint your home with EMF protective paint. You can unplug your computer when not in use, turn off your cell phone, and unplug all your electronic devices before you go to sleep. You could have a wired internet connection, which is actually much faster than any wireless connection. You can live a healthy lifestyle, and you can use mind-body healing techniques to help you.

I write a lot about parapsychology, and it’s quite clear that our minds can have a significant impact on our biology. I know it sounds a little ‘new agey,’ but the truth is, if you don’t believe you are being harmed, odds are that the impact on your biology will be significantly different than someone who is fearful and stressed out about health concerns. Consciousness is huge, and it is one of the biggest factors in regards to preventative measures.

You can learn more about this balance through our CE Protocol.

The problem is the Liberal government is standing in the way. What's a government to do?

The question at the centre of this saga is whether former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was pressured by anyone in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to seek a deferred prosecution agreement in the criminal case involving Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been unequivocal in his answer. It's just that he's been answering a different question: No one directedher to secure a particular resolution.

But did anyone pressure her?

No one ""directed"" her.

Don't be confused. Ever since that unambiguous denial of a question that wasn't asked, the government's line on the matter has been consistent and clear: We would like to tell you more, but we simply can't, because we are choosing not to.

Solicitor-client privilege​

Last week, the Liberal majority on the Commons justice committee blocked efforts to call relevant witnesses — including Wilson-Raybould and PMO senior advisers Gerald Butts (who resigned Monday) and Mathieu Bouchard — before the committee. Expanding the witness list to those who were actually involved in the pertinent conversations would be akin to a ""witch hunt"" and a ""fishing expedition,"" explained Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault.

Instead, the committee would be calling legal experts, civil servants and the current attorney general, David Lametti, who had already said he has no direct knowledge of conversations between Wilson-Raybould and the PMO. The committee has not called anyone who can speak to the colour of the paint on the wall where these conversations took place, but alas, there is still time to add more witnesses. (Indeed, the committee eventually relented to calling Wilson-Raybould to testify after all.)

Michael Wernick the Clerk of the Privy Council spoke to the Commons Justice committee Thursday 0:27

Proceedings began on Thursday, when Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick testified that the conversations with Wilson-Raybould about SNC-Lavalin were lawful and appropriate. He repeated the prime minister's line that if she felt pressure — due to the multiple conversations in which it was emphasized that the wrong decision on the matter could have dire economic consequences in Quebec — she should have reported it to the ethics commissioner.

Wilson-Raybould has not been able to publicly give her side of the story because, as she has noted previously, she is bound by solicitor-client privilege. The prime minister can waive that privilege should he choose, but he has not for a reason he has not coherently articulated other than to say he is discussing the matter with the current attorney general. During his testimony Thursday, Lametti was tight-lipped about his efforts on the matter, saying he himself is bound by solicitor-client privilege.

Attorney General David Lametti, who took over the job from Jody Wilson-Raybould, provided little new information Thursday, saying he is bound by solicitor-client privilege. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)

Now, the Liberals have been clear that they want to get to the bottom of this. It's just that all of the ways that have been proposed are not the correct ways to do so. They include a motion tabled by NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus calling for a public inquiry on the matter and for the prime minister to waive privilege to allow Wilson-Raybould to speak. All but two Liberals voted against the motion Wednesday.

Earlier that day, Wilson-Raybould reportedly told cabinet, according to a Globe and Mail source, that she experienced inappropriate pressure from the PMO on SNC-Lavalin. Meaning that, within the span of a few hours, cabinet reportedly heard from Wilson-Raybould that she was improperly pressured, then voted against a motion to allow her to say that publicly.

Move to Veterans Affairs

There are questions the prime minister may answer on the matter that don't involve privilege or require him to speak directly on SNC-Lavalin's criminal case. They include why Wilson-Raybould was moved from the Justice Department to Veterans Affairs even though other ministers maintained their posts during the last cabinet shuffle.

The prime minister has noted there are a ""range of factors"" that go into any decision to move a minister, but did not elaborate on the particular factors in Wilson-Raybould's case. There is no directive that requires Trudeau to keep this information confidential, but it nevertheless appears he is constrained by the parliamentary convention colloquially known as ""I'm Not Telling You Anything Else Because I Don't Want To.""

Indeed, if you trust the Liberals' words instead of their actions, it is clear they want to fulfil their promise of transparency; to free up Wilson-Raybould to ""speak my truth,"" as she requested in the House this week; to call upon all the relevant witnesses to testify; to allow a full and thorough public investigation. The problem is, the Liberals keep getting in the way. Alas, what is a Liberal government to do?

“There are seven fatalities resulting from the incident,” police in the Atlantic seaboard city said.

“All deceased are believed to be young children from the same family. A woman and a man remain in hospital.”

At a press conference, police said the man had “life-threatening” injuries. Public broadcaster CBC said the victims were Syrian refugees.

The cause of the fire was not immediately known.

A neighbour, Danielle Burt, told CBC that she heard an explosion in the middle of the night before seeing the flames ravaging the home.

“I heard a huge bang, and I was laying in bed with my daughter, followed by a woman screaming, so I jumped up out of bed and looked out the back window and all I could see was flames shooting out from the back door going out onto their deck,” she said.

Firefighters responded at 12.40 am.

In a Twitter message, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his “heart goes out to the survivors of this horrible fire … and loved ones who are mourning this tremendous loss.

“Words fail when children are taken from us too soon, especially in circumstances like this.”

382,Empty,2019-02-19T03:17:50Z,The two men forged their bonds in debate club. Trudeau said the experience helped convince him he wasn’t cut out for a career as a lawyer or a debater,"As a student at McGill University in the 1990s, Justin Trudeau sat down near some stone pillars and posed for a photo with another student, who decades later would emerge as the architect of his policies as prime minister — Gerald Butts.

The two were clad in nearly identical attire — sandals, ripped acid-washed jeans and white T-shirts. Trudeau included the photo of them in his 2014 autobiography — an indication of how close the two have been.

On Monday, after seven years hovering near Trudeau’s elbow as his chief advisor on policy and strategy, Butts resigned as Principal Secretary amid accusations that the Prime Minister’s Office interfered in the criminal prosecution of the giant Montreal engineering and construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. Though Butts called such accusations “simply not true,” he acknowledged that he had become a distraction and decided to remove himself.

Having helped persuade Trudeau to run for office, having helped write the Prime Minister’s autobiography and having helped run his campaign, he departs as the SNC scandal envelops the PMO.

“There’s no denying this is a body blow to the government and the prime minister,” said Charles Bird, a former senior staffer to a federal Liberal minister and now a managing principal at the Toronto office of public affairs firm Earnsdale Strategies.

“[Butts] was really key to the government’s policy agenda and what it’s been able to accomplish to date.”

Neither Trudeau nor Butts would comment about how his resignation unfolded; Butts said in a statement on Twitter that he offered to resign and Trudeau accepted.

In his own Twitter post, the prime minister said they remain friends and thanked Butts for his “integrity, sage advice and devotion.”

In recent weeks, Butts had emerged as a central figure in the unfolding scandal. Earlier this month, the Globe and Mail reported that the prime minister’s office had pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to broach a settlement with SNC-Lavalin on charges its executives coordinated tens of millions of dollars in bribes to Libyan government officials to win contracts there.

Though Trudeau denies interfering, Wilson-Raybould resigned last week, raising fresh questions about what had happened. Some reports suggest Butts had met and spoken to Wilson-Raybould about the case.

Butts, usually hovering in the background, had moved front and center and faced new scrutiny.

“When you’re in those jobs, you do your best not to become part of the storyline,” said Edward Goldenberg, a former chief of staff to Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chretien. “In parliamentary democracy, it’s for ministers to be part of the story, not staff.”

What happens now, including who will replace Butts and how Trudeau will adjust to the change, remains to be seen.

The two men, who met at McGill, forged their bonds in debate club. In an interview with McGill News, Trudeau said the experience helped convince him he wasn’t cut out for a career as a lawyer or a debater.

Nonetheless, in 2013, like a throwback to his college days, he was smack back in a debate while running the campaign that would land him in the PMO, and Butts was advising during each commercial break.

“Butts … practically pinned his friend against the wall,” according to a 2015 Maclean’s profile. “He slung a jacketed arm over Trudeau’s shoulder and spoke in hushed tones, inches from his face. It wasn’t so much aggressive as intensely friendly — a boxer with his longtime coach — with Trudeau occasionally nodding at Butts’s words.”

That helped reinforce a stereotype that Butts served as the brain of the operations while Trudeau provided the charming smile and personality to woo voters.

Their life stories, are of course vastly different: Butts, 47, born to a coal miner and nurse in Cape Breton, graduated from McGill, and after earning a master’s degree even briefly pursued a PhD in literature at York University in Toronto.

Before finishing his degree, he entered politics, rose through the ranks of former Ontario Premier Dalton McGinty’s office and later became chief executive of World Wildlife Foundation-Canada.

Trudeau, meanwhile, the son of a former prime minister, pursued a career as a teacher after McGill until decades later, Butts helped convince him to run for office.

According to a 2015 article in the Ottawa Citizen, as early as 2000, days after Pierre Trudeau’s death, the pair talked about the younger Trudeau running for office. The issue came up again throughout the intervening years, including over dinner in Toronto, where Butts lived with his wife and two children.

“I often did get the sense that they often would finish each others’ sentences,” said Jonathan Kay, who helped Trudeau with his autobiography and was a columnist for the National Post.

Kay said their personalities helped balance each other out, and the stereotype of Butts as the brains behind the operation is a mistake.

“They were very much equals,” he said, adding, “when they’re together they balance each other out.”

Butts, who is an avid twitter user even while occupying one of the highest positions in government, noted in his statement on the social media platform that one issue stands out to him as most important.

“That issue is climate change,” he wrote. “I hope the response to it becomes the collective, non-partisan, urgent effort that science clearly says is required. I hope that happens soon.”",Gerald Butts and Justin Trudeau ‘would finish each others’ sentences’,Financial Post,https://business.financialpost.com/news/butts-and-trudeau-would-finish-each-others-sentences
383,Empty,2019-02-24T09:00:00Z,Monday's federal byelections should shine a spotlight on some of the big themes of this election year.,"There's always something to learn from byelections. For starters, Jagmeet Singh will find out whether he has a future as the leader of the NDP.

But the results of all three of today's byelection contests also will shine a spotlight on some of the key dynamics that could decide the 2019 federal election.

Local factors always play a significant role in byelections, making it hazardous to draw overly broad conclusions from the results. But they're still instructive.

We know, for example, that how a party performs in byelections offers clues to how they might fare in subsequent general elections, that prime ministers with better byelection records have a higher chance of staying in office and that these seemingly minor affairs can have enormous historical significance.

There's certainly the potential for some drama tonight.

Singh is staking his leadership on the voters of Burnaby South, a riding in British Columbia's Lower Mainland. The area has voted for the NDP in every election since 2004 and even has a history of electing NDP leaders in need of a seat: Tommy Douglas won here in a 1962 byelection after he failed to secure a seat in his native Saskatchewan. Singh, a former Ontario MPP, is hoping to be offered the same hospitality.

If he doesn't get it, his days as leader of the NDP are likely to be numbered.

Can Singh put a halt to the NDP's struggles?

It speaks to a larger problem for the New Democrats. The party has made little headway since Singh became leader in October 2017. It's been dropping in the polls and now sits at just 14 per cent in the CBC Poll Tracker — a result which, if replicated on election night, would be the worst result for the party in nearly 20 years.

Singh's approval rating is in the red and he stacks up poorly against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer on the question of who Canadians would prefer in the top job.

This has a wider impact on the electoral landscape. The Conservatives have a tough time winning elections when the NDP is weak.

Expectations are that Singh will win in Burnaby South. His party has poured its meagre resources into the riding and Singh — who has taken up residence in Burnaby — has been campaigning there for months.

There's no telling what impact a defeat there would have on the NDP. It could send the party into a tailspin from which it couldn't recover in time for the fall election. Or the party could install an interim leader with better prospects.

How to follow tonight's byelection results

Join us for results and analysis on a live Power & Politics byelections special, hosted by VassyKapelos and Éric Grenier, starting at 10 p.m. ET on cbc.ca, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. You can also follow results on a special edition of The National with Ian Hanomansing on CBC Television and CBC News Network - and check for updated results stories throughout the evening at cbc.ca/politics

With that kind of uncertainty looming over the party, the New Democrats might be satisfied with a win of any kind. The party needs some good news. If Singh can secure the seat by a comfortable margin, it could be the signal needed to give the NDP hope that the rest of the year will be better.

A squeaker of a win, however, would only mean that a lot of work remains to be done before the NDP starts seeing some light at the end of the tunnel — and the Conservatives start breathing easier.

Battleground GTA - if Bernier doesn't get in the way

The Conservatives are unlikely to lose any sleep over York–Simcoe, a riding located north of Toronto. It has been a safe seat for the party ever since the right was united in 2003. The Conservatives won it by 45 points in 2011 when Stephen Harper secured a Conservative majority government. They still held it by 12 points in 2015 when Harper went down to defeat.

While it's a more sprawling riding than many of those located throughout the Greater Toronto Area, it's still only a stone's throw away from some of the seats that decide every federal election. So while the results might not be emblematic of the battles that will be fought between the Liberals and the Conservatives in the GTA in the fall, they might still give us a clue to just how hamstrung the Conservatives could be in the region by Maxime Bernier.

Andrew Scheer's Conservatives are expected to hold the Ontario riding of York–Simcoe, but it's the results for Maxime Bernier's People's Party that will offer clues to how likely the Conservatives are to make gains in the rest of the Greater Toronto Area. (Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press)

The runner-up in 2017's Conservative leadership race still has a long way to go before his People's Party is in a position to challenge for anything but Bernier's own seat in the Beauce region of Quebec. The Poll Tracker pegs support for the PPC at just 2.5 per cent nationally.

But Bernier could still have a significant impact on the Conservatives' chances of winning seats in key regions of the country — such as the GTA.

A recent Innovative Research Group poll gave the PPC five per cent support in the suburban GTA. With Liberal support slipping in Ontario in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin affair, a lot of their seats in the GTA are up for grabs. But fewer of them will flip over to Scheer's party if Bernier scoops up five per cent of the vote that otherwise would have gone to Conservative candidates.

The results in York–Simcoe will be a good gauge of just how much of a complication the People's Party will prove to be for Scheer in October.

Quebec and the Liberal path to re-election

If the Conservatives are banking on the GTA to propel them back to power (and are hoping Bernier stays out of the way), the Liberals are looking to Quebec to keep themselves in office.

The New Democrats won 16 seats in Quebec in the 2015 federal election. With their support in the province plummeting to just 8.9 per cent, according to the CBC Poll Tracker, the party is on track to lose every single one of them.

The Liberals are counting on that; they need gains in Quebec to offset expected losses in places like New Brunswick and Ontario. With 38.3 per cent support and a 17-percentage point lead over the Conservatives in the province, the Liberals are well-positioned to win most of those 16 seats.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is counting on Quebec to help him secure re-election in the fall. That plan starts with Outremont on Monday. (Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press)

Outremont would be high on that list of potential pick-ups. Prior to Tom Mulcair's breakthrough there in 2007, the riding was a Liberal stronghold. It's also the type of urban, diverse riding the Liberals tend to hold throughout the country.

An NDP win would be a tremendous upset and a signal that the Liberal plan for re-election is in big trouble. So Trudeau doesn't simply need to win Outremont — he needs his party to win it with a crushing margin. The provincial polls suggest that the Liberals should win the riding easily. They'll want to see a big number there, and a small one for Singh's NDP.

They'd also like to see middling numbers for the Bloc Québécois, which is enjoying an uptick of its own under new leader Yves-François Blanchet. The Bloc was the perennial rival of the Liberals in Outremont before its collapse in 2011.

So when the results of Monday's three federal byelections start to come in, don't just look at who won and who lost. The implications might go far beyond that. In an election year, every tea leaf tells a story.

But are we any closer to getting to the bottom of …,"In official Ottawa, some weeks feel longer than others. This one scarcely got started before the SNC-Lavalin affair exploded — again — leaving more questions than answers. And it's only Wednesday.

First, Gerry Butts stunned everyone Monday by abruptly resigning as the prime minister's top adviser — even as he insisted that neither he nor anyone else in Justin Trudeau's office sought to pressure former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

A day later, Wilson-Raybould sent jaws dropping everywhere when she emerged from a meeting of Trudeau's cabinet — the same inner circle she quit just last week. She was there for a few hours at her own request, the prime minister said.

Not even the din generated by a convoy of several hundred pro-pipeline supporters blaring truck horns on Parliament Hill yesterday could drown out the sound of reporters demanding to know why Wilson-Raybould met with the cabinet she'd just spurned, and what she said to her former colleagues.

And it's not over yet. Today, Wilson-Raybould is expected to attend the regular Liberal caucus meeting. Her reception there may not be as warm as she'd like, given her role in a consuming political drama that seems to be settling in for an extended run in the nation's capital.

Everybody wants answers

Her caucus colleagues no doubt will want to know what she told cabinet Tuesday. If she falls back on her statement that she's still bound by solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality, Liberal MPs will still want to know whether she felt pressured, directed or nudged by anyone in the Prime Minister's Office to give SNC-Lavalin the option of paying a fine in lieu of going to trial on fraud and corruption charges.

Watch: SNC-Lavalin affair timeline key to claims of PMO pressure on Jody Wilson-Raybould

In the SNC-Lavalin affair, one of the key questions remaining is who exactly said what to then-Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould, and did it amount to pressure to treat the company lightly. 3:26

The MPs on the Commons justice committee would like to hear her answer that question as well. They voted Tuesday to add Wilson-Raybould to their witness list after the Liberals — who had refused to put her name forward last week — relented Tuesday.

Other MPs spent much of Tuesday in the Commons debating an NDP motion demanding two things: that Trudeau waive solicitor-client privilege to allow Wilson-Raybould to tell her side of the story publicly, and that he agree to an independent public inquiry similar to the one led by Justice John Gomery on the Quebec sponsorship scandal.

The first of those demands is probably the less important one. Just about everyone, in government and out, expects Wilson-Raybould to speak. It's why she hired a former Supreme Court justice for legal advice. It's why Butts abruptly departed, even as he denied the allegations again.

""My reputation is my responsibility and that is for me to defend,"" Butts wrote. ""It is in the best interests of the office and its important work for me to step away.""

Fair enough. That's not going to convince the opposition to abandon its demand for an independent accounting of conversations in government circles last fall — when SNC-Lavalin was lobbying just about everybody who's anybody for a 'deferred prosecution agreement', a new legal tool introduced by the Liberals in a budget bill approved last June.

Charlie Angus, who sponsored Tuesday's motion, said a public inquiry would provide the ""transparency and accountability promised by the Liberals in the 2015 election campaign.""

Perhaps anticipating the Liberals defeating his motion this afternoon, Angus offered his own, highly-partisan version of the events that make up the SNC-Lavalin affair — a theory to explain why the government might be eager to cut a deal with the Montreal-based construction giant.

'Corruption and cronyism'

""It was about the government and this prime minister's insider relationships,"" he said as he opened debate in the Commons. ""There is nothing more negative for public life than corruption and cronyism.""

The Conservatives are just as eager to convince Canadians there's a cover-up here.

""The way in which this story has unfolded, with almost daily changes to the prime minister's version of the events, with high-profile resignations, with anonymously-sourced smear campaigns … suggests this is not an ordinary political scandal,"" Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer told the Commons.

""Something more sinister is at play here,"" Scheer added, alleging what he called a ""deliberate attempt to obstruct justice"" by unnamed people in the PMO.

Who are these people (allegedly)? It's a mystery. Who were the sources behind the leak that led to the original Globe and Mail report nearly two weeks ago? Also a mystery.

But this is an election year, and this story carries the whiff of scandal from the highest reaches of the Trudeau government. So the opposition is taking it all as gospel — no matter how the allegation first came to light, no matter who the source or sources might be, no matter what their motivation was for leaking to the media.

The prime minister looked almost weary as he rose to his feet in the Commons Tuesday to take even more questions. But after days of offering vague answers that only spawned more questions, Trudeau offered no new information yesterday on why Butts resigned.

There was no big reveal about why he agreed to let Wilson-Raybould appear before cabinet as a former minister. No suggestion that he would agree to waive solicitor-client privilege before he gets a legal opinion from the man who replaced her as attorney general. No answers. Not yet.

And it's only Wednesday. Brace yourselves.

Opposition MPs are livid that no one from Justin Trudeau's office has been called to answer for their alleged roles in the affair.

The committee hearings are to begin Wednesday but Wilson-Raybould likely won't appear until Monday and it's not clear she will be able to shed new light on the allegations that prompted her to resign her cabinet seat and Trudeau to lose his most trusted aide.

The Liberal-dominated committee rejected an opposition motion calling on the prime minister to waive solicitor-client privilege and allow Wilson-Raybould to finally speak freely on the allegations.

She stunned observers by attending a meeting Tuesday of the very cabinet from which she resigned a week ago. Trudeau said she had asked to speak there and was invited to do so but cabinet confidentiality meant nothing could be told about why or what was said. For her part, Wilson-Raybould continued to say nothing about the furor around her.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould speaks briefly w/ reporters on Parliament Hill: asked if she was pressured re SNC-Lavalin case, says ""I'm still working w/ my lawyer""; asked if she's still in Liberal caucus, replies ""I'm a Liberal member of Parliament."" #cdnpoli pic.twitter.com/le9UaBzYrq — CPAC (@CPAC_TV) February 19, 2019

""I am still consulting with my legal counsel as I think people can appreciate, or should appreciate, the rules and laws around privilege, around confidentiality, around my responsibility as a member of Parliament,"" she said as she exited the meeting.

""My ethical and professional responsibilities as a lawyer are layered and incredibly complicated so I am still working with my lawyer.""

Shortly after Wilson-Raybould met cabinet, one of the Liberal members of the justice committee, who had last week rejected calling the former minister to testify, announced that she would propose a motion at committee to hear from her after all.

New Democrat justice critic Murray Rankin said it appears that Wilson-Raybould and the government have reached some sort of internal resolution to the affair that will allow her to remain in the Liberal caucus and testify to the committee without saying anything damaging to the government.

The committee will also hear from Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, current Justice Minister David Lametti, and deputy justice minister Nathalie Drouin, along with a number of academics who can discuss the legal principles underpinning the allegations.

'The coverup continues': Tory MP

Gerald Butts, Trudeau's long-time friend who resigned his post as principal secretary on Monday despite saying he had done nothing wrong, will not be called, nor will anyone else from Trudeau's office.

""The coverup continues,"" said Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus after the closed-door committee meeting.

Deputy Conservative leader Lisa Raitt said the committee hearings won't be meaningful unless solicitor-client privilege between Wilson-Raybould and the government is waived and, at a minimum, Butts can be questioned on his blanket assertion that he did nothing wrong.

Rankin called the committee's decision ""a travesty.""

""There will be nobody from the Prime Minister's Office at this,"" he said. ""When she comes, she could quite properly say I suppose, based on legal advice, that I can tell you nothing because of solicitor-client privilege.""

Watch: Who is Gerald Butts? Story continues below.

Wilson-Raybould has hired former Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell to advise her on what she can say publicly about allegations made by an anonymous source to the Globe and Mail. The newspaper reported she was pressured to help SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal prosecution on bribery and corruption charges related to government contracts in Libya.

Wilson-Raybould was the justice minister for more than three years, until she was moved in January to veterans affairs. Opposition parties maintain she was demoted because she wouldn't instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin, rather than pursue a criminal conviction that could see the company barred from bidding on public contracts for 10 years.

Trudeau has acknowledged there were conversations with her about the case, but that he told her the decision was hers to make, and she was not being directed to do anything.

She confirmed Tuesday she is still a member of the Liberal caucus and sat with the Liberals in the front row of their side in the House of Commons.

MPs began the day debating an NDP motion calling for a public inquiry into the affair and calling on Trudeau to waive the solicitor-client privilege.

I have given notice of motion at the justice committee to invite the Hon. Jody Wilson-Raybould to appear before the committee. — Iqra Khalid (@iamIqraKhalid) February 19, 2019

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Canada cannot claim to be a country based on the rule of law if the Prime Minister's Office is dictating the course of justice.

""The prime minister has kept (Wilson-Raybould) silent in order to protect himself,"" Scheer alleged.

In question period, Trudeau faced a barrage of questions from the opposition demanding he let Wilson-Raybould speak, and accusing him of sexism for giving his side of the story while simultaneously muzzling her by refusing to wave privilege.

Trudeau said his government consistently stands up for the rule of law and the independence of the justice system and he is awaiting advice from Lametti on how to proceed on the question of privilege.

""In the matter of solicitor-client privilege, the member opposite must know that there are real dangers of unintended consequences, particularly on the two court cases currently wending their way through the courts,"" Trudeau said.

At the same time, Conservatives in the Senate are seeking to bring the allegations before the Senate legal affairs committee, which would hear from at least 10 witnesses including Trudeau, Wilson-Raybould, Butts, Trudeau's chief of staff Katie Telford, Lametti, Wernick, and several other senior advisers in the Prime Minister's Office.

Conservative Senate leader Larry Smith brought the motion for the study Tuesday but was denied the chance to immediately debate it. It could come up for debate Wednesday but a Senate official said given the schedule it is most likely not to be heard now until Thursday.

Yet the massive potential market for driverless cars, combined with rapid recent advancements in hardware, have helped convince hundreds of companies to target this nascent industry niche.

Below, we'll highlight just a few of those entities that deserve investor attention right now. Read on to see why Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA), BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) are worth following over the coming weeks.

A computer-vision specialist

Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Ambarella): Investor sentiment turned negative against many small tech companies at the end of 2018 and helped push Ambarella shares sharply lower for the year. It didn't help that the semiconductor specialist, which produces low-power video compression hardware for miniature cameras, has seen sales growth grind to a halt while profitability declined in the last three quarters. Management's outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter isn't optimistic, either, with revenue set to slump by 29%.

Those low expectations could set shareholders up for gains when the company reports earnings results on March 1. CEO Fermi Wang and his team may highlight some good news, such as progress at securing a bigger client base for Ambarella's second generation of computer vision chips.

Early market share wins in this potentially booming industry would mark an important first step. However, Ambarella isn't likely to reverse its recent stock price slide until the company secures bigger avenues for growth and can raise prices to reflect its design innovation leadership. Investors will have a better idea about those trends when they see the 2019 sales and profitability outlook management will issue in the March report.

A bet on branded car tech

Jamal Carnette, CFA (BlackBerry): While it's simple to think of driverless cars as an all-or-nothing proposition, the reality is that vehicles are on a continuum from fully human operated to truly unmanned. In between these extremes are various features as mundane as cruise control and handsfree systems and as complicated as unassisted maneuvering and path tracking. BlackBerry's QNX technology has a strong foothold in this market, as its software/operating system (OS) is in more than 120 million cars across more than a dozen car brands performing many or all of these functions.

CEO John Chen has doubled down on cybersecurity and automotive applications as the company's focal points, specifically autonomous vehicles for the latter. Last quarter the company reported QNX had four design wins (a fancy way to say the automaker initially chose QNX) in advanced driver-assistance systems. Recently the company partnered with a Canadian start-up -- LeddarTech -- to provide the OS for LeddarTech's LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) platform.

The company is also seeing financial results from its QNX car-tech focus. Last quarter, BlackBerry's technology solutions division reported 23% year-over-year growth owing to its automotive vertical. Despite the green shoots of success, the company is not resting on its laurels in autonomous vehicles as it did with smartphones and has a huge backer in the form of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau; BlackBerry is getting a CA$40 million grant from the Canadian government to develop next-gen technologies that will power autonomous cars.

BlackBerry's QNX is already a mainstay in automobiles, and the company is looking to leverage those relationships to become the de facto plug-and-play OS in autonomous vehicles, akin to Alphabet's Android in smartphones. Investors who believe driverless cars are the next big thing would be wise to put the company on their watch lists and follow this industry closely.

A beaten-down chipmaker

Leo Sun (NVIDIA): NVIDIA lost about 40% of its value over the past six months over concerns about slowing sales of its data center and gaming GPUs. NVIDIA attributed those declines to three causes: the end of the cryptocurrency boom, which flooded the market with cheap GPUs; softer demand in China; and weak sales of its new Turing-based GPUs.



NVIDIA's revenue plunged 24% annually last quarter, but it allayed some of those fears with a forecast for flat to slightly negative sales growth in fiscal 2020 -- which was slightly better than the consensus forecast for a 5% decline.

NVIDIA is best known for its gaming GPUs, but its Tegra CPUs also power cars. NVIDIA currently supplies over 370 Drive partners -- including automakers, suppliers, and service providers -- with its driverless technologies. Its Drive PX, PX 2, PX Xavier, and PX Pegasus platforms all let automakers add driverless capabilities to their cars by plugging in an onboard computer.

NVIDIA's Automotive revenues rose 23% annually to $163 million last quarter. That accounted for only 7% of the chipmaker's top line, but it helped its data center and professional visualization businesses partly offset a 45% plunge in gaming revenues.

During the quarter, NVIDIA launched Drive AutoPilot, the world's ""first commercially available Level 2+ automated driving system."" It also announced a new partnership with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz to create a ""centralized computing architecture"" for next-gen AI-controlled vehicles.

These moves could widen NVIDIA's moat against Intel, which became a major player in the automotive market after its takeover of Mobileye, which provides ADAS (advanced driver assistance system) solutions to about 90% of the world's automakers. Looking ahead, investors should see if NVIDIA's auto business can keep expanding as the chipmaker tries to turn around its core gaming business.",3 Top Driverless Car Stocks to Watch in February,Fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/02/22/3-top-driverless-car-stocks-to-watch-in.aspx

The controversial image, used as the account’s cover photo, shows a row of pink sticky notes on a kitchen shelf. The notes read, “Donald Trump is president,” “This is not normal,” “Donald Trump is evil” and “Don’t be complacent.”

While it’s unclear if the account actually belongs to former President Barack Obama’s older daughter, the backlash among his detractors has ensued.

“Sorry, Malia, we the people feel the same way toward your so-called dad Obummer,” read one angry comment. “Your whole family needs to move to Kenya!”

But critics of the Harvard student were quickly shut down on social media — most notably by another former first daughter.

It’s not the first time Clinton — who endured her own share of negative scrutiny during her father’s presidential tenure — has stepped in to defend a fellow first child. In December, she tweeted her support of 12-year-old Barron Trump, who is currently living in the White House, writing, “Please leave Barron Trump out of ‘jokes’ & analyses. He’s a kid and private citizen and deserves to be left alone. Thank you.”

Other public figures — including Pete Souza, the former official White House photographer under Obama — jumped in to show their own support for Malia.

On Monday the Daily Mail also published photos of the former first daughter sharing a bottle of wine at a pool party with friends while underage — just months shy of her 21st birthday.

James McCarten, The Canadian Press





WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Donald Trump's senior economic adviser gave Canada and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau a symbolic pat on the back Sunday for how the federal government has been ""hanging tough"" on the diplomatically delicate extradition case of senior Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou.

Larry Kudlow said he's ""proud"" of how Canada has handled the Meng matter -- a tacit acknowledgment of the diplomatic bind the U.S. Justice Department created for the federal Liberals in December when they asked that the chief financial officer and telecom scion be arrested and held in Vancouver, pending extradition.

Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, is at the centre of a sprawling U.S. indictment unsealed last month that accuses the growing tech juggernaut of misrepresenting its ownership of a Hong Kong-based subsidiary between 2007 and 2017 to circumvent U.S. sanctions against Iran. She and the company are facing 13 counts of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice.

""I'll just say how proud I am of Prime Minister Trudeau, and Canada, for hanging tough on Huawei,"" said Kudlow, director of the U.S. National Economic Council.

He acknowledged the grief the case has caused Canada since Meng, who remains under house arrest in Vancouver pending an extradition hearing, was detained at the city's airport in early December: two Canadians have since been detained in China, ostensibly for national security reasons, while a third -- convicted by a Chinese court of drug trafficking -- is facing the death penalty.

""That's why I'm so I'm so proud of Prime Minister Trudeau for staying with the rule of law and assisting the United States. I'm very proud of him.""

Kudlow made the comments following an appearance on a free-trade panel at the winter meeting of the National Governors Association in Washington alongside federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau. And it wasn't the only instance that he dropped the prime minister's name.

As world leaders were gathering last year in Argentina, where Trump, Trudeau and former Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto signed the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the prime minister approached Kudlow in an effort to move past the animosity that had erupted six months earlier at the G7 meetings in June in Quebec.

Trump, apparently piqued by Trudeau's hard-line rhetoric on tariffs and trade, unleashed a Twitter tirade that denounced the prime minister as ""dishonest"" and ""weak,"" refusing in the end to sign on to the agreed-upon end-of-summit communique. Kudlow called Trudeau's comments a ""betrayal,"" while U.S. trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested he deserved a ""special place in hell.""

The dust-up left Canada-U.S. relations, already strained over the ongoing NAFTA talks and a burgeoning cross-border tariff war, at their lowest point in recent memory -- until Trudeau crossed the corridor to reach out to Kudlow.

""He came up to me -- this is a true story -- after the USMCA ceremony, he walked across the hall to come up and grab my hand and give me a hug,"" Kudlow said. ""I asked him if we could please turn the page on any of that stuff that occurred last spring, and he said, 'Absolutely,' and then we started having some policy discussions.

""Justin just grabbed my hand and gave me a bear hug, and I was thrilled.""

Asked whether the animosity has similarly diminished between the two leaders, Kudlow said: ""I think it's partly happened.""

On Friday, Trump himself floated the possibility -- again -- that the U.S. could drop criminal charges against Huawei, as the president wrapped up two days of negotiations at the White House aimed at resolving America's own ongoing trade dispute with China.

""We're going to be discussing all of that during the course of the next couple of weeks,"" Trump said at the White House during an Oval Office meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping's special envoy, Vice Premier Liu He.

""We'll be talking to the U.S. attorneys. We'll be talking to the attorney general. We'll be making that decision. Right now, it's not something we've discussed.""

Late Sunday, Trump announced he would hold off on a dramatic spike in tariffs on Chinese exports, originally scheduled for Friday, pending the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks that he said on Twitter have ""made substantial progress.""

""Assuming both sides make additional progress, we will be planning a Summit for President Xi and myself at Mar-a-Lago to conclude an agreement.""","Trump adviser Kudlow 'proud' of Canada, Trudeau, for approach to Huawei case - CTV News",Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/trump-adviser-kudlow-proud-of-canada-trudeau-for-approach-to-huawei-case-1.4310520

The scandal, over whether the prime minister’s office pressured its justice ministry to help a Quebec firm facing fraud charges, has consumed the nation for the past two weeks. Each detail that has dripped into the public domain has generated multiple opinion columns and dominated airwaves.

Part of that scrutiny owes to the federal electoral season – with the opposition seizing on any whiff of Mr. Trudeau tainting the rule of law as the nation heads to the polls this fall. But it’s also captured public attention because it seems to stand in opposition to everything that Trudeau, and the Canada he represents, stands for: a respite to the pressures squeezing the rule of law, human rights, and liberal values in the rest of the world.

When Trudeau was propelled into power, it was his brand as a fresh and youthful face, positive politics, and a new and more transparent way of governance that drew the electorate to him. While more than three years of decisionmaking at the top has necessarily damaged his “real change” brand, he remains a beacon for many middle-power countries in the world, especially as the United States under President Trump has put into question the American commitment to a rules-based, international order.

Now Trudeau faces charges that his government is, essentially, just like everybody else’s.

A WOMAN BORN TO NOBLE PEOPLE

The scandal began after The Globe and Mail published a report earlier this month that alleged that the prime minister’s office put pressure on Jody Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister to help SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution for its dealings in Libya. According to the newspaper, she resisted. She was demoted to veterans affairs minister in January and has since resigned – without revealing anything about why, citing solicitor-client privilege.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould is a powerful symbol of Trudeau’s branding. She both personified his pledge to build a new relationship with indigenous people in Canada as a historic reconciliation and his commitment to gender equality.

And while the main issue that could damage Trudeau concerns the rule of law, Alex Marland, author of “Brand Command: Canadian Politics and Democracy in the Age of Message Control,” says that gender and race add to the scandal at a sensitive moment.

“If the attorney general happened to be a white guy, to what extent would the story be an issue? It would still be an issue,” he says. “It’s just that because it happens to be an indigenous woman and this particular prime minister – and not even just the prime minister, it’s just the nature of society at the moment. It’s really a sensitive thing to have a white man and a prime minister demote an indigenous woman, especially in Canada where we’re going through this period of reconciliation.”

When the scandal broke, Trudeau immediately said he did not “direct” Wilson-Raybould to reach an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin, which faces charges of fraud and corruption. The firm employs 9,000 people in Quebec, a province that will be crucial for the Liberals in the election. But Trudeau’s carefully constructed statement only led to speculation that he was engaging in a semantics game because the government had something to hide. He tried to stifle it by saying her continued presence in his cabinet spoke for itself. The next day she stepped down, signing her resignation “Puglaas,” her name in her native Kwak’wala language, which means “a woman born to noble people.”

Days later Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s longtime friend and influential principal secretary, resigned. In his letter he said there was no untoward pressure placed on Wilson-Raybould, but his resignation only turned up the speculation.

It was only in testimony in the House of Commons justice committee last week that Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council of Canada, shed some light on a basic timeline of meetings that have taken place. He essentially admitted a degree of pressure placed on the justice minister but said that it wasn’t inappropriate.",A murky scandal threatens to mar Trudeau's – and Canada's – good names,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/murky-scandal-threatens-mar-trudeaus-canadas-good-names-220949695.html

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Canada is looking at ways to bring over relatives of a Syrian refugee who lost her children in a house fire.

Kawthar Barho's seven children died in an early morning fire in the Canadian city of Halifax on Tuesday.

Her husband sustained life-threatening injuries in the fire.

The family had come to Canada after fleeing their home in Raqqa, which had been taken over by the group known as Islamic State.

Ms Barho, 30, has no other family in the country.

Mr Trudeau told reporters on Thursday in Halifax that the federal immigration minister is giving personal attention to the case and seeing what can be done within the system to bring over some of her family members to bring ""some solace in this tragedy"".

""In heartbreaking cases like this we're certainly looking at doing what we can to bring this family, which has suffered such a devastating loss, together,"" he said.

There has been an outpouring of support for the parents in the wake of the tragedy, including a vigil on Wednesday evening attended by the prime minister.

An online fundraiser for the Syrian couple has also raised over C$440,000 ($330,000; £255,000) in two days.

The youngest Barho child was just four months old and the oldest was 15.

The funeral for the children will be held at a local mosque the family attended.

The family had been privately sponsored to come to Canada by a local refugee resettlement group.

""For the past year and a half, the children have been able to enjoy life as kids should be able to: going to school, riding bicycles, swimming, having friends, running in the yard, celebrating birthday parties and hanging out with the neighbours on their porch swing,"" the organisation wrote in a Facebook post.

""They loved every minute of it, and it seems impossible we won't hear their laughter and feel their hugs again.""

Authorities say it took about an hour to get the flames under control when fire and emergency services arrived on the scene in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

Fire crews said the fire quickly engulfed the first and second floors of the building.

The two-storey home was completely gutted by the fire.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s personal approval ratings are down; a declining number of Canadians think his government deserves re-election; and Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives narrowly lead the Liberals on the ballot box question.

“This is the worst couple of weeks the PM has had since the India trip,” said Darrell Bricker, CEO of polling firm Ipsos. “The biggest problem is that it hits at what gives the Liberal Party its appeal: the prime minister.”

READ MORE: Charges against SNC-Lavalin explained — and how the PMO allegedly got involved

Ipsos was in the field last week, after revelations surfaced that, last fall, while she was justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould felt that unnamed individuals in the prime minister’s office were pressuring her to intervene in a criminal court case in favour of Quebec-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Those allegations were first reported by the Globe and Mail, citing unnamed sources.

If she did feel pressured, she did not act and did not intervene on behalf of SNC-Lavalin. But a few months later, she was shuffled out of her job as justice minister and attorney general and into the job of veterans affairs minister.

Then, last week, as Liberals themselves seemed divided over the optics of seeing the country’s first-ever Indigenous justice minister being shuffled aside for what appeared to be craven political calculations, Wilson-Raybould stepped down from cabinet altogether.

Meanwhile, all through the week, Trudeau and other Liberals struggled to explain what had happened while Wilson-Raybould announced she had retained a former Supreme Court justice to provide her with advice about what, if anything, she might say about the whole matter.

Voters took notice.

Ipsos found that, among the 1,002 Canadians it surveyed online from Thursday through to Monday, nearly half or 49 per cent said they were aware of this rapidly shifting story involving SNC Lavalin, Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould.

And it appears many are changing their opinion of the government as a result.

READ MORE: Justin Trudeau’s top adviser Gerald Butts resigns amid SNC-Lavalin affair

Support for the Trudeau Liberals is now at 34 per cent of decided and leaning voters, down four percentage points from a poll Ipsos did in December. In the 2015 election, the Trudeau Liberals won their commanding majority with 39 per cent of the vote.

Scheer’s Conservatives appear to have benefited from this slide. That party is now at 36 per cent support, up three points since the end of 2018.

“The big trouble spot is now Ontario, where the Tories have a six point lead over the Liberals,” said Bricker. “The way the vote breaks in Ontario suggests that the Tories are doing well in the 905, where the Liberals won their majority in 2015.”

The NDP and its leader Jagmeet Singh, meanwhile, continue to languish, with 17 per cent support right now versus 18 per cent at year-end.

The poll was out of the field before Monday afternoon’s bombshell news that Gerald Butts had quit his post as the prime minister’s principal secretary. Butts, one of Trudeau’s closest friends, had played a critical role in the revival of Liberal fortune and was, along with Trudeau’s chief of staff Katie Telford, central to Trudeau administration. Butts said he had done nothing wrong but was resigning to avoid being a further distraction to the government’s agenda.

WATCH: Justin Trudeau’s top adviser Gerald Butts resigns amid SNC-Lavalin controversy

In any event, Ipsos found that even before that additional turmoil, voter approval of the Trudeau government had dropped nine points since the beginning of the year down to 42 per cent in its most recent pulse-taking.

Trudeau’s own personal approval rating is now two points lower than it was after his disastrous trip to India this time last year.

“Those who strongly disapprove of his performance now outnumber those who strongly approve by a margin of four to one,” Bricker said.

And yet, Trudeau is still doing better than his two main rivals, Scheer and Singh, who continue to have lower approval ratings than Trudeau.

“All is not bad for Trudeau,” Bricker said. “When assessed head to head with his major rivals, Scheer and Singh, he still does well on specific leadership attributes. Although the gap appears to be closing now.”

And just 38 per cent of those surveyed believe the Trudeau Liberals deserve re-election, while 62 per cent agreed that it was time to give another party a chance at governing.

A margin-of-error could not be calculated for this poll as the sample surveyed was not drawn randomly. That said, Ipsos says the accuracy of its polls can be gauged using a statistical measure known as a credibility interval. Applying this technique to this poll, Ipsos believes this poll would be accurate to within 3.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, compared to a poll of all Canadian adults

Wilson-Raybould’s meeting comes exactly a week after she resigned as veterans affairs minister amid allegations that when she was attorney general the PMO pressured her to abandon the prosecution of a fraud and corruption case against the Quebec-based engineering and construction giant.

Speaking with reporters on her way out of Tuesday’s meeting, she would not answer whether or not she was pressured by the PMO, saying that she is still consulting with her legal counsel about speaking publicly.

""As I think people can appreciate or should appreciate, the rules and laws around privilege, around confidentiality, around my responsibility as a member of Parliament, my ethical and professional responsibilities as a lawyer are layered and incredibly complicated,"" Wilson-Raybould said.

In her letter of resignation from cabinet, Wilson-Raybould said she has retained former Supreme Court judge Thomas Cromwell to provide advice about speaking publicly about the scandal, as she has been called on to do since the news broke in The Globe and Mail last week. CTV News has not independently verified the story.

Speaking in French on his way out of the meeting, Trudeau said that Wilson-Raybould asked to come speak to the cabinet.

""Our cabinet gets together every Tuesday to talk about a broad range of issues,"" Trudeau said during question period.

Other than the handful of ministers who stopped to respond to reporters' questions on their way in to Tuesday's meeting, the 35-member cabinet largely passed by without comment about the ongoing scandal. The cabinet meeting ran around an hour later than usual on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear at which point Wilson-Raybould was present.

""We had a good discussion in cabinet this morning,"" Treasury Board President Jane Philpott said.

Asked about what Wilson-Raybould’s presence meant -- both in the seat she held on the front bench before resigning from cabinet, and at the high-level morning meeting -- Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said it wasn’t for him to “analyze internal aspects of this.”

Similarly, when asked if perhaps this meeting is a signal that the Liberals are working to resolve this controversy internally, deputy Tory leader Lisa Raitt took issue with the level of secrecy surrounding it.

But Conservatives and New Democrats accused the Liberals of blocking key players from appearing — among them Gerry Butts, who suddenly resigned Monday from his position as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's top adviser.

Wilson-Raybould was demoted from minister of Justice to the Veterans Affairs portfolio earlier this month. She resigned cabinet last week, just days after the Globe and Mail reported that she was pressured by people in the Trudeau PMO to direct the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to draft a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — a legal tool resembling a plea deal — for SNC-Lavalin, allowing the global engineering firm to avoid criminal prosecution on bribery and fraud charges in relation to contracts in Libya.

Wilson-Raybould surprised many today when she emerged from the cabinet room in the afternoon after addressing Trudeau and his ministers. Standing at the centre of a scandal engulfing the government — and asserting that she still remains bound by solicitor-client privilege that limits what she can say publicly — she said the situation is complex.

""The rules and laws around privilege, around confidentiality, around my responsibility as a member of Parliament, my ethical and professional responsibilities as a lawyer, are layered and incredibly complicated. So I'm still working with my lawyer,"" she said. As the former attorney-general, Wilson-Raybould acted as the government's top lawyer.

Conservative deputy leader Lisa Raitt expressed deep disappointment with the committee's witness list and said that committee members must hear from Butts in order to get to the bottom of the affair.

""We will ask very good questions and we will expect the witnesses to answer truthfully because they will be under oath,"" she said.

Raitt said it's also critical that Trudeau waive client-solicitor privilege for Wilson-Raybould so she can answer the committee's questions thoroughly.

""I will appear, but as I said, I'm still in discussions with my counsel about the various privileges and confidences that I have,"" she said.

Lawyers, academics called to testify

Facing mounting pressure from opposition critics to waive client-solicitor privilege, Trudeau today would say only that he asked Lametti to review the situation and provide him with advice.

Along with Wilson-Raybould and Lametti, other witnesses called to appear before the committee include:

NDP MP Murray Rankin said he was frustrated by the fact that no one from the PMO was on the witness list.

""The justice committee owes it to Canadians to study this. It's fundamental to our democracy and, frankly, what happened there was a travesty,"" he said.

Trudeau has denied any wrongdoing, as did Butts in his bombshell resignation letter Monday.

Asked today if she was pressured by the Prime Minister's Office, Wilson-Raybould said she is ""still working with my lawyer.""

​Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault insisted the committee hearings will yield answers.

RCMP arrested Meng Wanzhou at Vancouver’s airport in December at request of the U.S., which is seeking her extradition on fraud charges, and Trudeau has repeatedly said that the government will not interfere in the process.

Nine days after Meng’s arrest, China detained two Canadians on allegations that they were endangering the country’s national security. It also increased another Canadian’s sentence on drug trafficking charges from 15 years to the death penalty.

China has not linked the moves to Meng’s detention, but the fallout has nonetheless been a diplomatic chill between Canada and China in recent months.

Kudlow acknowledged as much on Sunday, saying he appreciates the Canadian government sticking to its guns by not allowing Meng — or the detained Canadians — to become bargaining chips in wider trade discussions.

“Is it part of the overall trade landscape, if you will? Yes. But it’s principally a legal matter and not a trade matter,” Kudlow said.

The notes are being sought by the legal team defending the former vice chief of the defence staff against a single charge of breach of trust. Norman is accused of leaking cabinet secrets in relation to a shipbuilding deal.

The subpoenas were issued by the court at the request of Toronto lawyer Marie Henein, who is preparing a motion to dismiss the case on the basis of alleged political interference.

The court order for notes includes both the prime minister and Butts, and also Trudeau's Chief of Staff Katie Telford, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick and Zita Astravas, chief of staff to Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan.

Henein told the court Friday she views obtaining those notes as a ""high priority"" for the defence.

""These requests have been outstanding for some time,"" she said. ""I just want to make sure we're moving to the top of list the material that may be relevant to the abuse of process motion.""

Justice Heather Perkins-McVey noted that Wernick ""has been quite busy this week"" — a reference to the clerk's testimony Thursday before the House of Commons justice committee, which is investigating allegations of political interference in the prosecution of SNC Lavalin.

At a pretrial hearing on Friday, the Department of Justice indicated officials are still in the process of collecting the notes and could not say when they will be turned over.

""We've made it a priority, along with some other priority tasks,"" said Robert MacKinnon, the Department of Justice lawyer who is shepherding the disclosure of federal government documents. ""I think you can appreciate everyone is working at full speed.""

Focused request

Henein asked the court last October to force the government to deliver up communications between the Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council, which supports and advises Trudeau.

The demand for documents was narrowed on Feb. 1 after Astravas testified at the pretrial hearing last month that she could not recall the substance of any conversations within the PMO about the Norman case while she was a senior official there.

The former commander of the navy is accused of leaking cabinet secrets related to a $668 million shipbuilding deal in 2015. He is one of two people charged in the case; federal procurement official Matthew Matchett also faces a single count of breach of trust.

Henein will present a motion to dismiss the case — citing abuse of process — at the end of March.

Many of the documents being sought by the defence — including items of witness evidence — have not been fully disclosed.

The RCMP conducted many of its interviews in the winter and spring of 2016, two years before Norman was charged. The Crown is obliged to disclose documents and notes the witnesses relied on in giving their statements to police.

The process, however, has been hung up because the government is worried the notes may reveal cabinet secrets. Justice Perkins-McVey has said it's ""baffling"" that the Crown still has not produced the records.

Cases Intersect

Norman's lawyers alleged political interference in the case earlier this month, claiming the Crown had inappropriate conversations with the top lawyer in the Privy Council Office, which supports and advises the prime minister.

The director of public prosecutions vehemently denied the claim in an extraordinary public statement on Feb. 12.

The issue of prosecutorial independence strikes at the heart of the justice system and has been the key factor in the controversy involving SNC Lavalin and former justice minister Jody-Wilson-Raybould.

Wernick, testifying before the House of Commons justice committee on Thursday, tacitly acknowledged both the Norman and SNC cases intersect over the claims of Crown separation.

He twice cited the prosecution of the former vice chief of the defence staff and attempted to assure MPs that the justice system remains solid.

""There is a statutory legal force field around the prosecution function in Canada,"" Wernick said ""We have the strongest protection of independent prosecution that I can think of.

“Neither the current nor the previous attorney general was ever directed by me nor anyone in my office to take a decision in this matter.”

Yesterday, in testimony before the House justice committee, the clerk of the privy council, Michael Wernick, Canada’s top bureaucrat, attacked the original Globe story, saying it “contained errors, unfounded speculation and in some cases [was] simply defamatory.”

He said that on Dec. 19, he spoke to her about the case. “I conveyed to her that a lot of her colleagues and the prime minister were quite anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press about the future of the company, the options that were being openly discussed in the business press about the company moving or closing.”

So the Globe was right, of course. She was pressured—by Wernick, by Trudeau and by his right hand man, Gerry Butts—to overturn the decision of the independent director of public prosecutions, who had concluded that there was no basis to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin.

Wernick said that was not “inappropriate pressure,” that all the talk was “lawful advocacy,” but he would say that, wouldn’t he? He’s the one who applied the pressure. He can hardly now say that it was inappropriate to do so.

The legislation allows for the justice minister to overturn the independent decision of the director of public prosecutions, but to do so she would have had to declare it in the Canada Gazette, publicly undercutting the prosecutor, which might have led to a high-profile resignation, throwing the administration of justice into disrepute.

One of the surprising things about this whole mess is how many well-educated, powerful, astute people thought it was appropriate to put the muscle on Wilson-Raybould to push for a result that would have made all of them look bad.

It seems like they fell prey to groupthink, influenced by the high-priced and effective lobbyists. Note that the chairman of SNC-Lavalin’s board is Kevin Lynch, who held Wernick’s job under Harper. The Laurentian elite had convinced itself that SNC-Lavalin should not be allowed to fail.

I suspect the Prime Minister’s aides did not look closely enough at the law, or were distracted by the pressure to pick up seats in Quebec, which Trudeau needs if he is to win another majority. Premier Francois Legault was pressing Trudeau to come up with a way to save the company, reasonably enough, and Trudeau would dearly like to have Legault’s help in the coming election, in which he is likely to face hostile premiers in Ontario and Alberta.

Trudeau is not a details guy, so he likely asked Wernick and Butts to make this happen. They should have said, “Sorry, boss. That dog won’t hunt. Can we give Legault something on immigration?” Instead, it looks like, they said: “Let me talk to her, see if I can convince her.”

Then, when she wouldn’t come around, they should have said, “You know what, Jody, you were right. Good call.”

Instead, they said: “We are really looking forward to you bringing your skills to play at Veterans Affairs.”

Then came the Globe story, anonymous attacks on Wilson-Raybould from a senior Liberal, the resignation of Wilson-Raybould, the resignation of senior Liberal Butts, a weird cabinet meeting where Wilson-Raybould got to tell her colleagues about the inappropriate pressure and, finally, yesterday, Wernick’s appearance, where he confirmed the original Globe story.

It was a surprising turn of events, not because of what he had to say about the arm-twisting he engaged in, but because of the vivid observations he made about many other things.

Clerks of the privy council usually stay backstage. Because the Liberals have made a hash of this whole thing, communicating excessively and ineffectively without ever confronting the heart of the matter, Wernick had to deliver a soliloquy, doing work that Trudeau should have done.

It was the performance of a lifetime—powerful, emotional and effective—warning against foreign interference in our elections, violent political rhetoric and disrespect for the wise people, like him, for instance, who are running our government.

Wernick, whose back was to the wall, succeeded in producing headlines that had nothing to do with the matter at hand, and asserted—effectively but unconvincingly—that everything he and everybody else did to pressure Wilson-Raybould was appropriate.

I don’t think most law professors would agree with him, but law professors in general prefer the Trudeau government to the alternative, and are unlikely to rally against Trudeau the way they rallied against Stephen Harper when he tangled with Beverley McLachlin.

Wernick succeeded in spinning this mess, throwing up chaff and providing an explanation that people can buy if they are inclined to do so. This will make him a polarizing figure—since he praised Liberals and attacked Conservatives—which is not ideal, but the Liberals were desperate.

Wilson-Raybould will speak next week, and she may yet deliver a damaging blow, but for the first time since the Globe dropped its story, it looks like there may be a way for the Liberals to turn this from a preoccupying crisis to one difficult file among many.

This affair raises serious questions about the competence and judgment of Trudeau’s operation, but there are no indications that anyone was acting to pursue corrupt ends, and the Liberals have time to make a proposition to voters on other matters, if they have the competence and judgment necessary.

For two weeks Canadians have been looking for clear answers as to whether former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was pressured by the Trudeau PMO to help Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution, and for two weeks one of the only people who could provide those answers, Wilson-Raybould herself, has largely remained silent. Any hopes that Wilson-Raybould’s first appearance on the Hill since the controversy erupted might bring clarity were soon dashed.

Wilson-Raybould asked to speak with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau‘s cabinet, but that discussion was held behind closed doors and, well, “cabinet confidentiality.” Then she took her seat in the front row of the government benches and looked either ahead, or down at her three phones, while Trudeau attempted to swat away opposition questions about her, SNC-Lavalin and Gerald Butts‘s resignation as principal secretary the day before. In between she briefly answered reporters questions about the controversy while on her way to an elevator: “As I think people can appreciate or should appreciate, the rules and laws around privilege, around confidentiality, around my responsibility as a member of Parliament, my ethical and professional responsibilities as a lawyer are layered and incredibly complicated.” (CTV News)

She did pop back out of the lift in response to a question about whether she was still a Liberal—”I am a Liberal member of Parliament, thank you“—but didn’t bite at the follow-up: But will you run as a Liberal in the next election? (CBC News video tweet)

Next for Wilson-Raybould is testifying to the Parliamentary justice committee that’s looking into the SNC-Lavalin affair. After initially resisting opposition demands that she be invited to speak—Liberal MP Liberal Randy Boissonnault had earlier accused Conservatives of engaging in a “witch hunt” while his fellow Liberal committee member Iqra Khalid said it was making hay “out of nothing“—the Liberals on the committee reversed course and agreed to a new list of witnesses. Joining Wilson-Raybould will be lawyers, law professors, civil servants and a judge. (CBC News)

Not on the list, much to the dismay of opposition members: Gerald ‘nothing happened but I’m still resigning’ Butts.

It’s wishful thinking to believe the departure of Butts will create a firewall for Trudeau against the SNC-Lavalin controversy, writes Andrew MacDougall, especially if this descends into a he said / she said battle:

Everything might come down to Trudeau’s word—and that of the players in his office—against that of Canada’s first female Indigenous justice minister, and that of her staff. Job one for Trudeau will now be to make sure as much of the battle takes place behind closed doors, away from prying reporters, or anyone else who could transmit the details to Canadians in real-time. A forum like an Ethics Commissioner’s investigation, which usually takes lots of time and leaves no lasting marks, as the investigation into Trudeau’s law-breaking Aga Khan trip proved. (Maclean’s)

Trudeau didn’t only lose his most trusted advisor when Butts stepped down, but one of the driving forces behind the government’s double-headed approach to energy and the environment, writes John Geddes:

Even environmentalist activists who strongly object to the Trudeau government’s approach to the energy-and-environment file don’t doubt that Butts is a believer. “They’ve lost a voice on climate change. His commitment is absolute,” Bruce Cox, who was executive director of Greenpeace Canada from 2005 to 2014, said in an interview. It’s worth noting that Cox says this even though he rejects the way the Liberal government tried, with Butts as its pinnacle strategist, to balance support for Alberta’s oil sector with a national plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions. “I mean, we’re in a climate crisis and they’re buying a pipeline,” Cox scoffs. He’s referring, of course, to the federal government’s $4.5-billion purchase last spring of the Trans Mountain pipeline—which runs from Edmonton to Burnaby, B.C., just up the coast from Vancouver—in a bid to complete a stalled project to triple its capacity. Still, buying the pipeline was, Cox concedes, consistent with what Butts has said in private conversations: “He believes—he’s said it to me personally—that we’re going to pump the oil, but we’re going to do it responsibly and properly.” (Maclean’s)

Another Liberal MP has called it quits. New Brunswick MP T.J. Harvey said he won’t run for reelection this fall, opting instead to return to the private sector. (Twitter)

Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., David MacNaughton sat with Paul Wells for the latest #MacleansLive interview on Tuesday night. Near the end Wells asked MacNaughton if replacing Butts as Trudeau’s principal secretary might be a job for him. Here’s MacNaughton’s nearly two-minute answer where he says a lot of things, but not ‘No’. (Twitter)

Watch the whole interview, in which MacNaughton talked trade, tariffs and why he was telling Canadian officials Donald Trump could win in 2016.

If there ever was a deal to earn Jody Wilson-Raybould‘s silence in the SNC-Lavalin affair as some cynically pondered — specifically, she gets Gerry Butts‘s head on a platter in return for her going easy on the government when she finally speaks — it blew up in spectacular fashion Wednesday.

First, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appeared to extend an offer of peace to Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from cabinet after allegations surfaced that while she was attorney general the PMO had tried but failed to pressure her to help SNC-Lavalin avoid a fraud trial. Trudeau apologized to her, both in a caucus meeting and standing before reporters, for not being “quick enough to condemn, in unequivocal terms, the comments and commentary and cartoons made about her last week.” (CTV News)

Then Trudeau congenially called for an “airing on this situation” so Canadians can “hear the different perspectives in this situation,” a reference to Wilson-Raybould’s expected appearance next week before a parliamentary justice committee. (Canadian Press)

(Side note: even Trudeau seems lost as to where we are in this story, not to mention Wilson-Raybould’s status in the party: “Obviously, she had asked to speak to her fellow, er, her former caucus, sorry, cabinet members, colleagues, and that’s exactly what she did,” he stumbled during a scrum with media.)

Ah, but then in the House Trudeau joined most (but not all) Liberals in voting down an NDP motion that urged the government to launch a public inquiry into the allegations, and for Trudeau to waive solicitor-client privilege so Wilson-Raybould can speak openly about what went down between her and the PMO last year. (The two Liberals to side with the opposition were Nathaniel Erskine-Smith and Wayne Long).

Part way through the voting, Wilson-Raybould rose to share some of her different perspective with the House. After making note of the fact she was abstaining from voting on the motion and amendments because they involved her (she didn’t need to point out that Trudeau wasn’t abstaining, the opposition did that for her) Wilson-Raybould lobbed the steaming spud back to the Prime Minister: “I understand fully that Canadians want to know the truth and want transparency; privilege and confidentiality are not mine to waive and I hope that I have the opportunity to speak my truth.” (Global News)

Cue standing ovation. By the opposition. For a Liberal MP. While the rest of the Liberals sat on their hands.

For what it’s worth — and no one else seems to be claiming to have seen this and perhaps the eye sees what the mind wants it to and it would be a stunning lack of self-awareness if true, but… — after Wilson-Raybould rose to speak, Conservative MP Michelle Rempel tweeted that Trudeau looked at Liberal MP Carla Qualtrough “and both give her a mocking look and shake their heads in disgust.” Alas, no instant replay exists since the pool cameras in the House were fixed on Wilson-Raybould as she spoke, as per the rules. (Twitter)

Anyway, the justice committee hearings are expected to start today. Up first, current Attorney General David Lametti, his deputy Nathalie Drouin, and Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council. (CBC News)

Hey, you know what would help change the subject right about now? A budget. Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced a date of March 19 for the Trudeau government’s last budget before the federal election. While promising to be “fiscally responsible” he indicated the budget will address skills training, millennial housing needs, pharmacare and support for seniors. (Canadian Press)

John Geddes looks the question of what more Morneau can promise on the skills training front, given the government has already promised so much yet delivered so little. (Maclean’s)

In a note apparently to everyone on social media who’d been clamouring for former Conservative MP Tony Clement to resume his sharing ways, Clement returned to Instagram Wednesday and thanked his followers “for allowing me time away from social media as I get my life back in order.” His Twitter and Facebook followers will have to wait, as Clement hasn’t posted any updates since he was booted from the Conservative caucus after sending sexually explicit photos of himself to extortionists.

Worldwide, Canada is held in high regard, due in large part to generations of goodwill, upholding the ideals of human dignity, our unique British and French legal heritage, and enforcement of the rule of law. The rule of law means that there is one law for all and that no one is favoured — especially the powerful and influential at the expense of everyone else.

Canada’s well-deserved reputation is now in jeopardy, as Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin, accused of criminal wrongdoing, appears to be receiving special treatment from the Trudeau government.

Now, the news is swirling about the resignation from cabinet of former justice minister and attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said recently: “The government of Canada did its job and to the clear public standards expected of it.”

But Canadians have questions. What are those standards? What are the criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin? What is a remediation agreement? Why do the Conservative and NDP members on the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice want to hear testimony from all involved under oath? Why is Opposition leader Andrew Scheer demanding disclosure of information and preservation of documents?

As an experienced lawyer and former cabinet minister, I can provide answers to some of these questions. The larger questions, however, must be answered by Trudeau, his cabinet colleagues and his staff.

The standards have been set by the Supreme Court of Canada. Attorneys general must act independently of political pressures when exercising their delegated sovereign authority to initiate, continue or terminate prosecutions.

Justice Marc Rosenberg further summarized them in the “Shawcross” doctrine. Prosecution decisions taken by an attorney general require her to take into account the public interest, allow for her consultation with cabinet colleagues (covered by cabinet confidentiality in any event), but draws the line at taking cabinet or prime minister direction, and specifically does not allow government to put any pressure on an attorney general for political reasons.

The criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin and many of its executives go back several years and have included paying up to $160 million in bribes to government officials to obtain contracts in Libya. Similar previous charges were brought regarding a project in Bangladesh. Several company executives and implicated Canadian public servants have already been convicted or pled guilty to corruption offences.

In 2015, charges were laid against the company itself, and it has publicly claimed the resulting loss of billions of dollars in contracts and share value. If convicted, the company could face a 10-year ban on winning any federal government contracts and a similar ban on any projects financed through the World Bank.

What is a remediation agreement? First, although it is now law, I have seen little comment on how this legislation was passed a mere five months ago. When this legislation came into force as part of an omnibus bill, many in Ottawa referred to it as the “SNC-Lavalin bill.”

For the first time, prosecutors may enter into formal agreements with organizations that self-report wrongdoing or stand accused of having committed crimes, as an alternative to prosecution.

These crimes can be serious, such as bribery, money laundering, theft, forgery or fraud. Criminal prosecution is suspended pending agreed-upon terms and can result in all charges being stayed.

Published reports assert that SNC-Lavalin had been forcefully lobbying for this change in Canada’s criminal law, which by September 2018 was achieved. In October 2018, however, federal prosecutors told SNC-Lavalin that Canada would not negotiate a remediation agreement with it. The company has sought a judicial review of that decision, keeping all issues alive.

In this context, reports recently surfaced of the Trudeau government “heavily pressuring” Wilson-Raybould to drop the criminal prosecution in favour of a remediation agreement that could see all charges dropped.

Only those involved know what actually took place. Was “heavy pressure” applied? What was the nature of that heavy pressure? Who applied the heavy pressure? In what context?

Heavy pressure brought on the attorney general by the prime minister, or anyone on his behalf, to reverse the prosecution’s earlier decision for political gain would certainly breach the Shawcross doctrine.

Why is this a political issue? SNC-Lavalin employs approximately 9,000 Canadians and is seen by some as one of those companies that is too big to fail. But no company is too big to fail.

If a company fails due to its own corrupt dealings as proven, or pled guilty to, in a fair court process, other employers will come forward to do the work at hand. Indeed, SNC-Lavalin operates in a very competitive industry.

There is no doubt that the changes to Canada’s criminal law by the federal Liberal government could benefit the company, but once federal prosecutors refused to offer a remediation agreement, other than judicial review, its only option is for the prosecution to change its mind.

The only person with the authority to direct the prosecution to change its mind is the attorney general.

Canadians deserve answers to this government chaos.

Western Canadians deserve answers as to why the Trudeau government stood by as vibrant, job-creating, ethical companies in the West were allowed to implode, losing tens of thousands of jobs, while special attention was reserved for a company under criminal suspicion with a long history of questionable business practices, but with close ties to the Liberal government.

The prime minister must answer.

Besides that critical race in B.C.'s Burnaby South for Jagmeet Singh, there are two other byelections being held in the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe and Outremont in Quebec.

Burnaby South is one place where all three major parties have been competitive in past elections. The NDP held onto the seat by a hair more than one per cent of the votes in 2015.

The Liberals, who usually put up a strong showing in Burnaby, faced challenges in this campaign.

Their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Singh said he's not taking anything for granted, but he's confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off.

""I think people are very disappointed with what's going on with the Liberal government,"" he said.

He's up against Richard Lee (Liberal), Jay Shin (Conservative) and Laura Lynn Thompson (People's Party).

Singh has been without a seat since he was chosen as leader of the NDP in October 2017. The B.C. riding has been the focus of the party's heaviest campaigning efforts since Singh announced he would run for that seat in August. Expectations are Singh will take the win in this byelection.

But the NDP is also squaring off against the Liberals in another race — to defend former leader Tom Mulcair's seat in the downtown Montreal riding of Outremont.

Outremont

The provincial polls suggest that the Liberals should win the riding easily.

The NDP's support in Quebec has been fading, and the riding was a Liberal stronghold before Mulcair seized it in a 2007 byelection, the first-ever win in the province for the NDP and one that helped set the stage for the Orange Wave that swept the province in 2011.

Countrywide, that Orange Wave is now little more than a ripple. The NDP has been dropping in the polls and now sits at just 14 per cent in the CBC Poll Tracker — a result which, if replicated on election night in October, would be the worst result for the party in nearly 20 years.

The Montreal riding of Outremont (CBC)

Singh also presents unique challenges in Quebec ridings.

Julia Sanchez, the NDP's candidate in Monday's Outremont byelection, told The Canadian Press people in the riding talk to her about climate change, wealth inequality — and sometimes what the leader of her party wears on his head.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is Sikh and wears a turban, making him conspicuously religious in the eyes of a heavily secular province. His French is also weaker than the two previous party leaders, complicating the job of appealing to Quebec voters.

Even in multicultural Outremont, located in the geographic centre of the island of Montreal with one of the largest ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in North America, Singh's religious clothing is on some voters' minds.

""Some people are concerned about [the turban],"" Sanchez said during a recent interview following a candidate debate in the riding. She said when she knocks on doors, ""It's definitely not the main thing people bring up .... It does come up.""

Sanchez is running against Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan, Conservative Jasmine Louras, Bloc candidate Michel Duchesne, PPC candidate James Seale and Green party deputy leader Daniel Green.

York-Simcoe

York-Simcoe is almost certainly a safe Conservative seat. The Tories won it by 45 points in 2011 and still held it by 12 points in 2015 when Stephen Harper was defeated.

Tory candidate Scot Davidson told CBC News on Saturday he's confident the affluent riding will stay blue.

The candidate running beneath the Liberal banner in York–Simcoe, however, said voters in the riding aren't focused on mudslinging in Ottawa.

""To be honest, that's not what we are hearing at the doors. What we're hearing at the doors are issues about families, and the challenges that families face,"" said Shaun Tanaka, who also ran in the 2015 federal election.

""I think what is going to affect the vote are the issues that matter to people in York–Simcoe,"" she said, adding that residents in the riding haven't had a representative in the House of Commons for nearly six months.

The seat has been vacant since Sept. 30, 2018, when former Conservative MPP Peter Van Loan formally retired from politics.

""I think our riding is ready for a change,"" Tanaka told CBC Toronto.

Undoubtedly, the Tories are looking for a major win in York–Simcoe with a federal election looming in October. CBC polls analyst Éric Grenier wrote last month that the riding has been 20 points more Conservative than the rest of the country as a whole in the last three elections.

""If the Conservatives are in a position to form a government, York–Simcoe is the kind of riding they should expect to win with at least 55 per cent of the vote,"" Grenier said in a piece published on Jan. 10.

Though she admits she's facing a steep uphill battle, NDP candidate Jessa McLean said she hopes to ""change how we look at what is possible from our governments and from each other.""

NDP candidate Jessa McLean faces a tough challenge in a riding where the New Democrats have struggled to gain traction. She said her campaign has been about changing the conversation around the important issues in York–Simcoe. (CBC)

Scheer introduced a House of Commons motion Monday afternoon that would demand Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appear at the Commons justice committee to explain his role in allegations former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was pressured not to proceed with a criminal prosecution of Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

“Quite simply what we’ve seen unfold over the last two weeks is a textbook case of government corruption with those at the very top of the Prime Minister’s Office implicated in what could very well be the obstruction of justice,” Scheer said in a news conference before introducing the motion. Scheer said Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick’s testimony to the justice committee last week made it clear that SNC-Lavalin successfully lobbied the government for the Criminal Code to be changed to allow for remediation agreements. Those allow companies to avoid a criminal prosecution in exchange for accepting responsibility for wrongdoing, paying fines and reparation to any victims, relinquishing any financial benefit from the actions and showing changes to prevent misdeeds from being repeated. Striking such an agreement would mean SNC-Lavalin could avoid a criminal prosecution in Canada for allegations it bribed officials in Libya to win contracts there.

Scheer said the Liberals launched “an unsolicited, co-ordinated and sustained effort by the PM himself to get the former attorney general to change her decision. “Canadians need to be outraged at the suggestion that politicians were putting pressure on independent agents of the Crown, independent legal officers, to try to get a better deal for well connected friends of the Liberal party,” Scheer said. “That is unacceptable and we need to be outraged about this because of the implications it has on the entire justice system across the country.”

The Liberals don’t appear ready to support the Conservative motion to call Trudeau to testify. The motion would not be binding in any event, and a Commons committee can’t summon a sitting MP to appear before it. Arif Virani, the Liberal parliamentary secretary to the minister of justice, said in the House of Commons there isn’t a need for the Commons to inject itself into the proceedings of the justice committee. If the committee wants to call certain witnesses the committee members can decide who they want to hear from, he said. “Committees of this house do exemplary work,” said Virani. “We’re confident that the committee hearings will continue to be thoroughly and fairly conducted and will provide Canadians with the answers and information that they seek.” Thus far the committee has heard from Wernick, deputy justice minister Nathalie Drouin and current Justice Minister David Lametti. Lametti replaced Wilson-Raybould in the job in January, when she was shuffled to veterans affairs. She resigned from cabinet altogether a few days after the allegations of improper pressure were first raised, but continues to sit as a Liberal MP. She is expected to testify at the committee this week but no date or time has been confirmed. Trudeau denies any improper conduct occurred and that any conversations on the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin were done with Wilson-Raybould knowing the final decision was hers alone.

Was it effective?,"The United We Roll convoy is heading back west after a two-day protest on Parliament Hill to complain that the federal government's energy and environmental policies are hurting Alberta's beleaguered oil and gas sector.

But critics are divided on whether or not the convoy was as effective as it could have been, given that some of its participants seemed more interested in protesting Ottawa's immigration policies than arguing for specific fixes for Alberta's oilpatch.

​The United We Roll convoy started its journey in Red Deer, Alta., on Feb. 14 and made stops and held rallies along the way to the nation's capital.

It arrived in Ottawa on Tuesday morning. It held rallies on Parliament Hill, featuring speeches from Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, among others.

Lori Williams, an associate professor of policy studies at Calgary's Mount Royal University, says the convoy succeeded in raising the profile of some of the concerns among Albertans, specifically that the rest of the country seems to take for granted Alberta's economic contribution.

""But the problem was some of the participants were engaging in messages that were arguably racist, questions about that racism got raised, and then it became a matter of defending whether they were racists or not,"" she said. ""Now that's not the message they wanted to focus on.""

United We Roll Convoy head organizer Glen Carritt says the participants and their supporters were mainly grassroots Canadians frustrated with a federal government they believe is not addressing their concerns. (CBC)

Glen Carritt, lead organizer of the protests and owner of an oilfield fire and safety company in Innisfail, Alta., told CBC Radio's The Current the protesters want the Liberal government to scrap the carbon tax and two pieces of legislation now before the Senate. Bill C-69 would overhaul how Canada does environmental assessments of energy projects. Bill C-48 would ban oil tankers from loading or unloading at ports on the northern coast of B.C.

But many participants also held signs protesting Canada signing on to a non-binding UN compact on global migration. The 36-page document lays out a collaborative approach to dealing with growing global migration and has 23 objectives for treating migrants humanely and efficiently.

Scheer opposes Canada's participation, warning it could erode Ottawa's sovereign authority to make decisions on immigration. But the UN document has also become a magnet for extremist and even racist anti-immigrant elements.

Carritt, who is also an Innisfail council member, maintains that his convoy was made up of, and supported by, grassroots Canadians who are simply fed up with a federal government they believe is disconnected from their concerns — and that there are legitimate reasons to oppose the UN migration compact.

Violence rejected

He said the movement is open to anyone angry with the Liberal government, as long as their actions are not violent.

""We've been having rallies out in Alberta for four months and, you know, they're just not listening to us out here. So, you know, we wanted to get this convoy out there so that our government would realize that Canada is connected and reunited, and what this convoy proved was that that is what happened.""

Another convoy was originally created by a group that calls itself Canada Action, which cancelled the plan and refunded thousands of dollars in donations after that effort became associated with extremist elements in the Yellow Vests Canada movement.

Carritt originally referred to his convoy as a ""yellow vest convoy"" but renamed it United We Roll after it, too, was linked to people spewing hateful rhetoric against Muslims and immigrants.

Former Alberta MP Monte Solberg, who served as a Conservative cabinet minister, also spoke on CBC Radio's The Current. He said it's not unusual for anti-immigrant sentiment to creep into such debates.

'It's an old story'

""Well, it's an old story. I mean, whenever the economy is bad, we seem to see people reach for this and it's unfortunate. You know immigration has been one of the things that made Canada unique and strong, and a lot has been done to ensure that the immigration system in Canada is one that really helps build the economy,"" he said.

""But it's also true that people have legitimate concerns about people walking across the border, and the prime minister's very unfortunate tweet about welcoming people to Canada.""

Williams said the convoy seemed to come to Ottawa with very strong demands, but not a lot of clarity or realism about what they'd like to be done.

""You can have lots of people with lots of energy, but if the message isn't clear, then that detracts from the point that they're trying to make,"" she said.

""The image, if you like, of sort of redneck Albertans could have been exacerbated by some of the people that participated in this protest. On the other hand, it sounds like a lot of people heard a message that they hadn't heard before.""",Controversial convoy rolls back to Alberta as some wonder: Did the message get lost?,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/convoy-success-mixed-messages-united-roll-ottawa-alberta-williams-solberg-1.5028399

The Liberal government has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported on Feb. 7 that officials had pressured former minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc escape with a fine rather than face trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. SNC has declined to comment.

Wilson-Raybould, who was demoted in January, resigned last week. She has said nothing so far about the matter.

The House of Commons justice committee met on Tuesday behind closed doors to discuss whom to question about the affair and Liberal legislator Iqra Khalid tweeted that she would invite Wilson-Raybould to appear.

“I respect the justice committee and I will appear,” Wilson-Raybould told the CBC television, adding she was still consulting lawyers to see how much she could say.

A date for her appearance has not been confirmed but officials said it could be as early as Thursday.

The same committee, on which the Liberals hold a majority, last week decided not to hear from her, prompting opposition accusations of a cover-up.

Wilson-Raybould in an unusual move met with members of the cabinet on Tuesday. She declined to give details.

Trudeau’s office did not immediately respond to questions about whether a deal had been struck with the former minister to spare the government embarrassment.

Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s principal private secretary and one of the architects of the Liberals’ surprise 2015 election win, quit on Monday while insisting he had done nothing wrong.

Underlining the extent of Trudeau’s problems, a new poll showed his ruling center-left Liberals had slipped behind their main rivals ahead of an election in October. Opposition parties are demanding a public inquiry.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition center-right Conservatives, told the House of Commons that the resignation of Butts would not clear up the matter.

“This is not an ordinary political scandal. Something more sinister is at play here ... if a crime has been committed, those responsible must be punished,” he said, suggesting officials may have obstructed justice.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News taken after Wilson-Raybould’s resignation showed the Liberals support had dropped four percentage points since December to 34 percent, with the Conservatives up two points at 36 percent.

The survey suggests that if an election were held now, no party would have enough legislators to form a stable government.

A Trudeau spokeswoman said no decision had been taken on who would replace Butts.

One potential candidate is David MacNaughton, the influential Canadian ambassador to Washington who helped successfully negotiate the renewal of a continental trade pact last year, said two well-placed Liberals.

MacNaughton, 70, enjoys cabinet level status inside the Trudeau government and also has experience of working with Katie Telford, Trudeau’s chief of staff.

But during a typical, frigid week in Ottawa and a somewhat quiet time in federal politics, with the House of Commons on break, the Prime Minister’s Office handed the Scheer Tories a shiny scandal.

Jody Wilson-Raybould, once held up by the Liberals as a symbol of diversity – she was Canada’s first Indigenous justice minister – has quickly become a thorn in the side of Justin Trudeau and threatens to hurt his re-election chances come October.

Her resignation from cabinet came just one day after the prime minister tried to deflect criticism his office may have tried to influence her decision in a case involving SNC-Lavalin when she was still justice minister and attorney general, a role from which she had been moved in a recent shuffle. At the time, he told reporters he had full-confidence in Wilson-Raybould and “her presence in cabinet should actually speak for itself.”

But her resignation, his ever-changing story and Sunday’s surprise resignation of top adviser Gerald Butts has said more. The ethics commissioner has launched an investigation, which could take months, but the political fallout has begun in earnest, with both opposition parties circling.

Nothing has been proven but with an election looming, English philosopher Aldous Huxley sums it up best: “There are things known and there are things unknown, and in between are the doors of perception.”

While Scheer and his Conservatives have spent months looking for a “door” to victory, sticking to the right-of-centre and even sometimes the fringes, Trudeau has now handed Scheer the middle ground to be mined for support – an empty net late in the third, despite the game being tied.

Scheer had already been gaining ground in a number of surveys over the past six months, including in an Abacus Data year-end assessment, which found government approval slightly down and disapproval slightly up. At the start of the year, Abacus also found 40 per cent would like to see Scheer become prime minister.

Centre-minded voters will likely find it hard to support a leader and party who has pounded the drum for the middle class, but who, in the background, may have been courting Canada’s most powerful and corporate beings to keep them out of trouble.

The problem Scheer faces, however, is that he has handled every issue (and non-issue) the same: He would do the opposite of Trudeau, and everything is a scandal. This makes it harder for voters to separate the real issues from the “faux outrage” and give him credibility.

Scheer has handled every issue (and non-issue) the same: He would do the opposite of Trudeau, and everything is a scandal.

That’s not to say Scheer is the only leader to ever overplay his hand, as was fairly frequent for the NDP and Liberals when Stephen Harper occupied 24 Sussex Drive.

But given the frequency with which Scheer and his MPs have called for investigations and displayed outrage over not-so-serious matters, this will no doubt present centre-minded voters with a question: “Is this really THAT serious? Or is this just more grandstanding?”

Just as some voters would choose a red or orange houseplant against any Conservatives up for election, the same is true on the other side of the spectrum, so Scheer needs to keep independents in mind. He’s already won the anti-Trudeau crowd.

Former prime minister Jean Chrétien, known as a master of the middle ground in politics, spoke of the perils of too much criticism at a 2015 event, noting that as a political leader “ … if you speak too much, no one will listen to you. It’s better to keep yourself for an important occasion.”

Similarly, my mom (our household PM) always repeated the adage “it’s better to remain silent and thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.”

Scheer needs to be careful he’s not shooting himself in the foot. He needs to let Trudeau do the damage himself.

The House of Commons resumed sitting again this week, and the twists and turns have continued in the Wilson-Rayould/SNC-Lavalin affair.

The federal election is Oct. 21. Stock up on popcorn. It’s going to be a doozy of a year in Canadian politics.

413,Empty,2019-02-20T23:29:34Z,We do know that Trudeau apologized to Wilson-Raybould for not condemning in unequivocal terms the comments and cartoons in which she was disparaged,"The self-preservation instinct has kicked in for members of the governing Liberal party.

Prior to the regular caucus meeting Wednesday, MPs warned darkly of a potential riot by unhappy backbenchers.

But after former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould addressed the weekly gathering, MPs emerged to proclaim themselves satisfied with the situation. “It was immensely respectful,” said one MP.

Honourable members in the unfamiliar surroundings of West Block walked into closets, as they sought sanctuary from the glare of the cameras on the way out.

Even Ralph Goodale found himself trying to exit through a fire escape — apparently in his 30 years on Parliament Hill, he was never based in West Block so requires a GPS to navigate, like the rest of us who have been relocated during renovations to Centre Block.

He was more vocal than most of his colleagues, saying he did not believe that undue influence had been exerted on Wilson-Raybould and that the whole SNC-Lavalin saga might come down to a difference of interpretation — presumably between Wilson-Raybould and Justin Trudeau’s former principal secretary, Gerald Butts.

I understand fully that Canadians want to know the truth and want transparency. Privilege and confidentiality are not mine to waive

The closing of Liberal ranks makes sense. There was frustration in cabinet and in caucus at the bush-league way the SNC file has been handled — and at the failure to communicate with MPs. A new Leger poll found 41 per cent of Canadians think the prime minister has done something wrong and another 41 per cent aren’t sure. Many Liberal MPs would fall into the latter group — hence their insistence that Wilson-Raybould was allowed to speak to them.

We don’t know what was said but the mood was noticeably calmer on the way out than it was on the way in.

We do know that Trudeau apologized to Wilson-Raybould for not condemning in unequivocal terms the comments and cartoons in which she was disparaged. “They were absolutely unacceptable and I should have done it sooner,” he said.

If that was intended as a peace token, it was only partially accepted. Wilson-Raybould later abstained from a vote in the House calling for a public inquiry into the affair because she deemed herself to be in a conflict of interest. “I understand fully that Canadians want to know the truth and want transparency. Privilege and confidentiality are not mine to waive, and I hope that I have the opportunity to speak my truth,” she said, portentously.

But there is no upside for any Liberal, including Wilson-Raybould, in escalating this fight.

It seems clear she felt obliged to discount the political and economic consequences of a continued prosecution in her decision not to intervene

She wants the opportunity to have her say in public, which she will get at the Commons justice committee next week. But we can probably expect a tighter version of events than might have been the case if she had been exiled by Trudeau.

Aside from her personal political ambitions, she is more aware than most of a point made by Liberal MP Robert Falcon-Ouellette at a recent caucus meeting, when he said this government is all in on the Indigenous file and that if it doesn’t get it right, no government in the near future is ever going to take it on again.

In question period, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer noted that the director of public prosecutions announced on Sept. 4 last year that her office would not negotiate a remediation deal with SNC-Lavalin; that on Sept. 17, it came up at a meeting between the then-attorney general and Trudeau; and that on Dec. 5, Wilson-Raybould met Butts to discuss the issue. Did the prime minister express support for the idea that SNC qualified for a deal, effectively ending the criminal prosecution, Scheer asked.

There was, needless to say, no answer at the end of it all — Trudeau repeated his mantra of the day, that his government defended jobs while respecting the integrity of the justice system.

But, on the available information, it would seem the meeting between the then-attorney general and Butts on Dec. 5 is at the heart of the matter.

Butts believed it was reasonable for cabinet to consider a policy option that would potentially protect thousands of jobs at SNC-Lavalin, which is facing being barred from Canadian federal contracts for 10 years if convicted on corruption charges.

What we don’t know is how forcibly he expressed that opinion to Wilson-Raybould. He denies categorically that he or anyone else in the Prime Minister’s Office pressured her. “We honoured the unique role of the attorney general,” he said in his resignation statement Monday.

We may find out next week if Wilson-Raybould has the same recollection of events. It seems clear she felt obliged to discount the political and economic consequences of a continued prosecution in her decision not to intervene.

Another thing we do know is that the system worked: the prosecution of SNC is proceeding, pending an appeal by the company.

Yet, we may be reaching the denouement of a drama that has dominated the national political stage for two weeks. For the government it has been a tragedy, for the opposition a comedy.

Mel Brooks was talking about physical farce when he defined the difference, but it applies equally to politics. “Tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you fall into an open sewer and die.”

The Liberal caucus has indicated it has had enough of being laughed at, and reminded Trudeau they are the source of much of his power.

For all his talk about empowering MPs, his caucus management has, by many accounts, been abysmal. MPs rarely get an audience with their leader and the Hill Times reported that some have been shut down in the weekly caucus meeting by the prime minister because he didn’t agree with their views.

Trudeau’s failure to reassure Canadians gave birth to sedition in caucus but Liberals appear to have come together to bury the hatchet.

The suspicion is it may end up being buried in the back of Gerald Butts, as he exits the political stage.

414,Empty,2019-02-19T22:28:43Z,"For no good reason, his staff took a huge chunk of Trudeau’s feminist and reconciliation bona fides and ran them through the woodchipper","One assumes Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would prefer still to have Gerald Butts as his high-profile adviser. Close friends since their McGIll days, they went on a six-and-a-half year journey together that saw Trudeau romp his way to victory in the 2013 Liberal leadership race, then win a comfortable majority government in Ottawa. Butts resigned Monday amidst the Jody Wilson-Raybould/SNC-Lavalin mess with the Liberals in perfectly good position to win another majority next fall. And depending on how things shake out, he could wind up a key player in that campaign.

This is an opportunity for wholesale re-evaluation, though. And looking back on the dizzying past two weeks, nothing deserves more re-evaluation than the reputation of anyone involved whose business card says “strategist,” “political adviser,” or anything of the sort. The mess Trudeau’s team made of this file beggars belief.

To recap: Responding to a bombshell Globe and Mail story, Trudeau denies that he or anyone in his office “directed” Wilson-Raybould to abandon the SNC-Lavalin prosecution. But no one alleged he had; the allegation was of improper pressure, influence or suasion. It takes many subsequent hours before Liberal MP Marco Mendicino, for some reason, flatly denies the actual allegation.

The mess Trudeau’s team made of this file beggars belief

Anonymous “senior government officials” then concede there might well have been “vigorous debate” involving Wilson-Raybould and the PMO, but that it didn’t amount to “pressure.” And in any event, the Globe reported, “another (anonymous) official said the PMO had every right to raise the prosecution case with the justice minister … because a conviction could destroy the company and hurt thousands of workers.”

So nothing bad happened. But perhaps the bad thing isn’t really that bad. Righty-o.

Trudeau then belatedly reveals that he personally had discussed SNC-Lavalin with Wilson-Raybould — but that it was mutually understood the decision whether on not to prosecute was hers. He adds that Wilson-Raybould is not unhappy with the government. “Her presence in cabinet should actually speak for itself,” he said.

This effectively forces Wilson-Raybould, whom everyone knew was unhappy — witness her remarkable post-demotion manifesto — to resign, which she did hours later, making everything worse.

Trudeau then tries to turn it back on Wilson-Raybould: If she had been pressured then “it was her responsibility to come forward to me this past fall and highlight that directly to me.” He was “puzzled” that she had not done so, yet felt the need to resign.

Charging in from left field, Commons justice committee chairman Anthony Housefather suggests in a CTV interview that Wilson-Raybould might have gotten the boot for insufficient fluency in French. He later apologizes, explaining that he had just been BS-ing. Perhaps he thought that was allowed now.

Trudeau then suggests Wilson-Raybould would actually still be in cabinet had Scott Brison not retired. The Treasury Board president resigns so you demote the justice minister? Baffling. Also, he had just finished suggesting Wilson-Raybould might have failed in an important ministerial responsibility!

At the very least one of them deserves to lose his job. There’s no obvious reason why it shouldn’t be Butts

At least he puts his name to the charge. As soon as this all starts going pear shaped, various anonymous Liberal sources begin describing Wilson-Raybould as demanding, pushy, self-centred, and various other adjectives that to great numbers of Trudeau supporters connote people who just can’t stand successful women. Basically, over the course of a few days, for no good reason, everyone involved took a huge chunk of Trudeau’s feminist and reconciliation bona fides and ran them through the woodchipper. At the very least one of them deserves to lose his job. There’s no obvious reason why it shouldn’t be Butts.

It’s not as if this is the Trudeau PMO’s first epic screw-up. It’s still astonishing to think a group of highly paid and ostensibly intelligent political advisers somehow allowed the prime minister of Canada to swan off on vacation to the Aga Khan’s island without so much as consulting the integrity commissioner. They should have locked him in a basement until he promised not to go; instead they seemed baffled that people seemed to care about little things like conflicts of interest.

As it so often is with this gang, it gave the impression of people who just aren’t quite of the same world the rest of us inhabit — who even after three years have no idea what’s going to land well and what’s going to blow up in their faces. Part of the problem might be that for so long, a lot of things that could have blown up or landed flat instead yielded unfailing standing ovations and fawning coverage for the boss man.

“Because it’s 2015” was a stupid, glib line that raised more questions than it answered; he’d get savaged for it today. It’s 2019, his office can’t manage a piss-up in a brewery, and people who were near-cultish partisans just weeks ago are now heard comparing him favourably to Andrew Scheer. Much more of the country suddenly, belatedly seems to see Trudeau as the conventional, gaffe-prone politician he is. He might want to hire some of those as staffers.

The Conservatives and NDP want Trudeau to waive that privilege so Wilson-Raybould can offer her side of the story.

Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from cabinet last week, has said she cannot comment because she is bound by solicitor-client privilege, which still applies even though she’s no longer the justice minister and attorney general.

Federal opposition parties resumed their demands this week that Trudeau let former cabinet minister Jody Wilson-Raybould speak to allegations that she felt pressured to avert a criminal trial for Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

Spoiler alert: The Canadian Press Baloney Meter is a dispassionate examination of political statements culminating in a ranking of accuracy on a scale of “no baloney” to “full of baloney” (complete methodology below).

So is it true that revealing the discussions between Wilson-Raybould and the prime minister or members of his staff and cabinet have “unintended consequences” on the two cases?

Those involve the fraud and bribery case against SNC-Lavalin in connection with its work in Libya nearly a decade ago, and the company’s appeal of the decision by federal prosecutors not to negotiate an agreement that would let it avoid a criminal trial in that case.

But in response to such a demand from Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer during question period on Tuesday, the prime minister said doing so could harm two court proceedings involving SNC-Lavalin.

SNC-Lavalin is facing fraud and bribery charges in relation to business ties between it and Moammar Gadhafi’s regime in Libya and could be excluded from future government contracts here and elsewhere if convicted.

The federal justice minister is unique in that whoever holds the position is also the attorney general, the government’s top lawyer. In that vein, the government can consult the attorney general for legal advice and those discussions can be protected from disclosure.

But the Globe and Mail first reported this month, citing unnamed sources, that Wilson-Raybould felt pressured last fall to intervene and get federal prosecutors to offer the company a deal that would see it pay a fine rather than face a criminal trial. She refused.

Federal prosecutors in October rejected SNC-Lavalin’s request to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement and pay for the criminal case to be dropped. The company has since appealed that decision and is waiting to find out whether a court will hear its request for a review.

These are the two cases Trudeau mentioned in response to Scheer.

The Liberals have admitted to numerous private discussions about SNC-Lavalin, including a meeting that Wilson-Raybould had with Trudeau in September and another between her and Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former principal secretary, in December.

Trudeau and Butts have denied directing or otherwise pressuring Wilson-Raybould, who was shuffled out as justice minister and attorney general to veterans affairs last month in a move widely seen as a demotion. She resigned from cabinet Feb. 12.

While Wilson-Raybould has refused to talk about those discussions publicly, citing solicitor-client privilege, she says she has hired former Supreme Court judge Thomas Cromwell to advise her on what she can say.

Trudeau has similarly said that he is consulting Wilson-Raybould’s replacement, Justice Minister David Lametti, on what parts of their conversation can be safely revealed.

WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY

Whether solicitor-client privilege applies to interactions between the attorney general and other officials depends on the circumstances — and when it is invoked, the circumstances that give rise to the claim of privilege should be spelled out, says Toronto lawyer Lee Akazaki of Gilbertson Davis LLP.

That hasn’t happened in this case, aside from Trudeau saying that he told Wilson-Raybould that the decision whether to stop SNC-Lavalin’s prosecution was up to her and that the potential economic ramifications of a guilty verdict for a major company were raised.

That makes it hard to asses the degree to which waiving solicitor-client privilege could affect the criminal case and judicial review.

Assuming the attorney general was asked for advice about the ongoing prosecution, Akazaki says that advice “should be kept confidential in order to prevent any appearance of interference by the executive branch of government in an ongoing judicial proceeding.”

That is particularly relevant in a criminal case or judicial review such as those facing SNC-Lavalin, said Andrew Martin, an expert on legal ethics at the University of British Columbia, who added that once privilege has been waived it can’t be restored.

“I imagine it would inform SNC-Lavalin’s arguments on the judicial review, depending on what was said,” Martin said, “and they could probably use what was said as part of their application for judicial review.”

University of Ottawa law expert Elizabeth Sanderson, who previously served for many years as a federal-government lawyer, echoed the view that SNC-Lavalin’s lawyers could turn around and use any disclosed conversations between Wilson-Raybould and others in their defence.

All of which assumes, she said, that the discussions did touch on the details of the case and were not simply an attempt by Trudeau or his staff to get the former attorney-general to use her powers to intervene.

“There’s a real distinction between talking about the evidence or the legal opinion they developed to say why they think they have to pursue this case, which may reveal some of their strategy in litigation, versus a flat-out: ‘Don’t pursue this case.’ Which has nothing to do with the case.”

THE VERDICT

Any analysis of the prime minister’s assertion about the impact of waiving solicitor-client privilege is muddied by the fact neither Wilson-Raybould nor Trudeau have elaborated on the nature and context of the discussions that took place around the SNC-Lavalin case.

Still, the fact the case was discussed at the highest levels of government does raise the very real prospect that the contents of those discussions could have an impact on the proceedings and thus any waiver should be carefully considered.

“I think what he said is quite fair,” said Martin. “Don’t get me wrong, it’s politically convenient. I don’t know that he’s unhappy with this answer. But it is the correct answer.”

Akazaki said it is imperative the government provide more information about the nature of the discussions between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould, but that when it comes to the prime minister’s comment: “Based on what we know at the present time, it is accurate.”

The statement is correct based on what the prime minister has said, but he’s keeping crucial details to himself. For that reason, Trudeau’s comment ranks as “a little baloney.”

METHODOLOGY

The Baloney Meter is a project of The Canadian Press that examines the level of accuracy in statements made by politicians. Each claim is researched and assigned a rating based on the following scale:

No baloney — the statement is completely accurate

A little baloney — the statement is mostly accurate but more information is required

This is a political scandal, not a business one.","Canada cannot afford the damage that the SNC-Lavalin affair is doing to this country in undermining its government.

What the mob thirsts for is not good government in itself, but the merry chase of a definite exponent of bad government. — H.L. Mencken

Monday’s resignation of Gerald Butts , principal secretary to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the PM’s top political adviser, should mark an end to this government’s self-destructive conduct in the SNC-Lavalin case.

And it must do so — quickly.

A Trudeau government that has stood up to Donald Trump, to the police state that is China and to a thuggish Saudi Crown Prince should be able to hold itself accountable for its conduct in dealing with a special pleader here at home.

Butts’ departure is momentous. The PM’s chief of staff and his principal secretary are second in power and responsibility only to the PM. They are central to policy development and guidance to cabinet officers on its execution.

As everyone knows, Wilson-Raybould was inexplicably demoted from Justice last month and abruptly resigned cabinet altogether Feb. 12.

The casualty count is mounting in this debacle. It has also cost the government one of its top cabinet officers, Jody Wilson-Raybould. She is said to have been pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to favour SNC-Lavalin when she was the federal justice minister.

Another casualty is the 108-year-old SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., based in Montreal and one of the world’s leading engineering and construction firms.

What is routinely labelled “the SNC-Lavalin scandal” is no such thing. The company’s more than 50,000 employees, including about 9,000 Canadians, are global Canadian ambassadors building essential infrastructure in some 50 countries.

This is a political scandal, not a business one.

True, for several years, about a decade ago, a small number of SNC-Lavalin employees and foreign contract agents working to secure projects for the company are alleged to have engaged in bribery and other improprieties at home and abroad. Criminal charges against the firm dating from that period remain outstanding.

The scandal arises from the feds’ response to SNC-Lavalin’s efforts to negotiate a remediation agreement to pay for its past sins and avoid potentially devastating criminal prosecution.

The malefactors in SNC-Lavalin’s alleged misconduct are long gone from the company. The firm’s previous management and board of directors were swept out.

Today’s SNC-Lavalin is a leader in exemplary ethical conduct. It also stays out of countries where bribery and other improper conduct is the norm, forfeiting business in a large part of the world.

No, the current scandal lies entirely with the Trudeau government.

Did it improperly pressure the federal justice minister to act on behalf of a special interest, an SNC-Lavalin seeking a remediation deal?

Canada, the U.S. and Britain have adopted the remediation process to expeditiously resolve long-standing charges of improper corporate conduct, so that enterprises can pay their debt to society and move on.

Last year, Parliament enacted “deferred prosecution agreements” (DPAs) enabling companies like SNC-Lavalin to negotiate remediation deals. For a cogent primer on DPAs, my colleague Jennifer Wells provides one here.

The remediation process is meant to be punitive.

It requires companies to pay large financial penalties, remain under Crown supervision and implement ethics reforms. The latter wouldn’t be required of SNC-Lavalin. It has already undergone one of the most wrenching ethical and corporate-culture overhauls in Canadian corporate history.

Yet for reasons not explained, the opportunity to negotiate a remediation agreement has been withheld from SNC-Lavalin — though DPAs have been extended to the company’s rivals in other jurisdictions.

Finally, let’s be clear on how this scandal unfolded.

Neil Bruce, turnaround CEO at SNC-Lavalin, has been relentless in seeking from Ottawa a remediation agreement. At stake are billions of dollars in federal contracts that SNC-Lavalin would be ineligible to bid on if it is subjected to a criminal trial that ends in a conviction.

The intensity of Bruce’s campaign cannot be overstated. Bruce pressed his case for a remediation agreement personally with Justin Trudeau, Tory Leader Andrew Scheer, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Green Party Leader Elizabeth May.

The whirlwind of special pleading by SNC-Lavalin in Ottawa may be unprecedented. And Bruce wasn’t alone in creating it. Two Quebec premiers and many Montreal business leaders joined in, due to SNC-Lavalin’s status as a pillar of Quebec Inc.

At the centre of that vortex was Jody Wilson-Raybould, then the federal justice minister. Her former ministry oversees the Public Prosecution Service of Canada (PPSC), which decides on DPA cases.

This is quite a spectacle we are enduring.

It appears that Trudeau gave insufficient assurance to Wilson-Raybould that she was truly independent of politics in her decision-making. We can well imagine how confusing Trudeau was in his several talks with her on SNC-Lavalin, given his dissembling since the scandal broke Feb. 7.

It is also possible that the PPSC has been a stickler in its regulatory powers. Actually, the formidable character of Kathleen Roussel, the Director of Public Prosecutions, suggests that Zeus could not sway her.

Canadians cannot afford to wait for planned investigations of this scandal by a Commons committee and the federal ethics commissioner. We need answers now from the government, so that it, like SNC-Lavalin, can move on. What remains of the government’s credibility is evaporating.

Justin Trudeau needs to be forthright about his actions. In this matter he has obfuscated like any dime-store political hack who has been caught out. We need candour from him, now.

Trudeau needs immediately to waive solicitor-client privilege so that Jody Wilson-Raybould can tell Canadians exactly what pressure was put on her, by whom and when, in the SNC-Lavalin case.

And David Lametti, Wilson-Raybould’s successor as justice minister, must demand from Kathleen Roussel an explanation on why she rejected a negotiated remediation for SNC-Lavalin, so that it can satisfy the PPSC’s demands and redeem itself.

This isn’t the place to detail Canada’s laggard progress on global warming, Native Canadian living conditions, hallway medical treatment, and so on.

But the merry chase is distracting Canada from urgent business. Only Justin Trudeau can end it, and he will be judged by how quickly he does so.

You’re lucky, I replied. I just can’t keep the ice in my drinks from melting – just one of the hardships at our all-inclusive resort in the Caribbean.

That got me thinking that I really should share all my difficulties so that you understand what I’m going through down here while you cope with snow and frostbite. (I check the Canadian weather every day; that’s just how thoughtful I am.)

First of all, before you leave for a Caribbean destination, you have to decide where to go that has a government you don’t feel obliged to boycott, or a hurricane season corresponding with the vacation days you have to use up.

You’re now on the plane but have to wait while they de-ice it. And there are no more free snacks for coach class!

First of all, before you leave for a Caribbean destination, you have to decide where to go that has a government you don’t feel obliged to boycott.

You finally arrive, and after a big inhale of tropical air, it’s crash time in your room –after confronting the 500 pillows on the bed and the towels in the shape of swans, sprinkled with flower petals. The room doors have banners reading Return Guest or Anniversary or Honeymoon.

The first challenge here begins early, and it takes you a day or two to learn it. It’s called Claiming a Deck Chair. Do you want chairs in the sun in the shade? You have to take extra pieces of clothing or books and place them on the chairs in order to claim them as yours.

So far, none of our “stakes” has gone missing, even the most impressive ones such as inflatable floating devices for children. A simple round ring is so “last year.” We have seen giant inflatable unicorns, small unicorns, large ducks, small ducks, rings made to look like doughnuts, rafts, or sun and fish.

Then it’s time for the breakfast buffet. Do you know how hard it is avoid overeating when it’s all free, and presented beside carved watermelons? And your empty plates are removed so quickly you can’t even remember that your first course was chocolate croissant, your second was mango and guava, and your third was a made-to-order omelette.

After breakfast, it’s time to claim your beach chair. You have to be out of your hotel room while weekly fumigation takes place. You haven’t seen any bugs, so it must be working.

In the afternoon, you must hone your skills fending off aggressive souvenir vendors after a warm-up fending off excursion and resort amenity sales staff.

Another hardship is the period between lunch and dinner set-up, when the buffet is inaccessible and you have to acquire food and drink from the swim-up bar or seaside grill or Coco Café or the lobby bar.

In the evening, there’s music and dancing, with dancing for children first. What sympathy I have for the staff who have to do the same dances with different children every night, and the same crafts at the young Explorers’ Club! But think how hard it is for us to get the children back after experiencing adult deck chair freedom.

And finally, you know how hard it is to type this on my iPhone without tipping my floating unicorn?

So you can see that it is really hard for those of us who help cut down on winter traffic by leaving the icy roads to you. You’re welcome.

But let’s get real: It’s not as though most people are leaping out of bed in the morning having dreamed in their precious sleeping hours of the Shawcross Doctrine.

While it is the job of Ottawa insiders to report and consume every detail and do their best to interpret how it’s affecting the Justin Trudeau government’s political fortunes, for everyone outside the beltway, assessing the prime minister and his officials in this an election year comes down to two things: the Stink Factor and the Stick Factor.

To recap: There have been allegations Trudeau and his then-principal secretary Gerald Butts pressured now-former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to interfere in a decision over whether to prosecute Canadian engineering firm SNC-Lavalin on fraud and bribery charges arising from past dealings in Libya, or whether to instead negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement.

The former would see the company, if convicted, banned from bidding on lucrative Canadian government contracts for 10 years. The latter would see SNC-Lavalin avoid a trial in exchange for admitting responsibility, giving back any profits earned from wrongdoing, and paying a major fine. The situation reportedly led Wilson-Raybould to resign as a cabinet minister. Days later, Butts was gone as well.

Based on what we know, the stink factor is putridly gag-worthy.

Based on what we know, the stink factor is putridly gag-worthy, not necessarily because of the steady stream of details regarding who said what to whom, but because fundamentally, this comes down to the perception of a cabinet minister – a person at the senior-most level of government – being punished for not doing what the Prime Minister’s Office wanted on a criminal matter.

Sure, her successor, David Lametti, and Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, are stepping forward now to offer committee testimony nuancing the tone and tenor of the discussions between Wilson-Raybould and officials, and Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau. But that cannot erase the overwhelming view that she was dropped from her portfolio unceremoniously for not following orders.

It’s the type of thing people might have expected from former prime minister Stephen Harper and his PMO, but this wasn’t supposed to be Trudeau’s style. He campaigned on a promise of a kinder, more respectful, fairer, more open and transparent government, not one that would appear to engage in a raw, cynical exercise of power.

Canadians aren’t impressed. Two of three polls in the last week show the Liberal party sinking in voter intention. Trudeau’s personal brand – arguably the most dominant part of the current “Liberal” label – is similarly deteriorating. The Conservatives, seizing upon this gift from the political heavens, have pulled ever-so-slightly ahead in the horserace while leader Andrew Scheer leverages the opportunity to show his stuff grilling Trudeau during Question Period.

But how long will it linger? What’s the Stick Factor? In the last two weeks, this government has gone through several cans of air freshener in attempts to eliminate the general smell emanating from 80 Wellington Street, with little success.

The constant drip-drip-drip of news isn’t helping. Making things worse, the way scandals are covered has evolved.

The constant drip-drip-drip of news isn’t helping. Making things worse, the way scandals are covered has evolved. Governments, their advisers and caucus used to be able to brace for a few days or weeks of bad coverage, then wait for the media cycle to turn. But in the age of social media, the end of the story isn’t determined by an assignment editor. Video clips of Wilson-Raybould standing up in the House of Commons to request the opportunity to “speak her truth,” and those of Trudeau obfuscating in response to direct questions, will be shared and shared, giving the story a viral staying power.

Even if people get bored following a complicated scandal (and they do), there will be cumulative effects. Trudeau can never smell as clean (politically speaking) as he once did. That cleanliness was a major reason Canadians turned to him in 2015. Come October, it may be that the best the Liberals can hope for is an electorate that collectively holds its nose when voting.

420,Empty,2019-02-20T01:17:17Z,"A shortage of pipeline capacity in the oil patch has sharply driven down the price of Canadian crude in recent months, pummelling oil producers","OTTAWA — A convoy of oil workers arrived in Ottawa on Tuesday to deliver a message to the Liberal government about the province’s desperate need for more pipelines. Perhaps fittingly, however, the government’s focus was instead trained on Alberta’s deepest political foe: Quebec.

The long line of semi-trucks sat idling on Wellington Street in Ottawa, blocking off the street that passes in front of Parliament as part of a protest by United We Roll, a pro-industry group.

The Ottawa rally marked the final destination for the convoy, which started its journey in Alberta four days ago. Semi trucks were hitched to trailers emblazoned with calls to “build the pipeline” and “kill” Bill C-69, the Liberals’ environmental assessment reforms. Bearded men in fluorescent vests exhaled thick clouds into the cold air and yelled for Ottawa to “open your eyes” to industry struggles.

But, as if drawing directly from Alberta’s deepest political suspicions, MPs were instead focused on Quebec for much of the day, and the ongoing furor over allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured the attorney general to help Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin avoid prosecution on corruption charges. The minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, has quit cabinet and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s principal secretary has resigned.

Haley Wile, a co-founder of United We Roll, brushed off suggestions that the SNC-Lavalin affair was sucking up political oxygen in Ottawa and distracting media from the rally.

“I don’t care about the media,” she said. “I care about breaking down the barriers between provinces.”

Rally organizers said they plan to ask several cabinet ministers, including the Prime Minister’s Office, for meetings to discuss energy policy and Alberta’s pipeline woes. No Liberal MPs attended the rally, though Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and People’s Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier both delivered remarks.

“I didn’t think Justin Trudeau was going to come down and say ‘Let’s get this pipeline built,’” Wile said.

The United We Roll protest is an extension of the intense frustrations felt in Alberta, particularly after a Federal Court of Appeal ruling in August struck down the Trans Mountain pipeline, delaying yet another major oil conduit out of the province.

A shortage of pipeline capacity in the oil patch has sharply driven down the price of Canadian crude in recent months, pummelling oil producers and prompting the provincial NDP government to call for a mandatory cut in oil output.

Justin Long, a cement worker from Hamilton, Ont., said the SNC-Lavalin furor has only helped to underscore the convoy’s concerns with the Trudeau government.

“It just raises awareness, all attention is good attention,” Long said. “We won’t be silenced, we won’t be drowned out by anything.”

For some Albertans, the SNC affair points to the Liberal government’s courting of Quebec voters over an increasingly isolationist West. Those suspicions of Ottawa have only festered after a collapse in oil prices in 2014 left the resource sector reeling.

Patrick King, a rig worker from Red Deer, Alta., who has been unemployed since November, said the downturn in oil prices has caused major stress.

“It’s been a non-stop struggle,” he said.

He said the protest was at least partly tapping into deeper sentiments that Alberta’s industry woes have not been given the attention that they would have received in other provinces.

“I think that Quebec would have their own pipeline, Ontario would have their own pipeline… They would have absolute open taps.”

One bright green placard on Tuesday read: “Hey Trudeau, if SNC was in Alberta would you build us a pipeline?” Another read: “Build pipelines, let Jody speak.”

The pro-pipeline movement has also been tainted by claims that the protest serves as a catch-all for other misgivings, particularly racially charged concerns over immigration policy. Protesters wearing yellow vests on Tuesday decried anything from the United Nations migration pact to Trudeau’s budget deficits to energy legislation.

In a statement on Tuesday, the Prime Minister’s Office said it would not meet with organizers of United We Roll.

“We will always support the right of Canadians to be heard, but it is essential that their message not be co-opted by those who spew racist and divisive language,” it said.

Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi on Tuesday said it was “very unfortunate” that the message from the convoy has “drifted from pipelines to issues that are not relevant to the discussion on pipelines.”

“I am from Alberta, I have lived and breathed in Alberta for the past 34 years,” Sohi said. “I understand the frustration that people are facing.”

The Senate is studying Bill C-69, the Liberals’ proposed restructuring of the review process for major energy projects. This week, the National Energy Board will also release its report on the impacts of the Trans Mountain pipeline on marine life off the B.C. Coast.

Most protesters on Tuesday stuck to a message of unity among Canadians, saying the only way to correct industry struggles is to have meaningful discussions with people who oppose it.

Wade Woywitka, an oil worker from Vermilion, Alta., said members of the convoy were nervous about entering Ontario, unsure how the pro-industry group would be received. But he describes being amazed at the number of people who came out to support the cause, providing the convoy with home-cooked meals, coffee and doughnuts.

“There were grown men crying because we were so surprised by the support we got,” he said. “I’ve been on the road five days, I haven’t bought a meal yet.”","As frustrated pro-pipeline protestors arrive in Ottawa from Alberta, political attention remains focused on Quebec",Nationalpost.com,https://nationalpost.com/news/as-frustrated-pro-pipeline-protestors-arrive-in-ottawa-from-alberta-political-attention-remains-focused-on-quebec
421,Empty,2019-02-25T23:42:04Z,Why did Trudeau apply ‘relentless pressure’ to get Wilson-Raybould to change her mind? The only answer that makes any sense is: because he could,"There is no calm for the Liberals as the storm of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s upcoming appearance at the justice committee rumbles towards them.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons Monday he has waived solicitor-client privilege, freeing the former justice minister to talk about “relevant matters” as long as she does not touch on two court cases involving SNC-Lavalin.

Meanwhile, Wilson-Raybould said in a letter to the committee chair that she is willing to testify at the “first opportunity,” but wants to make sure there is clarity on possible constraints on what she can say — which suggests it may not be in the next couple of days.

While we don’t know when Wilson-Raybould will appear at committee, we do know she wants 30 minutes for an opening statement. You don’t need half an hour to say that the whole SNC-Lavalin saga, and recent allegations of political interference in the justice system, are just a big misunderstanding.

On Monday afternoon the committee heard from a former Saskatchewan judge who has gone on record as saying the affair should be investigated by the RCMP if there is evidence Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to another portfolio over her refusal to reconsider her position on asking the director of public prosecutions to offer SNC a deferred prosecution agreement. Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond has said a police investigation would be necessary to restore public confidence in the administration of justice, calling the prospect of the attempted influence over a prosecution “not only immoral, (but) illegal.”

Last week I suggested that Wilson-Raybould’s appearance at cabinet and Liberal caucus might auger a closing of ranks and an attempt by all sides to tamp down more controversy. After the clerk of the Privy Council’s unconventional committee appearance last week and Wilson-Raybould’s letter of intent, I’m less sure.

The appearance at committee of Michael Wernick, Canada’s top bureaucrat, suggested he thinks there is nothing to see here — that Canadians should have faith in the system because laws are “demonstrably working” when it comes to prosecutorial independence, lobbying and government ethics. “The shields held,” he said last Thursday.

As to his own conversation with Wilson-Raybould on December 19th last year, he made clear he believes it was neither immoral nor illegal. He said he told the then-attorney general her colleagues and the prime minister were “quite anxious” about the future of SNC and discussed whether a deferred prosecution agreement for the company was still an option. “I can tell you with complete assurance that my view of the conversation is that it was within the boundaries of what is lawful and appropriate,” he said. “I was informing the minister of context.”

The adjudicator of whether Wernick, and perhaps even the prime minister himself, crossed any lines will be the ethics commissioner. If prosecutors agree with Turpel-Lafond, the affair may even end up before the courts and be settled by a judge.

But what perplexes me is why Wernick, the prime minister, and senior advisers Gerald Butts and Katie Telford even discussed a remediation agreement for SNC after Wilson-Raybould made clear she was not disposed to negotiate one, when a perfectly sound plan B was already being worked on.

As my colleague Gabriel Friedman revealed in the Post on Saturday, the department of Public Services and Procurement is finalizing changes to the Ineligibility and Suspension Policy under the Integrity regime. This word salad governs whether corporations convicted of crimes can bid on federal projects.

SNC’s fear is that a conviction on corruption charges for bribing Libyan officials could lead to a 10-year ban on access to government infrastructure projects — the source of around 15 per cent of its $9 billion in revenue in 2017.

But the changes being contemplated by the government could reduce the ineligibility period from the automatically mandated 10 years to a debarment at the government’s discretion.

This policy change has been in the works for years — the public was invited to comment back in fall 2017 and the government says the update is being “studied and finalized.” A statement in the revised policy consultation said it is expected to take effect in “early 2019.”

One lawyer Friedman quoted said the debarment could conceivably be reduced to six months, a year or even no ineligibility at all. The proposed changes would widen the scope of offences that could lead to debarment, including human trafficking and environmental violations. The idea is that a one-size-fits-all punishment must be made more flexible if the range of offences is broadened.

SNC chief executive Neil Bruce has said the failure to secure a DPA would likely lead to three to four more years of court battles because the company considers itself not guilty.

But unless I’m missing something, a DPA would require an admission of culpability.

Under the new integrity regime, the company would also have to admit to wrongdoing before throwing itself on the mercy of the Registrar of Ineligibility and Suspension at Public Services. But, in that event, the company could claim mitigating circumstances, because the executives who perpetrated the alleged corruption have left and steps have been taken to ensure there is no repeat of the errant conduct.

So if the government already had an alternative to a deferred prosecution agreement that is expected to become policy in the next month or so, why did the prime minister and his most senior advisors risk flirting with immorality, if not illegality?

As Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asked Monday, if the decision to grant or refuse a deferred prosecution agreement was Wilson-Raybould’s alone — as the prime minister maintains — why did he apply “relentless pressure” to get her to change her mind?

The only answer that makes any sense is: because he could.

Time and again, Steve has returned to Captain America’s red-white-and-blue iconography, proving that the symbolic clothing of the Sentinel of Liberty stands for a higher ideal than any one person or government can achieve.

423,Empty,2019-02-19T20:43:04Z,"Seen as the strategist behind everything Trudeau did, Butts put cutting carbon emissions in its own category The post For Gerald Butts, climate change isn’t like other policy appeared first on Macleans.ca.","The accepted narrative about any power-behind-the-throne figure is always about raw strategy and never about pure policy. So, when Gerald Butts suddenly resigned yesterday as Justin Trudeau’s principal secretary, attention focused almost entirely on how the Prime Minister would manage without his alter ego around to make stuff happen by way of the dark arts of inveigling and intimidating, cutting deals and taking names.

But in his written resignation statement, Butts injected a personal preoccupation with a single file that isn’t typical for his sort of grand vizier character in a political drama. “I also need to say this (and I know it’s a non sequitur),” Butts wrote. “Our kids and grandkids will judge us on one issue above all others. That issue is climate change. I hope the response to it becomes the collective, non-partisan, urgent effort that science clearly says is required. I hope that happens soon.”

Skeptics might wonder if that sort of worry can truly run deep for any power broker who manages to rise to the top level. Yet even environmentalist activists who strongly object to the Trudeau government’s approach to the energy-and-environment file don’t doubt that Butts is a believer. “They’ve lost a voice on climate change. His commitment is absolute,” Bruce Cox, who was executive director of Greenpeace Canada from 2005 to 2014, said in an interview.

It’s worth noting that Cox says this even though he rejects the way the Liberal government tried, with Butts as its pinnacle strategist, to balance support for Alberta’s oil sector with a national plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions. “I mean, we’re in a climate crisis and they’re buying a pipeline,” Cox scoffs. He’s referring, of course, to the federal government’s $4.5-billion purchase last spring of the Trans Mountain pipeline—which runs from Edmonton to Burnaby, B.C., just up the coast from Vancouver—in a bid to complete a stalled project to triple its capacity.

Still, buying the pipeline was, Cox concedes, consistent with what Butts has said in private conversations. “He believes—he’s said it to me personally—that we’re going to pump the oil, but we’re going to do it responsibly and properly,” Cox says, quickly adding that he doesn’t think cutting emissions and building pipelines can ever be reconciled. In fact, the trick in trying to understand the approach Butts brought to this core policy concern often amounts to puzzling over how he made apparently incompatible notions fit together.

Butts became a national figure first as a driving force behind Trudeau’s bid for the Liberal leadership, then behind his 2015 federal election win, and finally inside his Prime Minister’s Office. Before then, though, he held two key roles: principal secretary to former Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty from 1999-2008, and president and CEO of the WWF-Canada, the country’s biggest mainstream environmental organization, from 2008-2012.

In McGuinty’s government, Butts was involved with the so-called “greenbelt” policy for protecting farmland, forests and wetlands in southern Ontario, and with phasing out coal-powered electricity plants. As WWF-Canada’s head, he argued that Canada needed to look beyond the oil and gas sector—especially developing Alberta’s oil sands—to renewable alternatives. “While the rest of the world searches for a low-carbon path to growth, we are betting the national economy on a carbon footprint deeper than even conventional fossil fuels,” he wrote.

Butts was also outspoken on the need for rich countries like Canada to take the lead on cutting carbon emissions. In a late-2009 interview, speaking with TVO’s Steve Paikin from a UN climate change summit in Copenhagen, Butts might have been expected to pin the blame for Canadian inaction on then-prime minister Stephen Harper’s Conservative government. Instead, he looked back to the previous decade, when Jean Chrétien’s Liberals were in power in Ottawa.

“This problem fundamentally has its roots in the 1990s, when you had one half of the government trying to make oil sands very economically feasible,” Butts said. “You know, 50 of the top people in Finance Canada, Industry Canada and PCO were trying to figure out how to make oil sands extraction economical, and nobody put environmental concerns on the table within that discussion.” There was no link then, he said, between pro-oil sands policy and thinking around how Canada would achieve its international greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments.

In a sense, the climate-change policy of the Trudeau era can be seen as an attempt to finally put environment and energy on the table at the same time. It’s not an easy fit. Trudeau has summed the policy up with the word “transition”—a period when oil and gas profits will help fund a shift to a low-carbon economy. The bargain behind getting Alberta’s NDP government to agree to a national price on carbon was that the province’s vast fossil fuel reserves would still be developed.

Imposing that national carbon price against opposition from several provinces now looms as the hottest issue in next fall’s election. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says repealing the Liberal climate change plan would be his first priority if he wins it. Arguably the biggest question going into the campaign is how voters in bands of must-win suburban ridings, especially around Toronto, view the notion of a federally imposed carbon tax.

Conservative strategists are confident that those commuter communities will revolt against a Liberal plan that boosts the price of filling up their cars—even though the federal government promises an income tax-based rebate worth more than the out-of-pocket costs of the policy for most Canadians. But Liberal insiders say Butts has contended that Canadian suburban voters—especially parents worried about the world their children will grow up to inherit—tend to be far more acutely concerned about the environment than the Tories imagine.

Butts has been known to point out that, when he was in provincial politics, suburbanites voted Liberal in large numbers when the party was shutting down coal-fired generating stations and establishing a protected greenbelt in their backyards. With Butts gone, taking that unique mix of campaign and policy experience with him, the question is whether the Liberal climate-change message will stay the same—or shift into some post-Butts mode before Canadians vote next fall.

Pray to All-Mother Freyja! For in her hands lies the key to ending Malekith’s war. The Black Bifrost — the only method of travel for Malekith’s vast armies — must fall. Even with the Punisher, Ghost Rider, Blade and Hulk (Jen Walters) at Freyja’s side, how many Dark Elves can one goddess kill? While Freyja’s team heads for the swamps of Svartalfheim, Captain America’s rescue mission in Jotunheim faces the wrath of giants, Captain Marvel leads a global assault team against Malekith’s allies and the Black Panther defends Avengers Mountain against a siege of mythic proportion. None of them know that Malekith has a secret weapon. And its bite will prove most…VENOMOUS.

THE PUNISHER LEADS THE CHARGE TO SHUT DOWN THE BLACK BIFROST!

Deep in the swamps of Svartalfheim stands the Black Bifrost, Malekith’s corrupted Rainbow Bridge and the only reliable means of travel between the realms with the true Bifrost in pieces. If the gods are going to stop Malekith’s invasion, the Black Bridge must fall. With her son missing and husband injured, Lady Freyja must take up the challenge herself. But she won’t go alone. Hulk (Jen Walters), the Punisher, Blade and Ghost Rider follow the All-Mother of Asgard straight into Malekith’s home territory!

Adams’ lavish and dynamic visuals and Thomas’ challenging and contemporary stories combined to create a book that throbbed with the pulse of the times. Their iconic run introduced the cosmic-powered Havok, the vampiric villain Sauron and the bizarre Mutates, while pairing the X-Men and Ka-Zar in a classic Savage Land battle against the X-Men’s greatest foe — Magneto! Painstakingly restored, packed with bonus material and presented in oversized glory, every page is a testament to the greatest in comic book storytelling! Collecting X-MEN (1963) #56-57 (A STORIES), #58-63 and #65.

Time and again, Steve has returned to Captain America’s red-white-and-blue iconography, proving that the symbolic clothing of the Sentinel of Liberty stands for a higher ideal than any one person or government can achieve.

But now…he’s going to go one step further. What do you do after you’ve found redemption? You help others do the same! Bucky is working to help others leave behind their lives of crime. It’s his way of channeling his own pain in a productive, personal way — by helping others find the same salvation he’s found. But not all paths are the same — and not everyone can be saved. Is there any hope for RJ, Hydra’s teenage assassin extraordinaire, who’s been sent to kill the man he’s been modeled after: the Winter Soldier himself? Collecting WINTER SOLDIER (2018) #1-5.

New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh arrives for a caucus meeting in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, February 27, 2019. REUTERS/Chris Wattie

Preliminary results showed Jagmeet Singh won a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia.

Singh captured just under 40 percent of the vote.

A practicing Sikh, Singh made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau’s chances become.

“This staves off all the talk that Singh would have to quit ... at least for the moment he is vindicated,” said Richard Johnston, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia.

Johnston said in a phone interview that Singh would still need to overcome unhappiness with his leadership.

Singh, 40, a former legislator in the province of Ontario, had no experience in federal politics when he took over from former leader Thomas Mulcair.

He has clashed openly with senior members of parliament on a number of issues. A quarter of the 44 NDP legislators who won seats in the 2015 election have either already quit or announced they are not running again in October.

And in a further sign of challenges ahead, in another special election on Monday, the NDP lost the Montreal seat Mulcair had held to the Liberals.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News last week put the Liberals at 34 percent public support and the right-leaning official opposition Conservatives at 35 percent. The NDP was far behind at 17 percent.

The Liberals are stumbling amid allegations that officials in Trudeau’s office leaned on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help a major construction company avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges.

Singh and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer are both calling for a public inquiry into the matter.",Left-leaning Canada opposition leader faces big parliamentary test,Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKCN1QE2E8-OCATP

Lloyd Longfield MP

February 20, 2019

Dear Lloyd,

I am a longstanding member of Science for Peace, Canada’s most renowned scientific community for peace research and advocacy over more than 30 years centered in the Department of Physics of the University of Toronto. Its co-founding president was George Ignatieff whose son later led the Liberal party of Canada. So the positions Science for Peace adopts are not marginal and very seriously thought through.

The attached brief position paper advocating withdrawal from NATO is the result of years of research, debate and vigorous membership discussion which represents the overwhelmingly supported position of Science for Peace. It rightly advises that Canada in NATO is now in repeated violation of United Nations Treaty and Declaration in military aggressions under international law, and the President’s covering letter emphasizes the need “to oppose global trends towards militarizing the many urgent and devastating humanitarian situations”. I urge you to communicate these issues to your constituency and colleagues in the knowledge that the position paper and letter have also been sent to the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister.

NATO’s increasingly warlike policies far beyond the North Atlantic regional alliance it was founded on, coupled with US-led demands for ever more needed public money to finance its non-defensive policies of nuclear and military domination across continents, are directly opposed to Canada’s common life and public interest, especially with Canada and the world’s environmental defence so threatened and underfunded at the same time.

This is a repressed turning-point issue of our age which the responsible federal government must come to grips with for its integrity as well as for Canada and humanity’s future.

Dear Prime Minister:

Re: Canada’s Withdrawal from NATO

Science for Peace calls on the Government of Canada to withdraw from NATO and to cease from colluding with NATO’s pretence of pursuing defensive goals. In addition, we urge the government to join in condemning NATO’s violations of international peace and security.

Finally, we call on the Canadian government to sign the United Nations’ treaty to ban nuclear weapons and to work towards dismantling NATO altogether. Canada can, and should, do more to oppose global trends towards militarizing the many urgent and devastating humanitarian situations.

I attach a brief position paper, prepared by Science for Peace, which explains the reasoning behind our proposals for a major foreign-policy shift by your government.

Yours sincerely,

Richard Sandbrook DPhil, FRSC

Acting President

Why Canada Should Withdraw from NATO

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed (1949) under a Treaty renouncing “the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” The Treaty calls for military action only in response to an attack upon a member. By reserving the liberty of deciding when military action is required, it usurps the authority the UN Charter supposedly confers on the Security Council to make such decisions. But NATO’s assault on world peace goes much farther. Plainly, its many military initiatives (as in former Yugoslavia in 1992 and 1999, and in Libya in 2011) and its military “exercises” threatening Russia on its very borders (up to the present) have violated NATO’s self-declared limitations. One might regard this as sufficient reason for a peace-seeking member nation to withdraw.

Almost from its beginning, NATO has committed a still more serious breach of the spirit and letter of international agreements: it systematically strives to impose its will by the threat of nuclear war. On the one hand, Science for Peace can not condone Canada’s adherence to an alliance which insists on its readiness to be the first to resort to nuclear arms (discussed, e.g., by the Arms Control Association); but on the other hand, even were NATO abruptly to accept the principle of No First Use, the use or threat of nuclear war even in retaliation incurs absolutely unacceptable danger to the survival of humanity and must be repudiated. The rationale of nuclear deterrence, far from shielding Canada or anyone under a “nuclear umbrella”, acts to multiply the ways a nuclear war may be triggered, and magnifies the destruction it threatens1.

Despite the increasingly potent threats to human survival through nuclear war and climate change, the public is largely uninformed by media, the government, and to a great extent within academia. Knowing the historical context is essential. With regard to laws and implementation of regulations that need to truthfully provide human security:

“The malleable, indeterminate, and oft-ignored ‘rules’ of the [U.N.] Charter concerning use of force can plausibly be marshaled to support virtually any U.S. military action deemed in the national interest. Limited or ambiguous U.N. Security Council approval, where available, is easily stretched.”2

In 1996 the International Court of Justice declared that “the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, and in particular the principles of humanitarian law”3 and yet there is silence about these threats coming from President Trump or implicitly from NATO’s first-use policy.

Similarly indeterminate and lacking in meaningful constraints have been the agreements around nuclear weapons. The U.N. Non-Proliferation Treaty has not resulted in sanctions or limit-setting in any of the states already possessing nuclear weapons and has not addressed former president Obama’s $1.1 trillion allocation for nuclear weapons proliferation. The public is uninformed about the significant escalation of danger since 1991: George W. Bush’s withdrawal from the Anti Ballistic Defense Treaty with the consequent development of a missile defense system that effectually increases NATO’s belief that after a first strike a missile defense system could stop a nuclear counter-attack and that a nuclear war is winnable.

Challenging the ambiguity and compromises of the U.N. Security Council in order to address the mounting threats of human extinction, non-NATO nations and civil society members joined together to implement a nuclear ban treaty. Canada, bowing to NATO pressure, did not even participate in the meetings leading up to the treaty. Canada is also bowing to NATO pressure to increase military spending.

Science for Peace calls on the Government of Canada not only to withdraw from NATO and to cease from colluding with NATO’s pretence of pursuing defensive goals, but to join in condemning its violations of international peace and security. We call on the Canadian government to also sign the treaty to ban nuclear weapons and to work towards dismantling NATO altogether and to oppose the global trends towards militarizing the many urgent and devastating humanitarian situations.

Lastly, it is the responsibility of an informed public to engage politically and demand the deep changes required for human survival.

428,Empty,2019-02-22T19:56:24Z,He has a very high bar when it comes to self-embarrassment,"Fermat’s Last Theorem was a doozy of a headscratcher that kept the very best noodles of mathematics in a whirl of frustration and despair from 1637 — when Fermat scribbled in the margin of a book that he had a solution for it (but that it was too large to fit on the side of the page) — to 1995. That’s 358 years. It was finally solved by the British mathematician, Andrew Wiles, after decades of recondite theorizing, endless computation, and manic determination (Jacob with a Numbers Angel). He beat Fermat at last.

Or is thought to have done so. I’m certainly in no position to rule on Mr. Wiles’ wily exegetics. For intricacies of this altitude, and for a cool head when under potential fire from the unruly brigands of number theory, this is the point when we dilettantes at the Post throw the switch, light up the Bat Signal, veer it west and beckon Dr. C. Cosh.

I make my own grade-school allusion to Mr. Fermat and his riddle only to suggest that the scale of the problem, its enduring challenge to the very best of minds and its resistance to definitive resolution invokes a disturbing comparison to a current teaser of equally daunting perplexity: the bottomless challenge of solicitor-client privilege.

Can Ms. Wilson-Raybould speak? Or can she not? Evidently she can speak in cabinet — for she did

The entire harem of lawyers in the civil service, the covey of external academic superstars, the top-rate attorneys in practice available for consultation on a phone call from the prime minister, the current attorney-general and his cohort of legal ninjas, the bar societies of all the provinces and territories, and at least one retired Supreme Court justice hired to represent the former attorney general, Ms. Jody Wilson-Raybould — all seem unequal to the problem. They languish. It is a real snorter.

Can Ms. Wilson-Raybould speak? Or can she not? Evidently she can speak in cabinet — for she did. In caucus? I’m unsure. In the justice committee? Evidently the authorities have not delivered a ruling on that. The prime minister can speak. And does so variously every day. Sometimes he even speaks for Ms. Wilson-Raybould. The clerk of the Privy Council can speak. Gerald Butts can speak, at least to the point that he may deny he has done anything wrong or untoward.

Can it be that solicitor-client privilege is an unfathomable, impenetrable legalistic black hole from which no light can emerge that it is currently and conveniently for all sorts of reasons made out to be? Apparently it must be so for certainly up to now it has held within its irremediable grasp all the key information that could settle the crisis and upon which a government’s fate depends.

One other feature of the week was the prime minister’s determinedly robotic turn in Wednesday’s question period. He has a very high bar when it comes to self-embarrassment.

He showed none whatsoever in absolutely ignoring the specific questions being put to him, and issuing a nearly identical and fully irrelevant answer to every single different inquiry during question period. Opposition leader Andrew Scheer asked about 15 particular questions and to each one the prime minister gave, with minuscule variation, a gauzy non sequitur about his concern for jobs and the middle class and something about the rule of law. He could just as easily have risen and said “it’s raining in Tanzania now” or “cats have four legs and a tail” for all the connection his answers had to the questions before him. The Liberals sometimes applauded the travesty, thought we must believe — they are human — there were inwardly ashamed of his pure witless evasions.

One other feature of the week was the prime minister’s determinedly robotic turn in Wednesday’s question period

Meantime if “jobs for the middle class” were the prime minister’s heart’s desire, he might have stepped out of the Commons and said at least a hello to the gathering of truckers who had driven all the way, in coldest February, from Alberta to Parliament Hill. They were there to describe how things are for working people in Alberta (and other provinces) since the oil industry has been battered by world prices, the fire in Fort McMurray, the killing of pipeline projects, the stalling on the remaining Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, and the flight of capital (another multi-billion-dollar oil company announced this week that it was packing up for the U.S.).

Most of them were salt-of-the-earth types, not the professional agitators, perpetual demonstrators and seasoned road-blockers that constitute Canada’s protesting class. There are two groups: those who make a living out of protest (see above); and those who protest (and only as a last resort) because they can’t make a living. The former in fact, are very much the reason the latter had to come to Ottawa.

It wouldn’t have hurt Justin Trudeau to extricate himself from the pointless metaphysics of solicitor-client privilege and wander out to shake a few hands and have a couple of chats with real people in real language about what they’re feeling, what they’re going through and what they might be seeking from his government. If a prime minister can make it to We Day revivals, or Women in the World #MeToo congratulatories to exchange progressive bon-mots with such eminences as Katie Couric, Tina Brown and Mira Sorvino, surely a few minutes with a handful of Western Canadian truck drivers, heavy-equipment operators and laid-off electricians shouldn’t be too much of a burden.

They travelled over 2,000 miles by truck; he had, at most, a few hundred yards on foot. And their only concern was jobs, the very jobs he was so repetitiously insisting were his prime concern during the woeful performance in question period.

In one sense, and a very real sense, a couple of well-meant hellos to these folks, a bit of listening to pick up their sense of things, might very well have had more value and more substance than all the artful, posturing theatrics of the past two weeks on SNC-Lavalin and Jody Wilson-Raybould’s still enigmatic dilemma. As between the two venues — the protest outside, the farce within — I know where reality lies.

A footnote: the plastering of the convoy with the tag that it was “fringed” or “infiltrated” by white supremacists and all sorts of other odd, despicable types was a cheap one exercised by many in the media. The main purpose of this group, and the people who organized and executed the trip, was clear as day, and as important as any issue in the country at present. If you’re going to characterize protests by whatever fringe elements may or may not attach to them, please do it universally. Next time there’s Occupy sit-in at Queens Park, or an anti-pipeline march in Vancouver, note the flags, check the repeat attenders, and find out who’s backing them. Or does scrutiny only apply to the non-professionals of the protest movement?",Rex Murphy: Trudeau prattles on about SNC-Lavalin ‘jobs’ while ignoring Alberta’s jobless truckers,Nationalpost.com,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rex-murphy-trudeau-prattles-on-about-snc-lavalin-jobs-while-ignoring-albertas-jobless-truckers

The Liberal government has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported on Feb. 7 that officials had pressured former minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc escape with a fine rather than face trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. SNC has declined to comment.

Wilson-Raybould, who was demoted in January, resigned last week. She has said nothing so far about the matter.

The House of Commons justice committee met on Tuesday behind closed doors to discuss whom to question about the affair and Liberal legislator Iqra Khalid tweeted that she would invite Wilson-Raybould to appear.

“I respect the justice committee and I will appear,” Wilson-Raybould told the CBC television, adding she was still consulting lawyers to see how much she could say.

A date for her appearance has not been confirmed but officials said it could be as early as Thursday.

The same committee, on which the Liberals hold a majority, last week decided not to hear from her, prompting opposition accusations of a cover-up.

Wilson-Raybould in an unusual move met with members of the cabinet on Tuesday. She declined to give details.

Trudeau’s office did not immediately respond to questions about whether a deal had been struck with the former minister to spare the government embarrassment.

Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s principal private secretary and one of the architects of the Liberals’ surprise 2015 election win, quit on Monday while insisting he had done nothing wrong.

Underlining the extent of Trudeau’s problems, a new poll showed his ruling center-left Liberals had slipped behind their main rivals ahead of an election in October. Opposition parties are demanding a public inquiry.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition center-right Conservatives, told the House of Commons that the resignation of Butts would not clear up the matter.

“This is not an ordinary political scandal. Something more sinister is at play here ... if a crime has been committed, those responsible must be punished,” he said, suggesting officials may have obstructed justice.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News taken after Wilson-Raybould’s resignation showed the Liberals support had dropped four percentage points since December to 34 percent, with the Conservatives up two points at 36 percent.

The survey suggests that if an election were held now, no party would have enough legislators to form a stable government.

A Trudeau spokeswoman said no decision had been taken on who would replace Butts.

One potential candidate is David MacNaughton, the influential Canadian ambassador to Washington who helped successfully negotiate the renewal of a continental trade pact last year, said two well-placed Liberals.

MacNaughton, 70, enjoys cabinet level status inside the Trudeau government and also has experience of working with Katie Telford, Trudeau’s chief of staff.

430,Empty,2019-02-19T11:30:56Z,"The former PM has been working hard to improve his legacy. It just might be paying off, writes Anne Kingston The post Brian Mulroney: From scandal-adjacent elitist to magnanimous statesman appeared first on Macleans.ca.","In March 2014, Mila Mulroney threw a surprise 75th birthday party for her husband at Palm Beach’s private Club Colette, a glitzy event that garnered gush from American gossip columns. “Billionaires party with former Canadian prime minister,” New York Post’s Page Six announced, listing some of the Canadian and U.S. one-percenters present: oil baron and Tea Party funder David Koch; Seagram scion Charles Bronfman; investor Wilbur Ross; Galen Weston, executive chairman of George Weston Ltd.; and Stephen Schwarzman, co-founder of New York-based Blackstone Group, the world’s largest private equity firm. Allies from his political days, including former Mulroney government cabinet minister and Quebec premier Jean Charest, mingled with newer friends like the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. The Palm Beach Daily News counted “so many more richy-richies that if the ground had opened up beneath the building, Congress would have to rewrite the tax code.”

At the epicentre was Brian Mulroney, Canada’s 18th prime minister, regaling the crowd with a tale about announcing a political return to his wife: “I had been out of politics for some time, but I was really unhappy with some things that were going on in Canada,” he said. “So I sat her down and said, ‘Mila, I’m considering running for office again. How do you feel about that?’ And she answered, ‘Honey, I want you to do whatever makes you happy. And I’m sure your new wife will feel the same way.’ ”

The punchline drew riotous laughter. Even funnier was the notion that Mulroney would consider a return to politics given the circumstances around his departure—and the wealth and influence he’d amassed since leaving office three decades earlier: he was senior partner in the Montreal office of law firm Norton Rose Fulbright; he sat on the boards of Archer Daniels Midland, Barrick Gold Corp., Power Corp., Blackstone and Quebecor Inc., among many others; he pulled in more than $1 million a year on the speakers circuit; he and Mila had lived comfortably part of the year among the Palm Beach rich since they bought a house there in 1997.

Still, Mulroney couldn’t resist sparking political nostalgia as he joined the Canadian Tenors on stage for When Irish Eyes Are Smiling, the song he notoriously sang with former U.S. president Ronald Reagan at the 1985 “Shamrock Summit” in Quebec City, foreplay to the 1988 Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement.

No one could have predicted that, within three years of that night, Mulroney would be back in the partisan spotlight with Donald Trump’s arrival to the U.S. presidency. A scrambling Liberal government led by the son of Mulroney’s Meech Lake nemesis, Pierre Trudeau, called on Mulroney for advice on how to handle Trump and renegotiate NAFTA. Later, Mulroney’s stirring eulogy for another U.S. president, George H.W. Bush, won plaudits and made Canadians proud.

It’s a measure of the political moment that the qualities Mulroney was pilloried for while in office—alliances with elites and American business, friendships with U.S. presidents, a gift for blarney—suddenly became national assets. Amid global volatility, an old-style Irish pol, a master of negotiating sometimes dodgy reciprocal relationships, offered comfort. In the process, the man once known as “Lyin’ Brian” is being recast as an elder statesman. It’s an unprecedented comeback, a reminder of how history hinges on which stories we tell or are told. With Mulroney, we’re watching reputation refurbishment in real time—awards, policy reassessment, the construction of the Mulroney Institute of Government at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, N.S.

It’s a focus that can’t help but cast light on conservative tradition in Canada. One odd twist to Mulroney’s return is how Liberals use his progressive environmental legislation to attack current Conservatives. Last December, Gerry Butts, principal secretary to the Prime Minister, tweeted: “The Conservative party won’t have a plan for the environment. They haven’t had leadership that cares about it since Brian Mulroney. It’s not going to change in the Scheer/Ford/Kenney era.” Those with longer memories see the Mulroney legacy revamp as more complicated. Peter McInnis, associate professor and chair of history at StFX evokes another U.S. president: “I would describe it as the most ambitious effort for rehabilitation since Richard Nixon.”

In June 1993, Brian Mulroney made a safe, if wishful, prediction about “the beauty of historical judgment” to the Montreal Gazette: “It bears no relationship to today’s headlines.” He’d just resigned after almost nine years in office, months before a federal election, with the lowest polling approval rating ever of a Canadian PM. It was a stunning reversal for a politician who swept the Progressive Conservatives to a historic landslide majority in 1984, and a record second majority in 1988. Canadians, mired in recession, harboured a list of grievances: introduction of the GST and free trade; sending an ill-equipped Canadian military to fight in the Gulf War without a parliamentary vote; a stream of scandals that saw 10 cabinet ministers resign. Mulroney was seen as too showy, too pro-business, too obsequious to power, not the way Canadians saw themselves. Mila Mulroney’s shopping habits won her the mocking nickname “Imelda” after Imelda Marcos. The Mulroneys’ taxpayer-funded global tour—London, Paris, Moscow—to bid farewell to world leaders summoned outrage. Two doomed constitutional initiatives—the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords—left the country divided and the Progressive Conservative party decimated. Lucien Bouchard defected to form the Bloc Québécois. The Kim Campbell-led Progressive Conservatives were crushed in the 1993 election, winning two seats; the party would only recover after a contentious 2003 merger created the Conservative Party of Canada.

The Mulroney years—the lobbyists, the conflicts of interest, the backroom deals, with cameos from arms dealers—were a goldmine for investigative journalists; Stevie Cameron’s 1994 On the Take and Marci McDonald’s 1995 Yankee Doodle Dandy were bestsellers. Historian Michael Bliss captured the sentiment in his 1995 book Right Honourable Men: The Descent of Canadian Politics from Macdonald to Mulroney: “Brian Mulroney knew how to lead elites—how to get premiers on side, business groups in his pocket and unity in his caucus, but when he urged Canadians to go over the top with him, they shot him in the back.”

That year, an aggrieved Mulroney filed an unprecedented $50-million lawsuit against the people he once represented after a Department of Justice letter to the Swiss government on behalf of the RCMP was leaked. It requested information related to allegations that Mulroney and others were involved in a criminal conspiracy to defraud taxpayers involving the $1.8-billion purchase of 34 Airbus A320 passenger planes from a European consortium in 1988, with “improper commissions” allegedly paid to German-Canadian businessman Karlheinz Schreiber. “I never had any dealings with him,” Mulroney said under oath. He was awarded $2.1 million for legal and PR costs and the government was ordered to apologize in an out-of-court settlement.

Mulroney’s frustration over being underappreciated and misunderstood was writ large in Peter C. Newman’s 2005 book The Secret Mulroney Tapes, which captured him in unguarded moments: “You cannot name a Canadian prime minister who has done as many significant things as I did, because there are none,” he is quoted as saying. A more modest, self-deprecating version of history appeared in Mulroney’s bestselling Memoirs, published in 2007. Its 1,100 pages included no mention of Schreiber, then suing Mulroney for the $300,000 he alleged he’d paid the politician for lobbying a German manufacturer of armoured vehicles—work he claimed Mulroney didn’t do.

In 2007, Stephen Harper ordered a public inquiry, which revealed that Mulroney not only knew Schreiber, who helped fund his leadership bid in 1983, but he accepted no less than $225,000 from Schreiber in 1993 and 1994. Justice Jeffrey Oliphant ruled in his 2010 report that Mulroney did not break any laws or use his influence while prime minister on the contract. Still, the takeaway imagery was tawdry: Mulroney met with Schreiber in three hotel rooms, one in New York City, and was handed envelopes filled with $1,000 bills. Oliphant’s report found “many inappropriate aspects,” including the lack of a paper trail and Mulroney’s failure to declare the cash at the border, to deposit it in a bank or pay income tax on it until 2000. The judge also criticized Mulroney for a “heavy-handed” campaign to block a journalist’s story “to protect his reputation.”

Before the inquiry report was published, that reputation was declared irreparably damaged. “Regardless of what happens now, Brian Mulroney’s credibility and reputation is shattered,” the Tyee wrote in 2007.

But time passes, and people forget. Time provides hindsight and context, former prime minister Kim Campbell tells Maclean’s. She expresses no bitterness toward Mulroney for leaving her with an unwinnable election and a decimated party: “I don’t blame someone for being human,” she says. “People who make a mark are complicated,” Campbell says. “Brian Mulroney is complicated. He has great skills and annoying flaws.” Campbell was proud to serve in the Mulroney government, she says, where she held a number of cabinet portfolios; she was also the first woman appointed as Canada’s minister of justice and attorney general, where she oversaw key revisions to sexual assault legislation and advocated for more women in the judiciary.

Campbell cites one Mulroney flaw: his thin skin. He called her former chief of staff to complain about her 1996 political memoir, Time and Chance. She thought she’d treated him fairly: “People said, ‘Why were you so nice to Brian Mulroney?’ I said, ‘I just wrote it as I saw it.’ ” Mulroney was a pragmatist, not an ideologue, says Campbell, one of the women Mulroney appointed to powerful cabinet positions.

Reputations do not rely only on the sands of time. Money and powerful friends can also burnish the record. So can an able PR strategist. (In late 2007, Mulroney hired Robin Sears, a communications and policy consultant with Ottawa-based Earnscliffe Strategy Group.) In her 2012 book Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else, Chrystia Freeland, then a journalist, now minister of foreign affairs, wrote of politics as a path to big money: “One thing that isn’t in dispute is the material value of a political career after leaving office.” Few have been as successful as Mulroney, says Derek Burney, Mulroney’s former chief of staff and former Canadian ambassador to the U.S. Retiring politicians of all stripes travel to Montreal for advice on post-political life, he says, as well as the hope of a few connections.

The powerful networks Mulroney assiduously cultivated before and during his stint in office were there for him afterwards. Mulroney “always noticed people worth noting,” says former Ontario Liberal premier David Peterson, who met Mulroney in Quebec in the ’60s. One of Mulroney’s great successes was identifying George H.W. Bush as the next president, says John Baird, a former minister of foreign affairs and the environment in the Harper government: “He advanced a very warm professional relationship before 1988.”

People who like Mulroney hold him in great, if not unflinching, affection. “I liked him even when I was mad at him,” says Peterson. “That doesn’t mean I love everything about him. But if I phone Brian Mulroney and say, ‘I need help,’ he’d be the first guy to line up.”

Mulroney sought common ground to both befriend and as a negotiating tool. Hugh Segal, a former senator who was Mulroney’s chief of staff, recalls asking Mulroney why he requested extensive intel on foreign leaders. “He said, ‘Huey, there’s not a single leader in the world—corporate or political—who wakes up in the morning, turns to his spouse and says: “I wonder how Canada is doing today?” Nobody cares about us. I have to look through that material to find linkages, so if I have to call the president of France or somebody in Africa because some Canadian is in prison, I have a relationship I can build on.’”

With his bountiful Rolodex, Mulroney nimbly forged connections between corporate shared interests. He sat on the international advisory board of Beijing-based China International Trust Investment Corp., a state-owned conglomerate that specializes in joint ventures with non-Chinese partners; later, he’d play matchmaker for a Barrick-Power joint venture to develop gold deposits in China.

Time found some Mulroney policies prescient. In 2006, he was hailed the “greenest” prime minister by the Canadian magazine Corporate Knights for the 1987 Montreal Protocol and the 1991 acid rain treaty. The 25th anniversary of the once-contentious free trade agreement brought more tributes. Ian MacDonald, Mulroney’s main speechwriter in the ’80s, later became the editor of Inside Policy magazine and devoted its first issue to a laudatory free-trade anniversary package. The University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs hosted a symposium.

Awards and tributes can be a way for the powerful to applaud one another. In 2012, Mulroney, Canada’s first working-class PM, received the Horatio Alger Award, named after the prolific 19th-century American dime-store novelist known for tales of young boys rising from poverty through hard work and honest living. (Other recipients include Ronald Reagan, Fred Trump, Maya Angelou and Leonardo DiCaprio.) Mulroney added “VP of the Horatio Alger Association of Canada” to his crammed CV in 2012. It provided an opportunity to talk publicly about scholarships for poor, worthy students—even if media wanted to revisit the past. In a 2015 Maclean’s interview, Mulroney deflected a question about the Oliphant inquiry, saying he’d not read the report. “I’ve been investigated more than any prime minister in Canadian history,” he said. “I have never been charged with a parking ticket.”

Mulroney’s gift for blarney also inspired devotion, and could even reshape reality. Jean Charest recalls attending caucus as an MP when the government was down in the polls: “We’d walk in at 15 per cent and we’d walk out, in our minds, at 80 per cent,” he told Maclean’s. “He was inspirational every single week.”

Campbell wonders if one of Mulroney’s perceived failings was appearing to “want it too much.” “He took great pleasure in becoming prime minister. He wasn’t Cincinnatus, who had to be persuaded away from his plough.” History can distort, she says: “People mythologize Pierre Trudeau as a reluctant PM. But, like Mulroney, he also wanted to be PM from an early age.”

Post-politics, Mulroney was never far from political action, helping with the Harper government transition and dispensing advice across the partisan spectrum, including advising former NDP leader Jack Layton on caucus management. “He never went away,” says Peterson. Harper told his cabinet to keep their distance from Mulroney after the Schreiber inquiry began. They didn’t. “It was one of the great secrets of the Harper era that as many as a dozen cabinet ministers would call Mr. Mulroney regularly to complain,” says a Mulroney friend. Mulroney offered advice and valuable contacts, reports Baird, who hosted a private reception for him in 2011 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the acid rain treaty, attended by Bob Rae and Elizabeth May.

The shock of Trump made Mulroney newly relevant. “The government was scrambling like mad to find a point of traction with the new administration,” says Burney. Mulroney had known Trump for decades. They lunched occasionally in New York; he also often speaks with Jared Kushner, says Burney. His friend Wilbur Ross was named secretary of commerce. Schwarzman, of Blackstone, whose board he’d sat on since 2007, was named head of Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum.

Initial talks between the government and Mulroney focused on the new U.S. government, says Burney (Mulroney declined Maclean’s interview request). He and Mulroney were invited to brief a cabinet committee on NAFTA; they brought together members of their original free-trade team to talk to Freeland, her chief negotiator and people from the PMO. “We each had several discussions with various players over the course of the negotiations,” he says. Mulroney’s message was consistent, Burney says: “Don’t pay attention to the bombast. Don’t play the Twitter game with the guy. Just stick to your guns and stare them down.” They shared their “No deal’s better than a bad deal” mantra from the first round. “I think they appreciated hearing it,” he says. “A lot of members of the cabinet were not even born when the free-trade agreement was concluded.”

Mulroney provided the public image of a steady hand at the tiller. “There’s movement going on between Canada and the United States at the moment, led by the Prime Minister, and I think it’s all positive,” he told CBC’s Power & Politics in December 2016. He also flattered Trump, calling him “a very solid citizen.” U.S.-Canada trade is “a perfect model,” he said. “They have no problems with us. I think they’re talking mostly about Mexico”—a comment soon seen to have no grounding in reality.

Mulroney also arranged for Schwarzman, nicknamed “Trump’s China whisperer” for his contacts with that country, to speak at the Liberal caucus retreat in Calgary in January 2017. (Blackstone’s first executive hire in Canada in 2014 was Mulroney’s son-in-law, Andrew Lapham.) In what would be a case of universes colliding, Freeland also met with Schwarzman and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser who sits on Barrick’s international advisory board with Mulroney. As a journalist, Freeland interviewed Schwarzman for Plutocrats, which described his ostentatious 60th birthday party in 2007, just before a market meltdown.

In March 2017, the Mulroneys dined with Trump and his wife, Melania, at a cancer research fundraiser at Mar-A-Lago; Mulroney reprised history, singing When Irish Eyes Are Smiling for another president.

When the NAFTA deal appeared in peril in September, Mulroney fielded media questions. “Have we missed a chance? You never do in life,” he said. “There’s always another chance.” Weeks later, the deal was signed. It was a big win for Canada, and for Mulroney, says Baird: “All the wins we got in this renegotiation were keeping things he had successfully fought for in the original trade deal.” Baird sees the Liberal validation of Mulroney’s record as a vindication: “[Margaret] Thatcher was once asked what her greatest accomplishment was,” Baird says. “Her response was ‘Tony Blair.’ And in many ways, one of Mr. Mulroney’s greatest accomplishments was to get the Liberal government to be such a champion of free trade.”

Mulroney was not paid for his advisory role, says a PMO spokesperson. Asked if there was any discussion or screening of potential conflict of interest given Mulroney’s directorships with companies that could be affected by the treaty, the PMO declined to answer. (Liberal legislation did pave the way for another Mulroney board seat—announced on Oct. 17, 2018, the day cannabis was legalized—with New York City-based cannabis company Acreage Holdings.)

Post-politics, foreign governments honoured Mulroney, who was handed the highest civilian awards from Ukraine, Japan, South Africa and France. His return to the public eye in 2016 provided a moment to highlight his accomplishments on the world stage, says Fen Hampson, professor of international affairs at Carleton University, and author of Master of Persuasion: Brian Mulroney’s Global Legacy, published in 2018. Hampson, who has co-authored op-eds and a 2014 book with Burney, saw a void, he tells Maclean’s: “We remember Mulroney for, shall we say, his indiscretions. But that’s overshadowed by a much more substantiative policy legacy that requires sober second analysis.” The glowing foreword, by former U.S. secretary of state James A. Baker III, sets the tone: “Under Brian Mulroney’s leadership Canada punched well above its weight on the world’s stage.” Hampson writes of Mulroney’s “moral crusade for justice,” highlighting his advocacy to end apartheid in South Africa, which saw him spar with Thatcher, and also giving Canada a respected voice at the G7. “He operated on the theory that ‘I’m not dealing with what’s going to be popular today, I’m doing things that are going to be good for the country in 10 years’ time,’ ” says Hampson, who notes Mulroney sat with him for interviews.

Last year, Mulroney received yet another honour: entry into the Canadian Disability Hall of Fame for his “extraordinary contribution to enriching the quality of life for Canadians with physical disabilities.” As PM, Mulroney instructed his finance minister to provide something in the budget for Canadians with disabilities, Burney says, noting Mulroney had three cousins with disabilities; he presents a heroic picture of a young Mulroney carrying them to the shrine of Baie-Comeau’s Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré in search of a miracle.

Another church, the Washington National Cathedral, would provide a defining Mulroney moment as he represented Canada at the funeral of George H.W. Bush with cabinet minister Scott Brison and U.S. ambassador David MacNaughton. With Trump in the first row, Mulroney employed strategic hyperbole to celebrate the U.S. (“in my judgment, the greatest democratic republic that God has ever placed on the face of this Earth”) and Bush Sr. (“no occupant of the Oval Office was more courageous, more principled and more honourable”). He emphasized their shared legislative legacy—the Clean Air Act that resulted in the acid rain treaty was “a splendid gift to future generations of Americans and Canadians”; NAFTA was “recently modernized and improved by new administrations,” which “created the largest and richest free-trade area in the history of the world.” Bush’s first Gulf War “will rank with the most spectacular and successful international initiatives ever undertaken in modern history,” he said, as sanitized a view of that conflict as could be imagined. Mulroney ended with an Irish proverb: There are wooden ships / There are sailing ships / There are ships that sail the sea / But the best ships are friendships / And may they always be. It was cringingly sentimental. It was also pitch-perfect amid unprecedented political polarity.

The Mulroney Institute of Government, set to open officially this year at StFX, has been in the works for more than a decade. The institute is the closest Canada has come to erecting a U.S.-style presidential library; Mulroney has called the school, which will offer an undergraduate degree in public policy, a “mini version” of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Former U.S. president Bill Clinton and former British prime minister Tony Blair will lecture, he promised.

Cladding on the site featured photos of Mulroney with Reagan and Thatcher, and with Pope John Paul II and Nelson Mandela. Mulroney Hall will house academic and research labs and offices as well as Mulroney memorabilia, including selected correspondence and a replica of his office as PM. Fundraising began in 2012, with Mulroney collecting close to $60 million himself (he has close ties to StFX, having graduated with a political science B.A. in 1959). His friends were generous, among them Koch, Ross, Gerald Schwartz, Weston, Ron Joyce, Paul Desmarais and Segal. Mulroney personally contributed $1 million. Nova Scotia gave $5 million. In April 2017, the federal government announced $30 million in funding for three campus projects, including the institute. Harper was urged to pony up by members of his cabinet, but did not.

The legacy project again put investigative journalists to work—and created the headlines associated with Mulroney: proximity to unseemly activities, but no conviction. An international consortium of journalists who looked into donors found two with links to arms sales and tax havens. Victor Dahdaleh, a British-Canadian businessman, and Wafic Saïd, who contributed a combined $5.5 million, both received honorary doctorates from StFX in 2015, though neither attended the university nor has connection to the province. Mulroney sat on the board of the Bermuda-based Said Holdings Limited between 2004 and 2012, according to the Paradise Papers. (In an email, StFX president Kent MacDonald writes that protocols for giving honorary degrees were followed and both men have histories of donating to education internationally.)

The influx of cash has been transformative on campus, says history professor McInnis. Still, he expresses concern about the sources of some funding, noting commerce secretary Ross’s ties to Russia. How much control donors will have of the curriculum is unclear, he says. “Obviously donors get a say to a certain point. But if it crosses the line into infringing on academic freedom, that’s a concern.” Koch runs the Koch Foundation, whose donations were found to come with a say in the hiring and firing of professors at Virginia’s George Mason University.

McInnis sees burnishing of not only Mulroney’s reputation but of the Conservative party more generally. The former desk of John A. Macdonald, a parting gift to Mulroney from the PC party in 1993, will be displayed behind glass. Macdonald’s role as the architect of residential schools is problematic, he says, given the pressure on the university under the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to deal with Indigenous issues. (The Mulroney Institute will fund a $1-million bursary for Indigenous students.)

Burney refers to Mulroney as “the patriarch of the Conservative party,” even though the party he led no longer exists. “The PC party was a big-tent party that encompassed a lot of different people—Red Tories and social conservatives—and we all had to work together,” says Campbell. “That made it a challenge to lead. It also meant it was a pretty centrist political institution.” Campbell couldn’t survive in today’s Conservative party, she says: “It’s too intolerant; it’s too right-wing.”

In recent interviews, Mulroney too has drawn a line, emphasizing his government’s record of increasing the flow of immigrants and refugees into the country. He told Power & Politics of his “firm belief that Canada and other democracies only prosper with great waves of immigration . . . Anything that varies from what I just said should be unacceptable.”

Mulroney’s association with the current Conservatives is complex. He avidly supported his daughter Caroline Mulroney’s run for leadership of the Ontario Conservatives—and the creation of a possible Mulroney political dynasty. In Patrick Brown’s 2018 book Takedown: The Attempted Political Assassination of Patrick Brown, the deposed Ontario Conservative leader reveals that Mulroney promised Brown a place “at the centre” of his daughter’s government if he swung his organizational clout to her campaign for leader—and then for premier. Brown didn’t. Caroline Mulroney, a political neophyte, lost the leadership race but won a seat and was named attorney general in the Doug Ford government.

Tensions are also said to exist between Andrew Scheer’s team and Mulroney. Scheer spokesperson Daniel Schow is vague when asked about the relationship: “They’ve spoken. They have friends in common. They’re both Conservative politicians.” Mulroney will be diplomatically quiet during the federal election, his spokesperson Sears predicts: “No one expects him to be completely silent. But I think he’ll be more circumspect and less frequent.” Speaking up is a delicate matter, given his daughter’s place in the Ford government. “He is used as a club to beat her with by the Liberals and New Dems,” Sears says. (Friends say Mulroney is not happy about Butt’s tweets that criticize his daughter’s rejection of a carbon tax.) Sears laments Canada’s treatment of retired politicians: “I find it so distressing that when we have a former leader pass from the stage we put them on the iceberg and let them float gently out to sea.” In a conversation held before Canadian ambassador to China John McCallum’s exit, Sears proposes that Mulroney’s skill set could be useful in the current standoff with China. “[Jean] Chrétien and Brian have forgotten more about Canada-China relations than these kids would know in the next 10 years,” he says. “Why not call either of them to make a discreet visit to Beijing to express our sympathies for the unhappiness this situation has caused the both of us and say, ‘Are there any messages you want to convey privately?’ ” Using former U.S. presidents to broker such matters is a time-honoured American trick. It’s telling of the political moment, and of Mulroney’s reputational rehab, that it’s an idea not unworthy of consideration.

In separate statements Thursday, Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach announced they would not to seek a third mandate but will remain as MPs until the election.

The decisions represent the latest blow to the third-place party, which has already seen a slew of MPs leave or announce their decision not to run for another term in October.

That list includes Alberta MP Linda Duncan, Ontario MPs Irene Mathyssen and David Christopherson, Quebec MPs Tom Mulcair, Helene Laverdiere and Romeo Saganash, and B.C. MPs Kennedy Stewart, Sheila Malcolmson and Fin Donnelly.

Boutin-Sweet and Quach were both elected for the first time during the so-called Orange Wave in 2011, when the NDP under then-leader Jack Layton rode historic gains in Quebec to become the Official Opposition.

The 63-year-old Boutin-Sweet, who represents the Montreal-area riding of Hochelaga, said representing her riding ""requires a lot of time and energy"" and she doesn't have the energy she had eight years ago.

Thirty-six-year-old Quach, who represents the riding of Salaberry—Suroit southwest of Montreal, said she was leaving for family reasons as she is pregnant with her second child and her young daughter is preparing to start school.

""I'm convinced the NDP has a future here in the riding, in Quebec and in Canada,"" Quach added. ""Many of us share the same values of solidarity, commitment and protection of our common good.""

The dual departures still underline the NDP's recent struggles, particularly in Quebec.

Not only has the party suffered several poor byelection results under current leader Jagmeet Singh, it has also had trouble raising money while its support in the polls has fallen.

New Democrats are hoping to turn things around next week in byelections for the Montreal riding of Outremont, which was held by their former leader Mulcair, and Stewart's former B.C. riding of Burnaby South, where Singh is running.",Another NDP MP rules out running for re-election,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/boutin-sweet-ndp-singh-quebec-1.5028561

in its history. Nitin Sharma traces the journey of the rally, which was conceived  38 years ago and has enthralled rallyists as well as tricity r…","It was on the evening of July 19, 1980 that the St John’s Old Boys Association (SJOBA) was formed at the founder president Manmohan Lal Sarin’s home in Chandigarh. Nine months after the body came into being, SJOBA organised its first Scooter Motorcycle SJOBA Rally on March 8, 1981. While the first edition of the rally saw more than 40 riders competing, the second edition also saw the introduction of cars and jeeps in. The rally, which started as a one-day long affair, will see its 32nd edition being held over three days starting March 1 later this year

“The first meeting of SJOBA was held with 19 members on July 19, 1981 and the founding members were keen on organising a sporting event. Unlike other sports, motorsports gives an opportunity to a young rider to compete against an older rider and vice versa; this was the main reason we decided to hold the first SJOBA Rally in March, 1982.,” recalls Sarin, adding how he would accompany his brother Ranjit Lal Sarin to chalk out the route. “We also came out with a souvenir publication, which we used to raise funds for advertisements to conduct the rally,” adds Sarin.

The first rally, which was flagged off from the St John’s High School, Sector 26, was meant only for the scooter/motorbikes. The four-wheelers were introduced in the second edition. The first route of the rally saw riders traversing from Chandigarh to Kasauli-Dagshai-Chail and back to Chandigarh on the same day.

This year, the rally will be conducted for the first time in the plains with the new route covering places like Baddi in Himachal Pradesh and Garshankar in Punjab apart from seeing a night stage.

“We started with the stage format and a couple of women riders too competed in the second edition of the rally. As the number of participants grew in the coming years, we made it a two-day affair in 1996. After getting the affiliation with Federation of Motor Sports Club of India (FMSCI) in 2000, we also introduced the time-speed-distance (TSD) format in 2007 apart from converting the rally to a three-day long drive in 2006, which meant that the city residents could also see the rallyists in action. Nowadays, more and more riders are competing in the TSD format too and that is good for rallying. This year we have also introduced the night stage apart from conducting the rally in plains in Punjab,” said SPS Ghai, one of the founding members of SJOBA.

Champions Speak

With rallyists like five-time SJOBA champion Suresh Rana to celebrities like Gul Panag, the rally has seen some of India’s top ranked rallyists in its 31 editions. Rana, who is a multiple winner of Raid-De-Himalaya, will be making his return to SJOBA this year after missing the rally for some years. “The best thing about SJOBA Rally is that it helps you prepare for the more tougher rallies with the same kind of terrain and competitiveness. It is a short rally in terms of number of days as well as route but that makes it more competitive too. I am making a return to the rally after some years and I will be driving a Gypsy this time instead of Grand Vitara. The fact that the rally is being held in plains will make the rally more open and it will be a exciting thing to compete in the night stage too,” shares Rana, who is based in Manali.

Kalka biker Mohit Verma, a three-time winner in the rally in the motorbikes format with his first title coming in 2011, sees the rally as a big stepping stone in his racing career. 28-year-old Verma, who became the only Indian rider to win the Raid-De-Himalaya, Desert Storm, Dakshin Dare and SJOBA Rally in 2014, is currently away from the circuit due to an injury.

“If you are a beginner, the SJOBA Rally puts you in competition against experienced riders and a rider can take him time to master the format and return back strong in the next edition. When I won the title in 2011, it was one of my first titles and gave me a lot of confidence. In 2014, when I won the titles in all the rallies, it meant a lot for me. I suffered an injury in 2015 but those wins are always special for me,” shared Verma. Two-time winner in TSD format, Jagmeet Gill also believes the same. “Winning the rally twice in the TSD format as a former student means a lot for me. I had competed for the first time in 2009 in the rally. As a rallyist, one enjoys the tough competition in this rally,” shared 34-year-old Gill.

Woman Power

Over the years, SJOBA Rally has seen more than 50 women participants competing as riders as well as navigators. Last year, the rally saw riders like Sarah Kashyap, Anita Krishan and Suzanne Bull competing in the Extreme Moto category apart from some woman riders in the TSD format. Kashyap, who had moved to Dubai last year, is the only Indian female rider to complete Raid-De-Himalaya and Desert Storm.

The 33-year-old competed for the first time in the rally in 2015 while riding a Bullet. Last year, Kashyap finished first in the ladies category and 11th overall in Moto Extreme category. “I first heard about SJOBA rally when I was kid. I never thought I will compete in the rally one day. When I competed in the rally in 2015, it was my first rally ever and I had never raced before that. I kept falling off the motorbike and I even got a heat stroke after which the organsiers asked me if I wanted to continue. I got an appreciation award that year and it motivated me. I have competed in the rally three times so far and it has laid the foundation for many cross-country rallies for me. It was easily the stepping stone for Raid-De-Himalaya and Desert Storm and taught me the required skills. The rally has new routes every year and it poses fresh challenges every year,” shares Kashyap.

Former Miss India and Bollywood actress Gul Panag too competed in the TSD format in the rally in 2010 with her two cousins and an aunt. Panag acted as the navigator for her cousin Simrat and they won the event in the women’s category in TSD format. “It was an experience to remember for all of us. My team consisted of my two cousins and aunt and all four of us competed in the TSD format. Being the navigator, I was responsible for guiding my cousin about the route and also keep a track of others things. It was a different challenge in every stage and we enjoyed a lot competing in such a rally. It is good to see more and more women riders competing in such events,” shares Panag.

Logistics Control

There is a lot of logistics involved in the rally that sees close to 80 riders competing in the 4WD Extreme, Moto Extreme and TSD categories apart from spectators stage SSS.

Vishal Sharma, the present president of SJOBA, says their task begins with charting out the route. “The chalking of route begins 40-50 days prior to the rally and we do the recce of the whole route more than five times. Then there is the task of making rule books and log books for the route. Once I was officiating as a marshal and sitting on a hill top. A group of monkeys came and took my equipment,” he laughs.

Another SJOBA member Vivek Bansal handles the communication part of the rally which means setting up the communication channels and radio for the drivers. “I am Ham Radio operator and the toughest part in SJOBA rally is to provide coverage in the valleys. Most of the times, we sit on hilltops to get full coverage. Once while officiating at Barog, we had a slide shave when lightning struck my radio and other equipment,” shares Bansal.

Kshitij Sharma, secretary, SJOBA, too has seen the action from close. “This year, more than 140 SJOBA members will act as volunteers and we have got close to 80 entries. The event has been successful because of the efforts of all the members as well as riders,” says Sharma.

The Way Ahead

With new sponsors supporting the rally, it will see the night stage happening this year. As Manmohan Lal Sarin proudly shows the first souvenir, he is quick to add, “The rallying gods have been kind to us in all these years. Apart from one incident in the starting years when a car skidded down and the death of a rider in an accident some years later, the rally has been conducted smoothly. When a rallyist died in an accident, we were deeply saddened and thought about discontinuing the rally.

But then Brother Meredith told us to remain calm and see it as a mishap, which can take place in any sport. When the car of a competitor fell into a khud, Jimmy Sehgal, one of the competitors and leader at that point, stopped and helped the rider. Such heartwarming incidents have given strength to the organisers and rallyists.”

‘My first win at SJOBA will always be special’

SPS Garcha, 65, still remembers the first time he competed in the SJOBA rally. It was the first edition of the rally in 1981 and the 1971 batch alumnus of St John’s was also actively involved in organising the rally. Garcha, who started competing in motorsports in 1977, became the first winner of the Scooter/Motorbike Open SJOBA Rally in 1981 and went on to become the national champion for five successive years from 1982 to 1987.

Garcha won the rally on a Jawa motorcyle and was told not to compete in the following editions of the rally to give others a chance.

“I was actively involved in planning the route and doing the recce for the rally. I used to have a 1966 JAWA motorbike at that time. After the first stage in the morning, we had lunch at Solan with me in the lead but on the eay back , my bike’s rear brakes got heated. As the route was uphill, I removed the brakes and continued. Riding uphill does not require much of rear brakes and when I reached Barog, the brakes had cooled down and I completed the last stage. I have very find memories of my first win,” says Garcha.

The motorsports champion also used to run a garage in those days. The following years saw him working closely with the Federation of Motor Sports Club of India (FMSCI) and officiating in many rallies besides working as the federation’s regional director. A senior steward and technical delegate with FMSCI, the former rallyist is still involved in charting the route and officiating at the SJOBA Rally. “In the 1980s, we would read books and magzines to learn about various rules and the various formats of a rally. Since the rally was held only in Stage Rally format, it would mean spending hours chalking out the route and understanding the map. There was less traffic and most of the roads were tracks. Despite tech advancements, the core of the racing has remained intact. That’s why a lot of new riders compete every year,” adds Garcha.

Looking back at his long and adventurous innings, Garcha remembers an incident during the Raid De Himalaya. “I was officiating as one of the stewards of the course when one of the cars did not cross the next point. Knowing that something was wrong, we reversed and sure enough, I saw skid marks. It was close to midnight but we launched a search for the car.

Finally. More than 16 months after he cruised to victory in the NDP leadership race, the 40-year-old politician from Ontario clinched his first federal seat in a British Columbia byelection Monday.

Not only will Singh now be able to lead his party from the floor of the House of Commons, he may also have saved his political career, for defeat in Burnaby South on Monday — as many NDP insiders have put it — was simply not an option for the third-place party. Singh’s victory came in one of three byelections held Monday, as voters in key battleground areas cast ballots against the backdrop of the lingering SNC-Lavalin scandal. In York-Simcoe, the Conservatives hold onto a Greater Toronto Area riding that has been a lock for the party since 2004. And here in Outremont, a diverse and multilingual district at the heart of the Island of Montreal, voters returned to their long-established tradition of electing Liberals, 12 years after Thomas Mulcair’s breakthrough here became the symbolic forerunner to the unprecedented success of the “orange wave” election in 2011.

The NDP leader campaigned against a Liberal government he accuses of cosying up to corporate friends, falling short on affordable housing and failing to take climate change seriously. The riding was previously held by Kennedy Stewart, an NDP MP who won by about 500 votes in 2015 and resigned the seat last year to run for Vancouver mayor. David Coletto, chief executive officer of Abacus Data, said a Singh victory is the first bit of good news the NDP has had in a long time. Under Singh’s leadership — which began when he cruised to victory in the October 2017 leadership race — the NDP has stalled in the polls, seen a parade of sitting MPs quit or announce they won’t run again in the general election, and experienced a sharp drop in fundraising from more than $18 million in 2015 to roughly $5 million last year.

Article Continued Below

Singh’s entry to the House of Commons gives the party a chance to change the narrative, Coletto said. “It gives them a huge opportunity to pivot and to start rebuilding his own reputation,” he said. “Low expectations can be a really powerful tool, because it’s easier to meet them.” Singh’s chances may have been boosted by the SNC-Lavalin scandal, which the NDP has used to portray the Liberals as a band of faux-progressive allies of big business. Combined with a Liberal stumble — candidate Karen Wang was replaced by former MLA Richard Lee partway through the race — and the possibility that People’s Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson snags votes from the Conservatives’ Jay Shin, the riding looked primed for a Singh win, said political scientist David Moscrop. “Burnaby South is sort of cooked for him to win,” he said Monday morning. Meanwhile, the results in York-Simcoe pointed to victory for Conservative candidate Scot Davidson. For 14 years, the riding north of Toronto was home to Peter Van Loan, a Harper-era cabinet minister who resigned from the House of Commons last year. That continued Monday with Davidson on pace to beat Liberal challenger — and second-time candidate — Shaun Tanaka. With such a record of Conservative voting, Coletto said he is looking to see how Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party — and local candidate Robert Geurts — performs in the riding. “The most important signal we get from tonight is how well does Max Bernier’s party do,” he said, adding the party could make an impact in all three byelections. “That will give us an indication of the potential effectiveness of his party,” he said. Meanwhile, Outremont was a Liberal stronghold for decades, until Mulcair won it for the NDP in a 2007 byelection. It is therefore hallowed turf for New Democrats, who see Mulcair’s success as the symbolic toehold for the “orange wave” in 2011, when the party was lifted to its best-ever federal election result by overwhelming success in Quebec. But now that Mulcair has left politics, local lawyer Rachel Bendayan wrested Outremont back for the Liberals Monday night. By late Monday, she had a sizable lead over Julia Sanchez, an economist who worked for decades in international development, who campaigned on an environment-focused platform for the NDP. One factor in the race may have been voter reaction to the SNC-Lavalin affair, which has a strong local component given the company is headquartered nearby in downtown Montreal and is a significant employer in the province. Shachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute not-for-profit polling firm, said while early polling has suggested the Liberals have taken a hit during the controversy, SNC-Lavalin is seen in a different light — as a big employer worth saving — by many in the province. But regardless of its impact Monday, it is too early to conclude whether the controversy surrounding the company and Justin Trudeau’s office will linger into the fall general election, Moscrop said. “I think this is a reminder to the Liberals that, boy, you don’t want this in the news in October,” he said. “The sooner you deal with this completely, the better.” Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

No, no, no: The men who wanted SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal prosecution engaged in “Grand-Master-Jedi-level gaslighting” of former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould by repeatedly refusing to accept her authority on the file and then insisting she was under no pressure, writes Anne Kingston:

Even before her testimony, however, an eerily familiar tale has unfolded, the last chapter in the spell-binding spiel from [Privy Council Clerk] Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, this week before the justice committee. And that’s the spectre of powerful men not used to hearing “No,” not willing to accept “No,” doggedly pushing for a “Yes” from the person who ostensibly determines consent, then gaslighting her when they don’t hear it. Through it all a question emerges: How many times did Jody Wilson Raybould need to say “No” before she was heard? (Maclean’s)

Singh needs this win: Monday is also byelection day. Votes will be counted in three ridings, including Ontario’s York-Simcoe and Outremont in Montreal. But the one everyone will be watching is Burnaby South, where NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh hopes to finally secure a seat in the House. With his leadership in question, and the NDP low on polling and fundraising support, Singh needs victory—and the SNC-Lavalin mess embroiling Liberals can only help “(Singh) may have been handed the gift of some voters as a result of all this,” saysRichard Johnston, a University of British Columbia political science professor. “Although it’s just one thing amongst many, boy, he could use a win right now.” (Canadian Press, CBC News)

Politics show round-up

Didn’t catch the weekend politics shows? Here’s what you missed:

In his testimony to the justice committee Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick attacked the original Globe and Mail story that kicked off the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Bob Fife, one of the journalists who broke the story, made the rounds, and on CTV’s Question Period defended the scoop: “In politics the best defence is often a strong offence, and particularly shooting the messenger, but in his testimony [Wernick] actually confirmed what we reported—we reported Miss Wilson-Raybould was subjected to pressure to cut a deal so SNC-Lavalin would not be prosecuted, would pay a fine. We did not say the Prime Minister directed her to do so. Nobody said that. In fact nobody did do that.” (CTV video tweet)

Speaking on Question Period Conservative Justice Critic Lisa Raitt said Wernick’s committee testimony shows lines were crossed with Wilson-Raybould: “Jody Wilson-Raybould told the prime minister and the clerk of the privy council in no uncertain terms she wasn’t going to overrule her deputy on the matter. That’s where it should end. And yet we see time and time again through phone calls through meetings between her staff and the PMO, the prime minister himself, Gerald Butts, and whoever else that we’ll find along the way, all took it upon themselves to go in and check-in with her and see whether or not she’s taken another decision.” (CTV News)

Following Friday’s recommendation by the National Energy Board that the Trans Mountain pipeline be approved, Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Ottawa is on track to wrap up consultations with 117 Indigenous committees that would be impacted by the pipeline within the next few months: “The work that we have done so far and the work we will continue to do in the coming months, I can tell you that I feel that we are in a very strong position to conclude these consultations within the next 90 days. But we must get it right.” (Global News)

On Trans Mountain, Canada’s fisheries minister Jonathan Wilkinson told CBC’s The House that increased tanker traffic from the pipeline expansion won’t have much additional impact on endangered southern resident killer whales because they’re already being blasted with underwater noise. “It’s important to understand that the plight of the southern resident killer whale has very little to do with the Trans Mountain pipeline, he said. “There are 3,200 large container ships that come into Burrard Inlet every year, there are thousands of ferries…. All of those generate noise. So irrespective of whether Trans Mountain proceeds there’s a need for us to actually address issues around marine traffic.” (CBC News)

Tomorrow night, party leader Jagmeet Singh finds out if he's secured his first-ever seat in the House of Commons — staving off what almost certainly would be a mortal threat to his leadership.

And while he's waiting to hear the results in the riding of Burnaby South, he'll also be watching anxiously as the returns come in from Outremont, one of three ridings holding byelections Monday night. The riding of York-Simcoe, in the northern part of the Greater Toronto Area, is expected to remain in Conservative hands, but the other two seats are seen as up for grabs.

For Singh, the stakes in Burnaby South are substantially personal: a win there may be the only way to silence the internal grumbling about his leadership that threatens to follow him into a general election campaign.

For the NDP itself, Outremont is symbolic: losing the Montreal-area riding held by former leader Tom Mulcair until his resignation on Aug. 3, 2018, would send a dire signal to voters and prospective candidates alike about the party's ability to hold at least some of the Quebec base that made it the Official Opposition in 2011.

Singh isn't believed to be a lock to win Burnaby South. In the 2015 federal election, the Liberals came within 547 votes of the winning NDP candidate, Kennedy Stewart, who resigned the seat in September 2018 for a successful run at Vancouver's mayoralty.

But New Democrats, publicly and privately, are expressing confidence about Singh's chances in the riding. ​Singh has put in the work; he and his team estimate they have knocked on over 30,000 doors in the riding since launching his campaign back in August.

""Biting my nails? No,"" said Quebec NDP MP Pierre-Luc Dusseault. ""I mean, from what we heard on the ground now — in Burnaby, especially — things are good. So I am not too stressed about this one.""

""Once you spend a lot of time or get to meet Jagmeet, you'll like him and he'll be a great addition here in the House,"" said B.C. New Democrat MP Wayne Stetski.

""We will certainly be winning in Burnaby. We have a tight race in Outremont, but we have a great candidate,"" said Ontario NDP MP Charlie Angus.

The stakes for Singh

Losing Burnaby South would put Singh in a bad place. His profile in federal politics has been held back by his absence from the Commons. The CBC's Poll Tracker puts the party's national support at just 14 per cent, while its recent fundraising performance has been dismal.

With an October federal election bearing down, nervous New Democrats have put Singh on notice. Last month, CBC News reported that several senior members of the federal caucus warned Singh back in June that he won't be able to hang on as party leader if he loses in Burnaby South.

""He absolutely must do well, win that seat. Because if he doesn't, if he happens to lose, I don't see how he can stay on as leader,"" said Karl Belanger, former national party director and principal secretary to Mulcair.

Some New Democrats see a win in Burnaby South as the only way to silence the self-destructive party chatter about Singh's limits as a politician — grumbling that former NDP strategist Farouk Karim compared to ""shooting yourself in the foot.""

""I mean, you're not helping yourself,"" he said. ""Once people see you as a winner, things change. Everything is a domino effect. People have a better perspective on who you are.""

New Democrats are less confident of their chances in Outremont. Earlier this month, CBC News reported that three separate polls showed the party struggling in Quebec, scene of its spectacular ""Orange Wave"" breakthrough in 2011. The party won 16 seats in Quebec in the 2015 federal election and the Quebec contingent makes up the largest provincial grouping in the federal NDP caucus.

Those three polls all put the party underwater in Quebec — below the 12.2 per cent of the vote the party captured in Quebec in the 2008 federal election, when Mulcair was the province's sole NDP MP.

That's bad news for the party's Outremont candidate, Julia Sanchez — and worse news for the party itself, which is struggling already with the fact that more than a quarter of its caucus members have decided they won't be running in October.

On Thursday, two Quebec New Democrat MPs — Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach — announced they will not seek re-election later this year.

""Losing Outremont will be emotionally difficult, not only for Tom Mulcair, but for a lot of New Democrats across the country,"" Belanger said.

A glass half full

Some New Democrats are describing the party's byelection prospects as a glass half full — suggesting that a win in Burnaby South coupled with a loss in Outremont would represent nothing more than a symbolic changing of the guard.

""A new generational leader comes up at the Burnaby byelection, while we lose the riding of the former leader. So it's energizing,"" said Karim. ""I think people will like it and people can't wait to see Jagmeet in action in the house and to energize the base towards the election.""

But that spin underestimates Outremont's symbolic value to New Democrats — and the demoralizing effect a loss there would have on a party that still needs a foothold in Quebec.

""If you combine a loss in Outremont with the recent results in other byelections that happened in Quebec recently, with the current polling, the prospects of NDP MPs returning to Parliament from Quebec en masse are very slim,"" said Belanger.

""It is very symbolic because it was the first seat won by an NDP MP in Quebec in a general election and obviously became the beachhead that led to what became the Orange Wave in 2011.""

The hunt for candidates

A loss in Outremont could make it much harder for the NDP to attract top-quality candidates, said CBC News poll analyst Eric Grenier.

""They already have a number of incumbents who said they're not running again. They need some good candidates, they need some fresh faces,"" he said.

""But if they're not able to show that they're actually able to win, to get support in the province, are they going to have good candidates? Are they going to be able to make the case that they are the ones who can represent Quebecers in the House of Commons?""

Grenier said that if the NDP loses Mulcair's Quebec seat, it should fervently hope to at least come in a close second.

""Quebec is so important to the NDP that they need to have a sign that they still have a chance to be competitive in the province.""

The dual departures nonetheless underline the NDP’s recent struggles, particularly in Quebec. Not only has the party suffered several poor byelection results under current leader Jagmeet Singh, it has also had trouble raising money while support in the polls has fallen. New Democrats are hoping to turn things around next week in byelections for the Montreal riding of Outremont, which was held by their former leader Mulcair, and the Stewart’s former B.C. riding of Burnaby South, where Singh is running.

439,Empty,2019-02-22T19:01:38Z,Jagmeet Singh needs to win a seat in parliament before he can run for prime minister,"The leader of Canada’s left-of-centre New Democratic Party faces a key byelection on Monday that will decide whether or not he is able to challenge Justin Trudeau in October.

Jagmeet Singh, the first non-white leader of a major political party in the country’s history, must win the byelection in Burnaby, a city east of Vancouver, in order to get a seat in parliament and be in position to go up against the Canadian prime minister in this year’s general election.

While parties often decline to challenge a leader seeking a seat, both the Liberals, Conservatives and the newly-formed People’s party are running candidates in Burnaby South.

Mr Singh, the former human rights lawyer-turned-politician surprised his party – and the country – when he wrapped up the leadership race with a decisive first ballot win more than a year and a half ago. His quick rise in federal politics has excited voters across the country.

“His leadership can be seen as refreshing. People saw him as this very telegenic, easy-to-like guy, who might be able to compete on the celebrity level with Trudeau,” said Lori Turnbull, the director of Dalhousie University’s school of public administration.

But since his leadership win in late 2017, he and his progressive party have fallen into disarray. Sitting parliamentarians have resigned; others have indicated they won’t seek re-election. To make matters worse, the plurality of the seats currently held by the NDP are in Quebec, a province where support for the party has plummeted.

Dreams dashed

With party veterans fleeing, haemorrhaging finances and weak poll numbers, the rookie leader has the daunting task of salvaging and reconstituting the party, ensuring a battle-ready machine for the country’s election later this year.

Some of Mr Singh’s challenges can be attributed to his absence in the House of Commons: despite leading the party, he remains seatless.

“Because he doesn’t have a seat, he hasn’t really been given a lot of opportunity to indicate what his message is. He’s not in the house with the rest of the [leaders]” said Turnbull. While touring across the country seems like a good idea, she said,Mr Singh can’t be seen trading barbs with other party leaders.

Some feel that Mr Singh’s status as the first non-white leader of a major political party has also prompted unfair criticism of his tenure. While newly minted political leaders in Canada get “put through the wringer”, the treatment of Mr Singh has been disgraceful, said Rick Smith, executive director at the progressive Broadbent Institute and a former NDP staffer.

Racist nonsense

At the same time, the problems gripping the party are not Mr Singh’s alone.

The broader weakness of the party also raises questions about the future ambitions of the party in Canada’s left-of-centre politics. Long seen as the “conscience” of the country’s political system, the party increasingly has to compete against the Liberals to its right – and the Green Party to its left.

Monday’s test will be politically existential for Mr Singh: as he canvasses neighbourhoods, party members have said Mr Singh’s continued leadership is unlikely if he fails to win. – Guardian",Canada’s first non-white party leader seeks path to challenge Trudeau,The Irish Times,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/canada-s-first-non-white-party-leader-seeks-path-to-challenge-trudeau-1.3803123
440,Empty,2019-02-24T20:39:22Z,"As policy wonks look to turn the issue in their side's favour in the federal election, here are a few things they could consider","With housing affordability dominating discussions in living rooms and coffeeshops across the country, policy wonks in Canada’s political parties are looking for some way to turn the issue in their side’s favour in the federal election scheduled for the fall.

“I’m not sure there will be direct measures” on housing in next month’s budget, Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters in Victoria, B.C. a few weeks ago. That could mean the government is saving popular policies for an election campaign later this year, that it will stand pat on the house market, or that it is considering some kind of indirect measures.

Whatever the plan, here are a few policy ideas the government could consider.

Allow longer amortization periods

Since 2012, a 25-year amortization has been the maximum for anyone looking for a CMHC-insured mortgage. As housing affordability worsens, some have called for the government to reintroduce the option for 30-year terms.

A longer amortization period will increase the amount of interest the buyer pays, but it also allows people to spread the mortgage cost over more years. For example, a hypothetical $300,000 mortgage on a 30-year amortization period with an interest rate of four per cent would result in a monthly mortgage payment about $150 cheaper than a mortgage on a 25-year term. However, the buyer will end up paying about $40,000 more in total interest payments over the life of the loan. Some potential buyers struggling to get into the market might jump at that deal.

Adjust the stress test

The stress test, known as B20, requires borrowers to show they can handle interest rates two percentage points above the current rate and has resulted in about 20 per cent fewer mortgage originations among younger Canadians.

Some home builders and mortgage professionals have called for the stress test to be reduced by a half a percentage point or a whole point, which would boost the spending power of most buyers. Others have called for scrapping the test entirely.

The stress test doesn’t just affect new buyers, but anyone renewing their mortgage. If a homeowner is renewing their mortgage and fails the stress test, they lose the ability to shop around and have to renew with their current lender, potentially costing them a discount.

Bigger first-time home buyer credits

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh — campaigning for a byelection in the housing crisis ground zero of Burnaby South — has urged the government to double the first-time home buyer’s credit, taking it from $750 to $1,500.

Singh also proposed some relief to renters by proposing a subsidy for anyone paying more than a third of their income on rent payments.

Build affordable housing

Conservative MP Tom Kmiec, the party’s deputy finance critic, repeatedly refers to the distinction between housing affordability and affordable housing. Housing affordability refers more generally to the state of the market and whether a family making an average income can reasonably expect to purchase a house. Kmiec says the government’s policies to cool off the housing market have actually hurt the average Canadian’s chance of affording a house.

Affordable housing refers to government-subsidized housing for low-income people which can help housing affordability more generally, as the supply increases and prices come down.

Singh’s NDP have promised to build 500,000 affordable housing units over a 10-year period, if elected. The Liberal government’s $40-billion housing strategy is based around a “right to housing,” and the plan hopes to get 500,000 Canadians out of housing that is either unaffordable or inadequate. Oppositions parties say the plan has been moving too slowly to have a tangible effect on broader housing affordability issues.

Do nothing

It may not be sexy and, in fact, it may not even be possible for vote-hungry politicians to pledge to do nothing, but some experts say it’s the right path.

Policies that affect the housing market, like the stress test, take time to work, and even longer to show results, and it might be safer to wait for more data before making any policy changes, said Kyle Dahms, an economist at the National Bank of Canada, in a recent interview with the National Post.

The post Butts is gone, but #LavScam rolls on appeared first on Macleans.ca.","Andrew MacDougall is a London-based columnist, commentator and consultant at Trafalgar Strategy. He was formerly director of communications to Stephen Harper.

Pity Justin Trudeau.

Resigning your best friend to the political scrap heap can’t have been an easy day at the office. Especially when that best friend has been the best brain at your disposal during your meteoric rise to the leadership of the Liberal Party, and then Canada. Losing Gerry Butts, as Trudeau did yesterday, is akin to having the foundation ripped out of your house. While you’re still living in it and trying to convince Canadians it’s a safe place to call home.

But, in politics, sacking your best mate is sometimes the price you have to pay. After all, there is only one king, and he must be protected at all costs. If a scandal like SNC-Lavalin is ravaging a government, a firebreak has to be cut into the ground, before everyone gets burned. Butts, the Liberals hope, will be that firebreak.

It’s wishful thinking.

No one left in the Prime Minister’s Office should be holding his or her breath, especially the Prime Minister; if anything, the Butts resignation has pumped even more oxygen into the fire. As messy as yesterday was, greater messes lie ahead.

Nothing continues to add up. Reading Butts’ resignation letter on its own, you’d be hard-pressed to explain why he’s resigned. As he states on multiple occasions, he did nothing wrong and behaved properly at all times. His resignation is only, he says, an attempt to take a distracting target away from the government’s efforts to make Canada the bestest place in the world.

So why throw yourself out the door?

As former Paul Martin director of communications Scott Reid describes in a suspiciously well-informed series of tweets, Butts could be freeing himself up from the constraints of serving in the PMO in order to fight what he expects will be a soon-to-be unleashed legal fight with Jody Wilson-Raybould, Canada’s former attorney-general, a.k.a. the other party in the SNC pressure two-step. This makes sense.

It might even be the Prime Minister’s Office is now in receipt of a letter from Thomas Cromwell, Wilson-Raybould’s attorney (and former Supreme Court Justice), describing the “pressure” Wilson-Raybould says was brought to bear by the PMO upon her decision-making on the question of SNC-Lavalin.

At this point, however, speculation isn’t useful. Especially from me, given how I predicted Butts would never get got two days before he got got. All we know is that some form of “pressure” was described—albeit anonymously—in the original bombshell Globe and Mail report from a few weeks ago, and that Wilson-Raybould felt compelled to resign from cabinet when Trudeau offered his interpretation of the interaction between his office and hers.

And now we can add to that the Butts termination without cause.

Which makes it sound like we’re in for the mother of all he said / she said battles. Because even in an age of emails, texts and Whatsapp, we can’t expect much of a record describing whatever transpired. Savvy political operatives know not to leave footprints on sensitive files, which comfortably describes the SNC situation.

In other words, everything might come down to Trudeau’s word—and that of the players in his office—against that of Canada’s first female Indigenous justice minister, and that of her staff. Job one for Trudeau will now be to make sure as much of the battle takes place behind closed doors, away from prying reporters, or anyone else who could transmit the details to Canadians in real-time. A forum like an Ethics Commissioner’s investigation, which usually takes lots of time and leaves no lasting marks, as the investigation into Trudeau’s law-breaking Aga Khan trip proved.

In the meantime, the opposition members of the parliamentary Justice Committee hoping to question the principals at the heart of the dispute will continue to be shut out. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh will not get his public enquiry, which must be called by the government. In other words, Canadians should continue to expect more heat than light when it comes to what did or didn’t happen with SNC. Unless, that is, the RCMP decide to get involved.

Which isn’t to say Canadians won’t be making up their minds.

On the one hand they’ll see a mega-corporation from the politically-sensitive province of Quebec facing potential ruin, with a trail of meetings with the government leading to its door and a favorable legal remedy tucked into the budget on its behalf, and a demoted, resigned and now silent former attorney general with a very public letter lauding the independence of Canada’s justice system.

And on the other, they’ll see a government that still can’t get its story straight, trying to shut down every public avenue of enquiry into the matter, with a formerly untouchable advisor now out the door for apparently no good reason whatsoever.

We needn’t wonder what Canadians will make of that mess.

The election hasn’t yet been called, but both parties have already staked out key areas of support throughout the province, leaving Calgary up for grabs, according to a study by ThinkHQ Public Affairs.

“The premier does very well in Edmonton, the capital region, and doesn’t do quite as well outside the two major cities,” said president Marc Henry.

“They’re quite evenly matched in Calgary. Calgary’s going to be the battleground for the election. (Jason) Kenney’s going to take most of the seats outside of the two major centres. (Rachel) Notley’s going to take most of the seats in Edmonton and it’s going to come down to who wins Calgary is going to be who the next government is.”

The study also showed that despite efforts by the NDP to draw a stark contrast in leadership between Kenney and Notley, the underlying premise that the premier’s popularity outweighs that of the Opposition leader doesn’t hold up.

When it comes to approval, Notley sits at 44 per cent, compared to Kenney at 43 per cent. But she also suffers from higher disapproval ratings than Kenney, at 51 and 45 per cent, respectively.

“If (the NDP) were going to run on their record, they would have a much more difficult time than running on the leader,” said Henry, pointing to “controversial” policies of the NDP government, including the introduction of a carbon tax and raising the minimum wage.

“I think that there’s some overestimation of how popular Premier Notley is. Her approval numbers are good, but they’re about the same as Jason Kenney,” he said. “The two of them are actually quite evenly matched going into the election.”

Henry said that despite her higher disapproval rating, Notley polls better among undecided voters.

The study surveyed a non-random sample of more than 1,100 people, including about 400 in Calgary, through an online research panel between Jan. 31 and Feb. 6.

It was weighted to reflect gender, age and region of Alberta, according to population figures from Statistics Canada. A probability sample of this size would have a margin of error of +/- 2.9 percentage points at a 95 per cent confidence interval.

In Calgary, the NDP’s vote share is polling near what they achieved during the 2015 election, yet the governing party still trails the UCP by about 15 to 20 points, according to Henry.

He said Notley’s approval ratings are more impressive, in general, than the NDP’s polling numbers.

“So there are more people who think that they like Premier Notley than are planning on voting for them. That’s reversed for Jason Kenney. There are more people planning on voting UCP than there are people who approve of Jason Kenney,” Henry said.

“She’s probably the best tool that they have during the election and they would be wise to focus attention on her. I just don’t think that it’s panacea. It’s not going to necessarily solve the problem that they have.”

On Thursday morning, Transportation Minister Brian Mason said photo radar has been used as a revenue generation tool more than it should be, and as a result, changes are being implemented.

“I’m not going to say we’re going to shoot the cash cow, but we’re going to put it down humanely,” Mason said.

“It is not being optimized to improve safety outcomes on our highways and our roads.”

READ MORE: Alberta will review photo radar amid concerns it has become a cash cow

Starting in June, photo radar will be banned immediately beside spots where the speed limit changes on highways.

Also in June, photo radar on high-speed, multi-lane highways won’t be allowed unless there is documented proof of safety concerns.

Municipalities, who take in the lion’s share of photo radar revenue, will also have to present a clear plan to use photo radar, backed up by collision data to prove it’s being used at high risk locations.

“Those jurisdictions — whether they be a municipality or police force — that deploy photo radar must be held accountable to ensure the first two principles are followed,” Mason said.

Mason said Edmonton motorists likely will not see a major change in how photo radar is used in the Alberta capital, but that could happen next year.

“It’s not a complete final report that allows us to make a final conclusion or a final set of policies,” Mason said. “So there’s more work that needs to be done.”

Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson said he believes the city is already compliant with the stricter guidelines. He said the city is transparent about where photo-radar revenue goes.

“It’s important not to generalize about all municipalities. I can’t speak to what other municipalities do but in Edmonton, all of the money that comes in goes into a dedicated reserve,” Iveson said.

“We are also transparent about where that money goes and all of the money gets reinvested in traffic safety.”

“Edmonton is looked at as one of the leaders in traffic safety in the country, so I think the auto-speed enforcement is part of that,” added police chief Dale McFee.

There are 27 municipalities using photo radar, and the report says they generate about $220 million a year in revenue while reducing collisions by about 1.4 per cent.

The review found Calgary spent 2.7 million hours on photo radar and generated $38 million, while Edmonton spent 3.7 million hours at photo radar locations and generated $50.1 million.

The minister said photo radar can been an effective tool to improve traffic safety if used correctly.

“Some would say photo radar should be outright banned. I don’t think the data we do have, the limited data that we do have and the information, supports that conclusion,” he said.

“It does indicate there is a significant, although relatively small, improvement in traffic safety as a result of photo radar.”

In May 2017, the NDP government said it would review photo radar in Alberta after concerns the program was a “cash cow.”

The City of Edmonton has said automated enforcement is “proven to reduce speeding and change driver behaviour, thereby reducing collisions and the resulting injuries and fatalities.”

In 2018, 378,619 photo and laser radar tickets were issued in Edmonton. That’s a decrease from 458,508 in 2017, 522,780 in 2016 and 498,227 in 2015.

WATCH BELOW (Jan. 10, 2019): A sitting MLA is speaking out in favour of ending photo radar in Alberta. Fletcher Kent reports.

Last month, Alberta’s Freedom Conservative Party, led by Derek Fildebrandt, called for an end of non-red light photo radar across the province.

Fildebrandt slammed the Alberta NDP for the use of the program, which he called “a cash-cow scam-of-a-tax on drivers.” He pointed to a report compiled by his party that he said highlighted the “serious abuse of photo radar in municipalities across Alberta.”

READ MORE: Alberta’s Freedom Conservative Party calls for end of photo radar

In response, the office of the Minister of Transportation sent a statement to Global News.

“Since the beginning of the review, it’s been our goal to make sure that photo radar is used to ensure the safety of Alberta’s roads, not as a revenue tool,” the statement read.

“We’ve been continuing to consider how best to operationalize the results of our study, and will have more to say on the actions we’re taking later this month. We will also be releasing the report alongside these actions.

“Our government will continue to support safe roads, while also ensuring that the rules are administered fairly.”

Municipalities with 5,000 residents or more can run photo radar through their local police or RCMP. Some municipalities in Alberta have abolished the practice.

Most of the money from a photo radar ticket goes to the municipality. The province receives 16.67 per cent of the fines and 15 per cent goes to victim services.

“Effective immediately, Premier Doug Ford announced that Randy Hillier has been suspended indefinitely from the Ontario PC Caucus following his disrespectful comments to parents of children with autism,” a statement from Ford’s office said Wednesday.

“I want to listen to every parent, and every family member who wants to share their stories and their asks. But Mr. Hillier’s comments crossed the line and that is unacceptable.”

Hillier denied that his heckling — uttering “yada, yada, yada” — was directed at parents of kids with autism in the public galleries of Ontario’s legislature. They had showed up Wednesday to protest the government’s new autism treatment funding model.

His comment was meant for NDP MPP Monique Taylor, according to Hillier, who accused her of exploiting the parents for political gain.

“To use that hardship and to use that emotional strain for partisan purposes, I find that reprehensible,” he said.

Hillier added he wasn’t quite sure what a suspension entailed but he remained a fan of Ford, and expected his fellow caucus colleagues to give him a fair hearing.

Regardless of the target, families fighting for autism services were hurt by Hillier’s heckle which was dismissive and cruel, Taylor said.

“But families are far more hurt by Mr. Ford’s decision to cut their children’s services,” insisted Taylor, who hosted a media conference Wednesday for parents whose children will lose most of the funding they now receive for treatment.

She compared the government’s new autism treatment plan to burning $300 million on the front lawn of Queen’s Park.

Stephanie Ridley, parent of a non-verbal seven-year-old boy with autism, said her family has exhausted savings and can’t afford the cost of more treatment.

“Ewan will be trapped for the rest of his life trying to find his words,” Ridley said.

Under the revised funding model announced by Social Services Minister Lisa MacLeod, the entire funding pot is divided equally among children currently receiving service and the 23,000 who are on waiting lists.

“I’m proud of this plan,” MacLeod said, criticizing opposition parties for suggesting to parents it might still be changed.

The new program provides a maximum of $140,000 per child until the age of 18, but parents say treatment can easily cost $60,000 to $80,000 a year.

The government also claws back funding on a sliding-scale beginning when a family’s net income hits $55,000 a year.

Allison Jones, The Canadian Press





TORONTO -- Ontario issued a directive Thursday to Hydro One, ordering it to pay its CEO no more than $1.5 million per year -- substantially less than the partially privatized utility had proposed.

Hydro One and the government have been at loggerheads over executive compensation, with the company refusing repeated requests to slash the CEO pay below $2,775,000.

Energy Minister Greg Rickford had asked Hydro One last week to come up with a revised executive compensation framework that set its CEO's salary and incentives no higher than $1.5 million, but the utility didn't budge.

Rickford took the step Thursday of issuing a formal directive that compels Hydro One to set the CEO's base salary no higher than $500,000 with a maximum of $1 million in incentives. Those incentives must be dependent on meeting certain targets, including reducing transmission and distribution costs.

The Tories have promised to reduce electricity bills by 12 per cent.

Rickford said he was scheduled to have a discussion Thursday afternoon with the board chairman about the directive, but warned that ""there isn't any room to negotiate on this.""

""We're frankly focused on a directive that we think reflects a fair parameter for compensation for the CEO and the board of directors,"" Rickford said. ""I don't know how we could be more clear.""

The directive also requires that the Hydro One board chair be paid no more than $120,000 and board members be paid no more than $80,000 per year.

Hydro One issued a brief statement in response, confirming it had received the directive.

""The board will continue to focus on its CEO search,"" it said.

Less than two hours after Rickford announced the directive, the Progressive Conservatives sent a fundraising email about it to supporters, touting their action and asking for money.

""The board of Hydro One is trying to hire a new CEO,"" the email in Premier Doug Ford's name said. ""You know what they want to pay? $2.7 MILLION per year. For one person! We told them it's a flat-out no. But they didn't listen. So we are directing them.""

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the way in which the Tories have handled Hydro One seems to be about raising money for their party.

""I guess they're trying to appeal to their base, who I guess are folks that don't like to see CEO's of Hydro One having big salaries,"" she said.

Hydro One had said its proposed compensation framework took into account the need to attract, retain and motivate highly-qualified leadership at Ontario's largest electricity transmission and distribution provider, noting it is responsible for more than $25 billion in assets and annual revenues of nearly $6 billion.

But Rickford said that the compensation levels in the directive are reasonable, more closely aligning it with corporations such as Ontario Power Generation, which produces about 50 per cent of Ontario's electricity.

""Moving forward, I am confident that Hydro One's board of directors will continue to take steps to earn the trust and confidence of the people of Ontario,"" he said in a statement. ""I believe Hydro One's best days are ahead, and the corporation will emerge stronger than ever while respecting Ontario's electricity customers.""

The Progressive Conservatives campaigned hard against Hydro One salaries in last year's election campaign, dubbing then-CEO Mayo Schmidt the ""six-million-dollar man."" Soon after they were elected, one of the government's first acts was to force Schmidt's resignation.

After Schmidt was forced out, the utility's entire board resigned and downgrades and lower values of Hydro One shares followed.

Last month, Hydro One and American utility Avista Corp. announced they were cancelling a planned merger, after regulators in Washington state said the deal would not sufficiently safeguard customers from the whims of the Ontario government.

Jill Bennett has more... View full cove…","BC Ferries was pulled into the fight over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project on Friday, as the National Energy Board (NEB) issued a decision saying that the project should move ahead.

In its decision, the NEB recommended that the ferry fleet take major steps to slow down and minimize underwater noise in order to protect marine life off the B.C. coast, including the southern resident killer whale population.

The recommendation was one of 16 included in the new decision, which also recommended similar changes for marine shipping vessels and whale watching boats.

READ MORE: National Energy Board rules Trans Mountain expansion project should be approved

BC Ferries said it is already working on reducing underwater noise, but the NEB called for those plans to be accelerated.

“Every vessel we build is quieter than the last, so we want to make sure we’re doing what we can to reduce underwater noise from our ferries,” BC Ferries spokesperson Deborah Marshall said.

Slowing down vessels and making them quieter aren’t necessarily connected, she added.

WATCH: Coverage of BC Ferries vessels on Globalnews.ca

“Some of our vessels like a “Spirit”-class vessel, for example, have what we call controllable pitch propellers, and when you slow down a vessel with [those propellers], they actually create more noise,” Marshall said.

Last summer, the company released a report saying it has reduced underwater noise on its vessels through improvements in hull design and by using different types of propellers.

“This is going to be a long process,” the report said. “We build our ships to operate for decades, more than 50 years in some cases. New, quieter ships will therefore arrive gradually in the Salish Sea.”

Replacements for BC Ferries’ older C-Class vessels will be built between 2022 and 2030, the report said.

WATCH BELOW: NEB reconsideration report says killer whales will likely be impacted

BC Green Party leader Andrew Weaver said the recommendation could lead the province to invest in new technology for the ferry fleet to address noise and speed.

“One of the things I would like to see us exploring is ferries that have different forms of combustion or actually electric ferries as we more forward,” he said.

Marshall said two vessels that are currently being built will be powered by electric-hybrid technology.

She was also noted that only a few ferry routes actually cross through the shipping routes to which the NEB’s recommendations are aimed, but added that BC Ferries is still taking the recommendation seriously and that it will work with the board and the province to find solutions.

READ MORE: B.C. indigenous and environmental groups blast NEB approval of Trans Mountain pipeline

Critics of the decision — and its recommendations — noted that the NEB’s calls to slow down ferries and other vessels is meant to offset the projected seven-fold increase in tanker traffic that the pipeline expansion is expected to generate off the B.C. coast if it’s realized.

The tankers will all carry diluted bitumen from the coast to offshore markets, which environmental lawyers argue would pose more risk to the orca population than underwater noise and vessel speed.

“They know and they’ve already said and everyone has admitted that this project amounts to a death sentence to the southern resident orcas,” Eugene Kung of West Coast Environmental Law said. “But what the board has said is that this is justified under the circumstances because of what they are arguing is the economic benefits.”

Increasing ferry service

The recommendation came as the province also announced Friday it would increase sailings on 10 ferry routes serving coastal communities, including Bowen Island, Texada Island, Gabriola Island, Quadra Island, Haida Gwaii and Prince Rupert.

The routes are the same ones that the previous Liberal government cut in 2014. The NDP said the restored sailings would bring back 2,700 round-trip sailings.

“For years, people living in coastal communities saw ferry fares increase and services cut,” Minister of Transportation Claire Trevena said in a statement.

READ MORE: Washington state is converting its ferries to hybrid-electric. Will BC Ferries follow suit?

“Quality, affordable ferry services are a necessity, not a luxury,” she continued. “That’s why we’ve turned the ship around – first by rolling back ferry fares on small coastal routes and now by reversing cuts to services that were making it difficult for people to get around.”

Those routes are expected to start returning as early as the spring, with more services set to be restored over the next year, the province said.

Premier Rachel Notley announces something. UCP Leader Jason Kenney cancels it.

This is mythical politics, since Notley may not be around to do the things she announces, and Kenney doesn’t have the authority to cancel anything.

That doesn’t stop either of them.

Last week, the NDP unveiled a huge deal to supply solar electricity to government facilities.

Kenney said he may ditch that if there are subsidies involved and it doesn’t look economical.

On Tuesday, Notley announced a $3.7-billion deal over three years to lease railcars for oil transport.

Kenney said Wednesday he’ll definitely cancel that one. He planned to call both Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railways to warn them not to waste any money on preparations.

Shortly after that, Notley announced a $2-billion methanol plant for the Grande Prairie area. Kenney now has that ball in his court.

Notley assumes she’ll still be premier. Kenney assumes he already is.

Another more common feature of Alberta campaigns also began Wednesday — the traditional battle over health care.

Kenney announced, and theatrically signed, a health-care guarantee for Albertans.

Alberta conservatives always make such election pledges to cut costs while improving service.

But it would be unwise to assume this is just political talk. Apart from the policy issues, Kenney has a deeply personal reason for reforming the system.

At an Edmonton news conference, he talked about how his father died in 2010 after a 14-hour wait at Rockyview General Hospital’s emergency room without treatment.

Kenney said his dad sat in a waiting room chair for many hours without being seen, diagnosed or tested.

A relative arrived and managed to get him into a hallway bed. The next day, his father was admitted but suddenly died — “and the tests hadn’t even come back yet.”

Kenney said his family has never understood why the most expensive system in Canada could let that happen to a person. He refuses to be “shouted down by interest groups” that defend the status quo.

He says the system is good but far from perfect, and nobody should suffer in pain without help.

Brian Jean, the former Wildrose leader whom Kenney beat for the leadership, often tells an equally emotional story about how his son died after months in hospital without being properly diagnosed.

Jean won the Wildrose leadership eight days after Michael Jean passed away at 23.

Reforming the health system in his son’s memory, Jean said then, was one major reason he stayed in politics despite the grief.

Jean never got to take action on health care. Kenney may. He’s clearly serious about improving surgery wait times and emergency room logjams.

Kenney said the UCP will not reduce spending but would cut administration. Any savings would go to the front lines.

Health Minister Sarah Hoffman pointed out that Alberta health administration costs are actually low, even though overall spending is the highest per capita in the country.

The main reason is high wages and salaries that were established when Alberta was rich and largely debt free.

Kenney, who says he will not cut public sector pay, seems to suggest that any new money for the front lines would have to come from savings elsewhere. There would presumably be no annual funding increases for inflation.

Hoffman says that alone would spell disaster for the system.

Conservatives have often started this debate, only to stumble in the face of fierce opposition.

Ralph Klein abandoned his Third Way privatization plan. Premier Ed Stelmach’s Tories spent years trying to contain the beast they created with Alberta Health Services.

For reasons both personal and ideological, Kenney would not be likely to stumble. He is determined to achieve much better results without pumping in more money.

So far, the language is deceptively mild. But this could soon become a health holy war unlike anything since the PCs tore down the old health regions.

Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press

Shortly after becoming Premier, Doug Ford demanded changes to his Ontario Provincial Police security detail because he didn’t trust the rotating cast of officers, according to newly disclosed court records.

Internal police e-mails filed in Ontario Divisional Court also show that the Premier’s office was interested in retrofitting a van for his travels, relaying a $50,000 cost estimate to the OPP.

Ontario Provincial Police Deputy Commissioner Brad Blair submitted the internal e-mails to bolster his claim that Mr. Ford and his office have interfered in police operations. The senior officer is asking the courts to order the province’s Ombudsman to review the hiring of Mr. Ford’s friend, Toronto Police Superintendent Ron Taverner, as the next OPP Commissioner.

Story continues below advertisement

Deputy Commissioner Blair, who was also a front-runner for the position, went public with his concerns in December, alleging that “inappropriate political interference or cronyism” could impact OPP operations. In his filings and correspondence, he alleged the Premier’s office directed a sole-sourced “off-the-books” request for the OPP to refit an executive van for the Premier’s use. He further alleged the Premier relayed to police that he wanted a meeting with then-OPP Commissioner Vince Hawkes to ask him to replace a rotating security detail for Mr. Ford with permanent bodyguards, and if not, ""perhaps a new Commissioner would.”

Deputy Commissioner’s Blair’s most recent court filings, made on Feb. 15, include internal e-mails about Mr. Ford’s concerns and an estimate for the van overhaul. The Premier’s office says, however, he should not be accessing those records and making them public.

“It is extremely troubling that Mr. Blair is apparently using his office to obtain confidential information and documentation and then filing such documents in a public court record to further his own personal agenda in the court process he himself initiated,” said Simon Jefferies, a spokesman for the Premier.

In an e-mail to The Globe, the spokesman added that the allegations about off-the-books purchase requests by the Premier’s office “are a complete fabrication by Mr. Blair and are categorically false.”

NDP MPP Taras Natyshak released a statement saying the van proposal is “wildly inappropriate"" when the government is implementing budget cuts elsewhere. ""It’s the gravy train for Ford, and cuts for everyone else.”

The OPP e-mails filed in court show that in mid-July, just a few weeks after the Progressive Conservative government had taken power, Mr. Ford expressed concern about his shifting cast of police-assigned bodyguards. In an e-mail to his supervisor, an officer assigned to Mr. Ford relayed the Premier’s displeasure as he prepared to travel to a first ministers meeting.

“[W]hat ... is going on? I’m going to Moncton with 3 officers I don’t know. This is too much. ... I keep getting new people in the truck. I just want my own protection team,” Sergeant Terrance Murphy wrote what Mr. Ford told him after he picked him up to go to the airport. He reported the Premier saying he had no faith in newly assigned bodyguards.

“I have not formed the trust with them. I have asked for my own detail of officers who I trust already. It feels like I’m not being heard, like I’m getting f***ed around by the OPP, and I’m getting more pissed off,” the e-mail reads.

“I’m going to call the Commissioner and sort this out,” the Premier then said, according to the e-mail.

In the July e-mail exchange, the police officer quotes Mr. Ford as saying he wanted to meet the then-OPP Commissioner “so he can see how serious I am about this. If he can’t sort this out, then maybe a new Commissioner can make it happen.”

The Premier’s office defended Mr. Ford’s request and again took issue with the release of internal e-mails related to security.

“These types of requests are made by politicians of all stripes, at both the federal and provincial levels of government,” said Mr. Jefferies. “Internal police reports are by definition, in our opinion, highly confidential documents.”

The Globe and Mail reported this week a senior government official warned Deputy Commissioner Blair in December about publicly disclosing any more sensitive OPP materials as part of his court bid.

Story continues below advertisement

The OPP e-mail exchanges filed in court further reveal that on Nov. 21, when the hunt for a new commissioner was concluding, the OPP received an e-mailed cost estimate of $50,696 for the interior redesign of an executive van for the Premier’s potential use.

A Mississauga company called A1 Mobility had provided this estimate – which involved installing WiFi, leather seats, a mini-fridge, a couch and a TV – to an executive assistant in the Premier’s office, who in turn relayed it to the police force.

Deputy Commissioner Blair has alleged in court documents that this cost estimate was relayed in a potential contravention of police procurement policies. The Premier’s office says these assertions are “categorically false.”

“As has been repeatedly stated by the Premier, he requested the OPP look into the possibility of obtaining a cost-effective used van for purposes of working and travelling the province,” said Mr. Jefferies. “The e-mails sent to the OPP from a member of the Premier’s Office staff are not an official procurement of a van, instead they are a cost estimate and reveal an effort to minimize expense.”

Mr. Jefferies said the retrofit has not happened. OPP Staff Sergeant Carolle Dionne said the police force would not comment about matters that are being litigated, including what happened to van-retrofit request that was received by the OPP.","Doug Ford demanded changes to his OPP security detail, according to court filings - The Globe and Mail",The Globe And Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-doug-ford-demanded-changes-to-his-opp-security-detail-according-to/

“Us parents are going into crisis,” said Stephanie Ridley of Burlington, the mother of a 7-year-old boy who will lose his weekly three days of therapy. “The PCs have abandoned these kids … When is this government going to step up and help 7-year-olds, 5-year-old kids that are trying to learn how to speak, to brush their hair, to put on their own pants?” said Ridley, visibly upset.

Then, amid some banter, PC MPP Randy Hillier yelled out “yada, yada, yada” — loud enough so that parents heard. Soon after, Ford issued a statement saying Hillier was suspended and his future “participation in caucus” is up for discussion given his “disrespectful comments to parents of children with autism.”

“I want to listen to every parent, and every family member who wants to share their stories and their asks,” said Ford, who earlier said he’d personally taken a number of phone calls. “But Mr. Hillier’s comments crossed the line and that is unacceptable.” Hillier later apologized “to the parents present who may have felt that my comments were directed at them; they were not, and never would be. At the end of question period as members were leaving their seats, Monique Taylor continued to politicize these hardships so I caught the eye of Ms. Taylor and simply said to her ‘yada yada yada.’ ”

Premier Doug Ford suspended Randy Hillier, seen in this 2018 file photo, over remarks he made to parents of children with autism at the end of question period Wednesday. The Progressive Conservative MPP for Lanark-Frontenac-Kingston apologized, but said his comments were directed at NDP MPPs and not parents. ( The Canadian Press file photo )

Both Ford and Community and Social Services Minister Lisa MacLeod say that while the autism file is a difficult one, the PC plan will clear a 23,000-child wait list and ensure more children receive services. “This is the best option to get every, single child some level of support from the Ontario government,” MacLeod told the Star in a telephone interview, acknowledging some families will receive less support for services than they do now, but that overall the system will be “fair, equitable and sustainable.” Starting April 1, families will be eligible for up to $20,000 a year for each child under 6 — up to a lifetime maximum of $140,000 — to be used for the services of their choice. Children older than that can access up to $5,000 a year up to age 18, to a lifetime maximum of $55,000. However, amounts are based on a sliding scale depending on family income, and only those earning less than $55,000 in net income will qualify for the entire amount. Families have argued the money falls far short, given intensive therapy for children with severe needs can cost up to $80,000 a year. MacLeod, however, said the system under the previous Liberal government excluded “three out of four children in this province. That means some children were getting some service, but most of the children were getting no service.” She also said the government is unwavering in its support for the autism overhaul, calling it “false hope for anyone to suggest we are going to change it.” Autism, she noted, is one area where the Ford government has increased spending, from the Liberals’ $256 million to $321 million. But a number of New Democrat MPPs — citing examples of families in their ridings — hammered the government about how children will lose services. Among the more than 200 parents in the public gallery, one mother stood up, shouting “you are failing all of us ... we deserve better,” and “shame,” before being escorted out.

Taylor said “families were hurt by the dismissive and cruel nature” of Hillier’s heckle, adding “we can’t allow the Conservatives to distract from the fact that these families need and deserve autism services for their children.” MacLeod “thinks that we are just going to give up,” said Taylor, her party’s children and youth services critic, adding parents have no plans to do so. Ford, Taylor added, might as well “burn $321 million on the front lawn of Queen’s Park” because the changes will only make the system worse. MacLeod — who herself has apologized for her tone during a January meeting with behavioural therapists who allege she warned them of “four long years” if they didn’t publicly support the autism changes — said she has a “great deal of compassion for families” but her job is “to make sure I’m supporting all the children in Ontario with autism.” MacLeod said parents who have current contracts with service providers will retain those until they expire — “there won’t be an immediate drop-off April 1.” This is not Ford’s first autism-related controversy. Back in 2014, when he was a Toronto councillor, he said an Etobicoke home for teens with autism had “ruined the community,” later telling a father who launched a complaint about that comment to “go to hell.” With files from Rob Ferguson Kristin Rushowy is a Toronto-based reporter covering Ontario politics.

Dewar, who represented the riding of Ottawa-Centre for almost a decade, died earlier this month from brain cancer. He was 56.

The gathering at Dominion-Chalmers United Church featured music Dewar loved — like Bob Marley — as well as prayers and tributes from friends and family.

Among those in attendance were his former federal NDP colleagues Murray Rankin, Hélène Laverdière and former party leader Tom Mulcair, as well as his successor as Ottawa-Centre MP, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna, Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson, and several city councillors. Ontario provincial opposition leader Andrea Horwath also attended.

The ceremony opened with a piano medley of Dewar's favourite songs, and a special blessing from Claudette Commanda, an Indigenous elder and good friend of the family.

""To you, Paul, may your beauty guide us, in healing, in reconciliation and in community,"" she said, acknowledging the gathering was on the unceded territory of the Algonquin people. Commanda said she was honoured Dewar lived on the lands of her people, because he understood and respected their traditions.

A memorial service was held Saturday for former Ottawa Centre member of parliament Paul Dewar, who died on Feb. 6. (Radio-Canada)

His wife's 'bubble of joy'

Dewar's wife and two sons spoke of the effect he'd had in their lives.

""I feel your spirit around me even though you are gone,"" Julia Sneyd said as she read aloud her letter to Dewar, adding her husband lived 80 years, but just compressed it into 56.

""As we shed tears of sadness for a life too short, tears of joy for a life fully lived and tears of hope for a better world ... You will always be my bubble of joy.""

Sons Jordan and Nathaniel recounted road trips, dance parties and musical evenings they'd shared with their father — saying it was his everyday actions that taught them the most meaningful lessons.

The family ended their tribute by telling the crowd ""Smile and play, laugh and dance, give and share.""

Dewar's siblings remembered a young boy in love with the world around him. He was a high energy and active child, his brother and sisters said.

""[He was] always alive and in touch with every person, problem or policy he came in contact with,"" his older sister Cathy Dewar said.

""To the end, Paul loved life.""

Politics in his DNA

Reverend Brian Cornelius, who led the service, recalled Dewar crying the last time they spoke, not tears for himself, but for youth in need in the community because of his deep concern for disadvantaged teens.

""Politics were part of his DNA,"" Cornelius said, recounting a time he saw Dewar approach a young man and ask ""so what should we do about the Senate?""

When his diagnosis was given, Dewar's outlook didn't change, Cornelius said.

""He faced the reality of death, and chose to walk back into life.""

Gavin Charles, part of the team Dewar worked with on Parliament Hill during his time as an MP, spoke of a team builder who wanted the best for his nation.

Watch: Paul Dewar explains his interest in youth

Former Ottawa Centre MP Paul Dewar, who has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, has started a new project to support young leaders called Youth Action Now. Its first major event is Thursday night at the Adult High School. 0:45

""He was honest and frank and loving and kind,"" Charles said. Dewar's encouragement to his team was always ""To do good work, but mostly to do good.""

Dewar was a champion for human rights during his time on the Hill, pushing for more humanitarian aid and help for refugees.

Dewar's farewell message

Before his death on Feb. 6, Dewar wrote a letter that his family posted on Facebook. He said his illness made him truly appreciate the beauty in the world.

""I told you that I thought my illness was a gift and I genuinely meant that. In this time in between, I got to see the wonder of the world around us.""

Politics was a family affair for the former teacher. His mother was former MP and Ottawa mayor Marion Dewar. Paul Dewar won the Ottawa Centre riding for the NDP in the January 2006 federal election, taking over from former NDP leader Ed Broadbent. He was defeated in 2015 by McKenna.

After going public with his diagnosis about a year ago, Dewar created Youth Action Now, an initiative to raise money to help engage young people to get involved in their communities. That movement will be among his lasting legacies.

454,Empty,2019-02-22T01:04:02Z,"VICTORIA – MLAs from all parties overseeing the legislature agreed to release a new report into spending by Speaker Darryl Plecas on Thursday and hire a retired judge to probe more allegations of wrongdoing at the capital. NDP, Liberal and Green party house l…","VICTORIA — MLAs from all parties overseeing the legislature agreed to hire a retired judge to probe more allegations of wrongdoing at the capital, on the same day that a new report claiming misuse of taxpayers’ money was released by Speaker Darryl Plecas.

The review by the retired judge is in addition to a workplace review and a forensic audit by the B.C. auditor general, and in addition to a separate police investigation. NDP House Leader Mike Farnworth said the co-operation between his party, the Liberals and the Greens was necessary for the good of the legislature.

“I think all three parties around that table take this issue very seriously,” he said. “I know everyone likes to think we’re always at each other’s throats, but the reality is we have to come together on this issue … The public demands that.”

The legislature spending scandal began in November when clerk Craig James and sergeant-at-arms Gary Lenz were suspended and escorted out of the building by police. After investigating both men for almost a year, Plecas released a bombshell report in January into alleged misspending by both men.

James and Lenz responded Feb. 8 denying they had done anything wrong, arguing Plecas himself approved many of the expenses and that they followed proper policies.

Plecas rebuts James and Lenz

On Thursday, a new report by Plecas chips away at the explanations provided by James and Lenz.

For example, Plecas highlighted an August 2017 Legislative Assemblies Business Continuity Network “conference” in Washington state, which James and Lenz attended with 10 other people, including their wives, and dignitaries from Scotland. James, in his earlier response to the Speaker, maintained this trip was legitimate and useful.

But Plecas alleges Washington state isn’t a member of their network, and there was no conference to attend there. Plecas alleges an “earthquake preparedness” event on James’s itinerary was actually a whale-watching expedition. The itinerary also notes the group was learning about large-scale evacuations at Safeco Field in Seattle, but Plecas claims the reality is they attended a baseball game there — expensing $1,073.32 for 13 tickets.

Plecas wrote that he thinks James and Lenz didn’t properly watch taxpayer funds.

“The most charitable interpretation of all of this is that Mr. James and Mr. Lenz really did, and do, consider that all these activities — the innumerable ‘business-continuity’ meetings and trips; the myriad of purchases; the electronics; the benefits and bonuses, and so on — were all proper and necessary business expenses,” he wrote.

“I disagree, and I expect the vast majority of ordinary British Columbians do too. If Mr. James and Mr. Lenz do think that, I believe it shows a lack of judgment, and a repeated pattern of decision-making that is utterly unacceptable in senior executives of a public institution.”

LISTEN: This week on the In The House podcast, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the 2019 provincial budget. Did the B.C. NDP present a prudent plan or did government miss a key opportunity to fulfill its agenda?

Plecas said Thursday he will recuse himself from future investigations, and was happy a retired judge will be hired to take over.

“I’m extremely happy of the decision to have a jurist do an independent review,” he said. “This was incredibly complex.”

Eye-raising expense allegations

Plecas’s original report included many eye-raising allegations, including a $13,000 wood-splitter and trailer that James had stored at his home, lavish overseas trips, a $1,000 piece of luggage, $5,000 in magazine subscriptions, questionable retirement benefits and large-scale payouts of cash in lieu of vacation time.

As a result, MLAs voted to authorize a forensic audit into legislature spending, as well as an independent workplace review.

Two special prosecutors are overseeing an RCMP probe into James and Lenz. Neither man has been charged with any crime. Plecas has said additional allegations were given to police outside of his report, but has refused to make them public.

Thursday’s meeting in Victoria, where MLAs voted to release Plecas’s new report, was crashed by Mark Andrews, the lawyer for suspended clerk James, who said he was also speaking for suspended sergeant-at-arms Lenz. He urged MLAs not to release the new report until it’s provided to the two suspended officials for comment.

“They should be given the opportunity to respond to any further allegations or comments by the Speaker or (his chief of staff Alan) Mullen before those reports are published,” Andrews said.

However, the report was released, and in it he alleged that James and Lenz took multiple trips to visit the same people, all the while claiming they were comparing best practices with new officials. It says taxpayers paid $4,059 to put up two Scottish officials in an expensive Victoria hotel, and they were each given a $232 jade bear for coming here to provide their expertise, even though James and Lenz had spoken to these men on earlier trips.

“What this behaviour invites is a conclusion that many of these trips are no more than useful justifications for reciprocal international visits, substantially underwritten by the public,” Plecas claims in his report.

‘No reasonable explanation’

Plecas has also alleged that James filled his truck — twice — with wine, beer and spirits, and delivered them to former speaker Bill Barisoff in Penticton. In his response, James said that Barisoff paid for the liquor.

Plecas said he found a copy of a June 2013 cheque for $370 from Barisoff, but questioned whether that would pay for the large shipments of alcohol.

“Moreover, Mr. James has provided no reasonable explanation as to why it would have been appropriate for the most senior officer of the legislature to drive up to Penticton to sell wine and deliver a desk and chair to the former speaker, stay overnight at the Penticton Lakeside Inn and drive back the next day, billing all of the expenses to the taxpayers along with his very high salary for two days of work,” Plecas writes.

Plecas also took particular aim at James for having a $10,000 trailer and $3,000 wood-splitter delivered to his property but paid for by the legislature as emergency equipment. James said in his response it was properly approved and he was asked to store it at his home due to a lack of space at the legislature.

But in his second report, Plecas included photos of a concrete pad constructed at James’s home, which he said has many large trees in the 10,500-square-foot backyard. He said the wood-splitter showed signs of being used at James’s home.

“That a committee on which Mr. Lenz and Mr. James sat approved the recommended expenditure as part of purported disaster planning is not, in my view, an answer,” wrote Plecas. “Committees generally place their trust in senior management that expenditures are appropriate and necessary, until that trust is brought into question or broken.”

The second Plecas report also took shots at James and Lenz for other expenses, such as $500 Bose headphones that James said were for an ear condition on flights but Plecas said are still not a business expense.

Cash for vacations unnecessary

Plecas also said he felt neither Lenz nor James worked very hard and could have taken their holidays rather than cashed out payments.

“There was no legitimate reason they couldn’t take their holidays in accordance with the applicable policies rather than bank them and cause the legislature to pay them out,” wrote Plecas.

The new report also includes several pages in which Plecas highlights statements attributed to him in the Lenz and James reports, flatly denies the comments and subsequently in numerous occasions accuses both men of lying.

“My motivation here is, and always has been, rooting out what I see as endemic misconduct by these two officers, and in doing so, shedding light on and hopefully improving systemic practices and protections in this important public institution,” Plecas says in the report.

MLAs on the legislature committee didn’t vote Thursday to change the status of James or Lenz, both of whom remain on paid suspension.

However, Plecas told reporters he thinks both men shouldn’t be allowed back to their jobs.

“These are very highly paid senior officers and the legislature and the public are entitled to absolutely scrupulous conduct from them that does not undermine the trust placed in them, and the dignity and reputation of the legislative assembly,” he wrote in his report.

Farnworth said MLAs want the process with the judge completed quickly. “We are certainly not looking at a year or two years, we want this to be done as expeditiously and as quickly as possible,” said Farnworth.

MLAs voted in February to increase protections for whistleblowers in the legislature, allow the merit commission to audit hiring and place the administrative functions of the legislative assembly under the province’s Freedom of Information law.

455,Empty,2019-02-21T01:04:46Z,"The provincial government's budget included new funding, but B.C. Teachers' Federation president Glen Hansman says more is needed.","One day after the B.C. government unveiled its budget, the head of the union responsible for public school teachers called for “an honest conversation” about the resources needed to fill education service gaps around the province.

Glen Hansman, the president of the B.C. Teachers’ Federation, said the budget’s new money for K-12 public schools was not enough, and stemmed from student enrolment growth and a Supreme Court ruling that went against the government. He likened it to a freeze on operational funding.

“There’s lots of good stuff in that budget, don’t get me wrong. But K-12 operational, we’re concerned that we’re not seeing the change that teachers and parents and others have been waiting for for a long time,” Hansman said in an interview.

Included in the budget was an additional $182 million for schools in 2019-20, as part of a three-year, $550-million boost for the education ministry. That includes $58 million over three years to reflect the 2016 Supreme Court of Canada ruling on class size and composition, which effectively reversed the then-provincial Liberal government’s 2002 setting of working conditions and staffing levels in B.C. schools.

Rob Fleming, the minister of education, said the latest budget puts B.C.’s education system in better shape than ever before with record levels of funding.

“I am proud that Budget 2019 ensures our education system will have the highest school operating and capital funding ever,” Fleming said in a written statement.

“This budget provides nearly $6 billion to public schools, so school districts can support increased student enrolment, provide more supports and services, and continue to hire teachers and other educators.”

But Hansman said more is needed. Yet to be developed is “any sort of provincial game plan” to ensure educators have up-to-date and accurate teaching materials to support B.C.’s brand new curriculum, including its Indigenous components, he said.

Meanwhile, there are waitlists in many schools for special needs designation assessments, and the ability to accommodate kids who are designated depends on the district, he said. Also, schools are still waiting for the supplies, lab equipment and new technology the premier called for in his mandate letter to Fleming, Hansman said.

“All that stuff seems to be on hold” as the province continues an ongoing review of the school funding formula, Hansman said. While the BCTF was among those calling for that review, “certainly nobody has been calling for operational funding to be, in effect, frozen pending (its) outcome,” he said.

Fleming said last year that his government’s efforts to hire several thousand teachers was likely the biggest hiring spree of educators in the province’s history. But Hansman said that hiring was linked to the Supreme Court ruling.

“That didn’t come about because of government benevolence or any action that the current NDP government took,” he said.

Hansman did offer the government an A+ letter grade for $2.7 billion it devoted over three years to seismic upgrades, repairs and expansions for schools, and he applauded several other items.

“There’s a lot of stuff external to the K-12 budget that we’re excited about. All the investments in child care and the elimination of interest on student loans and the affordability measures are all things that are going to be good for our recruitment and retention efforts here in B.C.”

Hansman’s comments on the budget come amid negotiations over the teachers’ contact, set to expire in June. On that topic he sounded positive.

“Bargaining will play itself out and at the end of the day, the province is in a very good financial situation. We’ve got the strongest economy in Canada and there’s a balanced budget here and there’s a surplus and so there are dollars,” he said.

Fleming said that in total, about $3.7 billion had been provided to support the renewal of collective agreements that will be negotiated under the province’s Sustainable Services Negotiating Mandate.

That mandate applies to public sector employers and it seeks to balance wage increases with the province’s bottom line.

Some First Nations groups say the announcement is welcome but overdue.

""The B.C. government is finally implementing a long-awaited agreement to share gaming revenue that will enable First Nations the opportunity to prioritize critically important community issues that have long hindered their beneficial development,"" said Grand Chief Joe Hall, a former chair of the B.C. First Nations Gaming Commission, in a statement.

The provincial government has pledged $3-billion over 25 years will be shared with First Nations from a dedicated gaming revenue fund.

Finance Minister Carole James said the deal was reached after decades of talks.

""It's the right thing to do on the path to reconciliation,"" James said.

Every First Nation community in B.C. will be eligible for between $250,000 and $2-million annually under the agreement.

'Hands up to them'

Hall said he and his colleagues at the B.C. First Nations Gaming Commission have been lobbying for years to secure revenue-sharing from gaming in B.C., but said former LIberal government wouldn't commit.

""I say hands up to [the NDP government] because they are the ones who said we need to address this, and they came back to us after years and years of difficulties with the previous government,"" Hall told CBCs Robyn Burns.

How it works

Fifty per cent of the fund will be divided equally among B.C.'s First Nations. The rest will be distributed based on a formula which takes population, size and geographic remoteness into account.

The First Nations Gaming Commission plans to establish a new B.C. First Nations limited partnership to manage the funding, overseen by a First Nations-appointed board of directors.

Jay Johnston, a negotiator for the BC First Nations Gaming Commission, said the funding plan will allow Nations to create spending priorities based on their own needs and develop economic independence.

""They'll be able to meet needs in their communities in ways they have not been able to do before,"" Johnston said.

She was referring to the logistics of the day, but it could have easily applied to the mood itself: celebrating what had already been announced, while offering warm generalities about the future with few major details.

To be sure, B.C.'s 2019 budget — another year with projected surpluses, another year of the province leading Canada in economic growth — was hard for any non-partisan to completely hate. There were even some new policies that will excite a few groups.

But after the breakneck speed of announcements in its first 18 months in power, the NDP presented a budget that shows the government settling into its role — content with the path it has charted out for the foreseeable future.

""We have a balanced budget across the fiscal track,"" James said. ""We're the only province with a AAA credit rating. But we will never have a truly prosperous province unless everybody can share in that prosperity.""

Tuesday's budget continues that philosophy of sharing.

Still, there was a reason the first eight minutes of her speech to the legislature had four references to the 2018 budget, and just one for the 2019 budget: this was a budget that built on its foundation instead of promising dramatic changes for the future.

B.C.'s 2019 budget stayed the course established in previous years but still had a few surprises. (Liam Britten/CBC)

Targeted programs this time around

In 2018, the big budget announcements — the elimination of Medical Services Plan (MSP) premiums in favour of a payroll tax, and the 30-point housing plan — affected virtually everyone in the province. Tuesday's big announcements were more targeted towards specific segments of the population.

Take the B.C. Child Opportunity Benefit: James trumpeted the fact a family earning up to $25,000 annually with one child will receive $1,600 a year under the new program.

But the province couldn't say how many families were under that $25,000 threshold; and since the amount families receive goes down as their income rises — and 40 per cent of families aren't eligible because they're over the maximum threshold — the average amount each family will receive from the program will be considerably less.

What about how this budget eliminates the interest on the provincial portion student loans?

A big help, but on average, around 60 per cent of money in student loans comes from the federal government, and interest on that portion of the loan will continue to grow for graduates. To say nothing of overall tuition and student housing costs that helped cause them to apply for student loans in the first place.

The $100 million a year from gaming revenue that will go directly to First Nations communities? It means there's a stable long-term funding source, but it doesn't necessarily mean $100 million more will flow to these communities annually. Traditionally, government provided money to First Nations through a hodgepodge of other programs; now there's a clear mechanism in place.

And so it goes.

Most people won't see big changes. But the announcements in this budget further the government's pledge to ensure British Columbia's strong economic performance benefits everyone — albeit in very targeted ways.

""It's not historic, it's not a fundamentally dramatic change, but there are systemic changes as part of a slow overhauling of our tax system,"" said Paul Kershaw, a public policy professor at the University of British Columbia.

B.C.'s budget for next year projects a surplus, but it's also predicated on money gained through the property transfer tax staying steady, instead of decreasing as it did over the previous 12 months. (Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press)

Few strong feelings

Even for business groups less predisposed to support this government, the general reaction was fairly measured.

""Steady as she goes,"" said Iain Black, CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade. While he was concerned about long-term economic competitiveness because of last year's tax changes, Black said he would give the budget a grade of B minus overall.

Which for most students, is the academic equivalent of a shrug.

But partisans and progressives who might have given this government an A if there were more big funding announcements might have been disappointed on certain things: the lack of details on the poverty plan, no long-promised $400 renters' rebate, or little new money for money laundering enforcement, for example.

And possible storm clouds are looming on the horizon, in the form of a housing market slowing down, and a forecasted deficit of $50 million for ICBC, which officials admit is purely based on behavioural modelling once new reforms come in.

Problems many governments would be thankful to have — but one the government would do well to watch, after it finishes congratulating itself on the promises it has implemented in the last 18 months.

""I think the best way to characterize this budget is it rests on the laurels of 2018's budget,"" said Kershaw.

459,Empty,2019-02-22T02:00:45Z,"2019 budget demonstrated no long-term vision or economic plan for our province, says Liberal leader","Premier John Horgan wants you to think that everything is OK but it’s not. The 2019 NDP budget is built on a foundation of wishful thinking that ignores the realities of B.C.’s economy and the world around us.

Horgan came to power two years ago on promises of $10-a-day daycare, a $400 renters’ subsidy and a general pledge to make life more affordable. Since then, he has introduced 19 new or increased taxes, gone back on his daycare and rental subsidy promises and done nothing to effectively respond to growing housing unaffordability. British Columbians had high hopes for real solutions and concrete action in 2019.

Unfortunately, these hopes were dashed on Tuesday as Horgan revealed a do-nothing provincial budget featuring a significant increase in government expenditures, still no renters’ rebate, a watered down child care benefit that won’t kick in until the end of 2020 and a speculation tax that treats 1.6 million B.C. homeowners as speculators until proven innocent. In the next year, taxes are going up nearly $1,100 per person. This will also be the year of the now-infamous “double dip” as the NDP continues to charge MSP while simultaneously charging its higher replacement, the Employer Health Tax.

It’s not all bad news though. The proposed rate increase for foster parents and home-share providers is long overdue. We also welcome eliminating student loan interest and providing new funding for youth mental-health supports to expand B.C. Liberal initiatives like the Foundry. Unfortunately, those small measures will do little to solve the systemic affordability problems left unaddressed in this budget.

The people of British Columbia are starting to feel duped. This government’s actions have raised the cost of living and jeopardized the economic growth on which the NDP has pinned all hopes of paying for their spending spree going forward. You’ll have less money to spend and it will be harder than ever for those struggling with the affordability crisis to secure their futures.

Finance Minister Carole James is barely balancing her budget despite the fact that, since taking power, she has increased taxes by billions on individuals, homeowners and businesses. She and Horgan blindly spent the healthy surplus left behind by the former B.C. Liberal government and got lucky with a lucrative transfer payment from the federal government. If not for that federal transfer, B.C. would be facing an $800-million deficit today.

Perhaps worst of all, this budget demonstrated no long-term vision or economic plan for our province. The B.C. Chamber of Commerce stated that business confidence has plummeted, with the number of businesses that believe this government supports them dropping by half over the past two years.

With no actions laid out in this budget to stimulate investment or private-sector growth, that measure of confidence along with economic growth may fall even further. The NDP admits B.C.’s economy will be slowing down, with housing starts and other measures decreasing but takes no responsibility for causing the downturn.

With 2019 as the year of the double dip, along with a slew of other new and increased taxes hitting our wallets, people across this province are going to start to feel the impact of this government placing the financial burden for their fiscal irresponsibility on the backs of hard-working British Columbians, businesses and municipalities. Over the next three years, the NDP will have increased taxes by $1,568 per person since coming to power. There are storm clouds on the horizon, but the NDP blindly insists everything is OK. It’s not.

We deserve a government that grows the economy and focuses on real opportunity for all of us. We deserve better.

Montgomery’s appointment as chair of the board of directors at the Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO) marks the first time the position is a full-time job — a move that has drawn criticism.

“It’s not a full-time job, and I don’t know how you make it into a full-time job,” said former NDP education minister Dave Cooke, who was a board member for 10 years, the last three as chair, before retiring in October. “If he’s there every day I don’t know what (Montgomery) is going to do.” Montgomery’s appointment by the Doug Ford government follows lengthy public consultations on how to improve education and comes at a time when the independent provincial agency says it’s in the process of modernizing to better meet the needs of students, parents and educators. As chair, Cooke earned a per diem of $225, which in 2018 amounted to $3,600. During one unusually busy year, with lots of meetings, he recalls earning more, but still less than $20,000. Cooke, who was one of the architects of the EQAO, established in 1996, wonders what Montgomery will do to warrant an annual salary of $140,000.

The agency administers tests in Grades 3, 6, 9 and 10 to assess reading, writing and math skills to help identify curriculum areas that need attention. Its responsibilities include coming up with strategies to improve accountability and making recommendations to bolster the quality of public education. The agency’s daily operations are led by professional staff headed by a CEO, who reports to the board, which meets at least four times a year. The board is accountable, through its chair, to the minister of education and must maintain an arm’s-length relationship with the province.

“EQAO is on a path to modernization that will touch every aspect of the agency — from assessments and reporting to research, engagement activities and business operations,” said Montgomery, a former assistant professor of education at University of Ottawa. “In the months ahead, I’ll be working with the government and EQAO’s board of directors to ensure the agency can better meet the needs of the province,” he said in a statement. The agency said Montgomery was unavailable for an interview Tuesday. Ministry of Education spokesperson Sandra Zeni described Montgomery as an “experienced educator” with “first-hand experience of best practices and challenges in Ontario’s English and French-language school systems.”

“EQAO requires strategic leadership and significant governance expertise as it works to modernize its processes throughout a multi-year transformation period,” said Zeni, noting a full-time chair will “better protect the public interest and parent needs” and “bring higher levels of accountability and transparency” for taxpayers. “The full-time chair will act as a chief spokesperson for EQAO,” wrote Zeni in an email. “The ministry will work with the chair with a view to promoting high levels of student achievement, particularly in foundational math skills.” EQAO communications officer Sarah Beech said in an email that modernizing the agency will be complex. Beech said Montgomery “will work with the board of directors to create an ambitious strategic plan and he will work with the CEO to ensure its successful implementation.” In a news release about the announcement, the agency said it “welcomes feedback on its modernization and listened closely as perspectives were shared through the government’s consultation on education reform in the fall.” That’s when the province received 72,000 submissions from the public on various education issues. Cooke, a veteran politician who was an MPP from 1977 to 1997 and served as education minister in the Bob Rae government, said he’s “very concerned” the appointment of a full-time chair could lead to the perception of “political interference.” Being a full-time position “puts a whole different spin on it,” he said, adding “I haven’t been able to get my head around it because I don’t know what (Montgomery) is going to do.” “We’ve got a defeated Conservative candidate who is now going to chair EQAO and that, to me, is a concern (because) of what the perception of that might be,” said Cooke. “The only way the agency maintains its credibility is if it maintains the reality of being arm’s length from government and completely non-partisan.” In the last provincial election, Montgomery ran in the battleground riding of Ottawa-Orléans, which was the first stop Ford made during a pre-campaign trip to Ottawa. Liberal incumbent Marie-France Lalonde won the race by a slim margin. Montgomery had previously intended to run in a 2016 byelection in Ottawa-Vanier, but stepped aside to allow former Ontario ombudsman André Marin to run. On Jan. 31, the province appointed Montgomery as EQAO chair for three years, but it was only publicized last week. Charles Pascal, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, said “creating a totally unnecessary high-salaried job to reward a failed PC crony is the worst kind of patronage.” “In the context of a government that has shown active disregard for public education, I worry that the appointee will earn his gravy by turning a non-partisan agency into a vehicle to further denigrate Ontario education,” said Pascal, a former deputy education minister and former chair of the EQAO board. In a media statement, NDP education critic Marit Stiles criticized the creation of the full-time $140,000 job. “Parents want to see every education dollar spent right in the classroom,” said Stiles. “Instead, Doug Ford is siphoning off cash to give to someone he trades favours with. That money is for children — not Ford’s insiders.” On Twitter, Chris Cowley, an executive member of the Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association, described Montgomery’s salary as “enough to buy 2,500 text books for Ontario students.” Isabel Teotonio is a Toronto-based reporter covering education.

Education Minister Lisa Thompson is defending the $140,000-a-year patronage appointment of a defeated former Progressive Conservative candidate to chair the agency administering Ontario’s standardized testing.

“Dr. Cameron Montgomery is an absolute perfect fit to be a permanent chair and help us get standardization right in Ontario.”

“So we need to address this. We’re taking a very serious approach and we are fixing it by way of working with EQAO and having them find within an opportunity to hire an expert,” she said.

“After 15 years of mismanagement and plummeting math scores under (former Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne’s) watch — and, quite frankly, her ideology — we have seen students failing,” Thompson said Wednesday.

Thompson said Montgomery, a former assistant professor of education at the University of Ottawa, “has an amazing pedigree.”

“He’s just been given a ticket to the Ford gravy train. Let’s face it, Mr. Ford keeps giving these tickets,” said Horwath.

“If the government had its priorities right, any extra dollars wouldn’t be going to Ford’s friends and insiders, so that he can manipulate the decisions that they make in the future, but rather should be going to children who have autism, whose parents need the support,” she said.

Indeed, the $140,000 to be paid annually to Montgomery, for example, is enough to cover treatment for “a couple of years” for a child with severe autism, Horwath added.

“The point is the government’s got its priorities wrong. If it’s somebody that Mr. Ford wants to do a favour for, somebody he wants to call on for favours in the future? Well, the bank is wide open,” the New Democrat said.

“If it’s parents struggling to find the supports they need for their children with autism, to try to help those kids to be able to connect with their parents and the rest of the world, well, those people are just not a priority for the premier.”

Interim Liberal leader John Fraser said “the optics are bad.”

“Doug Ford is bringing an old word back into the lexicon: patronage,” said Fraser.

“I don’t think the qualification should be: ‘I was a Conservative candidate in the last election so someone needs to take care of me.’”

In a release, Montgomery said he “will be working with the government and EQAO’s board of directors to ensure the agency can better meet the needs of the province.”

Former NDP education minister Dave Cooke, an EQAO board member for a decade and chair for the past three years before retiring in October, earned a per diem of $225. Last year he made $3,600 performing the duties.

“It’s not a full-time job, and I don’t know how you make it into a full-time job,” said Cooke. “If he’s there every day I don’t know what (Montgomery) is going to do.”

The EQAO administers tests in Grades 3, 6, 9 and 10 to assess reading, writing, and math skills to help identify curriculum areas that need improvement.

Its daily operations are led by professional staff headed by a CEO, who reports to the board, which meets at least four times a year.

Search and Rescue.","The future of B.C.'s volunteer search and rescue programs has SAR groups worried after no new funding was included in Tuesday's provincial budget.

Current provincial funding runs out on March 31 which means they will need to consider cutting programs, director Jim McAllister told Robyn Burns host of CBC's Daybreak North

""We're still hopeful there will be a separate announcement before the end of the fiscal year, but we're trying hard to crunch numbers now and see what we can carry forward past March.""

B.C. has 80 recognized search and rescue groups with 2,500 volunteers who respond to over 1,800 incidents annually across the province.

Funding for incident response is guaranteed by the province but funding for volunteer training, public education programs is unpredictable.

'On the radar' says NDP

When asked about the absence of SAR funding in the budget, Finance Minister Carole James said the NDP's plan for SAR is still under discussion.

""[It's] certainly on the radar of the minister and those discussions, I know, will continue, to make sure we can provide support for the incredible volunteers and the incredible organizations.

""We're getting into avalanche season and we've seen the incredible work that they provide in communities,"" she said.

Current funding model

In 2016, the Liberal government announced a one-time grant of $10 million for B.C. SAR, and the association received another $5 million from the NDP last year.

This money has gone towards avalanche safety education, peer support and training for SAR volunteers, as well as replacement safety equipment like rope. Volunteers pay out of pocket for their personal attire.

The association has been in discussion with the province since 2013 about the need for guaranteed funding to continue operations. B.C. SAR was hoping for a yearly commitment from the NDP in Budget 2019.

""What we're saying to the province is fund it, and you figure out where the money comes from,"" said McAllister.

463,Empty,2019-02-19T23:36:42Z,An early look at what the B.C. NDP's 2019 budget provides for affordable housing.,"Finance Minister Carole James says she is “cautiously optimistic” about the direction of B.C.’s housing market, attributing recent moderation of prices, in part, to measures by her NDP government during its first two years in power.

The 2019 B.C. budget includes more money to house the homeless and help low-income renters avoid homelessness. But it did not include the renter’s rebate that the NDP campaigned on nor any details about speeding up the construction of housing.

The budget touted the B.C. NDP’s earlier actions intended to cool the housing market, such as increasing the tax rate for foreign buyers and expanding the tax’s scope, and taxing empty or under-utilized homes in the province’s most expensive regions.

“In less than a year, we’re seeing results,” the budget overview says, citing decreases in benchmark prices over the last six months for houses and condos in Greater Vancouver.

James believes the housing market is heading in the right direction, she said, but added “there’s more work to be done,” as most residents in the province’s biggest cities still “would not classify housing as affordable at this stage.”

“I’m feeling cautiously optimistic about the direction we’re taking so far … And I want us to see that continue,” James said. She also added later: “I don’t believe we’re going to see a crash in the housing market.”

But Cameron Muir, chief economist for the B.C. Real Estate Association, said any recent cooling in the housing market is more likely due to federal changes to mortgage rates and rules, and not action by the provincial government.

The federal changes to mortgage rules represent, Muir said, “a giant sledgehammer to the housing market, compared to the B.C. government, which is just working around the edges of the market.”

MODULAR HOUSING

The 2019 budget promises another $76 million for more modular housing for homeless people. The B.C. government created the modular housing program in 2017, announcing $291 million to build 2,000 units and saying the first 1,000 units around were expected to be in operation by “early 2018.” But last week, the Ministry of Housing and Municipal Affairs said there are 800 units in use so far, with another 700 expected to open by the end of March.

Most of the 800 modular homes built so far — 554 units — are in the City of Vancouver, which, in many cases, provided city-owned land for their construction.

The 2019 budget includes $76 million to buy land and build and serve more modular homes, bringing the total to 2,200.

Funding only 200 added units is likely to disappoint many in B.C., including Vancouver’s council, which recently called for another 600 more units for Vancouver alone.

These modular homes have been hailed by housing advocates as a cost-effective way to get people out of parks and shelter beds and into real homes. But by many estimates, the demand far exceeds the 2,200 in the province’s current plan. Vancouver Coun. Jean Swanson, who introduced the city’s motion calling for 600 more modular homes, recently estimated there’s a need for 2,500 units in the Vancouver alone.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING

Tuesday’s budget says the Homes for B.C. program, announced a year ago, “laid out an ambitious plan to build 114,000 affordable homes for purchase or rent over 10 years. In just the first year, 17,000 homes are already built or underway.”

However, of those 17,000 homes “already built or underway,” the only ones currently completed with tenants living in them are the 800 modular housing units.

RENT BANK

Rent banks, which provide low-interest loans to renters who need immediate, short-term relief to prevent unnecessary evictions, already operate in seven B.C. communities. The 2019 budget acts on one of the recommendations delivered in December by the provincial government’s Rental Housing Task Force, providing $10 million to establish a provincewide rent bank.

ENCOURAGING DEVELOPMENT

Speaking last week, Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart pointed to another element of the throne speech he was eager to see in the budget: government action to speed up development. Last Tuesday’s throne speech promised to “improve the development process by speeding up much-needed rental housing and delivering more efficient and effective project approvals.”

The following day, Stewart said: “We’ve hear some good rumblings in the throne speech about speeding up development, which is great, perhaps giving us (in local government) new powers to do that.”

There were, however, no details in Tuesday’s budget on improvements to the development process. The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing is reviewing the subject.

The budget came in for criticism from the Urban Development Institute, which represents the real estate development industry. In a statement, UDI president Anne McMullin said the budget’s forecasts show a “dramatic collapse” in housing starts in coming years.

“It’s difficult to see how government will be able to meaningfully improve the vacancy rate, while building fewer rental homes,” McMullin said.

“Sadly, budget 2019 offers little to encourage more housing options for British Columbians and zero incentives for purpose-built rental homes.”

RENTER’S REBATE

Another item missing from this year’s budget is the renter’s rebate, which was an NDP campaign promise in 2017. The NDP government has not abandoned the yearly grant for renters, James said Tuesday, adding: “We are continuing to work on that piece.”

464,Empty,2019-02-19T02:30:23Z,Publicly-paid severance deals for political staff are part of an investigation by Speaker Darryl Plecas that continues to unfold at the B.C. legislature.,"VICTORIA — Speaker Darryl Plecas is diving into the murky world of political staff severances as part of his wide-ranging probe into spending at the legislature.

Plecas intends to crack open taxpayer-paid severance deals for political staff that were paid out of caucus budgets in the legislature. It’s a move that mainly targets his former colleagues and current enemies in the B.C. Liberal party, which paid out staff as it transitioned from government to opposition in 2017, and then again more recently as it shuffled from leaders, from Christy Clark to Rich Coleman to Andrew Wilkinson.

Under investigation is whether taxpayers got hosed for rich payouts that went beyond normal policies and whether any Liberal staff were able to inappropriately double-dip on severances by getting both a government cheque and one from the legislature using money from the Liberal caucus.

“There’s a policy that says you can give a caucus monies for severance one time,” Plecas said in a recent interview with Postmedia News. “And there are limits on what that can be. It certainly can’t be a second time and a third time.”

As many as three alleged severance payments to the Liberal caucus came from the office of suspended clerk of the legislature, Craig James, Plecas said.

“Severance payments once is good, that’s within the rules and the regulations, i.e. when government changes,” said Alan Mullen, Plecas’s chief of staff.

“So when they moved over to opposition, obviously positions are going to change. There’s going to be people let go and that is normal. They get paid severance,” he added.

But “not three times since the last election. Three times separate. First of all when the change happened, then when the interim leader came and went, then when the new leader came. You can’t do that. Unless, of course, you just do it anyway.”

Plecas said he hopes Auditor General Carol Bellringer will also investigate as part of a forensic audit that MLAs have asked her to undertake at the building.

Plecas may or may not discover illegalities on severances. The government has a clear policy that allows severances for terminated staff based on their years of employment, to a maximum of 18 months salary.

But the Speaker’s spotlight will almost certainly raise larger questions about the unsavoury nature of the whole practice — namely the rules that let political staff take a “leave of absence” from their taxpayer-paid jobs to work on election campaigns, and then return to government for a short period to cash out taxpayer-paid severance cheques if their party fails to win at the polls.

Take for example Neil Sweeney, a deputy minister in the premier’s office of Christy Clark, who took a “leave” to help on the 2017 Liberal re-election campaign. After the election, he returned to his job long enough to get fired by the new NDP government and collect severance of $413,361.

Or Michele Cadario, Clark’s deputy chief of staff, who took leave to work on the campaign, then was seconded to the B.C. Liberal party to prepare for a snap election in case the lieutenant-governor decided not to ask the NDP to govern. Before the NDP took office, Cadario returned to the premier’s office for the express purpose of being fired. She collected severance $147,249.

The list goes on. Almost $272,000 for assistant deputy minister turned Liberal operative Kelly Gleeson. Almost $160,000 for communications guru Ben Chin. All told, the Liberal-NDP transition meant 150 employees were fired at a cost of $13.7 million in severance.

Much could have been avoided if the taxpayer-paid staffers in government or legislature caucuses were forced to quit their jobs to work on election campaigns for political parties. No leave granted. No severance required. No cost to the public.

The counter-argument from political staff is they work long hours, for lower pay than comparative jobs in the private sector, and severance is a fair way to help them transition from public service.

Plecas’s power as Speaker will only give him limited ability to probe severances made inside government. But he’ll have free rein to investigate severances made by the B.C. Liberal caucus — which gets its funding from the legislative assembly that Plecas controls — as the Liberals lurched into opposition mode under Clark, interim leader Coleman and eventually new leader Wilkinson.

The Liberal caucus says most of its severance information is already public knowledge. Most fired Liberal government staffers who chose to transition into the Liberal opposition did not receive severances because their employment was considered uninterrupted, said Spencer Sproule, chief of staff to Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson.

However, a person’s years of government service are taken into account if they get fired from Liberal caucus, said Sproule, and they may ultimately end up with a severance package similar to what government had offered anyway.

There were 14 employees directly severed by Liberal caucus, at a total severance-payment cost of $1.1 million.

Twelve people agreed to allow the caucus to make their severance amounts public.

Two former longtime Liberal staffers, Tobie Myers and Greg Dunn, refused. They received severance packages from Coleman when he left as interim Liberal leader in February 2018.

Myers, a former senior aide to Coleman when he was a cabinet minister, became his chief of staff in the Opposition leader’s office in August 2017. Dunn served as manager of caucus information technology.

Postmedia attempted without success to talk directly to Myers and Dunn.

Coleman also declined to comment. As party leader, he was able to negotiate employment contracts for staff that could have included extra compensation clauses, such as if a person’s job position was being eliminated, for example.

Government records show Myers received a $136,058 severance during the initial transition from government to opposition in 2017. Any additional amount won’t be released until government’s year-end public accounts this summer.

“Under B.C. law, we cannot release the specific severance paid to former employees unless they give their permission to do so,” said Sproule. “In this circumstance, the former employees have declined to release their personal information.”

Plecas’s digging into caucus severances may also examine whether there was any extra compensation for anyone by the B.C. Liberal party, in addition to government and caucus payouts.

The party denied it paid any terminated Liberal government or caucus employees extra severance packages, thereby constituting a triple-dip for employees.

“Severance was only paid to long-term party staff who left the organization following the election and would have been consistent with the terms of their employment,” said the B.C. Liberal executive director, Emile Scheffel.

“No severance was paid to individuals who worked temporarily on the election campaign.”

MLAs on the all-party legislature management committee are to meet later this week for an update on the spending scandal. The Speaker wants permission to release a new report, outlining additional concerns about James, Lenz and building spending.

But if Plecas is looking for MLA support to overhaul the rules governing severance packages, he’ll find few allies at the table from the B.C. Green, NDP or Liberal caucuses. They all give their employees special leave to campaign in elections, along with the protection of taxpayer-paid severance packages if voters boot them out of office.

The maverick Speaker clearly doesn’t seem to care about whose feathers he ruffles with his investigations. That was already evident with his bombshell report into alleged misspending by the clerk and sergeant-at-arms last month, as well as his public proclamation that unspecified former MLAs and staff are going to jail as part of his probe.

Whatever Plecas find on severances will be interesting. But whether it changes anything is another story.

Nashie Oombash died on Monday, three weeks after she left the Cat Lake First Nation to seek medical care in Thunder Bay.

Oombash's cause of death is unknown pending an autopsy. But her sister said she believes exposure to mould contributed.

""She died from the house, from the mould,"" said Rita Wesley. ""She lived on a hill full of mould. In the basement, it's just full of mould under there and nobody really looked into it to clean it up.""

Last month, the remote First Nation 600 km north of Thunder Bay declared a state of emergency due to the severe housing and mould crisis. Chief and council believe long-term exposure to mould is affecting the health of at least 100 residents.

""People in Cat Lake get sick non-stop,"" the community's Deputy Chief Abigail Wesley said during a media conference at Queen's Park on Friday. ""Coughing, multiple pneumonia incidents, related kidney diseases and increased medical problems.""

A letter from Nashie Oombash's doctor expressing concern about the mould in her home.

Rita Wesley, who is also a health director in the First Nation, said she sometimes accompanied Oombash to the nursing station to seek help for her respiratory issues.

""Then she would be just [be] sent home, you know just to rest and relax,"" she said. ""Home is not where we rest; home is where we get sick from. Our homes are not safe.""

CBC News spoke to Nashie Oombash about her health issues 10 days prior her death. Along with suffering from diabetes, she said she often suffered from breathing problems that got better when she left her home in the community.

One of Oombash's doctors wrote a letter to chief and council about her respiratory issues on Jan. 21, 2019. ""Oombash has been having significant breathing problems when she is at home which is likely associated with the [sic] mold in her house,"" the letter said.

According to a report commissioned by the First Nation, 87 houses in the community need to be completely replaced due to mould and other problems. Councillor Abigail Wesley said her community is frustrated by the lack of action from the federal government to help them deal with the crisis.

""Medevacs occur almost daily,"" she said. ""As a matter of fact, we have almost 100 children needing assessment for serious health issues. The federal government continues to ignore, and demand more paperwork, proof, and study.""

Ontario NDP MP Charlie Angus said he doesn't know what it will take for the federal government to see the northern Ontario reserve is in a health crisis.



He also said discussions are underway about bringing in a non-governmental organization, such as the Red Cross, to help.

The office of Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O'Regan said the minister contacted community leaders on Tuesday night to express his condolences following Oombash's death.



O'Regan will meet with band leaders on Thursday in Thunder Bay.

""We're meeting tomorrow on a relatively detailed plan on housing for the community over the next 18 months,"" he told reporters in Ottawa. ""I think that we're moving relatively quickly.""

Cat Lake's leadership said if a plan of action is not agreed to soon, they are considering evacuating the community. Rita Wesley said she hopes it doesn't come to that.

""You know we love our home too. We don't really want to leave. So we just have to live with it and slowly suffer with it. That's the way we're living. We're slowly suffering, slowly dying.""

She hopes that help arrives soon for the community.

""We want better housing. Bring the lumber in. Do what you can. Never mind about money. Don't tell me it's a money issue. You know I don't want to hear that. We're human beings too.""

467,Empty,2019-02-21T14:00:06Z,Opinion: Bill Tieleman offers a behind-the-scenes glimpse at the electoral reform referendum from the perspective of the winners,"“Strategy is the single most important element in a political campaign.”

— Hawaiian political strategist Bob Oshira

How was proportional representation defeated in a decisive third British Columbia binding referendum – despite it having a clear lead in the polls and full support from the New Democratic Party provincial government, its B.C. Green Party allies and several prominent advocacy groups?

And how did a result that two major polling firms called “too close to call” after mail-in balloting ended on Dec. 7, 2018, turn into a 61 to 39 per cent drubbing of proportional representation?

As president of the official opponent group, the No BC Proportional Representation Society, and leader of two previously successful defenses of our current First Past the Post electoral system in 2005 and 2009, as well as strategist for Fight HST, which eliminated the Harmonized Sales Tax in a 2011 referendum, I have a fair bit of experience to draw conclusions from.

Three reasons are important:

1. Campaign strategy matters greatly.

2. Clarity tops confusion.

3. Strategic advertising moves opinions.

Here’s what happened.

Just after the provincial election in May of 2017, pollsters Ipsos found that 54 per cent of respondents wanted to change to a proportional representation electoral system, while just 20 per cent supported our current First Past The Post system and 26 per cent were undecided.

By May 2018, the Angus Reid Institute polling found that 57 per cent of respondents wanted to change from our First Past the Post electoral system to some form of Proportional Representation, with just 43 per cent in favour of FPTP.

But that was before any campaigning started and before the government announced in June 2018 the ballot question and outlined that not one but three different forms of proportional representation would be voted on – two of which did not exist anywhere in the world.

And that changed everything.

Prior to the official campaign period starting July 1, both sides began vigorous efforts to influence public opinion – but with very different approaches.

As a lifelong New Democrat, I was happy to accept an offer from Suzanne Anton, the former B.C. Liberal attorney general, to join me, along with our neutral colleague from the past two referenda, retired ex-deputy minister Bob Plecas. As the three Society directors we were ably aided by veteran political strategist and fundraiser Jess Ketchum and our campaign coordinator Kent Verge, with experience in provincial and federal elections.

Anton, Plecas and I spoke at dozens of events across B.C. and did countless media interviews, with a central campaign backed by local volunteers, generous personal donors and very strong Chinese-Canadian and South Asian campaign teams that clearly moved votes in many key ridings – as the final results showed.

Our strategy was to emphasize a non-partisan – or cross-partisan – appeal to voters from all three major parties who shared our belief that FPTP had served the province well, despite our political differences. Just the fact that obvious adversaries like Anton and myself were willing to work together was newsworthy.

It was also very important that former NDP Premier Ujjal Dosanjh was an early supporter, as were some labour and party activists, showing voters that support for proportional representation was far from unanimous within the NDP. In fact, polling showed about 35 per cent of NDP voters favoured FPTP.

And former NDP Premier Glen Clark publicly stated during the campaign that he would vote for FPTP.

Meanwhile, B.C. Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson and his caucus strongly fought proportional representation in the Legislature and at the riding level. Business groups such as the B.C. Chamber of Commerce also publicly criticized the referendum process and supported FPTP, fearing the instability of proportional representation.

The proportional representation Yes side had to overcome an early split between two conflicting groups but did eventually consolidate to create Vote PR BC as the official proponent group. It also brought together some unions, advocacy groups like the Broadbent Institute, LeadNow, Dogwood Initiative, the Canadian Federation of Students and both the BC NDP and BC Green parties.

But it tellingly lacked noticeable support from businesses or prominent B.C. Liberals.

And the proportional representation side was firmly tied to government decisions on the ballot and proposals drafted by NDP Attorney General David Eby and the referendum campaigns of Premier John Horgan and Green leader Andrew Weaver. But despite some criticism of the process, the pro-rep side started well ahead.

The differences in campaigns were soon even clearer.

Our No campaign started quickly with a hard-hitting series of specially targeted ads on social media attacking the confusion and complicated consequences of voting for a dramatic change.

There was a strong emphasis on the disturbing results of European elections, where proportional representation has allowed far-right parties in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and other countries to gain seats in parliament, giving them enormous influence or even the balance of power without winning significant geographic seats.

While proportional representation did not create extremism, we pointed out, it did enable extremists to enter parliament, gain a platform for their hateful views and stoke anti-immigrant attitudes by merely obtaining five per cent or less of the cross-country popular vote.

By comparison in the United Kingdom’s 2015 election, the far-right U.K. Independence Party took 12.6 per cent of the vote but only one of 650 Parliamentary seats, thanks to First Past the Post – which demands winning MPs have strong local support, not country-wide marginal votes.

[UKIP was all but wiped out in the following 2017 election, dropping to just 1.8 per cent and no seats.]

But Vote PR BC’s pre-campaign approach was not advertising to sell proportional representation to voters or counter our arguments but instead apparently focused on voter identification, using phone banks and canvassing to build a database for use in the eventual mail balloting period.

Vote PR BC presumed its base was strong enough to win without advertising reinforcement – so long as their voters turned out – but that turned out to be an error.

And these strong differences carried through even more clearly in the official campaign period of July 1 to Dec. 7, 2018.

The No side relied heavily on strong, repeated messaging in media, backed by powerful strategic advertising developed by our campaign in concert with Curve Communications – the firm founded by former Vancouver city councillor George Affleck. We also relied on very accurate opinion research polling by Ipsos that tested our campaign messaging and attacked the foundations of proportional representation, namely that it:

• was complicated and confusing;

• led to extremists winning seats with a tiny fraction of votes as in Germany, Austria and other European nations;

• would lead to loss of local representation and more party-controlled seats coming from pools of candidates used to create proportionality; and

• could adopt systems proposed that were untried or little used – with two of the three B.C. models untested anywhere and mixed member proportional only in four countries – while most pro-rep countries use proportional representation list systems – which were never on the ballot or seriously considered;

• compared poorly to First Past the Post, which by comparison is simple, stable and successful – the foundation of democracy in the United Kingdom for centuries and many other countries around the world.

That advertising – partly funded by significant personal donations from individual British Columbians – ran on TV, radio online and in print – and it was also controversial.

The most prominent ad showed scenes from Europe talking about the problems of extremism under proportional representation, ending with marching soldiers and the sound of their boots – and it hit a major nerve, with criticism claiming it was unfair.

But in our view it was both very accurate – and absolutely necessary to wake up voters. It started a vigorous province-wide discussion of extremism, which resonated particularly in immigrant communities.

The ad was needed because British Columbians were never excited about this referendum. Nor had they been widely consulted or informed because of a rushed process that met the NDP and Green parties’ legislative agreement timetable – but it didn’t create the social consensus needed for such a significant change.

To get around that, the government had already reduced the need previously set out in the Referendum Act to achieve 60 per cent of all votes and get 60 per cent of all 87 ridings to at least vote in favour of change – the standard set for both 2005 and 2009 votes.

Instead a vote of just 50 per cent plus one would change our entire electoral system, without any need to win regional riding support, meaning Metro Vancouver could technically make the decision because of the huge number of voters there.

And the rush job meant there were over 30 “details” left to be determined after the referendum should it pass – including providing riding maps; the number of votes each voter would have – one or two; and how many candidates per riding – with a range of from one to seven, depending on the system chosen.

Those facts informed our second and third television and social media ads.

The second showed a woman trying to reach her local MLA by phone only to find the office had been closed – a fair comment on the fact that under the proposed mixed member proportional system, 40 per cent of MLAs would come from pools of candidates, not directly elected locally in geographic ridings.

The third ad was simplicity itself – actual British Columbians were filmed reacting to proportional representation – and not surprisingly, they said it was “complicated and confusing” – which re-confirmed for many voters their existing worries about changing systems to something they did not understand. Together the three ads encapsulated all of the concerns voters had about proportional representation – and reminded them why it was important to cast a ballot.

While we were working hard to win votes, some political observers and media maintained the theory that the NDP government was actually trying to “lose the referendum.”

That idea met with great derision from our team. Without question the entire process had been set up to help the proportional representation side win – it just wasn’t either sufficient or a good enough strategy – but we objected repeatedly to the unfair advantages given.

More importantly, our core messages of complicated and confusing proportional representation – especially by comparison to simple, stable and success First Past The Post – were amplified by our advertising, which was also driven by our private polling.

Ipsos pollster Kyle Braid showed us that shortly after our aggressive advertising campaign began, we were doing much better, but still 20 per cent behind our goals.

But by August we had taken a lead, with 41 per cent definitely or likely voting FPTP, to 28 per cent definitely or likely voting proportional representation and 27 per cent still undecided; and by November we continued trending upward as the ballot deadline approached, leading by 43 to 29 points, with 21 per cent undecided.

And an Ipsos exit poll after voting closed Dec. 7 had us winning with 59 to 41 per cent, just two points off the actual results, also showing that the referendum was not at all, as some said, “too close to call”!

While our numbers clearly showed the Yes side sliding into trouble by August, by comparison to our campaign, they did not run a significant advertising campaign in traditional media – TV, radio, print – and made a limited social media effort.

Their strategy was, apparently, to continue identifying supportive voters via telephoning and canvassing and focus on getting them to mail in their ballots. Their social media campaign was reactive to our messaging – and sometimes their supporting groups wrongly used personal attacks.

The pro-rep campaign intent appeared to be to low-ball the entire referendum and win with GOTV – get out the vote – with a relatively modest voter turnout that would maximize its efforts.

But the pro rep strategy was a mistake – it did not make adjustments, as Carville advises.

One simple story to illustrate that. While buying groceries in late November, a young male clerk of South Asian descent asked me about what my “No Pro Rep” button on my jacket meant.

I told him it expressed my strong opposition to proportional representation.

He quickly replied: “Oh, that’s how extremists get elected.”

I heartily agreed, as it was very clear our messaging was reaching far and wide. And outside Metro Vancouver we heard equally strong concerns about losing local MLAs to party lists and urban votes.

In the end, a combination of factors led to the second crushing defeat in nine years for proportional representation.

Our volunteer team worked closely for a year, running a strong central campaign based on tested messaging that reflected the concerns of voters, combined with powerful advertising. We achieved the best possible result – the very wide margin of victory needed to ensure that proportional representation is off the political agenda.

They’re back and should be busier than ever.

Projects would have been granted expedited provincial approvals within one year, allowing businesses to begin construction, but critics warned that would have put prime farmland and the 1.8-million acre Greenbelt around the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area at risk.

First up will be a revised version of Bill 66 to eliminate an amendment to the Planning Act that would have allowed municipalities to bypass existing development requirements and restrictions for companies creating jobs.

“We’re moving at breakneck speed on all kinds of stuff. We’re going to have a robust schedule when the house resumes,” government house leader Todd Smith said in an interview Friday.

Premier Doug Ford admitted last month his Progressive Conservatives erred and vowed to close the loophole in that omnibus bill hastily introduced before Christmas.

A draft version — which confirmed the incorporation of a new “super agency” called Health Program Initiatives that the Star revealed in January — was leaked to the NDP and a mid-level bureaucrat was fired Feb. 4 for the breach.

Smith said another piece of legislation in the days ahead will be Health Minister Christine Elliott’s bill to reorganize the health-care system.

While the New Democrats claim the bill will usher in additional privatization to health care in Ontario, Elliott has dismissed that as “fear mongering.”

Also expected this month are potentially controversial bills on policing oversight from Community Safety Minister Sylvia Jones and on schools from Education Minister Lisa Thompson.

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, who has already called for the resignation of Social Services Minister Lisa MacLeod over the Tories’ contentious revamping of funding for autism services, warned the government is in for a bumpy ride on many fronts.

Horwath pledged to “fight for the services people care about, whether that’s young people, whether that’s children with autism, whether that’s our public health system that we so fiercely want to defend, that’s what we’re going to be doing.”

“Doug Ford is not the king of Ontario. He has to answer for his actions,” she said Friday.

With such rhetoric, Smith conceded it should be an emotionally charged session.

“They scream that the sky is falling no matter what we do. They seem to be a protest party and they like to plan protests,” the house leader said of the New Democrats.

Still, Smith said autism funding is “a tough file” and the Tories are bracing for the issue to dominate question period this week.

The opposition parties will also be hammering the government over its bid to appoint Toronto police Supt. Ron Taverner, a 72-year-old friend of Ford’s, as commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police.

That OPP posting is now subject of an ethics investigation by integrity commissioner J. David Wake.

Horwath said she will be highlighting the “tidal wave of criticism” over the appointment.

The government, which took office last June, is also looking ahead to its first budget.

Although Ford has promised to cut 4 per cent of spending — the equivalent of $6 billion on a $150 billion budget — he’s insisted “not one job” will be lost as the Tories move toward balancing the books.

“We’re going to be responsible. If it takes a year longer, so be it,” the premier said Thursday, referring to the timetable for being back in the black.

“I’ve said over and over again, I’m not going in there hacking and slashing, and with a chainsaw cutting it up. It’s not going to happen under our administration. We’re going to find efficiencies.”

Finance Minister Vic Fedeli, who is hoping to reduce a $13.5 billion deficit, is signalling Ontarians to gird for austerity measures.

“We have to start with the understanding that the previous government was spending $40 million a day more than they brought in,” said Fedeli of the Liberals of former premier Kathleen Wynne.

“We know that in this budget we must also indicate our path to balance. It’s mandatory in this budget,” he said, declining to tip his hand on when the province will be out of the red.

“I like to use my Goldilocks reference: it won’t be too soon, because, quite frankly, nobody would believe it; it won’t be too long, because anybody can do that; it will be just right.”

Asked what that means, Fedeli smiled and said: “It means that the 2019 budget will see a detailed path to balance.”

Justin Trudeau’s chief of staff, Katie Telford, and principal secretary, Gerald Butts — who quit last week, denying any improper PMO conduct — spoke to Jody Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff, Jessica Prince, a PMO official said late Friday.

Prince answers to Telford within the ranks of political staff. The Prime Minister’s Office would not detail the nature of their exchange. But privy council clerk Michael Wernick told a committee during his testimony Thursday that the conversation among staffers for each office — whom he did not name — may be raised by Wilson-Raybould as a concern if and when she ever goes public.

“I can’t get into any actual details of the conversation itself,” said Trudeau spokesperson Cameron Ahmad. “Any conversations that were had, whether it was this one or any of the other ones that have been referenced, all fall under the category of what the prime minister has described and, frankly, what the clerk described as appropriate conversations where everything was discussed in a proper way.”

Article Continued Below

Until now it had not been clear that Telford had any contact with the SNC-Lavalin file. The PMO has previously said Telford never spoke to Wilson-Raybould directly on the matter. Wernick defended the actions of Trudeau, his senior aides and himself on the file, but conceded Wilson-Raybould may have seen things differently. “How she interprets or perceives those conversations, she can tell you next week. “I can tell you my view very firmly is that they were entirely appropriate, lawful, legal. I’m prepared to submit to the judgment of the ethics commissioner on that,” Wernick testified. The Conservative official Opposition said there may be grounds for the RCMP to investigate whether pressure put on the former attorney general in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution amounted to obstruction of justice. Conservative MP Michael Cooper, a member of the Commons justice committee, told reporters it was clear based on Wernick’s testimony Thursday that Wilson-Raybould was subjected to pressure to negotiate a remediation agreement with the Quebec company long after the director of public prosecutions rejected it. “I think there’s certainly a strong basis to be made for an RCMP investigation,” Cooper said.

The Conservatives went further in question period Friday, charging that efforts by Trudeau and his senior aides to make Wilson-Raybould “change her mind” crossed the line. “With everything we now know, how is this not obstruction of justice by the prime minister?” said Conservative MP John Brassard. Government house Leader Bardish Chagger highlighted Wernick’s testimony that Trudeau had always made clear the final decision on any deferred prosecution the SNC-Lavalin rested with Wilson-Raybould. On Friday, Trudeau was asked if he viewed any of Wernick’s interactions with Wilson-Raybould as applying undue pressure on her, but he declined to pass judgment. He pointed to “mechanisms to look into exactly those kinds of issues. We have an ethics commissioner who’s pursing an investigation, we have a parliamentary committee.” Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith broke ranks with his party mid-week and voted to support the opposition’s unsuccessful call for a judicial inquiry because he said he doesn’t believe the ethics commissioner has a mandate to get to the heart of the matter. Ethics commissioner Mario Dion said he would look at a possible breach of section 9 of the Conflict of Interest Act, which prohibits a public office holder from seeking to influence a decision of another person so as to improperly further another person’s private interests. Erskine-Smith said when it comes to the merits of a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin, “whether or not an intervention (by the PMO) may have been justified in substance, the real question is the nature of that intervention. Specifically, was undue pressure exerted, contrary to the constitutional convention of attorney general independence? “In the end, citizens deserve the truth,” he said. “The truth, like confidence in our public institutions, depends on a serious commitment to openness and transparency.” Trudeau has not yet committed to lifting the limitations of solicitor-client secrecy on Wilson-Raybould, saying he awaits legal advice from her successor, David Lametti. On Friday, Trudeau urged Canadians to “heed” the testimony of Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant, who serves as the prime minister’s deputy minister and secretary to cabinet. Wernick said the former attorney general may have felt pressure to “get it right” on the SNC-Lavalin prosecution but that nobody applied inappropriate or undue pressure. He rejected suggestions the director of public prosecutions had already dismissed the option of a remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin, and even suggested it continued to be an option. “The decision had not already been made,” Wernick told reporters, defending his conversation with Wilson-Raybould on Dec. 19. “She had and continued to have authorities under the law, and it is entirely legal and lawful and appropriate under the Shawcross doctrine to inform a minister of the context in which she’s taking a decision.” Speaking in St. John’s Friday morning, Trudeau dodged several direct questions about why he, Gerald Butts and Wernick continued to speak to Wilson-Raybould, the then justice minister, about a possible remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin even after the director of public prosecutions had already rejected it. Trudeau repeatedly answered by declaring the “fundamental responsibilities of any government” is to protect and promote jobs while upholding institutions, respecting the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. Trudeau called Wernick “an extraordinary public servant who has served this country under governments of different political stripes with integrity and brilliance.” Trudeau added Wernick “is someone who we need to heed very carefully when he chooses to express himself publicly.” Wilson-Raybould — who has stated she hopes to be able to “speak my truth” — is expected to appear before the justice committee next week. Lametti said Friday, “We are working to try to find a way such that the former attorney general can, in fact, speak. We are doing our level best to do that.” Wernick, who is not a lawyer, all but scoffed at Wilson-Raybould’s claim to be bound by solicitor-client privilege. The blunt-talking privy council clerk said the matter was “never” discussed at cabinet, and that no solicitor-client privilege attaches to the discussions because Wilson-Raybould was never “advising” the government on the matter. He said the only thing that ever took place were “lawful” discussions about the impact of potential criminal liability on the company.

Duff Conacher, co-founder of the non-partisan organization that advocates for democratic reform and government accountability, expressed concern after the Star first revealed the Tories urged lobbyists to sell tickets to Wednesday’s fundraiser.

Ontario Progressive Conservative leader Doug Ford: “We’ve put fundraisers together that are $25-spaghetti dinners as you know, so we have the freebies, we have the $25-fundraisers, and then we have the big fundraiser,” the premier said of the event, which should make the Tories $2 million. ( Aaron Vincent Elkaim / THE CANADIAN PRESS file photo )

“The PC Party asking lobbyists to sell high-priced tickets to the premier’s fundraising event shows that the Ford government is willing to sell access to the premier for cash, and to trade favours with lobbyists, in violation of the interests of the people of Ontario,” he said. Conacher, an adjunct professor of law and politics at the University of Ottawa, said the governing party will “feel compelled to return the favour by protecting the interests of the lobbyists’ clients. “That means the public interest will be violated.”

“I can tell you one thing: no one can influence Doug Ford. No one can influence my ministers or my caucus,” he said during a trade mission to Washington. “We’ve put fundraisers together that are $25-spaghetti dinners as you know, so we have the freebies, we have the $25-fundraisers, and then we have the big fundraiser,” the premier said of the Toronto Congress Centre event Wednesday that should make the Tories $2 million.

“We have to run campaigns.” As disclosed by the Star on Thursday, the Tories appealed to lobbyists for help due to the tightened rules around political fundraising introduced in 2016 by the previous Liberal government. The ban on corporate and union donations has made selling tickets a challenge. Until the changes three years ago, which were triggered by a Star probe of Liberal political fundraising excesses, companies could purchase entire tables for dinners and then give the tickets to employees, associates or clients. But now, each ticket must be paid for by an individual. In an email appeal to clients obtained by the Star, Chris Benedetti, a principal at Sussex Strategy Group, a firm run by Conservatives and Liberals, said the company “has been asked to help with the event.” “The event is $12,500 for a table of 10 ($1,250/person). To reserve a table, please let us know, and we can assist you in assembling individual registrations to then be sent in as a package,” he wrote. Benedetti, registered to lobby for 60 different companies at Queen’s Park, said he was contacted by the PC Ontario Fund last month. “I have not spoken to anyone in the premier’s office about this event, and no one in the office or any other government office has been in touch with me to encourage sales or otherwise,” he said. Another lobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wants to continue to do business with the Tories, said there has been “tremendous pressure” on his company to sell tickets. “You’re really made to feel that you’re not pulling your weight if you don’t sell a table or two,” the consultant said. NDP MPP Taras Natyshak (Essex) said Friday that “Doug Ford’s threat-based racket looks like cash-for-access on steroids.” Green Leader Mike Schreiner said that “when big money gets its hands on our politics, it eats away at democracy.” Marcus Mattinson, the PC party’s director of communications, has said “dozens of individuals have been assisting the party with fundraising for decades, and this event is no exception.” In November, the Tories repealed a section in the campaign finance reform bill that forced donors to “certify, in a form approved by the chief electoral officer, that the person has not acted contrary” to the ban on unions or corporations making donations in the name of members or employees.

After weeks of embarrassing leaks — including revelations in the Star about a new health “super agency” and the opposition NDP’s unauthorized release of a draft government bill — Elliott will table legislation on Tuesday.

“There’s no real surprise in the sense that I’ve said from the beginning that we need transformational change in health care in Ontario,” the minister told reporters Monday at Queen’s Park. “We have some significant problems that we’re dealing with when we have over 30,000 people who are waiting for long-term care beds,” said Elliott. “We have 1,200 people every day in hospitals across Ontario who are receiving health care in hallways and storage rooms; and the wait-list for mental health and addictions is way too long,” she said.

Confirming what the Star first reported on Jan. 17, Elliott said as part of the restructuring there would be a new “super agency” overseeing how health services are delivered. “What we really need to do is focus our health-care system on the patient. That’s what the centre of all of this is about — to make sure that patients’ needs are considered and thought of first and foremost.”

The minister emphasized that the head of the new super agency would not be a patronage appointment. “We are thinking about the people that we are going to be appointing to the agency. We are wanting to make sure that we are connecting with people that are knowledgeable about our health-care system so that’s what we are concentrating on,” she said. “We are finalizing our appointments ... it is going to be a professional person.” In recent months, the Tories have been criticized for appointing friends of Premier Doug Ford, including Toronto police Supt. Ron Taverner, 72, the proposed new commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, whose party’s obtaining of draft legislation led to a mid-level government bureaucrat being fired on Feb. 4, said she’s worried about what the revamped system will look like. “They better close this idea of a super agency that’s going to take away the local specifics around what people need in their communities,” said Horwath. “We’re very, very concerned about that,” she said, warning of increased “privatization” in health care. The draft bill, which Elliott downplayed as a “very early” version, would give the new super agency unprecedented powers to contract out health services. One of the leaked documents, titled “agency review weekly status report,” indicates the government has used focus groups to gauge acceptance of the health-overhaul plan. Some 20 existing health agencies are expected to be folded into the new body. Robert Benzie is the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

Staff at the office of the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth — which will be shut down this spring, with investigations transferred to the ombudsman — were told at a meeting that more than 40 of them in Toronto will likely be laid off, sources say.

Officially, however, “the exact number is yet to be determined,” the Ontario Ombudsman’s office said in a statement. One employee who spoke to the Star said staff were told the best-case scenario is 24 of 67 positions will transfer over, but all advocacy jobs will be axed. “Two-thirds of staff is a lot,” said the Toronto employee, who did not wish to be identified.

The child advocate also has an office in Thunder Bay that will be shut down. Ombudsman Paul Dubé is taking over investigations done by the children’s advocate, by May 1 at the latest, under provincial legislation brought in by the Ford government last year.

Advocacy will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services — and Minister Lisa MacLeod has said she will also personally assume such duties — and it will create roundtables to give youth a voice. Meanwhile, MacLeod came under more fire Thursday for changes to the province’s autism services, but said the government will go ahead with its plan that is meant to clear the 23,000-child wait-list for services, and ensure more children receive support for services. As of April 1, families will qualify for up to $20,000 a year for each child under 6 — up to a lifetime maximum of $140,000. Children older than that can access up to $5,000 a year up to age 18, to a lifetime maximum of $55,000. However, amounts are based on a sliding scale depending on family income, and only those earning less than $55,000 in net income will qualify for the entire amount. Intensive therapy for children with severe needs can cost up to $80,000 a year, and some families are bracing for a drop in support from the government. Parent Sarah Farrants of London, who made the trip to Queen’s Park, said “there was no hope in there today” from PC MPPs. “Listening to them and watching them applaud her (during question period), there’s no hope for parents.” She and mom Brandi Tapp later met personally with MacLeod to outline their concerns. “We told Lisa that it took 96 days with the Liberals,” to get the former government to improve the system, said Farrants, whose 3-year-old son is on a wait-list for autism therapy. “We’re not going away. These are our children.” “I would prefer to go back on the wait list than to move forward with this program,” Tapp added. “She is offering sub-standard therapies to 23,000 children so she can look good on paper by clearing the wait list.” NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said parents feel “betrayed” by Premier Doug Ford, who “promised families so much” during the election campaign. “This premier has done nothing to offer anything to parents,” Horwath said. “The promises were big, but the result was nil.” MacLeod — noting the province is spending $321 million on its autism program, up from the $256 million the Liberals budgeted — said “I understand that there are a lot of parents who are concerned about this plan, but there are a lot of parents who are going to be relieved with this plan.” She said it’s “heartbreaking” to hear from upset families. “As a mother, I can appreciate parents fighting for their children,” she added. “As the minister, I have to make sure I am supporting as many children as possible.” With files from Rob Ferguson Kristin Rushowy is a Toronto-based reporter covering Ontario politics.

473,Empty,2019-02-21T03:02:05Z,"Had the Liberals spent even a fraction of those cash reserves, they might still be in government. Instead, the New Democrats get to spend, with an easy thanks and a tip of the hat to their arrogant and uncomprehending predecessors.","VICTORIA — Finance Minister Carole James wrapped up her budget presentation this week with a motion to spend a further $375 million in cash on hand before the March 31 ending of the current financial year.

The one-time funding would be targeted at worthy causes, from medical research to high-speed internet connections for rural and Indigenous communities.

Such supplementary estimates, as they are known in legislative parlance, were precluded by budget law so long as the province was carrying an accumulation of debt from past operating deficits.

But the direct debt was paid off last year, freeing the finance minister to begin diverting end of the year surpluses to top up existing programs and fund new ones.

The spending estimates still need supplementary approval by the legislature, a likely outcome given the majority in the seat count for the NDP-Green partnership.

The largest item on the list is $100 million for Kitimat and 25 other local governments along what the New Democrats are calling “the LNG corridor” in northwest and north central B.C.

The money is ticketed for infrastructure and planning for future projects, as a down payment of sorts on the anticipated benefits of LNG development.

Local governments elsewhere in the province will be in line for a further $40 million in grants to rehabilitate and upgrade water, waste water and storm water systems, develop tourist attractions, and other infrastructure projects.

Next on the list is $89 million in grants to organizations specializing in research in health and the life sciences. The goal being to help them to attract and retain researchers as well as lever $200 million in additional funds from external sources.

Then comes $50 million to expand high-speed internet connections, something taken for granted in urban B.C., for some 200 rural and Indigenous communities.

This, too, comes with expectations of attracting additional money from the broadband fund of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.

James also seeks approval for $30 million in incentives to encourage British Columbians to switch to clean energy vehicles, a further $30 million to treat contaminated sites, and a $20 million top up to NDP child-care initiatives.

There’s a request for $5.5 million in additional funding to maintain tuition-free programs for adult basic education and English language learning.

Last on the list is $8 million in additional funding for the civil resolution tribunal, which is central to NDP hopes of reining in ICBC’s legal and court costs; plus $2.4 million to begin implementing recommendations of the recent task force on jobs in the mining sector.

The $375 million won’t exhaust the entire budget surplus for the year. Other leftover money will be used to retire the much larger capital debt.

Such are the end-of-the-fiscal year rewards that a government can dole out when the direct debt is paid off and the budget is in surplus.

The New Democrats made the $1.2 billion payment on the direct debt last year. The direct debt topped out at almost $16 billion early in the B.C. Liberal term of government.

Mike de Jong, the last Liberal finance minister, did most of the heavy lifting to retire the debt, a point James acknowledged during her budget day media conference.

“It certainly was the focus of the previous finance minister,” she conceded. “I’ve been quite clear about giving him credit for the focus that he put on it.”

Then the nod to her own government’s follow-through on debt retirement and surplus budgeting, reflected in continued “strong growth” and “fiscal responsibility.”

She also took a dig at the Liberals for their narrow focus on surpluses and debt reduction, to the exclusion of other priorities.

“Getting rid of the operating debt means those resources can be used for programs and services and supports,” said the finance minister.

“Having the operating debt paid off means we can utilize, through supplementary estimates, the dollars and the resources when the economy is doing well to support people in B.C. We believe that will help us continue to see that economic growth.

“It’s really the different approach that we’re taking compared to the previous government,” she continued. “To us, having a surplus simply for the sake of a surplus without having supports in place for people doesn’t make good sense.”

A surplus simply for the sake of having a surplus. That’s a tough but defensible assessment of the Liberal approach during their last few years in government.

When the Liberals lost their legislative majority and with it their hold on power in 2017, the audited financial statements for their last full year in power would show a $2.7 billion surplus.

Their final budget and three-year fiscal plan, tabled on the eve of the election call, included a further $2.6 billion in operating surpluses, forecast allowances and contingency funds.

Yet with all that fiscal room to move, de Jong and his colleagues presided over a government that picked fights with the disabled over passes, dragged its feet on a long-overdue increase in income assistance, and could not see its way clear to eliminate bridge tolls, a stance that contributed to the loss of a half dozen seats.

Had the Liberals spent even a fraction of those cash reserves, they might still be in government.

Instead, the New Democrats get to spend, with an easy thanks and a tip of the hat to their arrogant and uncomprehending predecessors.

474,Empty,2019-02-20T02:21:57Z,"On the spending side, the New Democrats are budgeting for a $10-billion increase from when they took over from the Liberals, or about five per cent more per year.","VICTORIA — While B.C. continues to enjoy healthy growth and significant surpluses under the New Democrats, this week’s provincial budget acknowledged a few clouds on the economic and fiscal horizon.

Take housing starts, a canary in the coal mine for both affordability and residential construction.

The New Democrats are forecasting that by the 2021 election year, housing starts will have dropped by about 30 per cent from when the NDP took office, a loss of tens of thousands of units and untold jobs and economic activity.

By way of explanation, I would note that the government’s vaunted 30-point housing plan concentrates almost exclusively on tax and regulatory changes, relief for renters and subsidized public housing.

There was next to no mention of measures to increase the private sector housing supply. Likewise, this year’s throne speech paid only lip service to the challenges faced by developers, with a passing reference to “delivering more efficient and effective project approvals.”

No new taxes? Some New Democrats claimed as much. But one had to look at footnote no. 6 on the bottom of page 113 to be reminded that the carbon tax will increase by $5 a tonne starting April 1, raising an additional $200 million from taxpayers. That previously announced tax increase was acknowledged in the tiniest type face available to the ministry, and then only in parentheses. No wonder even some NDP critics missed it.

On the spending side, the New Democrats are budgeting for a $10-billion increase from when they took over from the Liberals, or about five per cent more per year.

Some $4 billion in all is sequestered to cover increases in wages and benefits for more than 300,000 workers in the provincial public sector.

Nor is that necessarily the end of the story. The province has yet to settle with the powerful B.C. Teachers Federation. The union is signalling it expects a bigger raise than the two-per-cent-a-year over three years standard in other public sector settlements.

The Health Ministry, as is usually the case, is the other major consumer of new funding. The ministry will get three out of every four dollars dedicated for increased program spending over the next three years.

Not surprisingly, other priorities will be squeezed.

Finance Minister Carole James highlighted a new tax credit for families with children under the age of 18, though it won’t kick in for another 20 months. Blame the federal government, say the New Democrats, for that is how long it takes to get Ottawa to work a new tax credit into the income-tax system.

One could as easily attribute the delay to the New Democrats. They took office 18 months ago with the promise of $10-a-day child care and are still some distance from implementing anything like it.

The New Democrats are also starting to spend in a big way on capital projects. There’s $30 billion budgeted over three years to build schools, hospitals, roads, bridges, transit lines, housing and B.C. Hydro projects.

By 2021, the total provincial debt is forecast to be just over $82 billion, up $17 billion from when the New Democrats took office.

As with some of the big debt increases under the B.C. Liberals, the NDP debt-loading is not expected to affect B.C.’s Triple A credit rating.

But some of the biggest ticket items, like the $1.8 billion replacement for St. Paul’s hospital or the $10.7 billion Site C project, have not yet been incorporated into provincial borrowing.

Perhaps the most dubious forecast involved the Insurance Corp. of B.C. In the course of turning around the mess inherited from the Liberals, ICBC was expected to reduce its losses to $684 million in the financial year ending March 31. Instead it lost a whopping $1.18 billion.

Still, the New Democrats insisted that the turnaround will be back on track when a crackdown on legal billings and court costs kicks in April 1. Projected loss in 2019-20: a mere $50 million.

I have my doubts that a company that missed its last target by half a billion dollars can make up so much lost ground in such a short time.

Another mystery involved revenues from casinos. The New Democrats have presided over a crackdown on large cash payments and other vestiges of money laundering.

Yet the service plan forecasts a $125-million increase in casino revenues over four years. If there were as much money laundering going on as some people claim, wouldn’t revenues be down not up?

I’m told that the increase is mostly owing to increased play on slots. Table revenues, the main attraction for those big-bucks cash-only customers, are down by $27 million or five per cent.

This also marks the first budget where the B.C. government has made any allowance for LNG.

It is too soon to record direct revenues but the look ahead on the economy includes the following: “On Oct 1, 2018, LNG Canada announced its final investment decision to build the LNG Canada facility in Kitimat. As such, the 2019 economic forecast includes the LNG Canada project. The project is expected to generate a significant amount of economic activity.”

No dollar breakdown. But the multi billion dollar investment in LNG Canada is one of several factors contributing to a modest improvement in forecasted economic growth over the next few years.

Just the sort of thing that might come in handy if some of those other forecasts falter.

475,Empty,2019-02-22T23:55:23Z,"Recently, economists at banks and research firms have joined geographers in comparing the ratio of condo units to number of people or households in Vancouver and Toronto.","The NDP budget forecast a drop in housing starts by as much as 30 per cent across B.C. over the next three years, sparking debate about whether there are too many, or too few, condos being built in Vancouver’s expensive market.

Economists at major banks recently joined geographers in comparing Vancouver and Toronto when it comes to the ratio of condo units to number of households.

While population growth in Vancouver has been lagging that in Toronto, there are more newly completed but unoccupied condo units in Vancouver, according to Stephen Brown, a senior Canada economist at London-based Capital Economics. He found that at the end of last year, there were some 2,000 such units, compared to 1,500 at the beginning of 2018.

“By contrast, in Toronto, the number of (newly completed and unoccupied) units is just 500, despite the population being 2.5 times larger. … The supply situation will probably get much worse. There are currently 42,000 units under construction in Vancouver, compared to 71,000 in Toronto. Vancouver is therefore building 1.2 units for every person that arrived in Vancouver in the past year, compared to just 0.5 units in Toronto.”

In Toronto, Benjamin Tal, an economist at CIBC Capital Markets, agreed that population growth in Vancouver has lagged while “supply, mainly in the high-rise segment, has risen sharply. The number of completed and unabsorbed units in Vancouver is on the rise. In the third quarter (of 2018), the ratio of units under construction to household formation in Vancouver was elevated … while Toronto was still in line with long-term averages.”

At Vancouver-based Urban Analytics, managing principal Michael Ferreira, who tracks data about new multi-family projects, pegged the number of “completed and unsold units” in Vancouver at just 223 at the end of 2018, “which is nowhere close to being an oversupply situation.” Across Metro Vancouver, said Ferreira, “there are fewer than 1,000 unsold condominium units either under construction or completed and move-in ready.”

Other critics argue that estimates of oversupply don’t necessarily take into account the demolition of older units, which reduces the total supply.

As well, census numbers used in some studies do not count the number of temporary foreign workers and students moving into cities, said Anne McMullin, CEO and president of the Urban Development Institute (UDI), which represents developers. She also noted that investors rent out units that form an important secondary rental market.

“We also have to look at building for population growth for the next 10 years, not just now,” said SFU professor of real estate finance Andrey Pavlov.

LISTEN: Professor Andrey Pavlov and lawyer Wes Mussio join Housing Matters podcast host Stuart McNish to discuss the B.C. real estate speculation tax and vacancy tax.

Pavlov said the number of homes stuck in the permit approval process in the Lower Mainland was estimated to be 108,000 in 2017. He has been unable to get updated information from municipalities, but said clearing this backlog would greatly increase supply and potentially bring down prices.

The provincial Ministry of Finance said housing starts are at near-record highs, and noted the previous Liberal government projected 27,521 housing starts across the province in 2018, but the actual number was 48 per cent higher, totalling 40,857. The historical average is closer to 30,000 units, which is what the NDP budget is forecasting by 2021.

Andy Yan, director of SFU’s City Program, looked at all housing starts in Metro Vancouver, including co-ops, condos, rentals and homes, going back more than a decade, and found that after a plunge in 2009 (following the credit crisis), the number of housing starts steadily rose from around 15,000 to 20,000 between 2010 to 2015. The number spiked to almost 28,000 in 2016 and then started to fall to 26,200 in 2017 and again to 23,400 in 2018.

It is the opposite of what had been happening ahead of the peak, when several factors came together, said Yan. Now, “we are in an era of declining assessments. Interest rates are going up. Credit is harder to obtain, as is global capital.”

The Opposition party is also calling for an investigation by the province’s ethics commissioner into the governing New Democratic Party and AHS.

Standing behind a lectern and in front of signs that stated “Rachel Notley. Fighting For You,” the premier spoke at Lethbridge’s Chinook Regional Hospital on Saturday, flanked by nurses as well as Environment Minister Shannon Phillips.

The UCP called it a “partisan campaign event” that violated AHS rules surrounding the use of its public facilities.

“AHS facilities shall not be used for any political activity, including, but not limited to use for the purposes of canvassing, campaigning, making political announcements, touring and other activities,” AHS rules state.

“During an election campaign, political parties are not permitted to use AHS facilities as a backdrop or host location for any campaign event or activity.”

While the Alberta election looms this spring, an election has not yet been called.

Notley’s spokeswoman, Cheryl Oates, said in a statement that “not a single tax dollar went to this announcement.”

“The nurses who came to speak out about the dangers of Jason Kenney’s plan to privatize health care, came on their own time because this issue is important to them,” Oates said.

“We were not aware of the 2012 AHS memo outlining their policy on events like this. We understand the concern and will ensure future partisan events are not done at AHS facilities.”

Oates further noted on Twitter that “the event was done in a public area of the hospital.”

UCP House Leader Jason Nixon called use of the hospital “an unethical abuse of public resources.”

“Saturday’s NDP campaign event was not just a clear violation of AHS policy, but it also seems probable that the premier and her staff broke Government of Alberta rules that prohibit them from using their influence to host a partisan event in a public hospital,” Nixon said.

“I have written to Alberta’s ethics commissioner to ask for an immediate investigation into this event and I’m calling on Alberta Health Services and the premier’s office to explain this clear violation of AHS policy for the benefit of the Notley NDP.”

During the event, Notley spoke out against Kenney’s comments earlier in the week about allowing some private companies to carry out publicly funded health-care procedures, according to the CBC.

“Mr. Kenney wants to cut & privatize our health care system,” Notley said following the news conference in a tweet, which included photos from her appearance at the hospital.

“In Lethbridge, that would mean not hiring 203 nurses. Nurses who wouldn’t be there when you need them.”

Great to visit Chinook Regional Hospital today.

In a statement, AHS said its political activity policy, which came into effect in March 2012, “is designed to maintain AHS’ non-partisan role in healthcare delivery, and to protect our staff and patients.

“The policy outlines that during an election campaign, AHS sites should not be used as a backdrop or host location for any form of campaign event or activity,” AHS stated. “The event at Chinook Regional Hospital in Lethbridge was not organized by AHS and participants were not representing AHS.”

An AHS spokesperson did not provide comment when asked if any employees could potentially face repercussions for participating in the news conference.

Kenney took to Twitter to criticize Notley for holding the event at a public hospital.

“It is an unethical abuse of public resources for the NDP Leader to hold a partisan news conference in a public hospital, as she did today,” he wrote Saturday.

“Those are party, not government signs. This is explicitly prohibited by AHS policy. Stop campaigning at public expense. Call the election.”

According to AHS’ policy statement, the public health body “recognizes the personal right of AHS representatives to participate in political activities.”

“AHS representatives may publicly support or oppose any political activity, political party, candidate, or cause in a personal capacity provided they do not use AHS work time or resources . . . or do so while representing AHS,” the organization states.

The Code of Conduct for employees of the Premier’s Office and cabinet ministers states that staff “may not ask employees of the Alberta public service to engage in any activity that is inconsistent with the Code of Conduct and Ethics for the Public Service of Alberta or the Public Service Act.”

The Canadian Press





LETHBRIDGE, Alta. -- A spokeswoman for Alberta Premier Rachel Notley appeared to acknowledge the poor optics of a weekend appearance Notley made at a hospital, which the Opposition says broke rules prohibiting political activity at health facilities.

Cheryl Oates posted on Twitter on Sunday that while Saturday's event was in a public area of the Chinook Regional Hospital in Lethbridge, the premier's office will ensure future campaign events are not done at Alberta Health Services facilities.

A picture Notley posted on Twitter of the event showed her standing at a podium with the message ""Rachel Notley, fighting for you"" on it, with health-care workers standing behind her.

United Conservative House Leader Jason Nixon said in a news release that Notley's NDP government and AHS should be investigated by the province's ethics commissioner for what he called a ""partisan campaign event.""

AHS policy states that elected officials may access their facilities for the purpose of carrying out their duties, provided they don't engage in political activity.

The health agency tweeted Sunday that the Notley event was not organized by AHS, and that participants were not representing the agency.

It started with a brief back-and-forth between Ford and opposition leader Andrea Horwath during yesterday's question period in the legislature.

""The premier has announced an attack on post-secondary students that includes higher student debt, scrapping grants and attacks on student organizations,"" said the NDP politician. ""Will the premier put a halt on this, reverse the decision and support, rather than attack students?""

Ford answered by mentioning that his government is lowering tuition fees for the first time in Ontario's history, at which point the PC cabinet got up to give themselves a standing ovation.

""Not only that, we gave the students an option — do you believe this? — an actual option to opt out on [student union] fees,"" said Ford. ""For over a thousand dollars in some cases. Fees that they don't even want to be part of, a lot of them.""

The Premier began to say something about how much students at Carlton University could save, but was cut short as protesters in the gallery became too loud for the session to continue.

Speaker Ted Arnott called for order and warned the student protesters that they would be removed if they continued.

Despite this, they chanted things like ""No cuts, no fees, tuition should be free!"" and lobbed profanity-laden insults at Premier Ford.

They were ejected from Queen's Park after members of the group yelled such things as ""Doug Ford can kiss my a**"" and ""You're a f**king cracker.""

Ford made his thoughts on their behaviour clear in response to a follow-up question from Horwath after the clock had been restarted.

A Calgary justice says the B.C. government should have waited until the law was in force to file the constitutional challenge, saying the claim was both ""premature and inappropriate for consideration by the court.""

B.C. filed the statement of claim in Alberta's Court of Queen's Bench in May 2018, challenging the constitutionality of Alberta's Preserving Canada's Economic Prosperity Act.

The act, also known as Bill 12, gained royal assent on May 18, 2018, but has not yet come into force on proclamation.

It requires exporters to obtain licenses, and gives Alberta's energy minister the power to decide how much fuel is exported, how it's transported — by pipeline, rail or tanker truck — and whether direct shipments to be stopped altogether.

""The Government of Alberta introduced and supported the Act because it asserts British Columbia is responsible for ""delays"" to an expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline … Alberta seeks to utilize powers under the Act to punish British Columbia, and to exert pressure upon British Columbia,"" B.C.'s statement of claim reads.

B.C. said a significant percentage of the fuel it consumes comes from Alberta. It adds any disruption could cause irreparable harm, both to the economy and to health and safety in remote communities that depend on a reliable fuel supply.

B.C. could resubmit once bill is proclaimed

But Calgary Justice R.J. Hall, in a decision dated Friday, said the claim of B.C.'s attorney general was made too early as the bill hasn't actually been proclaimed yet.

""Should the Alberta government proclaim the act in force, the [Attorney General of B.C.] may recommence a claim,"" Hall wrote.

Alberta Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd said the government is pleased the challenge was struck down.

""This law remains available if necessary. In the meantime, we're encouraged by Friday's NEB decision and are taking decisive action to move more oil by rail until new pipelines are built … we call on the Government of BC to recognize our shared interest in moving our natural resources to new markets as we support their efforts to export LNG,"" she said.

The bill is just one of the province's weapons in its political battle over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which Alberta's NDP-led government has accused B.C.'s NDP-led government of blocking.

""Albertans, British Columbians and all Canadians should understand that if the path forward for the pipeline through B.C. is not settled soon, I am ready and prepared to turn off the taps,"" Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said when the bill passed last May.

On Friday, the National Energy Board reiterated its approval of the $7.4-billion pipeline with new recommendations to protect the environment in B.C.

B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman took to Twitter to reiterate B.C.'s concerns with the project.

This project is not in the best interests of the tens of thousands of people who depend on our coast for their livelihoods.<br><br>We're going to continue to assert our right to defend BC's env't in court & will continue to insist the federal gov't take BC's concerns seriously. —@GeorgeHeyman

The PCs have reported a total of $506,118 in political donations in 2019, according to current figures in the Elections Ontario database. By contrast, the New Democrats and Liberals combined have raised less than one-tenth that amount.

The NDP has reported $30,271 in donations from 222 donors.

Ontario Liberal Party: $20,081 from just 38 donors.

The Green Party of Ontario has raised $10,310 from 32 donors.

On Wednesday, the PCs will hold what they are calling the biggest fundraiser in the party's history: a $1,250-a-plate dinner at the Toronto Congress Centre.

""Doug Ford and our Ontario PC Caucus accomplished a great deal in 2018,"" says the invitation on the party's website.

""There is much more to achieve in 2019, and to continue getting things done for the people, we need your help to build up our Party's financial resources as quickly as possible.""

To be the biggest fundraiser in the party's history, the dinner would have to raise more than the record $2 million that Patrick Brown brought in during his Toronto leader's dinner in 2016.

Ford's party is trying to build on its fundraising momentum from the election year of 2018, during which the PCs amassed far more in donations than all the other parties combined.

The PCs raised $9.2 million in 2018, according to data compiled by CBC News from the Elections Ontario website, tallying donations at all levels: to the provincial party, to riding associations and to individual candidates.

Total donations to the NDP in 2018 amounted to $4.2 million, according to the Elections Ontario database. The Liberals reported $3.5 million in donations and the Green Party $1.05 million.

The PC party's 2018 fundraising total included $5.5 million logged as election-period donations and $3.7 million reported as annual contributions.

That's separate from another $2.4 million raised in 2018 by the four candidates in the PC party leadership race: Ford, Christine Elliott, Caroline Mulroney and Tanya Granic Allen.

The PCs have been the top fundraisers in each of the past three years, amassing a record $12.9 million in 2016 and collecting more than the Liberals and NDP combined in 2017

All parties are raising far less now than they did before 2017, when the Wynne government banned corporate and union donations.

A news conference for reaction to the decision was facilitated by advocacy group Stand.earth and included members of the Union of B.C.

'The gauntlet has been thrown down'

They said they were outraged by the decision and further motivated to fight the pipeline from ever being built.

""A complete dog's breakfast,"" said Phillip in describing the process that produced the NEB's latest report.

He called the report a flawed process and vowed that there would be further lawsuits involving the project.

""The gauntlet has been thrown down,"" he said.

Prime Minister push

Berman said the decision supporting expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline ""is the direct result of the Prime Minister's Office telling the board and federal bureaucrats to ""get to yes.""

She said in a news release that scientific evidence filed with the board shows there is not enough data to ensure the safety of salmon runs or endangered orcas.

Berman says the board also failed to address the climate impacts of the Trans Mountain expansion, which will increase the number of oil tankers in the port of Vancouver from about five per month to at least 34.

Despite Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's argument that the pipeline is in the best interests of Canada, Berman vows Trans Mountain ""is not in the public interest and will never be built.""

The NEB said the project would cause ""significant adverse environmental effects"" on the southern resident killer whale population, and while a worst-case spill from the pipeline or an oil tanker is not likely, ""the environmental effects would be significant.""

It said though that the project and its risks are justified in light of the benefits of the pipeline.

The ""Don't Steal #OURsubway Day of Action"" was organized by the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113 — which represents some 11,500 TTC workers — along with the union-connected transit advocacy group TTCriders and the Toronto Labour Council.

Participants handed out flyers to subway riders in an effort to raise awareness about the impending upload, while ATU Local 113 members wore T-shirts over their uniforms that read ""Don't Steal Our Subway"" while on the job.

""Ripping the TTC Subway from the rest of our public transit system will create havoc for riders, add unnecessary bureaucracy to our system and take local control away from city transit planning,"" said Carlos Santos, president of the union.

Last year, the Progressive Conservative provincial government announced that it intends to take over ownership of Toronto's subway network. The province would control construction of subway infrastructure and maintenance, while the city would keep revenue generated by the subway system.

Transportation Minister Jeff Yurek has argued the upload would allow for a more efficient expansion of the existing network. Earlier this month, the province and city have reached ""terms of reference"" for negotiations for the upload.

The plan is bitterly opposed by some transit riders, city councillors and the provincial NDP. They argue that the city needs to maintain its control over subways to ensure that it has a say in future development of transit and other infrastructure around subway stations.

Protesters carried an effigy of Ontario Premier Doug Ford outside Queen's Park station. (CBC)

The problem is not that the city owns the subways, critics argue, but that the TTC has been chronically underfunded since the mid-1990s, when former premier Mike Harris's government cut provincial subsidies for the service.

Yurek responded to Friday's protest on social media, calling it ""NDP fearmongering.""

""A subway upload will get new transit lines built faster,"" he wrote on Twitter.

For its part, TTCriders says the upload will result in higher fares, poorer service and generally more ""chaos"" during peak hours.

""There's going to be a loss of accountability if the transit system doesn't stay integrated and in Toronto's hands. Why would an MPP in Parry Sound or Kenora care about investing in our system the way that we need?"" said Pizey-Allen.

Push for public awareness campaign

Toronto councillors Josh Matlow and Joe Cressy intend to introduce a motion next week that would see the city launch a public information campaign ""regarding the importance of retaining control of Toronto's subways.""

The campaign would include ads on TTC vehicles and in stations, as well as a series of public consultations to help residents better understand the consequences of transferring control of the city's subways to the province.

""Torontonians should also know that with Toronto's subway, the province would gain control of lucrative air rights above stations and adjacent properties, owned and paid for by Torontonians,"" reads the motion, titled ""Save Our Subway: Ensuring Torontonians Know the Facts.""

Matlow has also posted an online petition calling for the TTC's subways to remain under the city's ownership.

“This (deal) is a catastrophic mistake by the NDP,” Kenney told a news conference Wednesday, one day after Premier Rachel Notley announced the province will lease 4,400 railcars to get more oil to foreign markets while the government works to increase pipeline capacity.

Notley called the United Conservative leader’s plan irresponsible and arrogant.

Kenney said he will be contacting Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway to urge them not to invest too much in the agreement given that it could be shelved if his United Conservatives win the vote.

An election can be called any time now and by law must be concluded no later than the last day of May.

“If elected, a United Conservative government will do everything within our power to cancel the NDP’s reckless $4-billion expenditure of borrowed tax dollars to interfere in the market,” said Kenney.

He suggested that oil companies would ship more oil by rail if it were profitable and called the NDP’s plan “corporate welfare.”

Kenney also said Alberta can’t afford the deal right now, given its multibillion-dollar deficits and a debt projected to reach $96 billion by 2024.

Notley, who was in Grande Prairie, Alta., for a methanol plant announcement, responded via a video on social media in which she accused Kenney of being an opportunistic flip-flopper.

“A few weeks ago, he supported our government’s plan to move more crude by rail. But today, now, he’s suggesting he’s going to call up CP and CN and somehow try to scuttle the deal,” she said.

“I have to say I am shocked by how irresponsible of him this is. And I honestly expected more from someone putting forth their name to lead the province.”

Notley has said the rail plan will net $2.2 billion for taxpayers, because the increased traffic is expected to boost commercial, royalty, and tax revenue by $5.9 billion.

“It is a sensible, practical and profitable plan that is part of our job to stand up for Albertans,” the premier said in the video. “I am surprised that Mr. Kenney would choose to score political points over standing up for Albertans.

“I’m also surprised that he has demonstrated such an unprecedented level of arrogance. Let me say this: whoever earns the privilege of leading this province in the future will do so after the votes are counted, not before.”

Extra oil shipments by rail are to begin this summer and increase to an estimated 120,000 barrels per day by 2020.

Of the 4,440 cars, more than three-quarters are to be new and the rest retrofitted.

The province initially believed it would need 7,000 cars, but says it was able to lower that number because it found better routes to market.

The region’s mayors have been advocating for funding for HandyDART, the door-to-door shared-ride service for people with disabilities, and a break on transit fares for people with low incomes and youths.

“We would have liked to have seen those programs included in this year’s budget,” said New Westminster Mayor Jonathan Coté, who chairs the Mayors’ Council on Regional Transportation.

For the past couple of years, both the council and TransLink, the regional transportation authority, have argued that the provincial government should help pay for HandyDART.

TransLink has invested money in expanding HandyDART service as part of its 10-year regional transportation plan, and made some changes following a review to improve the quality of service.

However, Coté said the majority of HandyDART trips are related to health services, such as dialysis or specialist appointments, and seeing some investment from the Ministry of Health would make sense.

“We think there is an argument to be made that there should be better support through the provincial government, just like the provincial government mainly funds those services throughout other parts of the province,” he said.

“That’s been a longstanding issue that the Mayors’ Council and TransLink have advocated for better support there.”

The budget did include some extra money for transit — and HandyDART — improvements, but for communities outside Metro Vancouver. It adds $21 million over three years for B.C. Transit to expand bus services in 30 urban and rural communities and make improvements to help seniors and people with disabilities.

We also discuss the CleanBC plan, BC Green leader Andrew Weaver’s budget response and the BC Liberals struggling to define themselves within the budget debate.

Beth McKellar, co-chair of the HandyDART Riders Alliance called the lack of specific funding for HandyDART in Metro Vancouver “very, very disappointing” because the service is in demand.

“There are people who want to sign up for HandyDART every day because they need it,” she said.

Coté said he hopes increasing demand for HandyDART service will prompt more serious conversations with the province about a long-term, sustainable funding model so that TransLink can continue to provide the service.

Providing discounted transit passes for people with low incomes and free transit for youths under the age of 18 has been discussed around the Mayors’ Council table, Coté said, and such initiatives have been adopted in other major cities.

“I think the Mayors’ Council is very interested in the idea, but it’s something we strongly feel would be most appropriately funded through a provincial poverty reduction strategy,” Coté said.

Such a strategy was outlined in the budget, but details about the specific programs therein were not released. It’s expected that the public will hear more in the coming weeks.

Related

Viveca Ellis, campaign organizer for #AllOnBoard, has been lobbying for a regional plan and provincial funding for making transit affordable and accessible for all people in the region.

“In the budget documents and the information that we have right now, we didn’t see anything specifically related to transit affordability and accessibility to transit for low-income people in the TransLink service region or any other region,” Ellis said.

“We’re looking forward to the release of the poverty reduction plan and seeing what will be addressed there in terms of affordable transit.”

Coté said the Mayors’ Council will move forward by formalizing their position on reducing transit fees for low-income earners and youths this spring.

“We do expect continued discussions on that regard there and hopefully future inclusion in budgets in coming years,” he said.

The budget did follow through on promised funding for major transportation infrastructure projects, including the Broadway subway line, for which $1.12 billion has been allocated over the next three years. The total cost of that project is $2.83 billion.

All 203 of B.C.’s recognized First Nations are eligible for a share, though to collect they need to sign up with the First Nations Gaming Revenue Sharing Limited Partnership, scheduled to be up and running this April.

The partnership, wholly owned and controlled by First Nations, will distribute the money under guidelines laid down by the three major First Nations organizations in the province through their gaming commission.

Eligible uses for the funds are six-fold: Health and wellness. Infrastructure, safety, transportation and housing. Economic and business development. Education, language, culture and training. Community development and environmental protection. Capacity-building, fiscal management and governance.

The rules also preclude direct distribution of any of the money to individuals.

Recipient First Nations are required to report annually to the partnership with an audited financial statement on how the money was spent in their communities.

LISTEN: This week on the In The House podcast, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the 2019 provincial budget. Did the B.C. NDP present a prudent plan or did government miss a key opportunity to fulfill its agenda?

First Nations have been lobbying for a share of provincial gambling revenues for 20 years as a way of providing socioeconomic benefits to their communities.

The breakthrough contribution is calculated at seven per cent of gambling revenue, currently running at about $1.4 billion a year. The first instalment is front-end loaded to cover two years’ worth of funding. The funding formula laid down by the First Nations Gaming Commission provides for a three-way split on the global amount, currently estimated at $100 million a year.

Half, in the range of $50 million, will be reserved for each First Nation, or about $250,000 apiece.

A further 40 per cent, about $40 million, is to be distributed on the basis of population. There being about 150,000 Indigenous people in B.C., it works out to $265 or so per capita.

The remaining $10 million will be evenly split among several dozen communities that are recognized as especially needy because they’re geographically remote. The annual payout is expected to fall between $250,000 and $2 million, depending on how the various factors in the formula work out.

For those First Nations that fail to join the partnership straightaway for whatever reason, their designated share will be banked for three years before being distributed to the active partners.

The same will apply where funding is being withheld from a given First Nation because of failure to comply with accountability requirements.

The New Democrats have assured First Nations this will be all new money.

There will be no reduction in pre-existing funding agreements such as last year’s $550-million commitment to build 1,750 units of housing for Indigenous people on and off-reserve.

Nor does the seven-per-cent commitment to First Nations mean any change in the long-standing allocation of 31 per cent of gambling revenues to a special health account, or the dollars ticketed for community grants and local governments.

Any money left over will continue to go into general revenues, to pay for other programs.

The commitment to the revenue-sharing partnership flowed from the summit meeting last fall between Premier John Horgan and his cabinet and First Nations leaders.

That was also where the New Democrats promised to make B.C. the first province in Canada with legislation harmonizing its laws and policies with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

According to the terms of the agreement, the B.C. bill is supposed to be “not dissimilar” to an equivalent piece of federal legislation, currently before the Senate.

The federal measure originated three years ago as a private member’s bill from Romeo Saganash, an NDP MP from Quebec.

But after gaining endorsement from the federal Liberal government, which initially dragged its feet on UNDRIP legislation, the Saganash bill passed through the House of Commons last spring.

Bill C-262 obliges the national government, in consultation with Indigenous peoples, to “take all measures necessary to ensure that the laws of Canada are consistent with UNDRIP.”

It further dictates that “the government of Canada must, in consultation and co-operation with Indigenous peoples, develop and implement a national plan to achieve the objectives of UNDRIP.”

Those ambitions notwithstanding, the federal bill provides what looks to be a leisurely time frame for implementation.

The federal minister for Indigenous and northern affairs is given 20 years to update parliament annually on fulfilment of the aforementioned two objectives.

It is unclear whether the “not dissimilar” provincial legislation will provide that much leeway in B.C.

The NDP government bill, currently in the drafting stage, is supposed to be “in place,” meaning enacted into law, no later than the fall session of the provincial legislature.

UNDRIP consists of 46 separate articles, the most controversial of which guarantees “free, prior and informed consent” to First Nations over land use and resource development within their traditional territories.

The budgeted estimated cost for the new St. Paul’s hospital is $1.915 billion, not $1.8 billion as I wrongly had it earlier this week.

As well some, though not all, of the cost of the project is included in the projected provincial borrowing for the next three years as is some, though not all, of the estimated $10.7 billion cost of completing Site C.

489,Empty,2019-02-19T23:45:24Z,The B.C. Ministry of Health will spend about $21 billion in the 2019/20 fiscal year and $21.5 billion in 2021/22.,"While health expenditures have risen every year for decades, Finance Minister Carole James said Tuesday the NDP government is determined to make up for “years of cuts” and “underfunding” by the previous Liberal government.

The B.C. Ministry of Health will spend about $21 billion in the 2019/20 fiscal year, $21.5 billion in 2020/21 and $22.1 billion in 2021/22. The 2018/2019 budget was $19.8 billion. Those figures don’t include the $10 million allocated to the Ministry of Mental Health and Additions in each of the next three fiscal periods.

It’s expected that federal transfer payments averaging about $5.5 billion in each of the next three years will help fund the spending which includes billions on new and upgraded hospitals over the next few years, including St. Paul’s Hospital in Vancouver and Royal Columbian in New Westminster. The government expects to spend $4.4 billion over three years on major hospital construction and upgrades, equipment and health information systems.

St. Paul’s hospital is projected to be completed by 2026 and will ultimately cost $1.9 billion.

Several hospital construction and upgrade projects are behind schedule, according to budget documents. Among them is work at Surrey Memorial Hospital, Royal Inland Hospital in Kamloops and B.C. Children’s and Women’s Hospital.

MENTAL HEALTH

James said the government has allocated $74 million over three years for a better-coordinated child and youth mental health system in which families can “ask once to get help fast.” The new approach will help “ease the worries of countless parents” who don’t know where to turn, she said.

It is described in budget documents as a program to fund prevention and early intervention for children and young adults trying to cope with mental health and addictions problems. Specialized teams of educators, counsellors, mental health experts, substance use experts and others will provide services in one-stop shop facilities, online programs and others.

OVERDOSE CRISIS

James said the government would spend another $30 million on the fentanyl overdose crisis, bringing the total spent since 2017 to $608 million. Across the province, there is a need for more paramedics in rural and remote areas as they have been on the front line of the crisis.

Budget documents say funding is going towards 21 overdose prevention sites and nine supervised consumption sites. Between July 2017 and June 2018, people used drugs 475,000 times at these sites. In that period, 3,000 individuals overdosed at the sites, but all were revived by staff. Another 1,700 drug users were successfully resuscitated around the province over the past year for a total of 4,700 overdose deaths averted.

Still, about 1,500 individuals died from overdoses on streets, residences or other places across the province in 2018.

PRIMARY CARE STRATEGY

James said the government is “hiring” 200 new family doctors, 200 nurse practitioners and 50 pharmacists, to provide “faster, better” care in “every corner of the province” at urgent care and primary health clinics. Five urgent care clinics have opened so far, including one in downtown Vancouver, and another five will open at undisclosed locations by the summer. James couldn’t say what the budget is for such clinics and staffing and Ministry of Health staff have not provided the figure either.

James seized the opportunity to slam the Liberals for their “doctor for everyone” campaign that flopped because there simply aren’t enough doctors to fulfil such a promise. The NDP scheme to hire 200 new primary care physicians is equally ambitious but James said the Liberal plan to find more family doctors “obviously didn’t work, so we’re taking a team approach.”

She was referring to the government’s oft-touted “primary care strategy” which envisions doctors, nurses and other health care providers working in teams at clinics, all under one roof. It remains more of an aspirational concept, as no specifics emerged Tuesday.

PHARMACARE

Pharmacare deductibles for 240,000 people with incomes under $45,000 have been eliminated, at a cost of $105 million over three years. The government is also spending $42 million to expand coverage for certain drugs so “people can access the medications they need,” including those for three common conditions — diabetes, asthma and hypertension.

The government is fulfilling its promise to eliminate Medical Services Plan premiums formerly charged to individuals and now paid by employers through a health tax. James said the MSP premium cut that began last year will be eliminated by the end of this year. At $2.7 billion, it is “one of the biggest middle-class tax cuts in B.C. history.”

By doing away with premiums, families will save as much as $1,800 a year. But employers are expected to make up the lost revenue through the payroll tax.

OTHER MEASURES

The government also announced an $89-million grant program for life sciences organizations to help them attract and retain researchers “and to support research, entrepreneurship and commercialization” of discoveries. The government expects the provincial share will help attract over $200 million in further funding from other sources.

The B.C. Care Providers Association applauded the $5 million earmarked for training workers, including health care assistants and specialty nurses. CEO Daniel Fontaine said care providers to seniors are especially feeling the effect of staff shortages in the North, the Interior and on Vancouver Island.

“When there are staff shortages, seniors that receive care at home or in a long-term care home or assisted living setting will not receive the services they need,” he said.

490,Empty,2019-02-22T17:28:00Z,"Much-awaited ruling is expected to bring strong reaction from Alberta and B.C. governments, still embroiled in a bitter legal battle — and the business community, oil sector workers, First Nations and environmental advocates.","The National Energy Board ruled Friday that the project can move ahead despite “significant” environmental effects because the project’s benefits are in the public interest.

CALGARY AND VANCOUVER—Advocates and opponents of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion stood their ground Friday as a renewed review of the contentious project recommended approving it.

The NEB also added 16 recommendations for the federal government, including measures to manage cumulative effects on the Salish Sea, offset underwater noise, prevent ships from striking marine mammals and fish, respond to oil spills, consult with an Indigenous advisory committee, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The recommendations aren’t legally binding, and Steedman said they are considered “important advice to government.”

If the project is to go ahead, it must comply with 156 conditions, the board said. The regulator found marine shipping traffic from the pipeline project would harm killer whales and Indigenous cultural uses related to the whales, as well as release “significant” greenhouse gas emissions.

Speaking in Calgary, the board’s chief environmental officer Robert Steedman said the expansion should be approved.

However, the board also said the risk “can be justified in the circumstances, in light of the considerable benefits,” as long as there are measures to minimize harm.

The NEB report is one of the factors the federal government will consider when deciding whether to move forward with the project.

The decision was being closely watched by industry, First Nations, oil sector workers and environmentalists — and it serves as a reminder of the bitter ongoing legal spat between Alberta and British Columbia. While Alberta Premier Rachel Notley welcomed the ruling as an “important step” toward resuming pipeline construction, B.C. Premier John Horgan said in a statement that he is still “convinced Trans Mountain is not in the best interests of British Columbians.”

The NEB’s much-anticipated ruling is the culmination of its rebooted review of the Trans Mountain expansion project. The federal government now owns and operates the project after purchasing it from Kinder Morgan in May 2018.

“We have to not let it be politicized. We have to make sure we get it right so when the project starts again, which I hope will happen, that it stays going and shovels stay in the ground.”

She said her NDP government will continue to pressure Ottawa to properly complete consultations with Indigenous groups.

But she said she is “cautiously optimistic” about the project’s future, calling the NEB’s conditions and recommendations “achievable,” and not something that will hold up construction.

In Alberta, the writ could drop for a provincial election any day, and Notley said she doesn’t expect to see Ottawa approve the pipeline before that campaign begins.

Friday’s NEB report comes just months before a federal election, when issues around Alberta’s oilsands, the environment and climate change and economic development will likely be at the fore as the Liberal government in Ottawa defends its record on one of its most controversial files.

In response, in September, the federal government instructed the NEB to reconsider its recommendation to approve the project. This time, it asked the board to examine the impacts of increased marine shipping traffic on the species at risk, including critically endangered southern resident orcas.

In August, a federal court overturned the expansion’s approval, saying the federal government’s attempts to consult First Nations were flawed and it had ignored the risks posed by oil tankers.

B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman also vowed that the government would “continue to assert our right to defend B.C.’s environment in court.”

The Alberta government, business groups and some First Nations leaders see the project as a major economic opportunity. Other First Nations, the B.C. government, environmental groups and the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby are concerned about its impact on the environment, and its infringement on the rights of Indigenous groups who haven’t consented.

United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney shot back that the NDP government hasn’t done enough to combat opponents to the pipeline, including the B.C. government and “their special-interest allies.”

“We should not celebrate this as some great victory. What we should do is ask ourselves, ‘How is it that we ended up in this situation?’”

However, Kenney also inaccurately claimed that the NEB added “16 more conditions ... that did not exist before” when, in fact, Friday’s NEB ruling removed one of the conditions issued in its previous report, and the 16 recommendations aren’t legally binding, meaning they do not technically have to be met for the project to continue.

The NEB report is one of the factors the federal government will consider when deciding whether to move forward with the project. Cabinet has 90 days to make the decision, but it’s possible that they will ask for an extension.

But Mount Royal University policy studies professor Duane Bratt said that decision is essentially a foregone conclusion.

“I can’t imagine how the government would not approve this given that they approved the previous NEB report that got quashed by the courts, and they own the pipeline,” he said.

“How do you reject a project that you own and that now has been approved by the regulator?”

Bratt said he expects to see further legal challenges to the project.

Tzeporah Berman, spokesperson for environmental non-profit Stand.earth, issued that message to the federal government Friday.

“If you rush a decision … ignoring Indigenous rights, climate and the threat to orcas, we will see you on the campaign trail this year, in the streets and in the courts,” she said.

Federal Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Friday that a decision on the pipeline will be made “once we are satisfied that the Crown has adequately fulfilled its duty to consult.”

The Trans Mountain expansion would involve building a second 1,000-kilometre pipeline from Sherwood Park, just outside of Edmonton, Alta., to Burnaby, B.C., following a similar route as an existing one that has been there since 1953. It would increase the pipeline’s capacity from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000 barrels per day.

According to the NEB, benefits of the pipeline include jobs created across Canada, “considerable revenues” for governments and more market access for Canadian oil.

The report also says the regulator considers response planning for an oil spill “adequate.” A large spill would cause major adverse effects, it adds, but “such an event is not likely.”

In an interview with the Star on Friday morning, federal Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, MP for Saanich-Gulf Islands in B.C., questioned why the NEB did not consider an economic report submitted by Unifor, a union that represents many workers in the oil sector, including the oilsands. That report alleged the project is exaggerating the number of jobs and economic benefits of the project.

“I will be demanding of cabinet and in the House (of Commons) how the NEB thinks the economic benefits — that they have never studied — outweigh the significant negative impacts they found,” May said. “They say it will be jobs all over Canada — find me a study that says that.”

Chief Judy Wilson, elected leader of Neskonlith First Nation near Chase, B.C., said the Federal Court of Appeal’s order that Ottawa redo consultations has not been satisfied. Simply speaking to elected leaders like her is not truly representative of the Indigenous community on a given territory, she said, and the Supreme Court has affirmed that.

The Trans Mountain pipeline runs through the larger Indigenous nation of Wilson’s people, the Secwepemc Nation. But the various elected band councils in the nation have seen some sign agreements with Trans Mountain, while others remain opposed.

“What I’m hearing from some of the others, who have signed, I feel they’re coming from a place under duress,” she said, speaking in Vancouver on Friday. “It will provide them some money to deal with the needs in their communities, but in our community the elders were very clear: It’s about the water, about protecting the Earth and the salmon, over any monetary decision.”

Reacting to Friday’s NEB ruling, Eugene Kung, a lawyer for Vancouver-based West Coast Environmental Law, questioned whether the federal regulator’s decision to recommend the project could truly be considered independent, given the federal government’s $4.5-billion purchase of the project.

“The process was a foregone conclusion from the start, from the rushed timeline, to the refusal to consider the economic and climate change case,” Kung told the Star in a phone interview.

The B.C. government is still before the courts with a reference case seeking a ruling on whether it has the right — as it says it does — under Canada’s Constitution to restrict what flows through the province. The Constitution does allow the federal government jurisdiction over interprovincial infrastructure, however, it also gives provinces the power to regulate for the environment.

That case has not yet been decided, and the B.C. NDP remains staunchly opposed to diluted bitumen flowing through the 66-year-old, 1,110-kilometre oil pipeline from Alberta.

“Before any cabinet decision is made, I would expect and hope this government make its business case public because it’s now the public’s money, and be transparent about how it’s being spent. That’s the opposite of what the NEB has done. The NEB has just created more distrust. It’s an industry-captured regulator.”

The NEB heard from 118 intervenors at a reconsideration hearing, including 52 Indigenous groups and individuals and eight federal government departments. Another 81 intervenors filed written evidence, the board said.

The board also held 25 individual sessions in Calgary, Victoria and Nanaimo for Indigenous intervenors to discuss their concerns orally.

More than 400 members cast a ballot in the contested nomination, which Woollard called a reflection of democracy. So far, most NDP incumbents have stood for nomination without facing opposition.

A handful of student protesters seated in the public gallery interrupted legislators by shouting chants of ""free tuition"" followed by profanity directed at the premier. Ford chastised the group and blamed the Opposition for influencing them.

""That's how they train our kids, with a filthy mouth,"" he said.

""They should have their mouths washed out with soap. That's what they should have, because that's embarrassing.""

The clash comes weeks after the Progressive Conservative government announced that it is ending free tuition for low-income students as it attempts to trim a $13.5-billion deficit. Critics say the move — which is being made in conjunction with a 10 per cent tuition fee cut — is harmful to those it purports to help.

The government has said grants under the Ontario Student Assistance Plan (OSAP) had become unsustainable and it was time to refocus the program to provide help to students in the most financial need.

Under the Liberal OSAP program, families earning up to $175,000 could qualify for some funding and that threshold is now reduced to $140,000. Low-income students could qualify for grants large enough to cover the full cost of tuition under the previous plan, but now a portion of the funding they receive will be a loan.

The government also plans to make some fees paid by Ontario college and university students optional instead of mandatory, including those to student governments. Critics have slammed that move as an attack on free speech on campuses.

Changes limit access to education, students say

Students rallying outside the legislature Tuesday said the changes will increase student debt and limit access to higher education for many.

""We the students will defend access to education against these attacks,"" said Nour Alideeb, chairwoman of the Canadian Federation of Students-Ontario. ""The government's plans to slash OSAP ... has devastated students and families across the country.""

The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario and the Ontario Public Sector Employees Union joined the students in their call for a rollback of the planned changes.

Training, Colleges and Universities Minister Merrilee Fullerton said she respects the students' right to protest on the grounds outside the building but criticized those who disrupted the legislative session earlier in the day.

""In the chamber, I think we need to demonstrate respect all different ways,"" she said. ""And make sure that people are heard and that they have an opportunity to protest outside if they wish but to maintain respect for the processes within the chamber.""

The protest comes a week after Ford accused student unions of getting up to ""crazy Marxist nonsense"" as he appealed for donations to his Progressive Conservative Party in a fundraising email.

495,Empty,2019-02-22T10:01:58Z,[SAnews.gov.za] The Department of Social Development has called on all unemployed social workers and auxiliary social workers to register on the department's database by 31 March 2019.,"The Department of Social Development has called on all unemployed social workers and auxiliary social workers to register on the department's database by 31 March 2019.

This, the department said in a statement, is to keep a record of unemployed qualified graduates in the two fields.

""This call serves as a response to the broader government goal of facilitating access to employment and economic opportunities for young people in the country.

""This will be a pool of all unemployed social work graduates who will be considered for employment opportunities, irrespective of the source of funding for their studies.

""The database will also help to inform the department about the number of unemployed social work graduates, who have studied outside the Social Development Scholarship Programme, thus enabling efficient planning and the inclusion of all social work graduates into the government recruitment system,"" said department spokesperson Lumka Oliphant.

Provincial Departments of Social Development were from 2013 unable to absorb social work graduates into the system due to a lack of funding. This led to the current backlog and an increase in the number of unemployed social workers and auxiliary social workers.

""Since implementation of the scholarship programme in 2007, provincial Departments of Social Development were able to absorb social work graduates. However, since 2013, provincial departments were unable to absorb social work graduates due to lack of funding and this led to the current backlog in the absorption of social work professionals,"" Oliphant said.

By the end January 2019, a total of 3 969 social work graduates, who benefited from the social work scholarship programme, were still unemployed.

""It should be noted that this figure excluded those who funded their studies through other loans, bursaries and other means, hence the call for registration in the database.

""Government, through the Department of Social Development, is aiming to develop an interdepartmental human resources planning and management strategy,"" said Oliphant.

The strategy is to be informed by the National Development Plan (NDP) vision, which encompasses the employment of social workers as part of 55 000 social service practitioners to be required in the country by the end of the year 2030.

Social workers and auxiliary social workers, who qualify and are interested in registering on the database, are encouraged to manually submit a correctly completed registration form to their respective provincial Department of Social Development offices. Electronic submissions will not be accepted.

There are clearly marked deposit boxes at district and service offices within various provinces.

Registration forms can be accessed from all official Department of Social Development online platforms including www.dsd.gov.za, Facebook Page @SocialDevelopmentZA and Twitter @The_DSD.

The database forms can be downloaded as follows:

- Unemployed Social Worker - FORM A

- Social Auxiliary Worker - FORM B

In order to improve the accuracy of the database, the Department of Social Development may integrate data from the database with that of the Department of Labour to determine the exact unemployment rate among unemployed qualified social workers and social auxiliary workers.",South Africa: Hope for Unemployed Social Workers,Allafrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201902220401.html
496,Empty,2019-02-25T16:15:46Z,Jennifer McKenzie has resigned as leader of the New Brunswick NDP a day after members voted for a leadership review.,"Jennifer McKenzie, who tried to move the New Brunswick NDP back to its socialist roots, has resigned as party leader, a day after members voted to hold a leadership convention before the end of August.

In a statement Monday, McKenzie said she was resigning ""effective immediately.""

""The NDP has by a vote this week determined that there will be a leadership convention within the next six months,"" she said. ""I have decided not to participate in such a leadership contest.""

McKenzie has been leader since August 2017 and led the party to a dismal showing in the provincial election last September, when the NDP won no seats.

On Sunday at Moncton's Darts Club, 95 delegates took part in the vote on whether to hold a leadership convention.

The vote was close, with 52 in favour and 43 against, said Danny Légère, who holds a labour seat on the NDP provincial council. He said the results of the 2018 election definitely affected the leadership review.

""At the end of the day, there are some who feel that leadership may be a factor in that,"" he said.

In a Monday afternoon scrum, McKenzie admitted she was surprised by the result and said she's ""not part of that vision"" of where the party wants to go.

Despite the vote Sunday, McKenzie could have remained leader until a convention, when she could have run against other candidates to try to keep the post. But she chose to resign immediately and said she won't run again for the leadership.

In her statement, McKenzie said she was ""thankful,"" for the opportunity to be leader. Despite the disappointing results of the Sept. 24 election, she said she was glad that the party had a full slate of candidates and that more than 50 per cent of them were women.

McKenzie finished third in Saint John Harbour, the riding represented by the last NDP member of the legislature, Elizabeth Weir, who retired from politics in 2005.

In 2018, the NDP received more than 19,000 votes provincewide, a 60 per cent drop from 2014 and its worst result in a New Brunswick election in 44 years.

McKenzie campaigned on a return to the NDP's socialist beginnings, promising universal childcare, pay equity, home care, better nursing home ratios and pharmacare.

This was a shift from what former leader Dominic Cardy pushed for. He alienated some people by endorsing the Energy East pipeline and distancing himself from unions. He's now a minister in the Progressive Conservative government.

""I was the new kid on the block, and the party was renewing itself and going back to its socialist roots,"" McKenzie said ""That is something that's quite new and different. We haven't seen that for a long time in this province and it's going to take some time to sell.""

In 2018, the NDP received five per cent of the popular vote, down from 11 per cent when Cardy was leader.

The NDP appears to have missed the wave that propelled the two other alternative parties (the Green Party and People's Alliance) to greater success. The Greens had 11 per cent and the Alliance had 12 per cent of the popular vote last election, and each won three ridings.

McKenzie said people may have chosen Green over NDP because there has been confusion about what sets them apart.

""[The Greens] are not a socialist party, they're not a party to the left,"" she said. ""Because we haven't had a lot of socialism and socialist policy in this province, people did not understand the difference.""

4 leaders in 14 years

Since Weir resigned in 2005, the NDP has had four leaders, including McKenzie, who ran for the leadership unopposed.

No date has been set for the leadership convention, which has to be held in the next six months.

The vote was by secret ballot, Légère said, but some people did voice their disagreement with the results.

""Some felt that we shouldn't be changing leaders as often as we do. It wasn't good for the party, that we needed consistency. Some felt otherwise.""

Legislature is an opportunity to reopen discussion on MLA term limits, says Green Party leader Andrew Weaver.","The alleged spending scandal at the B.C. legislature is an opportunity to reopen discussion on MLA term limits, says Green Party leader Andrew Weaver.

Weaver introduced a private member's bill on Thursday that, if passed, would limit MLAs to three terms.

""We start to see issues emerge when people have been [in office] a long time, and we are seeing that play out right now in the B.C. Legislature,"" he told the host of CBC's On The Coast.

Weaver clarified that he was referring to the alleged misuse of taxpayers' money by senior legislature staff. He said problems are more likely to arise when long-time MLAs become complacent.

Time for 'rejuvenation'

Several prominent members of the legislature have been in office since the 1990s.

Former speaker Linda Reid has been a B.C. Liberal MLA since 1991. Former B.C. Liberal deputy premier Rich Coleman was first elected in 1996 and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth has only missed one term since he was first elected in 1991.

Weaver said term limits would allow a new generation of MLAs to come forward with new ideas and tools to shape public policy.

""We need to foster innovation, we need to foster new ideas and that doesn't happen unless there's a rejuvenation of the place,"" he said.

Liberal MLA says bill ill-conceived

The bill passed its first reading with every MLA in favour except one, B.C. Liberal Ralph Sultan, who was first elected in 2001.

Sultan said protocol dictates that many private member bills are voted through unanimously at the first round but he broke with etiquette in protest of what he called ""grandstanding,"" by Weaver.

Sultan called the bill ill-conceived and said good government needs a balance of rookies and old-timers.

""If you had a three-term limit the entire NDP front bench would be decimated, you'd have no Carole James, no John Horgan, no Adrian Dix and I say government would be much the poorer as a result, so experience does count for something.""

This is not the first time Weaver has raised the question of term limits; he brought a similar bill forward in 2017.

Weaver said the BC Liberals decided not to bring the bill for debate that year, but he hopes this year's bill will see the light of day again.

Importing prescription drugs from Canada has long been seen as an easy solution to skyrocketing drug prices for U.S. patients.

But now that President Donald Trump and Democrats are pushing to make those cross-border sales legal, Canadian health experts are issuing a dire warning: It could destroy Canada's drug market.

Story Continued Below

Attempting to fill the United States' needs with pharmaceuticals from its much smaller northern neighbor could sap supplies in Canada, creating shortages and driving up prices in a government-run health system that itself is struggling to make drugs affordable, opponents of the import proposals say. And the result, they say, would be little if any relief for high prices in the United States.

“The Canadian shelves would run dry,” said Steve Morgan, a Canadian health economist who has advised the government on pricing reform.

The drug industry has cited such concerns as justification for blocking importation by U.S. wholesalers, pharmacies and consumers. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration strongly discourages importing drugs even for personal use, saying it can't ensure they are safe.

But the idea is gaining momentum, as evidenced by five bills in Congress — including one promoted by presidential contender Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — while states like Vermont are barreling ahead with their own plans.

Sanders, a long-time champion of importation, has the most far-reaching plan, S. 97, which would allow wholesalers and licensed pharmacies to buy from FDA-approved counterparts in Canada. He argues that Canada’s fears are unfounded.

“For years the pharmaceutical industry has tried to scare Canadian officials into thinking that U.S. importers would drain the drug supply in Canada,” a Sanders spokesperson said. The bill attempts to head off such a scenario by barring drug companies from retaliating against Canadian pharmacies that sell medicines to U.S. buyers at lower Canadian prices. Identical language is in companion legislation by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who has launched drug pricing hearings this year as chairman of the House Oversight Committee.

GlaxoSmithKline and other big manufacturers have threatened such penalties in the past after internet pharmacies shipped cheaper medicines across the border. Some of those pharmacies scaled back after being forced to report shipment details while others struck deals with storefront pharmacies to avoid scrutiny.

But clamping down on drugmaker retaliation won't address all the possible consequences of widespread imports. Even if pharmaceutical companies don’t pull their stock, it’s far more likely that Canadian prices will jump with the boosted demand while U.S. prices remain largely unchanged, said former FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan, who is now director of the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy.

Even narrower proposals to allow American consumers to personally import drugs — such as S. 61 and H.R. 478 by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) — would have to overcome hurdles. Canadian pharmacists can’t accept American prescriptions, meaning patients would need to line up a Canadian doctor to co-sign their prescriptions — which is not an accepted practice up north, said Joelle Walker, director of public affairs for the Canadian Pharmacists Association.

“Even if the legislation did pass for Americans, it’s not going to be as simple as going through Canadian pharmacies,” Walker said. “And I assume it’s not inexpensive to get a Canadian physician to see you and sign a prescription.”

What the extra requirement could do is drive business to online pharmacies — a fast-growing market that both Canadian and American regulators have criticized as a potential conduit for counterfeit or ineffective medicines, as well as shipments of illicit prescription painkillers.

The Canadian government so far has held its fire, perhaps because none of the bills are likely to pass soon. It's instead focused on a variety of price-lowering initiatives, with a national election coming this fall. One such plan would change the formulas used to set domestic prices through the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, which has only partial power over the cost of medicines and can't dictate the cost of generic drugs or what wholesalers and pharmacies pay for products. Partly for this reason, Canadians pay more for drugs than Europeans in government-run systems.

Sanders' staff has discussed his plan with the Canadian embassy and consulted with experts on the country’s drug system. But Walker said it's hard to imagine Canadian lawmakers and regulators are pleased with such ideas. Besides the Canadian Pharmacists Association, which has come out against U.S. import proposals in the past, Canadian patient advocacy groups and providers would need to sign off. And on top of federal regulators in Ottawa, Canada has regional pharmacy boards — known as provincial colleges — that ultimately issue guidance and standards for pharmacists in the various provinces.

The bureaucratic and legal landscape isn't much friendlier in the United States. A federal judge already struck down Maine’s attempt at letting citizens buy their own drugs across the border. Vermont’s similar plan, passed last year but yet to take effect, has to pass muster with the Department of Health and Human Services, where Secretary Alex Azar has frequently criticized even limited personal imports as potentially undermining strong U.S. safety standards.

Even when HHS announced a working group last year to explore importing certain drugs, Azar and FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stressed its narrow goals — saying the group would explore bringing in a medication only when it had a single U.S. manufacturer and evidence existed of supply problems or price gouging.

It comes down to FDA's limited capacity to oversee imports, said former commissioner McClellan.

“It’s an issue that has come up over and over again — FDA’s inability to ensure the safety and effectiveness of a[n imported] drug,” he said. Even doing that in narrow circumstances would require scaling up the agency’s resources and gaining access to each step of the supply chain.

Morgan said U.S. policymakers should be focused on fixing the broader health system instead of buying drugs from Canada.

“Why bother to import medicines from the country with the second-highest prices in the world? That is Canada. We’re second only to the United States in drug prices,” Morgan said.

There’s no question that Americans are paying too much for drugs, says Amir Attaran, a health-law specialist at the University of Ottawa who’s closely watching U.S. lawmakers’ efforts. “But ... tapping out your neighbor is a nasty, rotten thing to do.”",Canadian shelves ‘would run dry’ if U.S. imports drugs,Politico,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/21/canada-prescription-drugs-1188578

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian government will unveil its budget for the 2019/20 fiscal year on March 19 and outline ways to provide more access to prescription drugs, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said on Wednesday, confirming a report from Reuters.

The budget is the last before a federal election in October. Polls suggest the ruling Liberals could have trouble winning a second consecutive parliamentary majority.

""We're going to talk about our twin goals of ensuring that our pharmaceutical system is both appropriate in terms of its costs and that we find a way for better coverage for all Canadians,"" Morneau told reporters.

Reuters reported on Jan. 31 that the budget would propose a limited expansion to the universal healthcare system in the budget to cover part of the cost of prescription drugs. Although Canada has a publicly funded health care system, prescription medication is largely covered by private insurance and public plans that are geared primarily toward the old and the very poor.

""We have a system that doesn't provide all Canadians with access,"" Morneau said.

The Liberals came to power in late 2015 promising to run modest budget deficits to help fund investments in the economy. The party now declines to say when the budget will be balanced.

Last October the government forecast the 2018-19 deficit at C$18.1 billion ($13.76 billion), smaller than the revised C$18.8 billion in the February 2018 budget.

""We believe it's very important for us to continue to be fiscally responsible and that will be demonstrated in our budget,"" Morneau said.

When pressed about the continuing deficits, Liberals say that a more important indicator is the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is forecast to continue dropping gradually.

Billed by PC Ontario Fund chair Tony Miele as “the biggest fundraiser in our party’s history,” Wednesday’s event at the Toronto Congress Centre on Dixon Rd. could bring in more than $2 million.

But the tightened rules around political fundraising introduced by the Liberals in 2016 following a Star investigation — including a ban on corporate and union donations — have made it challenging to sell tickets. While companies could once purchase entire tables for such dinners and then distribute them to employees, associates or clients, each ticket must now be paid for by an individual, which has put pressure on those tasked with selling. In an email appeal to clients obtained by the Star, Chris Benedetti, a principal at Sussex Strategy Group, a prominent firm run by Conservative and Liberal lobbyists, said the company “has been asked to help with the event.”

“The event is $12,500 for a table of 10 ($1,250/person). To reserve a table please let us know and we can assist you in assembling individual registrations to then be sent in as a package,” Benedetti, who did not return messages seeking comment, said in his missive. Sources say senior aides to Ford have been personally shaking the trees — after office hours — encouraging lobbying firms to be “team players” and sell tickets to the premier’s keynote speech. According to one lobbyist, political parties of all stripes have been helped with fundraisings. The use of lobbyists to help politicians raise money, when they in turn often seek help from politicians, could be perceived as troubling. According to the integrity commissioner, who regulates lobbyists at Queen’s Park, “lobbying occurs when an individual or group is paid to communicate with a public office holder in an attempt to influence” public policy. Benedetti — an influential consultant registered to lobby for 60 different companies at Queen’s Park, including the Canadian Nuclear Association, Aecon, Enwave, and NextBridge — said he was contacted by the PC Ontario Fund last month.

“I have not spoken to anyone in the premier’s office about this event, and no one in the office or any other government office has been in touch with me to encourage sales or otherwise,” the lobbyist said. “When fundraising events are advertised that might be of interest to our clients, Sussex has provided notice of such along with their description. We do this for a variety of events, including conference, industry consultations, and other notable occasions that are of interest to our clients and contacts,” he said.

“Our role as volunteers is simply to help ensure that the most up-to-date information gets out to individuals with a prospective interest in attending. Sussex receives no compensation or benefit from this voluntary participation.” One veteran Tory, who has already bought a ticket, said his phone has been ringing off the hook with different consultants trying to unload tickets. “I’ve had friends from three lobbying firms call in the last day or two trying to get me to buy more. I told them I’m maxed out,” said the insider, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of incurring the wrath of Ford’s office. Another lobbyist, who asked not to be identified because his firm is also selling PC tickets, said consultants have always assisted political parties with their fundraisers regardless of who is power. “We’ve done it for the Liberals; we do it for the Conservatives,” he said, noting consultants also volunteer their time on all of the major parties’ campaigns during elections. “This is how it works.” Marcus Mattinson, director of communications for the party, emphasized there is nothing untoward about lobbyists selling tickets. “In order to achieve successful events, the … fund has always relied upon long-time party activists, supporters, and others to assist in these efforts and sell tickets,” said Mattinson. “Dozens of individuals have been assisting the party with fundraising for decades, and this event is no exception,” he said. Ford’s office agreed there is no quid pro quo for those lobbyists pounding the pavement to raise money for the Tories. “Premier Doug Ford takes his cues from the people and governs for the people,” said press secretary Simon Jefferies. “He is the most accessible politician in the country, and will listen to any Ontarian who wants to bring forward a suggestion or offer feedback,” said Jefferies, stressing Ford does not just attend dinners for well-heeled backers. “Doug Ford has been hosting spaghetti dinner fundraisers across Ontario at a cost of $25 per person,” he said. “These events have been massive successes, and provide an opportunity for grassroots party supporters to help the party prepare for the next election.” Robert Benzie is the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

502,Empty,2019-02-19T17:40:01Z,"Calling the existing law a “disaster,” Sylvia Jones, Ontario’s minister of community safety and correctional services, on Tuesday announced a series of changes to police oversight.","The move comes less than a year after the previous Liberal government passed Bill 175 — a massive overhaul of policing that strengthened police oversight — and will “restore respect for police,” community safety minister Sylvia Jones said at a news conference in Oakville.

After vowing to “fix” policing laws in the province, Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservative government proposed new legislation Tuesday that would limit the mandate of the police watchdog, impose time-limits on its probes and roll back efforts to promote independent investigations into public complaints about officers.

“On first reading, its bark may be worse than its bite. It is more a rebranding than a total gut of the Liberal legislation,” said Kent Roach, a University of Toronto law professor and policing expert.

While critics decried a weakening of police accountability — former Attorney General Michael Bryant said the proposed legislation would “gut” police oversight — others noted the new legislation still draws heavily from the omnibus Liberal police laws, despite the PC “rhetoric.”

“Make no mistake, the Liberals’ Bill 175 was, quite frankly, the most anti-police legislation in Canadian history. It was a disaster,” Jones said, before later introducing the 350-page legislation at Queen’s Park, dubbed the Comprehensive Ontario Police Services Act.

“This has become SIU’s practice since the Tulloch report, and in my opinion, this is important to help promote transparency of investigations to the public,” said Kate Puddister, a University of Guelph assistant professor who focuses on police accountability.

The proposed legislation still acts on some of the key recommendations made by Ontario Court of Appeal judge Michael Tulloch in a recent sweeping review of police oversight, many of which were already present in Bill 175. That includes that Ontario’s police watchdog, the Special Investigations Unit, automatically be called in every time a police officer fires their gun at a person, as well as enshrining into law the expectation that the SIU director release detailed reports on investigations when no charges are laid.

Citing lengthy investigations that “waste time and energy,” Attorney General Caroline Mulroney announced lowered expectations around SIU notification — an issue that has long been contentious between police services and the watchdog.

The new legislation proposes changes to both the SIU — which probes deaths, serious injuries and allegations of sexual assault — and to Ontario’s police complaints watchdog, the Office of the Independent Police Review Director.

Currently, police services are expected to over-notify, meaning they call in the SIU when it’s reasonable their mandate could be invoked, including deaths and serious injuries incurred in the presence of police, such as a heart attack or a suicide. This means the SIU, not the police service, makes the decision on whether to launch an investigation.

Mulroney said the proposed new legislation would remove the expectation that the SIU be called in for deaths such as a suicide, unless the police chief “reasonably believes” that an officer’s conduct may have been a contributing factor in the incident.

Notification of the SIU would still be mandatory in cases of death or serious injury caused by police use of force, incurred in detention, or as the result of a car chase, as well as for allegations of sexual assault.

Mulroney also said the proposed law would put a 120-day time limit on the watchdog’s probes, with the expectation that the SIU provide justification if it couldn’t wrap up probes in time.

Ian Scott, a former SIU director, said in an interview Tuesday that he worries about sending the message that police don’t have to call in the watchdog — “if they think they don’t have to call, they won’t,” he said.

“Clearly, the way they’ve worded it, will give the discretion to the police to decide when to call the SIU, and that in my view is not desirable,” Scott said, adding that police should ideally subscribe to the thinking of “if in doubt, call.”

According to the SIU’s most recent annual report, in 2017 the watchdog closed 367 cases, with the average number of each investigation taking 167 days. In 2016, when there were 296 cases, the average length of each probe was 111 days.

There are, however, some cases that stretch out for months, including the investigation into the death of Danforth shooter Faisal Hussain, who killed two and injured 13 others in July’s mass shooting. Hussain exchanged gunfire with two Toronto police officers but died by suicide; the SIU investigation lasted six months.

Jeff McGuire, the executive director of the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police, said the time limits would shorten the “unfathomable” length of time for SIU investigations.

“The trauma and victimization that officers underwent for responding to 911 calls and trying to do what was right was not fair,” he said.

Monica Hudon, spokesperson for the SIU, said the watchdog “will abide by whatever legislation is in place, as we have always done.” Asked whether additional resources will be required to meet the 120-day time limit, Hudon said it was too early to speculate.

The proposed new police laws would also make changes to the OIPRD, the police complaints body, which would become the Law Enforcement Complaints Agency. Part of its mandate would be to then assign the investigation of the complaints back to a police service — possibly the employer of the officer the complaint relates to — or an agency investigator.

That’s a departure from the police complaints system created under the previous Bill 175, which had required that the province’s police complaint watchdog become fully independent within five years. That meant it would no longer refer any complaints back to the police service where the complaint originated.

Liberal MPP Nathalie Des Rosiers (Ottawa-Vanier), a lawyer and former law dean at the University of Ottawa, said she was concerned with the change to the complaint mechanism.

“It is concerning to me that this office is being folded into a new body. We need to ensure that a robust complaint mechanism is maintained in Ontario, so that if an individual feels their interaction with a police officer wasn’t acceptable, they can have confidence that that type of behaviour doesn’t happen again.”

Roach said that although the complaints agency won’t investigate all complaints it can still decide what complaints to investigate and consider appeals.

“This is not the type of gutting of police complaints that was done by the Harris government despite the rhetoric of the Ford government’s announcement,” Roach said.

Another change proposed in the new law is a lowering of the penalties imposed on officers who fail to co-operate with SIU investigations, setting the fines at $5,000 for a first offence and $10,000 for a subsequent offence. Bill 175 had set the fines at $25,000 for a first offence, $50,000 for the second.

Puddister said that for many, the proposed legislation “will not go nearly far enough,” noting that it has, for example, removed the ability for the SIU to lay criminal charges outside of its mandate, a feature that had been in the Liberals’ Bill 175.

“Many believe that SIU’s exclusive criminal law mandate is both too narrow and the bar for substantiating a criminal charge is too high,” she said.

In a statement, Police Association of Ontario said it welcomed the announcement, saying front-line personnel are “are optimistic that this act will restore fairness and respect for professional policing in the province, make oversight more effective, and improve governance, training, and transparency for the profession.”

About two-thirds of the money is meant for programs that serve people who are currently homeless. The other third is for renovations and improvements to existing units that house Indigenous families in urban areas. Maracle said the biggest housing challenge for Indigenous people is affordability and that the focus on homelessness in the funding ignores the real root of the problem, especially since half of the Indigenous population in Canada lives in urban centres, according to the latest census data, where housing is often expensive. Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos and Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O’Regan announced the funding Wednesday at the Canadian Museum of History’s great hall, lined with totem poles on one side and vast windows with a view of Parliament Hill on the other.

The dollar amount received criticism from Jeff Morrison, the executive director at the Canadian Housing and Renewal Association. “When you consider the announcement today of $638 million, it’s really just a small fraction of a $40-billion announcement,” said Morrison. “I think it’s safe to say it’s insufficient.”

Both Maracle and Morrison said they hope Wednesday’s announcement is just a beginning and that more money will be funnelled toward Indigenous housing. Duclos said close collaboration with Indigenous communities across the country will be a big driver in where and how the money is spent. As a result, the government isn’t yet certain exactly where the money will go or how quickly it will be spent. “I know nothing is more critical than investing in stable and secure housing,” said O’Regan. Not having homes can make it difficult for Indigenous people living in urban areas to “reach their full potential,” he said.",Liberals promise $638 million for urban Indigenous housing,Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/02/20/liberals-promise-638-million-for-urban-indigenous-housing.html

506,Empty,2019-02-19T18:37:43Z,"SNC-Lavalin’s arguments found an open audience, and its language in favour of remediation agreements was echoed widely The post SNC-Lavalin’s allies in its push to avoid prosecution appeared first on Macleans.ca.","“Serious cases of corporate economic crime should be dealt with severely,” wrote SNC-Lavalin in October 2017. “However, it is unfair that the actions of one or more rogue employees should tarnish a company’s reputation, as well as jeopardize its future success and its employees’ livelihoods.”

So reads the opening line of SNC-Lavalin’s submission to a federal consultation on deferred prosecution agreements, a remediation tool the Liberals eventually snuck into an omnibus budget bill last year that allows companies to settle charges instead of fighting them in court.

As deferred prosecution wound its way through the policymaking process, from the earliest exploratory stages to the language of the law itself, SNC fought hard for the law—and it appeared to have some powerful allies on its side.

In 2015, the company funded a small portion of a roundtable report published by the Institute for Research in Public Policy, a Montreal-based think tank that cautiously supported deferred prosecution agreements after consulting legal and academic stakeholders.*

As Paul Wells lays out in detail, SNC-Lavalin then actively and openly sought the adoption of a made-in-Canada deferred prosecution law for several years. The company took out big ads in newspapers and lobbied anyone in Ottawa who would listen (including 28 meetings on “justice and law enforcement” between September 2017, when the DPA consultation started, and the end of 2018). SNC made its case to the public, and openly published its answers to 13 questions posed by the feds in the consultation that led to the law.

The thrust of SNC’s argument was that several comparable countries have already established deferred prosecution regimes—and that puts Canadian companies at a “competitive disadvantage” globally. “Investors may be reluctant to expose themselves to an uncertain enforcement regime in Canada, resulting in additional legal risks. Canadian companies have already lost significant contracts abroad because global competitors have been able to impugn the integrity of the firm, despite comprehensive remediation actions, while corruption charges are pending.”

SNC further argued that DPAs could “encourage self-reporting by companies,” result in “improved enforcement outcomes,” “improve compliance and corporate culture,” and “avoid undue negative consequences for stakeholders, including employees, investors and other third parties who had no involvement in the crime.”

SNC also offered arguments against a regime, which the company knocked down as having “no merit,” including that such a regime “could weaken the deterrent effect of prosecution;” and that DPAs could offer a “perception that companies could ‘buy their way out of trouble.’ ”

SNC wasn’t alone in using that language. A separate submission to the federal consultation from the Canadian Bar Association sticks to the same rationale, occasionally using identical wording (in bold).

On the role of the public prosecutor in initiating a deferred prosecution agreement, SNC said: “To maintain and uphold independence, the offer to enter into DPA discussions should be at the discretion of the public prosecutor. However, sole discretion should not just rest with the public prosecutor. There should be an administrative process by which an organization can proactively submit a DPA or settlement proposal without prejudice to any future proceeding, or to the independence of the public prosecutor.”

On the same question, the CBA wrote: “To maintain and uphold independence, the offer to enter into DPA discussions should be at the discretion of the prosecutor. However, an organization should also be able to proactively submit a DPA proposal without prejudice to any future proceeding or to the independence of the prosecutor.”

On the question of addressing non-compliance with a DPA, SNC said: “If there are repeated examples of non-compliance, beyond the organization’s control, the organization should have the opportunity to address the non-compliance and to renegotiate the terms of the DPA with the public prosecutor.”

On the same question, the CBA wrote: “The prosecutor should give the organization an opportunity to address allegations of noncompliance. If repeated incidents are beyond the organization’s control, it may be useful to renegotiate some terms of the DPA.”

Asked about the similarities, the CBA said its submission was independently conceived and subject to a “rigorous process” that gains wide internal approval. “The CBA does not coordinate or collaborate in the drafting of private submissions,” reads a statement provided to Maclean’s. “CBA effectiveness in law reform is based equally on its reputation for objectivity and independence, its professional expertise, and its national voice.” SNC-Lavalin didn’t respond to a request for comment.

There is one link between SNC and the CBA: Amee Sandhu, a regional integrity head and sector integrity officer at SNC-Lavalin, helped write the CBA’s submission as a member of the organization’s anti-corruption team.

The government’s post-mortem report on the consultation, which served as the basis for the government’s Criminal Code amendments, received 45 submissions on deferred prosecutions—nearly half of which were from businesses. (The feds didn’t post submissions online, but SNC and the CBA did.) The post-mortem neatly fits SNC-Lavalin and the CBA’s arguments for and against deferred prosecution into its rundown on “advantages” and “disadvantages.” First, the advantages (SNC’s language appears in bold):

“The majority of participants thought that a DPA regime would encourage self-reporting, promote accountability, foster a compliance culture and enhance public confidence in addressing corporate wrongdoing. A DPA regime is also viewed as a means to improve enforcement outcomes and could increase justice system efficiencies by avoiding protracted criminal trials…”

“Several participants noted that DPAs provide greater flexibility for prosecutors to structure tailored resolutions in appropriate cases, while reducing the negative consequences of a company’s conviction for innocent third parties, such as employees.”

Second, the disadvantages:

“There was a sense among some participants that instituting a DPA regime could give companies a false sense of security as they might consider that they would not be at risk of prosecution, but could, rather, ‘buy their way’ out of trouble through the payment of financial penalties rather than being held accountable by a court of law. If this were to be the case, it could weaken the deterrent effect of the criminal law on corporations and ultimately undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system.”

SNC’s view of DPAs popped up again in the Library of Parliament’s legislative summary of Bill C-74, the legislation in which deferred prosecution was buried deeply. The parliamentary staffers cited three of SNC’s four arguments in favour (more self-reporting, improved compliance culture, avoiding negative consequences for stakeholders).

That language even ended up in the bill itself. Section 715.‍31, which explains the rationale for remediation agreements, includes those same three arguments.

By the time Bill C-74 had reached the Senate in May 2018, the business lobby stood up for deferred prosecution. Witnesses on May 30 included the Business Council of Canada and the Conseil du patronat du Québec, both of which count SNC as a member, and Transparency International Canada, which cautiously supported DPAs in a paper published in 2017 and claimed credit for the new regime in its next annual report. (Mark Morrison, who testified on behalf of Transparency International Canada, had moderated a 2017 panel featuring SNC’s Sandhu on “good practices in implementing an effective anticorruption compliance program.”)

No witnesses critical of deferred prosecutions testified at the Senate. Three weeks later, the bill became law.

TODAY:

As a special four-day summit on abuse prevention in the Catholic Church opens in Rome this morning, the scope of the crisis might best be described as both huge and hazy.

The bar is set very high for the Pope's first global summit on protecting youth from abuse in the Catholic Church, and officials have been trying to temper expectations.

A central question as the SNC-Lavalin affair unfolds is what Jody Wilson-Raybould aims to accomplish.

Missed The National last night? Watch it here.

Murky numbers

How big is the problem of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church?

No one but the Vatican knows.

Last summer, Pope Francis wrote an unprecedented letter to the world's 1.2 billion Catholics apologizing for the church's abandonment of ""the little ones,"" and asking for the laity's help in ""uprooting this culture of death.""

But as a special four-day summit on abuse prevention opens in Rome this morning, the scope of the crisis might best be described as both huge and hazy.

National churches have been taking their own approach to accusations of abuse that often stretch back decades.

In the United States, there has been a sudden burst of transparency, with 96 of the country's 178 dioceses releasing lists of ""credibly accused"" priests and other church employees over the past six months, some 2,600 names in all.

The past week alone saw the Diocese of Oakland, Calif., release a list identifying 45 accused priests, Catholic brothers and deacons, dating back to 1962. While church leaders in Brooklyn, N.Y., made 108 names public, albeit most of them belonging to now-deceased priests. And in Virginia, the Diocese of Richmond disclosed the names of 42 accused clergy — all either dead or no longer active within the church.

This, however, appears to be the tip of the iceberg.

In the spring of 2017, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops reported that it counted 6,721 clerics who had been ""credibly"" or ""not implausibly"" accused of child sex abuse since 1950. The website BishopAccountability.org, which tracks abuse allegations, notes that its database contains just under 3,900 names, meaning that more 40 per cent of the U.S. accused remain unknown to the public.

(To date, the amount of money paid out in settlements to U.S. victims is in excess of $4 billion, with new cases being filed on an almost daily basis.)

(Luigi Navarra/Associated Press)

The situation is even murkier in other nations.

Canadian dioceses have yet to follow the lead of their American counterparts and release comprehensive lists. But Sylvia's Site, a blog dedicated to cataloguing known cases of abuse via news reports and court records, lists 373 Canadian clergy.

Putting a dollar figure to all those cases is difficult, but the amount must be staggering. In the fall of 2017, CBC News counted 56 sexual abuse lawsuits against Catholic diocese before the courts in New Brunswick, seeking tens of millions in compensation. And last summer, it came to light that church authorities in London, Ont., had paid out $15 million in mostly secret payments to 50 victims of 12 priests.

BishopAccountability.org has a database of accused priests and brothers in the Republic of Ireland that contains 93 names, well short of the 1,500 or more who have been reported to authorities there since 1975.

The site also maintains lists for the Pope's home country of Argentina — 70 names — and 122 accused clergy in Chile.

The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the church tribunal that handles abuse cases, says that it has received 3,420 ""credible"" allegations against priests worldwide over the past decade — enough to overwhelm the system.

Meanwhile, many large Catholic nations like France, Italy and Mexico have disclosed next to no data about the abuse allegations they have received.

And several of the bishops in attendance at the Pope's Rome summit have downplayed the extent of the problem in their homelands. For example, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, who was among the first speakers this morning, has spoken out against the idea of zero tolerance, saying that some past offenders have ""turned out to be very good priests.""

This meeting in Rome isn't supposed to forge a consensus, let alone a comprehensive abuse policy, it is simply being billed as a step in a long process.

Much work remains to be done, even by Pope Francis.

In December 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission into Canada's residential schools recommended that the Pope formally apologize for the Catholic Church's role in running 72 per cent of the institutions.

More than three years later, survivors are still waiting.

""I am sure that he has in his heart the ... suffering of these people,"" Canada's Cardinal Marc Ouellet told the CBC yesterday. ""That would be also my hope, that one day he could come. It's up to him.""

Tempering expectations

The bar is set very high for the Pope's first global summit on protecting youth from abuse in the Catholic Church, writes reporter Thomas Daigle in Rome.

The gaggle of several dozen reporters and photographers near St. Peter's Square, trying to push forward to get closer to the front of the crowd, was the first sign of an over-hyped event.

The pack was waiting for sexual abuse victims to exit a meeting they had hoped to have with the pontiff. But Francis never showed up.

And that could be a sign of disappointment to come.

By the Pope's own recent admission, ""the problem of abuse will continue"" after this highly anticipated conference involving nearly 200 senior Catholic clerics and officials.

The Meeting on the Protection of Minors — as it's officially called — got underway today and runs until Sunday. And those involved are tamping down expectations.

Anyone hoping Catholic bishops will ""change the world"" during this summit will be disappointed, said Father Federico Lombardi, a former papal spokesman who is acting as the event's moderator.

He told me the expectation should rather be for ""many new ideas and concrete models"" for protecting minors to emerge.

So much for the hopes of victims of clerical abuse. Our recent trip to Verona, 500 kilometres north of the Vatican, highlighted the deep and painful scars that remain for survivors of abuse, even decades later. And it showed how for some, expectations for the summit go far beyond what will likely happen.

Clergymen at Verona's Antonio Provolo Institute — a Catholic-run school for deaf boys — sexually and physical abused at least dozens of students between the 1950s and 1980s. One man told me that when he was 6, a priest started sodomizing him every night.

Ahead of the Pope’s unprecedented global summit on preventing abuse of minors in the Catholic Church, The National speaks to survivors taking their heartbreaking stories straight to the Vatican. 5:21

A group of Provolo victims and supporters is headed to Rome to demand compensation for the horrific abuse they endured. Their spokesman, Marco Lodi Rizzini, said giving them money ""is the only thing"" the Church can do for the survivors.

The next few days will show what the Pope and his cohort are willing to do to stop the abuse.

At Issue

A central question as the SNC-Lavalin affair unfolds is what Jody Wilson-Raybould aims to accomplish, writes The National co-host Rosemary Barton.

We are in our second week of double At Issues. And, I will be honest, we briefly considered another one on Tuesday.

The SNC-Lavalin affair is that kind of story. We could foreseeably try to analyze what is happening every day, and whether it is big news or incremental changes.

So where are we with this story?

We have allegations, two resignations, and frankly little clarity about what actually happened.

What I find even more perplexing, though, is the end game for one of the main players, Jody Wilson-Raybould.

I mean, it's obvious what the Prime Minister wants: to contain allegations he maintains are false.

But for Wilson-Raybould it seems more bewildering.

This week she sought to speak directly to cabinet colleagues. She also talked to her caucus colleagues. She continues to seek legal counsel on what she can divulge.

And then there is her line from yesterday, that she wants to ""speak her truth.""

The question, then: can she ""speak her truth"" and still be a Liberal MP?

Does she want to damage the government? Or does she simply want to defend her reputation, her sense of what is right and wrong and ethical?

Chantal Hébert makes a suggestion in her column this morning about how the resignation of Gerald Butts from his job as Principal Secretary to Prime Minister may go some way to helping resolve the crisis. ""His departure could pave the way for Wilson-Raybould to become part of the solution to the government's problem rather than the source of an ever-expanding river of troubles.""

Clearly we all have lots of questions.

Until we hear from Wilson-Raybould, which could happen as early as next week, we may not have any real answers.

For now, we will work with what we have. Andrew Coyne, Chantal and Shachi Kurl join us tonight on At Issue.

See you all then.

Feb. 21, 1984: Life in Syria under Hafez al-Assad

Thirty-five years ago Syria was a power-broker, not a basket-case. Its sickly dictator Hafez al-Assad inspired enough fear and fidelity that crowds would carry his Cadillac limo through the streets of Damascus. And bigwigs like Donald Rumsfeld and Geoffrey Howe, the British foreign secretary, came calling looking for solutions to Lebanon's troubles. The Journal's Ann Medina captures what now pass for the good old days.

Unlike other online firestorms, this one wasn’t squarely about a policy or politician. On Tuesday, Esquire magazine posted the first in what its editors described as a series about “growing up in America today” this one a profile of a white 17-year-old boy, from the Wisconsin town of West Bend. The actual profile is a perfectly reasonable character study, but the cover and display copy—“What it’s like to grow up white, middle class and male in the era of social media, school shootings, toxic masculinity, #MeToo and a divided country”—inspired an impassioned backlash, with critics arguing that it put another unnecessary, even dangerous spotlight on “white people,” giving even more attention to the thoughts, feelings, biases, and struggles of the dominant majority.

The story undeniably did that. “West Bend is a blue-collar town with a strong German heritage in a county where Donald Trump won 67 percent of the vote. ‘If you’re a moderate Republican in West Bend, you’re a liberal,’ Joe Carlson, a former school-board president, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2011. It’s also overwhelmingly white,” wrote the author of the Esquire article, Jen Percy. Her subject, Ryan, is described as supporting:

The death penalty, and limits on foreign goods. He doesn’t support welfare, unless those who receive it are made to get a job. He doesn’t support needle exchanges. On issues of gender, Ryan is mixed. He doesn’t think abortion should be legal. He doesn’t support condom distribution in high schools to prevent pregnancy. If a man and a woman earning the same salary have a child, and if one of them must quit their job to raise it, Ryan thinks it should be the woman. But he supports marriage equality and the right to enlist in the military regardless of sexual orientation.

Ryan also offers lukewarm support for President Trump, a position that one commentator suggested, “he doesn’t appear to grasp as being aligned with a vast array of troubling ideologies many Americans consider direct threats to their way of life.”

That locution, “a direct threat to a way of life,” struck me, since it could easily be used to describe traditionally white communities which I’ve studied. But it is fundamentally mistaken. The politics of national populism are not, as critics claim, simply and only cloaks for fascistic voters and governments’ pursuing policies of racial discrimination—though some obviously are. But other iterations of this are instead natural expressions of community—a perfectly uncontroversial idea that was indeed once conventional wisdom. Those of us interested in moving beyond flame-throwing—and into a useful conversation about how to create meaningful and effective public policy that benefits the most people—would do well to return to it.

***

“The distinctiveness of cultures and groups depends upon closure,” wrote Michael Walzer, in his magisterial Spheres of Justice (1983). “If this distinctiveness is a value, as most people … seem to believe, then closure must be permitted somewhere.” From a different angle, the Marxist philosopher, Gerald Cohen, in his essay “Rescuing Conservatism: A Defense of Existing Value,” adds that conservatism is primarily about valuing how things are in the present and seeking to preserve this particularity. This orientation encompasses causes dear to the left, such as the conservation of nature, species, architecture, and folk traditions, as well as enthusiasms of the right such as the preservation of national character and ways of life. The tension between these contradictory impulses is captured by the British writer James Meek who notes the dilemma of his fellow left cosmopolitans who value local particularity among the working-class cockneys of the East End of London, but not the locals’ anti-immigration and Brexit orientation.

Social psychology further reinforces the insights of communitarian political philosophy with experimental evidence that people’s deep values are between a third and a half inherited. Jonathan Haidt recounts a study involving dots moving on a screen where conservatives prefer when the dots move in orderly patterns while liberals favor a more chaotic arrangement. These differing value orientations are partly captured by the Big 5 personality trait of openness to experience, which is a significant predictor of immigration attitudes and voting for Brexit in two major data sets I have analyzed.

Two overlapping value orientations underpin the new cultural axis of politics: One is what social psychologist Karen Stenner describes as authoritarianism—a preference for order over difference; the other is status quo conservatism, which the political philosopher Cohen characterized as a preference for maintaining things as they are. This is what anchors the divide between nationalists and globalists, between people attached to ascribed ethnic and national identities, and those who identify with their portable credentials and achievements. Insofar as this crucial divide stems from psychology, it is highly resistant to social learning. Indeed, as Stenner showed, trying to convince someone who prefers order to embrace diversity tends to produce a backlash. In practical terms, countries seeking to maintain social harmony in periods of flux could avoid emphasizing change and, instead, appeal to the conservatism of these voters by highlighting what remains the same. In my own work, I find that emphasizing the cultural continuity of the nation through the assimilation of newcomers tends to reduce support for hard-line anti-immigration positions among those who voted for the populist UK Independence Party (UKIP).

There are two key aspects of the new culture war. First, conservative and order-seeking voters respond differently to diversity than liberals. For instance, U.K. data shows that, at a local level, ethnic diversity lowers conservatives’ trust in neighbors and attachment to locality but leaves that of liberals unaffected. In Europe, voters who value safety tend to vote for populists more than those who aren’t concerned about it, but only in more diverse countries like France or the Netherlands. Similarly, Tim Gravelle finds that if you begin on the Canadian border and move south to the Mexican border where county Hispanic share is higher, the partisan gap between white voters over whether to deport illegal immigrants or offer them a path to citizenship widens by 50 points. In effect, diversity affects people differently. Second, as conservatives express their discontent with diversity and change, liberals mobilize against them in the name of anti-racist morality. This second-order polarization is most evident in the United States, where white liberals have, since 2014, grown more suspicious of white people as a group, more likely to view the United States as sexist and racist, and increasingly favorable to higher immigration. In Western Europe, disaffected cosmopolitan voters have been switching from mainstream parties to the pro-immigration Greens.

The partisan divide over whether majority-group interests are racist is stark. When I ask Americans whether a white woman who wants less immigration to help maintain her group’s share of the population is being racist or “acting in her racial self-interest, which is not racist,” 36-39 percent of Americans, depending on the survey, respond that this is racist and 61-64 percent say it isn’t. In most West European countries, 20-25 percent claim this is racist against 75-80 percent who say it’s an expression of white group interest, which isn’t racist. Let’s zoom in on the partisan gap: 91 percent of white Clinton voters with postgraduate degrees think the woman is racist, compared with just 6 percent of white Trump voters (and zero white British Leave voters) without a degree. In the middle stand ethnic minorities: 43 percent of nonwhite Americans believe the white woman in this example to be racist compared with 57 percent who say she isn’t.

The difference turns on whether attachment to being white, and being willing to act in the majority interest, is racist. Yet psychologists have clearly established that an attachment to one’s own group is not correlated with hostility to an out-group unless the protagonists are locked in direct political competition or war. Indeed, whites’ warmth toward blacks in the American National Election Study (ANES) is uncorrelated with their feelings toward whites. On the other hand, liberals’ feelings toward conservatives, and vice versa, show a strong inverse correlation, reflecting what Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff term a “common enemy” form of identity. Many white liberals acknowledge that identities are not zero sum: Just 18 percent of white Clinton voters in my sample consider a Latino who wants more immigration from Latin America to “boost her group’s share” to be racist. Yet when a white person who is also attached to her group acts defensively to restrict immigration to achieve the same ends, she is deemed racist by nearly three-quarters of the same people.

Of course there is a crucial historical context that accounts for some of this disparity in opinion toward expressions of white political self-interest as compared with the collective organizing of minority ethnic groups. White majoritarian rule has not only been the historical norm in American politics; it is also directly tied to the enforcement of racial hierarchies in American life and the disenfranchisement of nonwhite ethnic groups. And yet, the historical grounds for exceptionalizing white identity has not simply lost its political valence after more than a half century of civil rights reforms—it has become increasingly counterproductive, inflaming interethnic division and conflict and contributing to racial Balkanization in America and elsewhere. Most of us wouldn’t insist on muting the Catholic identity of certain Americans due to Catholicism’s historic association with anti-Semitism, or argue that anti-Catholicism is in the DNA of American Protestantism. Countries should extend the same latitude to white majority groups that have learned from past mistakes. Surely the dangers of continuing to suppress this identity outweigh the risks of permitting it to be moderately expressed.

When people of any racial background try to slow the rate of ethnic change in their home nation, they do so because it is, in Cohen’s phraseology, an existing value for them. Many would agree that if Harlem were to become just another superdiverse New York neighborhood, it will have lost its African-American “ethno-tradition”—part of what constitutes its identity. Yet to ban certain groups from moving to Harlem, based on their ethnic identity, would be a form of illegal discrimination. Between these two poles there is a third choice: to govern the pace of gentrification and thus mitigate the impact of its attendant dislocations. It is neither desirable nor possible to stop change entirely, but the pace can be regulated, newcomers assimilated, old traditions preserved and new ones adapted.

Here again, we find different ethical yardsticks used to measure majority and minority groups, despite the lack of a consistent principle justifying this distinction. As Yael Tamir remarks in her 1993 book Liberal Nationalism, “If national claims rest on theoretically sound and morally justified grounds, one cannot restrict their application: They apply equally to all nations, regardless of their power, their wealth, their history of suffering, or even the injustices they have inflicted on others in the past.” Indeed, groups which have confronted their own past misdeeds may be less likely to re-offend or develop a “common enemy” version of ethnicity than majority groups elsewhere. Systematic studies of genocide show that the greatest danger lies not in groups embracing a majority identity (i.e., being Hindu in India), but rather in exclusionary ethnic nationalism (i.e., only Hindus can be Indian citizens, not Muslims). Moreover, the latter, though deplorable, is not more dangerous than exclusivist versions of universalist ideologies like socialism, or civic nationalism. When pushed to an extreme, all can be used to target out-groups.

Perhaps talk of a country’s ethnic composition as an aspect of nationhood that conservatives are attached to—and therefore wish to conserve through slowing immigration or encouraging assimilation—sends a signal to newer groups that they are not wanted? No more than calling a set of accents “American” excludes American citizens who speak with a French or Nigerian twang. People generally understand that a person’s accent is not a criterion for national membership or special treatment, even as the American accent serves as a distinguishing feature of the nation. If, like the ethnic majority, it declines in prevalence, this may legitimately worry conservatives who are attached to features of their nation. Tagging these concerns “exclusive” presents a classic example of the fallacy of composition: analogizing from collective to individual properties.

The mischaracterization of people’s attachment to a majority ethnicity or demographic status quo as racist hostility is a powerful source of resentment in many Western societies. More broadly, opposition to political correctness is a major predictor of the Trump vote. Ashley Jardina, author of the important new book White Identity Politics, finds that in experiments where Trump’s policies are labeled “racist,” support for him rises among voters who are skeptical of the view that structural impediments explain the black-white income gap.

In survey data, the new cultural divide is far more strongly associated with populist right voting than is the left-right economic axis. Trump and Brexit voters earn roughly the same as others, and are no more hostile to politicians or the system than backers of left-wing parties. But they differ widely in cultural and psychological orientation. We see this in the ANES, which reveals a shift of economically moderate voters who want less immigration from Obama to Trump between 2012 and 2016.

Since there is a taboo on majority-group ethnicity and ethno-traditional nationalism, these sentiments are expressed in sublimated form. Ostensibly “civic” national laws like language and residency requirements for spousal migration are designed to limit immigration—and such limits are justified on the grounds of state interests.

The desire to reduce the speed of ethnic change gets rationalized as the need to control immigration for material reasons. This could be to halt the flow of drugs and terrorists (Trump), to reduce pressure on the welfare state or housing, safeguard jobs (Bannon), protect secularism, gays or Jews from Islam (Le Pen and Wilders) or to reassert British sovereignty against Brussels (Farage). These rationalizations matter, but are secondary drivers. No wonder a far higher share of Trump voters agree that “immigrants fuelling urban sprawl” is a problem than “urban sprawl” itself. Brexit voters are moderately worried about “pressure on public services” but greatly concerned about “immigrants putting pressure on public services.” Denying services to needy immigrants, stigmatizing Muslims or bashing the European Union is deemed more acceptable than making the conservative case for slower ethnocultural change.

White majorities will gradually become “beige,” in Michael Lind’s terms, because intermarriage produces a logarithmic rise in the mixed population. In America and Western Europe, those of mixed race will become the majority in a century or so. However, it’s important that on the way there, people are able to travel at a pace that allows moderate conservatives to maintain a sense of continuity while enough change takes place to satisfy moderate liberals. Failure to do so risks alienating conservatives, perpetuating the populism and polarization that are convulsing western politics.

Why would he resign if he hasn’t done anything wrong? Unless of course he is trying to take the hit in order to protect someone more important. What is it the Liberals so badly want us not to know about? I expect the media to keep digging until they find out since parliament obviously won’t.

This case emphasizes the importance of a free press. In repressive societies, none of this would have come to public attention. The SNC-Lavalin matter reminds me of Watergate. The media is cutting though layer after layer of deceit and obfuscation and will in the end be able to reveal the truth. I don’t think it is going to be pretty and I have begun to suspect that it may cause the government to fall.

Green projects were rip off

So U.S. President Donald Trump wants $8 billion US to build a wall? That’s about a $32 for every man, woman and child in the U.S. but at least they end up with something. That compare that to the $16 billion in spending forced on B.C. Hydro by the previous Campbell provincial government trying to look green. That equals more than $3,000 for every British Columbian with nothing to show for it.

No electrical utility on their own would ever dream of connecting dinky run-of-the-river plants with zero firm capacity to their grids. Remember the other green initiatives the Liberals promoted: the Hydrogen Highway and the carbon tax that was going to save the planet but is just a cash grab.

Rest assured that whatever they did, someone was making money out of it.

Stop U.S. coal shipments

Thank you to James Kerr for educating me with his Feb. 16 op-ed regarding coal shipments through Westshore Terminals at Roberts Bank. Until reading this article, I was unaware that the Pacific U.S. states had banned such shipments.

The Canadian and B.C. governments should follow their lead and put a stop to our doing the dirty work to benefit the U.S. coal industry.

Don’t cloud the issue

The situation with former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould should be viewed without invoking her Indigenous heritage.

To my mind, she was appointed because she was qualified for the job. Her actions on the most part have born this out. If she had resigned when she was demoted she would have my full marks but still she acted honourably.

Let us not invoke the native issue. Let us keep to the simple facts and determine if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or his office exerted illegal pressure on her to support SNC-Lavalin remediation. Native chiefs trying to turn the issue into one of discrimination or somehow a retraction of conciliation is clouding the issue.

Don’t call Begbie a ‘hanging judge’

John Mackie’s Feb. 16 article about a trial in Victoria in 1889 unfortunately referred to Sir Matthew Begbie, the first Chief Justice of B.C., as the “famous ‘hanging judge.’”

Begbie was one of the province’s leading citizens in the mid- to late-19th centuries, responsible more than anyone for bringing justice to a sometimes turbulent frontier through enormous personal effort. He also filled a role similar to that of attorney general from 1858 to 1871 in creating B.C.’s first colonial laws.

The false imputation that Begbie was a “hanging judge” arose after his death, for unknown reasons. In a 19th Century judicial career of more than 40 years, he undoubtedly sentenced people to death. But there is no evidence that he did so any more often than other judges, that he took any pleasure in that duty, or that he took part in carrying out any such sentence.

As your newspaper has reported, there is much to show that Begbie was by the standards of his time a man of progressive views and quite sympathetic to First Nations people. In future, delete references to him as a ‘hanging judge.’

“One of the fundamental responsibilities of any government is to look for good jobs, to defend jobs and to make sure that our economy is growing in ways that give a real and fair chance to everyone,” Trudeau told reporters in St John’s, Newfoundland when asked about his conversations with then Justice Minister July Wilson-Raybould.

Trudeau’s remarks were among the most detailed yet to explain an affair that is harming his Liberal government ahead of an October election.

Trudeau denies a Feb. 7 report in the Globe and Mail that officials exerted undue pressure last year on Wilson-Raybould to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials and to pay a fine instead.

SNC-Lavalin is a big employer in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up seats to have any chance of winning a majority in the election.

After Canada’s director of public prosecutions ruled on Sept. 4 that the trial should proceed, Trudeau and senior officials raised the matter three times with Wilson-Raybould, who had the power to overturn the decision.

The company, which says the executives accused of wrongdoing have left and that it has overhauled ethics and compliance systems, says a trial could be devastating and has gone to court to try to overturn the ruling.

Wilson-Raybould, who quit last month after being demoted to veterans affairs minister in January, has said nothing. She is due to address the House of Commons justice committee next week.

Opposition politicians accuse the government of mounting a cover-up and are demanding a public inquiry.

Michael Wernick, the head of Canada’s non-partisan civil service, on Thursday said he had contacted Wilson-Raybould on Dec. 19 to discuss fears over what might happen in a trial but denied he had exerted any inappropriate pressure.

“(I) was conveying the context that there were a lot of people worried about what would happen, the consequences, not for her, but the consequences for the workers and the communities and the suppliers,” he told the justice committee.",Canada PM says concern over job losses at heart of SNC-Lavalin affair,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-politics-snc-lavalin-idUSKCN1QB20G
512,Empty,2019-02-21T00:18:29Z,A chronology of events in the SNC-Lavalin controversy.,"A chronology of events in the SNC-Lavalin controversy:

Feb. 19, 2015 — The RCMP lays corruption and fraud charges against Montreal-based engineering and construction firm SNC-Lavalin, over allegations it used bribery to get government business in Libya. SNC-Lavalin says the charges are without merit and stem from ""alleged reprehensible deeds by former employees who left the company long ago."" A conviction would bar the company from bidding on Canadian government business, potentially devastating it.

Oct. 19 — The Liberals win a federal election, taking power from the Conservatives. Two weeks later, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau names Jody Wilson-Raybould minister of justice and attorney general of Canada. She is the first Indigenous person to hold the post, which combines duties as a politician (heading the Department of Justice) and a legal official (overseeing prosecutions).

March 27, 2018 — The Liberals table a budget bill that includes a change to the Criminal Code allowing ""remediation agreements,"" plea-bargain-like deals between prosecutors and accused corporations in which they can avoid criminal proceedings by making reparations for previous bad behaviour. SNC-Lavalin had lobbied for such a provision in Canadian law.

Spring — Although the bill has yet to pass, SNC-Lavalin contacts Public Prosecution Service lawyers to ensure they have all relevant information for a possible invitation to negotiate a remediation agreement. During the next three months, in response to requests from prosecutors, SNC-Lavalin provides detailed information it sees as making a strong case for an agreement.

Sept. 4 — The prosecution service tells SNC-Lavalin in writing it will not invite the firm to negotiate a remediation agreement.

Sept. 17 — Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould discuss the SNC-Lavalin file. As attorney general, Wilson-Raybould could overrule the prosecution service, directing it to negotiate an agreement with the company. Trudeau later says that Wilson-Raybould asked him if he planned to tell her what to do concerning the prosecution — a conversation that he says ended with him telling her any decision was hers alone.

No remediation agreement

Sept. 18 — SNC-Lavalin representatives meet with Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick (Canada's most senior civil servant) and Finance Minister Bill Morneau to discuss issues including ""justice and law enforcement.""

Sept. 21 — The remediation-agreement provisions come into legal force.

Oct. 9 — The director of prosecutions confirms again in writing that she will not invite SNC-Lavalin to negotiate a remediation agreement, a decision the company challenges in Federal Court. That challenge is ongoing.

Oct. 10 — SNC-Lavalin issues a news release saying it strongly disagrees with the director of prosecutions' position and remains open and committed to negotiating a remediation agreement. SNC-Lavalin shares fall nearly 14 per cent, closing at $44.86 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. That's the lowest close since March 2, 2016.

Oct. 11 — SNC-Lavalin meets with Elder Marques, a senior adviser in the Prime Minister's Office, to discuss ""justice and law enforcement.""

Nov. 5 and 19 — SNC-Lavalin meets with Mathieu Bouchard, a senior adviser in the Prime Minister's Office, to discuss ""justice and law enforcement.""

December — According to the Prime Minister's Office, Wilson-Raybould raises the remediation case with Gerald Butts, the prime minister's principal secretary, and he tells her to talk to Wernick, the Privy Council clerk.

Jan. 14, 2019 — Trudeau shuffles his cabinet after the resignation of Treasury Board president Scott Brison. Wilson-Raybould is moved from Justice to Veterans Affairs, widely seen as a demotion. David Lametti, a Montreal MP and former law professor, becomes justice minister. Wilson-Raybould posts a long letter outlining her record as justice minister and noting a great deal of work remains to be done toward reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

Feb. 7 — Citing unnamed sources, the Globe and Mail newspaper reports that Trudeau's aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould, while attorney general, to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the justice portfolio. Trudeau denies any impropriety. Citing solicitor-client privilege, Wilson-Raybould refuses to speak about dealings she had on the case when she was attorney general.

Wilson-Raybould resigns

Feb. 11 — Federal ethics commissioner Mario Dion says he's beginning an investigation. At a public appearance in Vancouver, Trudeau says he's spoken to Wilson-Raybould and confirmed with her that he said any decision on the SNC-Lavalin prosecution was entirely hers. Her continued presence in his cabinet speaks for itself, he says.

Feb. 12 — Wilson-Raybould resigns as veterans-affairs minister and says she's hired former Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell to advise her on the limits of solicitor-client privilege. Trudeau says he's surprised and disappointed that Wilson-Raybould has quit, and that if she felt undue pressure in her role as attorney general, she had a duty to report it to him.

Feb. 13 — The House of Commons justice committee debates its own probe of the issue. Liberals use their majority to call one closed-door meeting and hear from senior officials (Lametti as justice minister, the top bureaucrat in his department, and the clerk of the Privy Council) who can talk about the tension between the minister of justice's duties as a politician and his or her responsibilities as attorney general of Canada. The Liberals say this is a first step in a cautious investigation, but the opposition calls it a coverup.

Feb. 15 — Trudeau says Wilson-Raybould asked him in September whether he would direct her one way or another on the SNC-Lavalin question. He says he told her he would not.

Feb. 18 — Butts resigns as Trudeau's principal secretary. He denies any impropriety but says his continued presence in the Prime Minister's Office has become a distraction.

Trudeau has known Butts since they met in college.

CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER Justin Trudeau’s top advisor has quit amid allegations of political interference in the criminal prosecution of engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

One of the key architects of Trudeau’s 2015 electoral win and his longtime friend, Gerry Butts said he resigned as the prime minister’s principle secretary to avoid distractions for the government facing another tough ballot fight in eight months.

In a statement, Butts “categorically” denied accusations that he personally applied undue pressure on former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould for an out-of-court settlement with the firm.

“Any accusation that I or the staff put pressure on the attorney general is simply not true,” he said, but added: “It is in the best interests of the office and its important work for me to step away.”

For weeks, Trudeau’s government has been rocked by the meddling allegations first reported by the Globe and Mail, citing unnamed sources.

The political crisis deepened last week with Wilson-Raybould’s surprise resignation, and the launch of an investigation by the independent ethics commissioner.

Opposition members of the Commons justice committee also sought to put a spotlight on the issue, but the Liberals used their majority to block motions to have Butts and other senior government officials testify. The committee is to discuss the issue again today behind closed doors.

Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Moamer Kadhafi’s reign.

It lobbied the government, including senior officials in Trudeau’s office, for an out-of-court settlement that would include paying a fine and agreeing to put in place compliance measures.

A possible guilty verdict at trial, the company argued, risked crippling its business and putting thousands out of work.

But Wilson-Raybould refused to ask prosecutors to settle with the company, and the trial is set to proceed.

Trudeau has denied the allegations, saying that he had made clear to Wilson-Raybould that any decision on the case “as attorney general was hers alone to make.”

Wilson-Raybould has declined to speak, citing solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality.

Butts became close friends with Trudeau in university and over the next two decades would help chart Trudeau’s political future.

514,Empty,2019-02-21T18:38:21Z,"As Democrats increasingly embrace single-payer options, the GOP ""realizes"" that ObamaCare is what the people want.","Sometimes, I am gobsmacked when I watch conservatives talk to each other. Take, for example, Kevin Williamson of the National Review trying to explain why Republicans should examine some European health care systems. Basically, this is a reaction to the increasing popularity of Medicare-for-All or similar single-payer systems among Democrats and Democratic office-seekers. For Williamson, a lot of liberals are clueless and don’t understand that Europe has a variety of approaches to providing health care and that most of them don’t resemble the “national-monopoly provision on the British-Canadian model.” In other words, maybe we can have a European system after all, and maybe Republicans should begin exploring a new approach.

But once he begins describing the situation, he quickly gets to the nub of the problem. What Americans seem to want is a system of private insurance that is regulated to ensure that everyone is covered, even if they are horrible insurance risks. Since you can’t compel private companies to operate at a loss, this necessitates a “complex regime of mandates, regulation, and subsidies.” In other words, what people want is something exactly like the Affordable Care Act.

Here’s the thing: Republicans, and most Americans, say they want a system in which insurance companies are obliged to cover expenses associated with preexisting conditions. They also want insurance to be provided privately in the market. I have a very hard time seeing how you can have both of those things without having an individual mandate, without which the underlying incentives all but ensure a dysfunctional insurance market. You’d have no incentive to sign up for a plan and pay premiums until you came down with something expensive. This is the Republicans’ dilemma: They hate the Affordable Care Act, but they want certain benefits (choice of private insurers, coverage of preexisting conditions) that more or less necessitate something like the basic structure of the ACA — which is to say, a necessarily complex regime of mandates, regulation, and subsidies. Such systems are more the norm in much of the world than is the national-monopoly model. They have significant deficiencies of their own, and some strengths, too, which would be worth understanding as we proceed.

If the Republicans hadn’t demonized the Affordable Care Act, they could use it for their alternative model to what the many Democrats will be pushing for on the 2020 campaign trail. This shouldn’t surprise us. The Affordable Care Act was modeled on the Massachusetts health care law that was established while Mitt Romney was serving as governor of the Bay State. And the Massachusetts law was based on a 1993 plan the Heritage Foundation promoted (very disingenuously) as an alternative to HillaryCare. So, we’ve been here before.

The Republican dilemma is that they hate the only solution that would approximate what they actually want. They hate it because President Obama signed it into law. They hate it because they’ve lied about this law nonstop for more than a decade and those lies are very internalized.

The result is that they’ve boxed themselves out of the health care debate. They really want to be defending the Affordable Care Act or something nearly identical to it. They want to defend this kind of system because they very much prefer it to the “national-monopoly provision on the British-Canadian model.” But they can’t really defend the status quo because they told everyone that the status quo was a Marxist-Leninist takeover of the American economy.

The Democrats will defend the Affordable Care Act against attacks, but they won’t defend it for long against better alternatives. So, how do the Republicans position themselves? They can try proposing something like the Affordable Care Act and call it something else. Maybe introducing some Swiss or German elements would give them some cover to attempt this, although they’d still be proposing “European health care.”

Williamson comforts himself that the people, at least for now, still seem to prefer a system of private insurance. But if the Republicans can’t defend that kind of system because it requires the subsidies and regulations of ObamaCare, then they can’t advocate for what the people want.

That suggests to me that the consensus on health care will soon move to the left. In a tug-a-war, things don’t remain contested when one side lets go of the rope.",ObamaCare Is Looking Better and Better to Republicans,Washingtonmonthly.com,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/02/21/obamacare-is-looking-better-and-better-to-republicans/
515,Empty,2019-02-20T14:29:11Z,A PM has every right to tell a minister of justice what he thinks the laws should be. He does not have a right to tell the attorney general what to do about a prosecution,"Let’s row into the weeds a little. There is a subtle constitutional point at the heart of the Wilson-Raybould controversy, or at least what we know of it. It’s one of those weird bits of political metaphysics that pops up in Canada because of its parallel overseas evolution of an ancient, highly idiosyncratic monarchy. It’s a point that is being discussed by lawyers, but not so much in the newspapers, yet.

I suppose it is bad for business to bring a piece of what sounds like complicated trivia to the forefront when there is an exciting scandal happening and all ink-stained hands are on deck. But this is a fairly important piece of the whole mess.

It’s about Canada’s minister of justice, which is the job Jody Wilson-Raybould used to have. The minister of justice, as her title denotes, is a minister like other ministers of the Crown. She sits in cabinet meetings and participates in their collective decision-making, a process in which unity is a paramount feature. This necessarily does subordinate her to a first, or prime, minister — a final decision-maker.

As a minister she can be expected, and will have expected, to sometimes be given advice and orders from the PM. It would not be an unusual feature of her job to have one of the PM’s close advisers visit her with delegated instructions. Maybe sometimes those instructions would be delivered somewhat abruptly. It happens.

But. The minister of justice also bears an associated title: she is also the attorney general of Canada. You may have gotten the idea that this is just a matter of tradition, a romantic holdover from olden times. It is in fact a matter of explicit statute, the Department of Justice Act, as well as an important constitutional concept. The minister of justice is a politician who writes legislation and oversees the operation of law and courts. The attorney general, although always and necessarily the same human as the minister of justice, is a distinct person charged with the royal authority to commence, manage and cancel criminal prosecutions. When someone sues the Crown it is normally the attorney general who answers, and when the Crown sues it is done through her.

What does this mean? It means that if you are the prime minister’s trusted old chum who does his dirty work, it is all right for you to visit a mere minister of justice, operating in that capacity, and to tell her what the boss wants done for crude partisan reasons. But it is quite strictly forbidden to do that to an attorney general.

In matters of hiring or statute-writing, you can go ahead, kick down her door, and tell her “Orillia needs more red-headed Hungarian judges!” or “There really oughta be a law against candy.” When it comes to prosecutions — when madame has her attorney general hat on — it is very different. You, as a sunny-ways enforcer, are not even supposed to provide unsolicited advice or hints from the prime minister. The PM may be the minister of justice’s boss, but he is not in the chain of command between the attorney general and the sovereign at all.

An attorney general is supposed to make prosecution decisions with the good of the country in mind, and she can ask ministers for their opinions about what would be good, just as she could consult any other schmuck. But for a PM or his dogsbody to venture such an opinion spontaneously, whatever the motive, is not cool. If someone tried to give an attorney general such advice, and she told that person to shove off back to Cape Breton in a leaky dory, and she woke up one morning not long after and turned on the radio and heard that she was no longer attorney general, that would certainly be a mighty big deal.

I know what you might be thinking: this is a stupid system, and we should actually have two people to do the two distinct jobs of minister of justice and attorney general. This is, in fact, how it works in England. They have two different people doing the two jobs, and the AG of England and Wales is specifically excluded from cabinet, to prevent misunderstandings and carelessness.

However the Wilson-Raybould business works out, I suspect we may well end up adopting the English structure once all the smoke has cleared. The Conservatives created the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in 2006 as part of the “accountability” wave that swept them into office, but the director is still ultimately answerable to the attorney general, so that is not looking like an ideal solution to the dual-identity problem.

Frankly, it ought not to be much of a problem, but here we are. Surely one of the most convincing reasons to vote Liberal, if there are any, is that the Liberals have governed this country for much of its history and can be expected to understand its constitutional nuances and the niceties of power.

The p…,"After reporting a record number of B.C. real estate audit assessments in 2018 – amounting to $140.7 million – the Canada Revenue Agency is expected to receive a treasure trove of data from the B.C. government tying home ownership to income declarations.

The province is estimating it will collect $642 million over the next four years from the newly implemented BC speculation and vacancy tax, aimed at satellite families and those who leave their secondary urban homes empty for most of the year.

Whether these 2019 budget estimates hold water will partly depend on what the government deems to now be the “most advanced auditing processes in the country,” thanks in part to a suite of new efforts to collect information on home ownership.

Complex audits are bound to follow the submission of speculation tax declaration forms, policy and tax experts suggest.

The annual 2% tax against a satellite family’s assessed home value is designed to bridge a policy gap that has led to tax avoidance attributable to trends in global migration and the internationalization of B.C. real estate.

In essence, satellite family breadwinners earn income abroad while having their families live in B.C. The household thus pays little income tax in Canada but utilizes social services, the bulk of which is paid for by such taxes.

B.C. real estate audits lucrative for the taxman

In 2015 the CRA augmented its compliance program for B.C. and Ontario real estate audits. Last month the agency issued a report claiming it had collected $140.7 million from 1,417 real estate audits in B.C. alone, from April, 2018, to December, 2018. That’s $99,294 per audit, well above the three-year average of $45,182 per B.C. audit, and miles ahead of Ontario’s average of $17,241 per audit.

Tax collectors are getting more efficient, it appears, as 1,470 B.C. real estate audits from April 2015 to March 2016 generated only $18.5 million in evaded taxes.

In B.C., $173.4 million of the $310.4 million recovered in taxes – from 6,861 audits since April 2015 – is income tax related (lifestyle audits of owners of expensive homes and capital gains assessments on home sales). The other portion relates to unreported GST on sales and house flipping. Ontario’s 31,749 real estate audits since April 2015 brought in $547.4 million. Overall, the CRA also applied $70.9 million in penalties for knowingly making false statements.

The $642 million estimated new tax revenue is payment of the speculation tax only. The B.C. government says it has not assessed the amount of tax from unreported worldwide income or capital gains could be recovered from the data it collects for the speculation tax. After Ministry of Finance experts declined an interview request from Glacier Media, the government said it does expect the speculation tax auditing process to help identify overseas tax evasion and thus the ministry is expected to flag audit leads for the CRA.

Out migration and expensive homes

B.C. technically defines a satellite family as one in which reported worldwide household income is greater than local income.

Satellite family arrangements can be observed by looking at investor-class immigrant “out-migration.”

A government study of the now defunct federal investor immigrant program (foreigners paying an $800,000 loan for permanent residency), favoured by Chinese nationals, showed “out-migration” rates of investor immigrants after 10 years was 26.2 %, well above any other immigrant stream.

As an example, from 2006 to 2010, Canada admitted 13,151 investor immigrants and 34,544 of their spouses and dependents. According to the 2016 census, there remained only 7,590 of those investor immigrants and 27,370 spouses and dependents, showing a disproportionate number of breadwinners left the country within five years.

The average assessed value of homes owned by investor class immigrants in Metro Vancouver, in 2018, was $1.78 million for those admitted by the federal government and $2.2 million for those entering via Quebec, according to a recent Statistics Canada study. Furthermore, recent investor immigrants (since 2009) own single detached houses with average values of either $3.11 million for federal investors or $3.30 million for Quebec investors.

Of 121,650 investor immigrants admitted since 1986 and still declaring residency in Canada, 52% are now located in British Columbia, per census data.

Tax tries to close “bad tax setup”

Satellite family arrangement have given rise to wealthy people – often foreign nationals or recent immigrants – with access to foreign sources of money having a greater advantage in owning homes in Metro Vancouver than local income earners, said Josh Gordon, assistant professor at Simon Fraser University’s School of Public Policy.

Foreign money inflows into real estate by various means have decoupled housing prices from local income earners, Gordon contended, pointing to widely available data of the Vancouver real estate phenomenon where relatively low incomes are reported in some of the most expensive neighbourhoods in Canada.

Gordon said the purpose of the speculation tax is to close the gap on a “huge subsidy” due to a “bad tax setup.”

“It’s a tax avoidance problem, not purely tax evasion. This arrangement is perfectly legal and that’s the problem,” he argued.

“Over time much of the expensive property will come to be owned by people outside the labour market,” said Gordon.

Gordon said presumably higher consumption based taxes paid by satellite families are an inadequate substitute for any unreported or even reported worldwide income.

“Those families will be using the education and health care system for much of their life. The purchase of a couple luxury vehicles does not capture the services they will consume,” said Gordon, adding that even if worldwide income is diligently declared and paid (minus the home country’s tax assessment), Canada’s social systems are still disadvantaged.

Richmond’s Andersen Tax LLP international tax accountant Steven Flynn said at first glance the speculation tax should be able to capture those families whose breadwinner is not filing Canadian taxes. Should a satellite family try to file a speculation tax exemption, the federal and provincial governments should be able to cross reference low income to high property value, via the auditing system, said Flynn.

For satellite families, “in general terms, by filing for an exemption under the B.C. speculation and vacancy yax, you’re admitting to a government agency that you’re a Canadian resident for income tax purposes. The expectation is the individual is subject to Canadian income tax of their worldwide income,” said Flynn.

Some audits of overseas spouses could be tricky, said David Duff, professor and director of the LL.M. in Taxation program at University of British Columbia’s Peter A. Allard School of Law.

Duff said people make arrangements to ensure that they are not residents in Canada for tax purposes. So one could remain a non-resident for tax purposes even if their de facto Canadian household pays the speculation tax.

“The key is that they’re not residents for Canadian tax purposes. Residence for tax purposes is not the same thing as citizenship or permanent residence status,” he explained.

Opaque, if not non-existent, spousal status; children (students) put on the title of homes; income transferred by the non-resident spouse from offshore corporations; and cash “gifts” to the family makes for a difficult gambit for Canadian auditors, should initial red flags, such as low income declarations from expensive homes, arise, Duff said.

“Perhaps the [speculation] tax will trigger real or fictitious separations for tax purposes,” he said.

Flynn said under the federal tax act, overseas cash gifts do not count as worldwide income.

And so, said Duff, “since the CRA has no way to audit this income directly, it will have to rely on whatever information it is able to obtain from the jurisdiction in which the spouse is a resident.”

For instance, according to the Canada-China Income Tax Agreement a person shall be deemed a resident for tax purposes first and foremost if “he has a permanent home available to him.”

If the person has homes in both countries the tiebreaker is where most personal and economic relations lie. If this cannot be determined then nationality determines tax liability.

The agreement eliminates double taxation in the event a person is deemed a resident for tax purposes in both countries (and presumably files tax returns in both countries as mandated to do so).

Polling indicates the BC NDP’s new speculation tax is supported by four in five British Columbians, but the opposition BC Liberals and special interest groups have panned its implementation, citing objections such as allegedly unclear and unfair exemptions and privacy concerns about providing one’s social insurance number.

“I think its revealing that someone would be more concerned about connecting income tax data to property ownership than about widespread tax avoidance,” countered Gordon, who seems confident the tax will do what it is intended to do.

Flynn said collection of a SIN should not be a concern and would appear necessary to make the tax effective.

Bryan Short, director of the BC Freedom of Information and Privacy Association, said his group is “monitoring” the tax.

“If the B.C. government can demonstrate that the collection of SINs is absolutely necessary to the facilitation of the speculation tax, then they are not overstepping boundaries,” said Short, via email.",B.C. real estate audits reveal widespread tax evasion,Vancouverisawesome.com,https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/02/22/widespread-tax-evasion-real-estate-audits-bc/

From data breaches to phone scams seeking to collect your information to sell on the black market, it could happen to anyone.

But as some 27,000 Canadians report being victims of identity theft every year — a number that the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre says is vastly underreported — a Marketplace investigation reveals Canada is doing little to match the strength of protections offered in the U.S.

Marketplace began looking into identity theft protections after receiving a leaked database of nearly 3,000 Canadians who fell victim to a low-interest credit card scam operating out of one overseas call centre.

As part of its research, Marketplace tested two services offered to identity-theft victims by Canada's two credit-reporting bureaus, Equifax and TransUnion, and learned that they won't necessarily prevent the risk of fraud.

Credit monitoring: 'It's a flaw in the system'

The top advertised product for both Equifax and TransUnion is credit monitoring — a service that costs between $11.95 and $29.95 a month, depending on the plan.

Marketplace tested each bureau's recommended plan, at $19.95 a month, by having two producers sign up with both companies. Call-centre staff for the companies said that with these products, clients can expect an email notification whenever ""key changes"" occur to their credit reports, including any inquiries or new accounts opened.

The two producers then applied for six different credit cards — three apiece — with major banks across Canada. As each bank made inquiries into the producers' files, an email notification was only received from one credit bureau — never both — and always one day after the application was submitted.

Some of the sensitive information leaked to Marketplace included credit card numbers, social insurance numbers and addresses — even recent account balances. (CBC)

Equifax and TransUnion both declined requests for an on-camera interview, but each credit bureau told Marketplace through email that financial institutions typically pull credit reports from only one bureau.

This means that in order to ensure consumers are getting a full picture of their credit reports, they would need to sign up for monitoring with both bureaus, at a cost of nearly $500 a year.

""Definitely it's a flaw in the system,"" said Claudiu Popa, a cybersecurity expert and author of The Canadian Cyberfraud Handbook. ""No amount of monitoring will give you 100 per cent guarantee that you're going to be protected against identity theft.""

Even if a consumer does cough up the hundreds of dollars each year, Popa says credit monitoring won't do anything to prevent identity theft.

""It's a reactive system,"" he said. ""In many cases, these provide nothing more than a false sense of security.""

Fraud alerts: 'They definitely didn't protect me'

When Robert Darch had his wallet stolen, the North Vancouver man knew one of the first things to do was to alert both credit bureaus.

""I thought I was doing the proper due diligence that one needs to do when you have your ID stolen or your wallet stolen,"" said Darch.

He says both Equifax and TransUnion placed a fraud alert on his account, which triggers a notice on someone's credit report, saying they may have been a victim of identity theft.

Legislation in Ontario, Manitoba and New Brunswick says that if a fraud alert is placed on someone's credit file, a lender must take reasonable steps to verify someone's identity before a new account can be opened. All other provinces and territories have no legislation around fraud alerts.

With these alerts in place, Darch said he expected someone would call him if there was suspicious activity on his file. ""I thought once you notify Equifax, once you notify TransUnion, there's like a firewall in place and you are protected,"" he said.

It wasn't until CTV News knocked on his door, wanting to know why he was selling illegitimate phones on Craigslist, that he realized the fraud alerts hadn't worked.

Watch Robert Darch explain why credit alerts didn't work for him:

This man signed up for fraud alerts after his wallet was stolen. But he says it didn't work. 1:00

Someone using Darch's identity had managed to open two phone accounts with his personal information, and was selling the phones online under Darch's name.

While Darch was able to quickly clarify the situation with the news crew, he was left concerned that the protection offered by the credit bureaus didn't work.

""I definitely wasn't covered, wasn't protected.""

Marketplace's producers also placed fraud alerts on their accounts in Ontario, where specific legislation exists. And while no credit cards were approved, producers only received phone calls to verify their identity three times out of five.

""I don't think they have any teeth,"" said Darch about fraud alerts. ""I don't think that they are going to protect Canadians. They definitely didn't protect me.""

Both Equifax and TransUnion told Marketplace through statements that it is up to the lending organization to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant.

Equifax added: ""We believe it would be a mistake to discourage consumers from signing up for fraud alerts. We believe fraud alerts are an effective way to help identify fraudulent activity and help better protect consumers against identity theft.""

Canada behind in identity theft protections

Several experts Marketplace spoke with agree one of the best ways to safeguard against identity theft is a credit freeze, which gives the consumer control of their credit by allowing them to lock their file.

Even the consumer won't be able to access any credit until they unlock the freeze. As a result, potential lenders and fraudsters can't open new accounts or even inquire about their credit.

The product is offered for free by Equifax and TransUnion in the U.S. by law — but it's not available in Canada.

""Canadians have the right to know what's happening with their personal information,"" said Popa. ""There's absolutely no reason those same companies should not be offering credit freezes in Canada.""

The U.S. law to mandate free credit freezes passed in May 2018 after a public outcry following the 2017 Equifax data breach, though paid credit freezes had already been available there for more than a decade.

""In Canada, we have yet to catch up,"" said Popa, who would like to see credit freezes applied by default and for free.

When asked why Equifax doesn't offer credit freezes to Canadians, the company said: ""We are monitoring recent changes made to this service in the United States to see how consumers are responding to changes in the lock/freeze capability, as well as changing Canadian consumer needs in order to create the solutions which best meet those needs.""

In a previous statement, Equifax told Marketplace that ""unless it is an industry-wide requirement, it would present a false sense of security to consumers.""

TransUnion did not respond to questions about why it doesn't offer credit freezes in Canada.

Watch as cybersecurity expert Claudiu Popa explains the benefits of a credit freeze:

This cybersecurity expert says a tool known as a credit freeze is likely the easiest and most effective way to protect against identity theft. 0:59

Lenders and creditors pay credit agencies to access customer credit reports. But major banks in the U.S. told Marketplace that if a customer has a credit freeze, they can't access the data and don't have to pay.

Darch believed a credit freeze would have saved him a lot of hassle and embarrassment.

""I don't see a good reason why we can't have that in our country,"" he said. ""And I really wish that would be fast-tracked into place, so other people don't have the misfortune that I've had.""

Ontario credit freeze law in limbo

In Canada, provincial and territorial governments have the power to mandate that Equifax and TransUnion provide credit freezes for Canadians. Marketplace reached out to all 13 provinces and territories, and none have plans to introduce new legislation around the issue.

But Ontario has come close.

Just before 2018's provincial election, the Wynne government had passed legislation that would have forced TransUnion and Equifax to offer free credit freezes to Ontarians. Bill 8, the Access to Consumer Credit Reports and Elevator Availability Act, received royal assent, but the Liberals were voted out of power before the law became active.

The current Conservative government has told Marketplace there are no plans to finalize the legislation.

While still in Opposition, Consumer Services Minister Bill Walker told the Legislature that he supported credit freezes during an April 2018 reading of the bill. ""We have to have the ability to protect our information and know what's being used or what's being given to people out there,"" he said at the time.

But after more than seven months in office, there are still no plans to push the law forward.

After Marketplace reached out to the minister's office multiple times, it released a statement attributed to Walker that said the issue of consumer protection is on its department's radar.

""Consumer protection, as well as ensuring consumers know they can trust the government to implement effective rules, is our top priority.""

When Marketplace approached Walker at a public event for further clarification, he responded: ""I will commit to you that I will go and look at it.""

According to Popa, the issue is one that requires government intervention.

""When it comes to credit-monitoring bureaus, we cannot trust them to give us 100 per cent visibility into the risk of identity theft,"" he said.

The regulator imposed 156 conditions on the project (it listed 157 conditions when it first approved the project in May 2016) while also handing Ottawa 16 new non-binding recommendations it says would help mitigate marine safety risks that could result from an expanded shipping terminal near Burnaby, B.C.

Robert Steedman, the chief environmental officer of the NEB, said Friday that conditions in the Salish Sea along B.C.'s coastline are already so badly degraded from centuries of human activity that the addition of just one more tanker per day would have a minor impact on the endangered southern resident killer whale population.

Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi welcomed the NEB's report calling it a ""major milestone"" and said Ottawa is committed to doing the ""hard work necessary to move forward in the right way on TMX.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his cabinet have 90 days to respond to the NEB report — they can either approve it or kill the taxpayer-owned project outright.

But despite the legislatively mandated response time, Ottawa has said it will not impose constraints on Indigenous consultation efforts — meaning a firm date for a final decision remains elusive.

The NEB re-do was prompted by a Federal Court of Appeal decision last summer that quashed the Trudeau government's initial cabinet approval of the expanded pipeline, sending Ottawa back to the drawing board on two key matters: Indigenous consultation and marine-related environmental assessment.

The 1,150-kilometre expansion project would nearly triple the existing pipeline's capacity to 890,000 barrels a day. It would allow pipeline shipments from Alberta's oilpatch to coastal B.C., and then to markets in Asia. Tanker traffic from the Westridge Marine Terminal would increase from about five vessels a month to one a day.

With pipeline capacity severely constrained, oilpatch boosters have long demanded a new pipeline to tidewater that would allow Canadian producers to fetch prices closer to the going world rate for oil — which could boost government revenue.

According to research from the nonpartisan Conference Board of Canada, an expanded Trans Mountain would lead to 802,000 person-years of employment and $46.7 billion in government revenue over the next 20 years.

The think-tank estimates that most of those gains would come about through higher prices for Canadian oil.

'We categorically disagree'

The NEB announcement doesn't mean the project is in the clear. Environmentalists and other project opponents warn a spill on the coast would be disastrous and say increased greenhouse gas emissions driven by pipeline exports could threaten Canada's commitment to the Paris agreement on climate change.

Anti-oilsands activist Tzeporah Berman, who works with the Standearth green advocacy group, said the project ""is not in the public interest and will never be built.""

Judy Wilson, chief of the Neskonlith First Nation and secretary treasurer of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, said the coalition of B.C. Indigenous peoples opposed to the pipeline expansion will not back down in the face of the regulator's approval.



""We categorically disagree with the National Energy Board,"" she said. ""We still say no to the project. Not only did they not listen to the Indigenous concerns, they're not even listening to our orcas.""

(Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press)

The Federal Court of Appeal said the NEB, in its initial May 2016 recommendation report, did not adequately address the impact a substantial increase in tanker traffic could have on area whales, or the threat of a spill of diluted bitumen from a tanker.

""Today, following an intensive 22-week reconsideration process, the NEB submitted its report on the project with an overall recommendation that the Trans Mountain expansion project is in the Canadian public interest and should be approved ... This report marks an important milestone as the government follows the Federal Court of Appeal's guidance,"" Sohi said.

""Moving forward, the [cabinet] will make a decision on TMX once we are satisfied that the Crown has adequately fulfilled its duty to consult. We are hopeful the work we are doing will put us in a strong position to make a decision within the NEB's legislated timeframe.""

Dooming whales 'to oblivion'

While the federal Liberals vowed to be guided by the NEB in approaching the project, B.C. NDP MP Murray Rankin said the regulator's decision was ""not acceptable"" and compared its recommendations to mitigate the project's risks to ""changing the deck chairs on the Titanic.""

""They're prepared to consign the southern resident killer whales to oblivion. Perhaps that's in the national interest where you live, but it's certainly not where we live,"" Rankin said, adding he suspects there will be further legal action against the project.

""I can predict with confidence environmental organizations are not going to take this sitting down,"" the Victoria-area MP said.

Conservative MP Shannon Stubbs, the party's natural resources critic, said the NEB decision is good news for the many energy workers who have faced layoffs in recent months due to historically low oil prices — but she demanded a clearer timeline from the Liberal government on when construction of the project would resume.

""Today's recommendation from the National Energy Board, while positive, does not get us anywhere closer to the pipeline getting built. All it does is put the decision back in the hands of the same Liberal cabinet that failed to start construction in the first place,"" she said.

The original proponent of the expansion, Kinder Morgan, halted all essential spending last spring after the B.C. NDP government launched a series of legal manoeuvres designed to thwart construction.

Amid the uncertainty, Ottawa agreed to buy the project for $4.5 billion. On the very day Kinder Morgan shareholders agreed to sell most of the company's Canadian assets to Ottawa, the Federal Court of Appeal quashed approvals, demanding changes before construction could resume.

The court found the federal government's Phase 3 consultation process with Indigenous peoples was a ""failure.""

Neskonlith Chief Judy Wilson says Indigenous concerns were not taken into account over the National Energy Board decision. 1:05

It called federal consultants glorified ""note-takers"" who recorded the concerns of Indigenous communities without acting on them.

The previous Crown consultation team believed, erroneously, that it could not add more conditions to the project than those the National Energy Board (NEB) already imposed as part of its Phase 2 consultation, the court found.

The federal government tapped retired Supreme Court justice Frank Iacobucci to lead renewed talks with Indigenous communities. Iacobucci and his team of 60 consultants will be empowered to turn feedback into action where possible.

As of Wednesday, the consultation teams had spoken already with three-quarters of the 117 communities that will be affected by the project's construction.

Wilson-Raybould said Tuesday she’d accept any invitation to speak to the committee but is still in talks with her lawyer on what she can say. “I will appear,” she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. “I am continuing to discuss and talk with my counsel about what I can and cannot say. That, too, would apply at the justice committee.” Canada’s two major opposition parties have called for an inquiry into the ordeal, which the parliamentary ethics watchdog is already investigating. Trudeau said last week his cabinet discussed the SNC-Lavalin issue in part to avoid job losses at the company.

521,Empty,2019-02-22T21:05:56Z,It's already clear where this whole affair is heading,"On Thursday, Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council — the top civil servant in the federal government — came out swinging against the recent allegations that have thrown the Liberal government into disarray. Specifically, after a long, eyebrow-raising introduction that had very little to do with the matter at hand, Wernick acknowledged that former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould had indeed been “pressured” to grant SNC-Lavalin a break from criminal prosecution on bribery charges and move towards a settlement in the form of a remediation agreement. Indeed, he had done some of the pressuring himself. If this was a problem, Wernick said, Wilson-Raybould should have spoken up.

But, Wernick insisted, this wasn’t inappropriate pressure. “I am quite sure the minister felt pressure to get it (her decision) right,” was his delightful turn of phrase. To Wernick, this was somehow materially distinct from the kind of “undue” or “inappropriate” pressure the Liberals have been insisting never occurred.

If this was a problem, Wernick said, Wilson-Raybould should have spoken up

The Liberal defensive lines have fallen back some as this scandal progressed. First, of course, the line was that Wilson-Raybould had not been “directed” — the prime minister himself stuck to that one quite closely for days. It was an odd thing for him to say, as the original Globe and Mail story that kicked this whole affair off had never said the former attorney general was directed, but rather that the Prime Minister’s Office had tried pressuring her. When that non-denial didn’t help, the Liberals shifted gears slightly. Consider Monday’s resignation letter by Gerald Butts, the prime minister’s now-former principal secretary: “I categorically deny the accusation that I or anyone else in (the prime minister’s) office pressured Ms. Wilson-Raybould,” he wrote.

How the Liberals reconcile that categorical denial with Wernick’s subsequent admission that he is “sure the minister felt pressure” remains to be seen. But it’s already clear where this whole affair is heading. Unless Wilson-Raybould ultimately says nothing, or suddenly starts offering complete, if belated denials that she was pressured, the Liberals are going to find themselves arguing that this accomplished Indigenous woman simply overreacted when a series of men tried to pressure her into making a decision that was rightfully hers to make — and if she’d been bothered by the pressure, it was her responsibility to take action.

It would be an interesting response. It’s possible that senior Liberals might even believe there is some truth to it. But if that’s the best they’ve got, it will be something to see feminist, progressive Trudeau resorting to “blame her” as his defence against a scandal that continues to bog down his government.",NP View: Trudeau’s SNC-Lavalin defence is awkwardly shaping up to be ‘blame her’,Nationalpost.com,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/np-view-trudeaus-snc-lavalin-defence-is-awkwardly-shaping-up-to-be-blame-her
522,Empty,2019-02-25T10:00:00Z,"Don’t expect to see the much-discussed national pharmacare plan in the March budget, writes David Olive.","Universal pharmacare has long been in place widely in Europe. The Liberal-dominated Commons health committee called last year for universal pharmacare, because about 20 per cent of Canadians are uninsured or under-insured for drugs. And roughly one in 10 Canadians goes without prescription drugs because they cannot afford them.

In the spring budget, just over three weeks from now, the Trudeau government will once again pass on the chance to finally give Canadians the universal pharmacare that doctors and a multitude of studies have shown is needed to improve patient outcomes and reduce the country’s prescription-drug bill.

That’s not what the doctor ordered, but it is what the insurance lobby wants. And the Trudeau government will oblige the private insurers, who fear having to compete with universal pharmacare.

Morneau will speak glowingly of how the Trudeau government is “filling the gaps” in our patchwork system of drug spending by government, private drug plans, and the $3.6 billion that Canadians spend out of pocket on prescriptions. Actually, Morneau will add complexity to the patchwork system rather than streamline it.

But in his next budget, which was set last week for March 19 , Finance Minister Bill Morneau will reject that holistic solution. He will instead announce narrowly targeted partial coverage of selected patient groups.

A government that has already broken its promise to balance the books by now understandably blanches at the estimated $20.4 billion annual cost of universal pharmacare. But the country’s total drug bill would actually drop by an annual $4.2 billion, according to the federal budget watchdog, due to volume buying by a single provider.

Putting private-sector insurers ahead of the people doesn’t sound like an effective means of winning a tight election contest in October.

The Alberta election campaign hasn’t officially started yet, and already the man poised to win it has effectively declared war on the rest of the country.

As premier, after a provincial election that must be held by May 31, Jason Kenney will demand that Ottawa sunder the federation by withholding transfer payments from provinces that don’t do Alberta’s bidding (that would be B.C., Quebec and to a lesser extent Ontario) by deep-sixing their misgivings about new heavy-oil pipelines in their backyards.

If those pipelines don’t rapidly materialize, Kenney will hold a nationally divisive Alberta referendum on the equalization-payments system. And he wants Ottawa to debauch the Federal Court of Appeal, which ordered a halt to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, by using a Constitutional provision to overturn that decision.

At home, Kenney will set Indigenous communities against each other, favouring pro-pipeline communities with subsidies (that sure sounds like a bribe), and withholding the same from pipeline opponents.

He’ll throw Alberta teachers into confusion over elements of the curriculum that strike him as an NDP socialist plot. And he’ll strip farm workers of recently won means of redress for workplace injuries, on the untested theory that a safe farm is an unprofitable one.

Premier Rachel Notley has already blamed Canada for Alberta’s self-inflicted woes. Expect four more years of the same, only ramped up to firebrand level.

But understand that the next spell of Wildrose Country vitriol is coming from a good place. Kenney says he is simply “moving Alberta from an apologetic or defensive posture to an assertive posture.”

Apologetic? We await with interest a list from Kenney of Alberta’s apologies.

No rush, our patience is infinite.

Tariff-bully Trump: First Canada, now Germany

Canada may soon have an ally in Germany in our mutual despair over the U.S. as a threat to our economies.

Germany is bracing for the same 25 per cent tariffs on U.S. auto imports that U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Canada with in pressuring Ottawa for a makeover of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that neither Ottawa nor Canada’s business community much likes.

The looming tariffs on the German auto sector threaten to pitch Europe’s biggest economy into recession.

Recall that Trump justifies America’s continued 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian steel on the specious grounds that imported Canadian steel girders somehow threaten U.S. national security.

A long-awaited report by Trump’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, a former steel baron, is expected to make the same bogus assertion about imports from Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG.

Likely the best way this turns out is a compromise that imposes quotas on German auto imports, but that would be damaging in reducing the revenues of a key German economic sector.

A more productive outcome would be a German commitment to make more vehicles in the U.S. The Germans already do so, of course.

Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said recently she doesn’t understand how the BMWs built in South Carolina are a threat to U.S. national security. She might be wiser to put ironies aside and accurately broadcast Trump’s tariffs as an attack on Europe, given that the German auto sector assembles vehicles and sources parts widely across that continent.

None of this would be an issue, of course, if only Detroit made cars as well as the Germans, who perfected the internal-combustion engine in the 19th century and have never looked back.

In a typical softball BBC interview, breaking down in tears he said the British state should ensure that this woman safely comes back to British land.

Not only that, he said, the government shouldn’t prosecute or jail her, because she’s arguably a youthful teen who made a mistake, and everyone makes mistakes. The mask slipped momentarily when he was asked whether he ever took part in an Islamist demonstration against Americans and British. The answer is anybody’s guess.

Apparently, that might have pushed this girl to join the Islamic State, a murderous death cult raping, pillaging, and enslaving in a land that once stretched almost from Tehran to Tartous. This woman, who left her privileged London lifestyle with full knowledge of the people she was joining, in the age of internet and mass media where no stories of ISIS atrocities are censored, declared war on her own countrymen and is now sitting at a camp in the Middle East, demanding to come back. The word treason is thrown around a lot, but if there’s one example where it fits, it is declaring war against your own country.

This is by no means the only sympathetic portrayal of ISIS brides that has flooded Western media recently. These women left the West to marry and commit jihad, and not just in the United Kingdom (UK). CNN wrote a sympathetic portrayal of one British female ISIS supporter who is pregnant and wants to return to the country she spurned to give birth.

American ISIS bride who called for terror attacks at Memorial Day parades begs US to let her go back to Alabama https://t.co/4N0Bd3Ab8o — Daily Mail US (@DailyMail) February 18, 2019

A Canadian woman said she was clueless about the ISIS atrocities but has no regrets because, even though she wants to come home, she still believes in Sharia and wants it established. When asked about ISIS’s mass murder and enslavement of the Yazidis, she defiantly commented there might have been “a few” executions.

A German woman was featured in a Guardian tearjerker, saying she “just wants to go home.” Another British woman misses “fish and chips” and free health care, a German now has two children of her own and worries about an “uncertain future,” and a Moroccan married to a British/Australian jihadist “bonded over television shows.”

CNN’s Gayle Lemmon argued in a dewy essay about an American ISIS widow that the “West should not take it out on children.” To top it all up, there’s news about U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar urging more leniency for those who voluntarily joined ISIS, because America should be “more compassionate.”

If I were to channel my sincerest feelings about this recent bout of sympathy for ISIS brides, it wouldn’t be in the queen’s English, nor would it be deemed publishable.

I predicted this would happen. In an essay a couple of years back, I wrote that we should imagine a girl, disillusioned with her life, goes to join a death cult. She knows full well the utmost debauchery and deviancy that is a part of not just that group’s lifestyle but its entire ideology, and decides to join it nevertheless.

Over the course of the next four years, she and her fellow female devotees to the cause would marry leaders of the cause, immerse themselves in its ideology, and engage in acts of depravity themselves. Some of them turned their own friends and families in for noncompliance, some fed their prisoners to guard dogs, and the most brutal of them all made a lampshade with the skin of babies. When Irma Grese and Maria Mandl were hanged for their crimes as Nazi guards, they didn’t show much emotion. In fact, Jenny-Wanda Barkmann, the notorious officer of a prison camp, declared, ‘Life is full of pleasures, but pleasures are usually short.’

Nazi mass murderers like Irma Grese didn’t have sympathetic op-eds written about them in newspapers and websites. It would have been repulsive then, and even when the actors are changed, it remains repulsive now.

In his seminal work “The Open Society and Its Enemies,” Karl Popper once wrote that “unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance.” Put simply, in a society that treats unlimited tolerance as a virtue, provides no punitive deterrence, and only attempts rehabilitation, intolerant forces will take advantage of the situation, and erode the society from within.

There’s a section of liberals and libertarians to whom social cohesion and community mean nothing. Individualism is the be-all and end-all to them, and tolerance for crimes and rehabilitation is considered a prime virtue of their liberal society. A typical difficulty for this worldview are the Islamists and Marxists within any Western society. One cannot co-exist with a bunch of people whose ultimate aim is to destroy your existence.

According to conservative intelligence estimates, there are currently around 60,000 Islamists in Europe, almost three World War II-era army divisions. Add those currently in Australia, America, and Canada, and the number increases even more.

Every man with half a brain can understand that none of these people would exist without some tacit understanding with family and friends, a support network. Consider the radicalized parents of the pregnant ISIS bride who wants to now come back to the UK. It is highly unlikely that her family, friends, local community center, mosque, or Islamic charity were not aware of something brewing with her before she left, and now as she seeks to return. These are open secrets and taboos that people are too polite or afraid to talk about.

Adding white wine instead of red to a Coq-au-Vin is a mistake. Swiping left instead of right in a dating app is a mistake. Joining a mass-murdering religious cult enslaving, raping, and conquering infidel land to spread Sharia, with full knowledge, record, news, and online evidence and without any intoxication, coercion, duress, or insanity is anything but.

No civilized society and social contract can survive unless violent crimes are punished with extreme prejudice, and human rights are protected, which includes punishing violations of them. In just one single village, 7,000 Yazidi women were enslaved and raped, and their menfolk and children killed. Only their bones remain. Anyone voluntarily joining a group that committed such ultraviolence in the name of religion breaks her bonds with civilized society and humanity itself. They cannot just waltz back, nor should they be allowed to.

It is abhorrent for their fellow citizens, who are decent and contributing to society; it is unjust to the Syrians and Kurds and Yazidis, upon whom the darkest crimes of humanity were unleashed and who rightfully seek justice and retribution; it is treasonous to the land beneath their feet; and it denigrates the minorities who are law-abiding, hardworking, and have made the West their home. Not everyone deserves another chance. Nor should they get one, if one intends to see Western civilization preserved. ​","No, Female ISIS Members Should Not Get Tickets Back To Civilization",Thefederalist.com,http://thefederalist.com/2019/02/19/no-female-isis-members-not-get-free-tickets-back-civilization/

Canada: Scandal Involving P.M. Justin Trudeau Linked to Libya: The cesspool of romancing Jihad.

Posted on by SeekAndFind

Four years ago, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officially leveled corruption and fraud charges against Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin, over alleged criminal acts that occurred while that firm was doing business in Libya. The Globe and Mail broke the biggest scandal since Canadas Adscam scandal, which cost the Liberals dearly in election year 2006. This latest scandal, also breaking in an election year, has to do with the involvement of Justin Trudeau and the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) in the SNC-Lavalin case.

SNC-Lavalin operates in a variety of sectors globally, including mining and metallurgy, oil and gas, and the fraud and corruption charges against it include nearly $48 million in payments made to Libyan government officials between 2001 and 2011.

The case centers around Liberal MP Jody Wilson-Raybould (JWR), who served as Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada from 2015 until January 2019. She was then demoted in a cabinet shuffle to the position of Minister of Veterans Affairs, and suddenly resigned several days ago (February 12) following the Globe and Mail report, which alleged that the PMO attempted to press her to intervene in the corruption and fraud prosecution of SNC-Lavalin in her role as Attorney General, in order to spare the engineering giant  deemed to be a crown jewel in Quebec  from criminal prosecution. The story also indicated that she came under heavy pressure.

Now the Commons Justice Committee will look into whether JWR was subjected to any kind of pressure from Trudeau and/or the PMO. Meanwhile, Trudeaus principal secretary, Gerald Butts, has suddenly quit. Butts is Trudeaus longtime friend, confidante and confidence booster, and some even say that Butts is his brains. Trudeau calls Butts the core of his inner circle. The resignation was over the SNC affair. Criminal charges could also be laid against members of the PMO for obstruction of justice, if its interference is established.

Doing Business with a Jihadist Government:

There is another twist in the criminal case involving SNC Lavalin, and the alleged involvement by Justin Trudeau and the PMO: Libya.

Between 2001 and 2011, a senior executive of SNC-Lavalin established close ties with Saadi Gaddafi, the son of the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The RCMP alleged that as the presidents son, Saadi Gaddafi was in a position of power and able to give a business advantage to SNC-Lavalin in Libya, and that he was a major recipient of SNCs largesse. Court documents allege that the company offered bribes worth $47.7 million to one or several public officials of the Great Socialist Peoples Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin was allegedly busy defrauding Libyan public agencies of approximately 129.8 million. Charges were laid by the RCMP against SNC executive Sami Bebawi and a former SNC executive vice president, Riadh Ben Aissa, who pleaded guilty to charges of corruption and money laundering relating to SNC-Lavalins Libyan operation. Aissa has since been extradited to Canada.

It has also been claimed that SNC paid for lavish trips and more for relatives of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and even had some on payroll to ensure they got lucrative contracts.

Saadi Gaddafi also has other unsavory personal baggage. He was acquitted last year of murdering Bashir al-Rayani, former footballer and coach of Tripolis Al-Ittihad football club. But now Bashirs family intends to appeal Gaddafis acquittal, because they say we could not get justice under his fathers regime, we will get it now, Im confident!

Some more background about the Libyan regime that SNC was allegedly wheeling and dealing with: Muammar Gaddafi seized power in Libya in a military coup detat in 1969. He was known for horrific human rights abuses, a supporter of jihad terror, fervently Islamic and pro‐Palestine, and once stated: Christianity is not a faith for people in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. Other people who are not sons of Israel have nothing to do with that religion .all those believers who do not follow Islam are losers ..We are here to correct the mistakes in the light of the teachings of the Koran. Gaddafi also declared that Iranians are our brothers and fed into the victimology narrative that America was the great oppressor.

So here is the Canadian government involved not only in possible obstruction of justice, but also in trying to cover up the links of SNC-Lavalin with the Gaddafi regime.

As Trudeau scrambles to do damage control, it should be remembered that he has embraced Islamic supremacists, as well as policies of open-door immigration, heedless of the costs of all this to taxpayers. Meanwhile, he perpetually downplays the dangers of jihad, to the peril of Canadian citizens.

Even the Liberal-leaning CBC noted that in the week since the SNC-Lavalin story broke, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has changed his talking points several times, and now risks brand damage. Between the Globe and Mail and the CBC, it doesnt look as if the $600,000,000 bailout package that Trudeau pledged to media, widely considered to be a bribe in an election year, is working in his favor.

In all 46 per cent of respondents said Canada is doing worse since Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government was elected in 2015, while only 22 per cent believed the country is doing better and 27 per cent said things are the same.

A poll conducted by Leger for The Canadian Press indicated the Trudeau Liberals haven’t convinced Canadians the country is doing better under their leadership. ( Riley Smith / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

Leger’s executive vice-president Christian Bourque said these numbers come despite economic indicators showing the country’s economy is performing better than in 2015. Regional concerns particularly in Western Canada over the state of the oil and gas industry, are affecting the way voters are viewing the overall state of the country, Bourque said. “In Alberta, for example, we see that 59 per cent of people believe Canada is doing worse, so there are regional issues affecting that overall number, but it is quite staggering,” Leger said.

The results were weighted to reflect age, gender, mother tongue, region and level of education in order to ensure a representative sample. While a margin of error cannot be associated with web-panel survey data, a probability sample of the same size would have a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

The poll also looked at what issues are most important to Canadians, suggesting pocketbook issues are what is top of mind. Economic growth and jobs topped the issues list for respondents, followed by taxes and finances. When asked whether the Trudeau government has done a good job or a poor job on specific issues, 22 per cent of respondents said they felt the Liberals have done a good job on the economy and employment and another 34 per cent are on the fence. Bourque said the economy is an area the Liberals should focus on as they prepare their campaign messaging for the upcoming federal election, with regional focuses since the level of concern over jobs and the economy varies depending on where Canadians live. “I think they need to demonstrate and spend time crafting out careful messages about how their plan for successive deficits is actually paying off and making our economy better,” Leger said. Another key finding in the survey suggests a hardening of public opinion against immigration in Canada. A total of 44 per cent of respondents said they believe Canada welcomes too many immigrants, and 45 per cent said the same of refugees. Meanwhile, 37 per cent said they believe Canada welcomes “enough” immigrants and only 11 per cent said Canada welcomes too few immigrants and refugees. These were similar to views expressed in a November survey, Bourque says, but notes that a shift has taken place in recent years indicating weakening support for immigration levels. In past years, there seemed to be consensus that Canada is a welcoming country for newcomers, but poll numbers suggest this perspective has changed. The Leger survey shows higher numbers of Conservative voters said they believed Canada welcomes too many immigrants, while Liberal voters are more content with current newcomer levels. There also appears to be little to no differentiation between economic immigrants and refugees, according to the survey results. “I think immigration is becoming a national issue and one that will need to be addressed by all parties in the fall,” Bourque said.

Quebec lawyers try to save immigrant applications amid crackdown

Reuters ^ | February 22, 2019 | by Allison Lampert

Posted on by Oldeconomybuyer

MONTREAL - Lawyers in the Canadian province of Quebec on Friday asked a judge to halt the suspension of almost 20,000 applications by immigrants caught up in a crackdown by the new center-right government.

Draft legislation by the Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) has triggered the suspension of 18,000 applications made under existing laws from immigrants seeking to live in the predominantly French-speaking province. The CAQ, which won power in October, has said that the reforms would improve newcomers integration into the workforce.

Lawyer group Association québécoise des avocats et avocates en droit de limmigration asked Quebec Superior Court Justice Frederic Bachand to order the government to process existing newcomers applications as the bill is being debated.

The CAQ campaigned on a pledge to cut immigration from 50,000 to 40,000 people a year and expel new residents who fail to pass tests on French and Quebec values within three years.

The policy could put Quebec on a collision course with the Liberals of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who are hoping to make gains in the province to offset expected losses elsewhere in a federal election this October.

Last year federal officials stressed that Ottawa had overall responsibility for immigration law in Canada.

The allegation is contained in a lawsuit filed by Vivian Bercovici, a former Canadian ambassador to Israel, who was appointed by the previous Conservative government of Stephen Harper and subsequently fired by the Trudeau Liberals.

Bercovici alleges she was terminated without being properly compensated for pension benefits, and that the government abused and harassed her. On Monday, her lawyer will petition the Ontario Court of Justice to amend the lawsuit to have Telford and four senior officials of Global Affairs Canada added as defendants. The allegations have not been proven in court, and the Prime Minister’s Office did not respond to a request for comment.

The Justice Department says in a reply filed in court last month that Bercovici’s “bold allegations” should be dismissed. Read More: Trudeau’s top aide resigns amid reports of meddling in SNC-Lavalin probe Opinion | Susan Delacourt: Here’s the downside of concentrating power in the Prime Minister’s Office Bercovici has been a source of controversy since Harper appointed her as his envoy to Israel in 2014. She was not a career diplomat — which is not unusual for high-profile ambassadorial appointments — but she faced internal opposition within the foreign ministry for being too pro-Israel. Bercovici is Jewish and a self-described supporter of Israel.

The Harper Conservatives faced frequent criticism that they were too pro-Israel in their Middle East stance, and vigorously rejected the long-held notion in Canadian diplomacy that Ottawa should see itself as an “honest broker” in the conflict between the Jewish state and the Palestinians. Bercovici’s lawsuit alleges she was unwelcomed by the bureaucracy from the moment she was appointed. She was “not only unsupported in her role, but the individual named Defendants as well as countless others within the Public Service, intentionally and maliciously waged a campaign of abuse” against her.

Article Continued Below

After the Liberals fired her in mid-2016 — as they were entitled to do — Bercovici alleges the government withheld almost $32,000 in pension benefits. She is suing for that amount, as well as millions of dollars in punitive and moral damages. Bercovici’s lawsuit alleges that she reached out to Telford repeatedly through emails and phone calls to deal with her pension issue, but was ignored each time. In her lawsuit, she is seeking $250,000 in damages from Telford for the “intentional affliction of mental suffering.” The motion to add Telford and four senior Global Affairs Canada officials as defendants was filed in December and is to be argued in a Toronto court on Monday. On Jan. 9, the Justice Department filed its reply with the court, arguing that there was no merit to adding five new defendants to the lawsuit. “The Plaintiff’s claims against the proposed individuals is frivolous and discloses no reasonable cause of action,” says the factum filed by the Justice Department. “The allegations made by the Plaintiff do not rise to the level of ‘flagrant and outrageous’ conduct. The Plaintiff has failed to plead any material facts to support her allegations of being ‘sidelined’, ‘threatened,’ ‘undermined’ or suffering ‘personal attacks.’ The Plaintiff makes bold allegations that are devoid of any particulars.” The long-simmering legal drama is unfolding as the Prime Minister’s Office grapples with the resignation of Butts, who served as Trudeau’s principal secretary and most trusted adviser. Butts denied any impropriety but said he was becoming a distraction to the government amid swirling allegations that unnamed officials in the Prime Minister’s Office put undue pressure on the former attorney general in a case involving engineering firm SNC-Lavalin. Butts and Telford were the architects of Trudeau’s rise to the Liberal party leadership and his subsequent 2015 election victory. Natalie MacDonald, Bercovici’s lawyer, suggested the current controversy enveloping the Prime Minister’s Office has resonance for her client. “We have pleaded that Katie Telford, a central figure in the PMO, purposely ignored repeated requests for immediate assistance and intervention with respect to the government’s unconscionable withholding of Ms. Bercovici’s pension monies,” MacDonald told The Canadian Press. “Our client was given no choice but to sue. Given what has come to light in Ottawa in recent weeks, we now question to what extent did the PMO direct the Attorney General to withhold Ms. Bercovici’s pension monies.”

528,Empty,2019-02-22T22:52:00Z,The Star breaks down five key issues in the Doug Ford government’s proposed policing legislation.,"When Ontario’s Attorney General proposed new policing legislation earlier this week, the message was clear: officers are “everyday heroes” who have the government’s unwavering support. “Our police deserve our respect,” said Caroline Mulroney at an announcement at Halton Regional Police Service headquarters, unveiling the Doug Ford government’s proposed plans to “fix” policing laws brought in under the previous government less than a year ago.

Mulroney was backed up by Sylvia Jones, the minister of community safety and correctional services, who said the Liberals’ omnibus policing legislation — known as the Safer Ontario Act, or Bill 175 — was a “disaster” and the “most anti-police legislation in Canadian history.” But hours later once the hefty 363-page legislation landed at Queen’s Park, it became evident the proposed legislation isn’t a complete rewrite of the previous government’s laws, which when passed in March were hailed as “historic” for strengthening police oversight. Some key parts are, in fact, identical.

What it is: Right now, police are expected to notify the SIU whenever it’s reasonable the watchdog’s mandate could be invoked: namely, when someone has died, been injured, or alleges they were sexually assaulted during any encounter with police. If there’s doubt, police are expected to err on the side of caution and let the SIU decide whether the threshold for an investigation has been met. Has it changed from the Liberals’ bill? Yes, though more in the spirit of the legislation’s interpretation. Mulroney specified that police services will no longer be expected to call the SIU for certain kinds of deaths — like when officers are present for a suicide, or when someone dies of a heart attack in their presence — provided its reasonably clear police conduct was not a contributing factor.

Article Continued Below

The intent, Mulroney said, is to spare officers a lengthy and stressful investigation into how they tried to save a life, and free up the SIU’s time and resources to focus on cases core to its mandate. In cases such as deaths and injuries caused by use of force, or allegations of sexual assault, notification of the SIU will still be mandatory. When the watchdog probes cases of an officer unsuccessfully attempting to save a life, “he or she is treated like a suspect,” Mulroney said, and “this is not what the SIU should be doing.” Why it matters: The issue has been a thorny one between police and the watchdog, most recently over to the growing number of officers carrying naloxone, an antidote to opioid overdoses — yet another instance where an officer may fail at saving a life, then become the subject of an SIU probe. But the debate dates back more than two decades, and in 1998 the disputes prompted a review of by former Ontario Superior Court judge George Adams. “The issue of notification must be treated more like that of calling an ambulance — when in doubt, call,” he concluded.

Adams acknowledged the approach would result in unnecessary calls to the SIU, but he said the public would have more confidence in a decision not to investigate if it was made by an independent body. And while the SIU has the reputation amongst many police services for unfathomably long investigations, it does have the ability to examine an incident and decide not to pursue a full-fledged probe — a process called “closed by memo”. This allows the watchdog to at first scrutinize a death, injury or allegation, then decide no probe is needed. This has occurred, for example, in deaths involving an officer administering naloxone. On average, those investigations have been terminated in less than one month. The SIU can also quickly decide not to investigate — as recently happened in the case of Roopesh Rajkumar, the father alleged to have killed his 11-year-old daughter, Riya, after it was discovered he had suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound before OPP officers arrested him (he later died). Under the proposed legislation, it’s likely the watchdog will no longer be called. Though welcomed by police associations this week, the change presents a slippery slope, says Kingsley Gilliam, a founding member of the Black Action Defence Committee (BADC), whose advocacy in the 1980s was a catalyst for the creation of the SIU. The group protested in the streets precisely because they did not want police making the determination on when an investigation was warranted. “Which police officer is going to squeal on his partner to say that he committed a criminal act?” he asked. Issue No. 2 — Suspension without pay What it is: Determining when Ontario’s police chiefs can suspend an officer without pay when he or she is facing criminal charges or serious misconduct allegations. Ontario is the only province in Canada that requires, by law, that an officer must be paid while suspended unless they are sentenced to jail time. Has it changed from the Liberals’ bill? No. Similar to Bill 175, the proposed COPS Act would allow for a few more circumstances in which an officer might be suspended without pay, including for convictions for an offence, even if it’s under appeal, or when an officer is charged with certain serious offences, to be determined in future regulations.

Why it matters: The ability for chiefs to suspend more officers without pay has been called upon for years, foremost by the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police (OACP). The province’s strict stance is widely perceived as both a waste of tax money and, too often, an embarrassment. A few high-profile cases have exposed how officers facing serious allegations have continued to collect a large salary for years. In 2015, a Waterloo Regional Police officer made headlines with a mocking email in which he thanked his service for the perks of his three-year paid suspension — a “dream come true” which included golf, travel and the ability to take a firefighter course. In another case, former Toronto Police Const. Ioan Floria was paid while suspended for 11 years before he was fired last year. Jeff McGuire, executive director of the OACP, said earlier this week that police chiefs did not see what they wanted in the proposed legislation. “It’s not something we relish or look forward to doing,” McGuire said, “but as the managers of the service there are times when, in our opinion, we should have the authority to suspend without pay. And it is very limited right now.” Issue No. 3 — SIU transparency requirements What it is: Requiring that the SIU provide greater details about its decisions to not lay any charges against the police. This would ideally come in the form of a publicly available report, complete with relevant photos, videos, a narrative of the incident and detailed account of how the SIU came to its decision.

Has this changed from the Liberals’ bill? No. This is was a central tenet of the Liberals’ Safer Ontario Act, and its virtually ‘copy-pasted’ into the COPS legislation, though the PC bill does add that “any delays” in the investigation be noted in the required timeline. Why it matters: Up until the high-profile death of Andrew Loku, a Black mentally ill man killed by Toronto police in 2015, the SIU provided limited explanation of its decisions, via a press release announcing whether an officer would be charged. In his 2017 review of police oversight in Ontario, Justice Michael Tulloch had a laser-focus on transparency, and one of his key recommendations was that the agency become “more open, candid, and communicative,” including by releasing detailed public reports “in every case in which it does not lay charges.” He noted there was an “overwhelming need for greater transparency.” The SIU has since adopted a practice of providing far more extensive reports on some cases where no charge is laid, including fatal police use of force. The COPS Act, however, will make this reporting required by law, as the Liberals’ bill would have accomplished. “I’m pleased they kept it in — I’m surprised they kept it in,” said Sandy Hudson, one of the founding members of Black Lives Matter Toronto, which demanded the release of far more information about Loku’s shooting death and all other SIU investigations. “We fought a lot for transparency. It’s something that we need in order to actually understand what is happening in our communities,” she said. She added, however, that the provision of requiring more information is undercut by giving police “far more discretion on when they call the SIU” due to the changes to notification requirements.

Issue No. 4 — Public complaints about police What it is: Revamping Ontario’s independent police complaints agency. Currently, complaints about the police in Ontario can be filed with the Office of the Independent Police Review Director (OIPRD). Established in 2008, the office accepts and screens complaints about police across Ontario, determining whether further investigation is required. If so, the agency either assigns one of its own investigators to the case, or refers it back to the police service in question. The OIPRD also conducts systemic reviews to tackle larger issues within policing in the province. Late last year, the agency wrapped a major probe into the Thunder Bay Police Service’s handling of cases involving deaths or disappearances of Indigenous people. Has this changed from the Liberals’ bill? Yes. The PC legislation acts on a Tulloch recommendation to rename the organization, whose unwieldy title and acronym confuse citizens and police alike. Under COPS, the OIPRD would become the Law Enforcement Complaints Agency (LECA), its mandate would include some special constables and peace officers, and it would retain the ability to launch systemic investigations. Similar to how the complaints body works now, the proposed LECA would receive complaints then either investigate in house, or assign a probe to a police service, including the service where the complaint originated. That’s a departure from Bill 175’s proposed “Ontario Policing Complaints Agency” — the Liberals had demanded that, within a five-year period the agency be fully independent, no longer referring complaints out. Why it matters: As noted in Tulloch’s report, the vast majority of public complaints brought to the OIPRD are referred back to the police service for investigation, which he concluded “erodes public confidence in the complaints process.” During his broad public consultation, the judge found a “deep mistrust of the public complaints process,” and the referral back to police services was “seen as a major impediment to a good-faith and impartial investigation.” Gilliam, from BADC, had lauded recent efforts to make the complaints system fully independent.

“That’s a retrograde move there,” said of the PC’s proposed complaints body, noting the Liberals’ bill would have meant “some semblance of confidence could be restored.” “This is a setback,” he said. Issue No. 5 — SIU power to charge civilians What it is: Determining whether the SIU should be allowed to investigate and charge non-police officers. Currently, the SIU can investigate and charge a civilian, even though its core mandate is to probe the actions of police officers. They can do so if the civilian is involved in alleged criminal activity alongside a police officer. The situation is exceedingly rare, but the watchdog did charge a civilian in 2017: Christian Theriault, who alongside his Toronto police officer brother Michael Theriault, is alleged to have assaulted Dafonte Miller in a high-profile incident in late 2016. Has this changed from the Liberals’ bill? Yes. Bill 175 had provided for the watchdog to continue to be able to investigate a civilian under certain circumstances. The PC bill removes that power. “Police would still be able to investigate in such situations, allowing the SIU to concentrate on its core mandate,” according to Ontario government backgrounder. Why it matters: In the case of the Theriault brothers — who are set to go to trial later this year — the incident was the subject of widespread public outrage, with members of the public and Miller’s lawyer Julian Falconer alleging there had been the “deliberate concealment” of a crime. That’s because the SIU had not been called in to investigate the circumstances surrounding Miller’s severe injuries, including damage to his eye, following an encounter with the Theriault brothers in Whitby; neither Toronto police, who employ Michael Theriault, nor the Durham Regional Police Service, where the incident occurred, notified the watchdog. As pointed out by Falconer and others, the Theriault brothers’ father was employed at the time in the Toronto police professional standards unit. Under the proposed PC system, the investigation into Christian Theriault would have instead been taken over by police, which Toronto lawyer Daniel Brown says would not inspire confidence, given the perception of bias in the case. He says though they are uncommon, there may be other instances where the SIU should be allowed to investigate and charge a civilian in order to ensure public confidence in the probe. “These instances are rare, but given that, why are we so worried about the SIU investigating them?” Wendy Gillis is a Toronto-based reporter covering crime and policing.

It is how well you frame and control the narrative around your defence against accusations. On that test, this government has not succeeded. It has had an overly tactical approach to criticisms and miniscandals from its earliest days. But there is an earlier question here that trumps all: Why did this government not grasp the nettle about the SNC-Lavalin mess earlier? By failing to realize they had only a binary choice: instruct the justice minister to negotiate a heavy fine and no trial, or allow the trial to go ahead and let the political chips fall where they may. They laid this very dangerous hostage to fortune themselves.

But that is not the reason Gerald Butts stepped down as Trudeau’s principal secretary. After all he had weathered plenty of bad stories before — the Aga Khan fling or the Bollywood family holiday? No, Butts probably offered his head for two other reasons principally. One, he wants to be free to defend himself publicly. Two, he understood he was becoming a lightning rod internally for many in cabinet and caucus unhappy about his gatekeeping role in the PMO. Every PMO has someone in that chair, and with it comes the job of taking bullets for the boss. But when you become the target, not merely the shield, it’s time to go.

Jim Coutts played a similar role for Pierre Trudeau and Eddie Goldenberg for Jean Chrétien. Like them, Butts became an object of regular complaint — that comes with the role for anyone doing this job well. He may have understood that he might be more useful as an external campaign guru and strategic communications adviser than playing such an all-consuming role central to the government. But his departure leaves two very serious problems in his wake. The first is what to do about the SNC-Lavalin problem itself. It’s future as a Canadian company is at risk. This would be a game-changer for the upcoming federal election in Quebec — potentially placing the Trudeau government’s very survival at risk. Secondly, what’s next for the structure of the PMO/PCO and political staff teams around the PM and senior ministers? Some of the best staffers will need to be poached from ministers’ offices to help fill the gaping hole that Butts’ departure has created — that may lead to other knock-on problems, now only a few months before an election. It is early days to write Butts political obituary. He has already a legacy of achievement that few can match: engineering a far from inevitable leadership victory, whipping the Tories and the NDP soundly with a creative youth-focused campaign, and then playing a central role in a government that until recently appeared unbeatable. Not bad for seven year’s work. Was he too high-profile and too partisan? Yes. Yet is it also true that he understood, as he said in explaining his decision to leave that, “public institutions are bigger and more important than any of their temporary occupants.” And it seems unlikely that anyone else could have engineered Trudeau’s success on his behalf. Their personal relationship may have been a weakness in times when the boss needed tough love and serious course correction, but it also created an incredibly powerful political partnership.

So now our latest political scandal will reach its crescendo, far too close to the election for comfort. There may be duelling narratives from the former minister and the former PMO boss. There may well be an inquiry into how the government got itself in this mess. There will at least be stormy days in committee and Question Period ahead. It should have, could have, been avoided if this government had less of a propensity to think and operate tactically, worrying about today’s headline or tomorrow’s nasty Question Period. If they had cared more about endgames strategically.

They knew that the former justice minister was a difficult minister to move when she had made up her mind. Why didn’t they anticipate that and make the tough political choice either in favour of SNC-Lavalin, or the even tougher one of letting the prosecution roll? There never was a middle ground. So, Gerald Butts leaves a complicated political legacy for his leader and his government. But we will hear from him again, probably soon. Robin V.

530,Empty,2019-02-22T09:00:00Z,"Michael Wernick, Canada's top bureaucrat, testified before the Commons justice committee Thursday, saying he did not inappropriately pressure former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to cut a legal deal with the Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin —…","Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, Canada's top bureaucrat, testified before the Commons justice committee Thursday, saying he did not inappropriately pressure former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to cut a legal deal with the Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin — although he did warn her of the consequences of prosecuting the criminal charges.

More than any other government player said to be involved in this ballooning controversy, Wernick spoke in clear terms about what he saw happening inside the machinery of government as the federal Liberals grappled with the file.

In 2015, the Mounties laid corruption and fraud charges against SNC-Lavalin over allegations it used bribery to secure government contracts in Libya.

In an effort to avoid a criminal trial, SNC-Lavalin lobbied a cross-section of cabinet ministers, MPs, senators, senior bureaucrats and premiers, asking that some sort of remediation agreement be reached that would allow it to avoid a criminal conviction. A conviction would exclude the firm from bidding on future government contracts for up to 10 years — which could financially cripple the company and threaten its continued viability.

Here are five things we learned from Wernick's testimony:

1. Wernick takes aim at Globe story

Earlier this month, on Feb. 7, the Globe and Mail published the initial report that claimed Wilson-Raybould was pressured to direct the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to sign a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — a legal tool resembling a plea deal — with SNC-Lavalin.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, have denied any wrongdoing.

Wernick said Thursday that he thought the Globe's reporting on the matter was inaccurate.

""I'm here to say to you that the Globe and Mail article contains errors, unfounded speculation and, in some cases, is simply defamatory,"" he said.

The article — citing unnamed, anonymous sources — said that Trudeau's senior aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould to intervene and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the high-profile justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs.

‘I'm here to say to you that the Globe and Mail article contains errors, unfounded speculation and, in some cases, is simply defamatory,’ Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council, said. 5:31

While there was much debate inside government about what should be done about the criminal allegations, Wernick repeatedly denied Thursday the claim Trudeau, or officials in the PMO, exerted inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould to cut the company some slack.

""We are discussing lawful advocacy that the minister take a lawful decision, which in the end she did not take,"" he told the justice committee.

""What Canadians need to know is that, despite a massive government relations effort, meetings with MPs, staffers, leaders of the opposition, paid advertising, pressure put through two premiers of Quebec, they didn't get what they wanted. If it's a movie, it's a flop.""

2. The September meeting

On Sept. 4, the prosecution service told SNC-Lavalin, in writing, that it would not negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — paving the way for a trial on the matter at a later date.

Wernick said that in a Sept. 17 meeting between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould — which the clerk said was principally called to attend to another matter before cabinet, namely the drafting of a new framework on Indigenous rights — the SNC-Lavalin matter was raised.

He corroborated the prime minister's account of the meeting.

As attorney general, Wilson-Raybould could overrule the prosecution service, directing it to negotiate an agreement with the company.

Trudeau said Wilson-Raybould asked him that day if he planned to tell her what to do — and he said he told her that any decision on the matter was hers alone to make.

Michael Wernick the Clerk of the Privy Council spoke to the Commons Justice committee on Thursday 3:39

The next day, on Sept. 18, SNC-Lavalin representatives met with Wernick. The clerk said he doesn't remember the substance of the conversation or whether the representatives told him that the public prosecution service had denied a request for a DPA.

On Feb. 12, a week after the Globe and Mail story broke, Wilson-Raybould resigned her cabinet position. Trudeau said he was surprised and disappointed that she quit cabinet, adding that if she felt undue pressure in her role as attorney general, she had a duty to report it to him.

3. Solicitor-client privilege doesn't apply: Wernick

Wilson-Raybould has so far refused to speak publicly about what transpired on the SNC-Lavalin file, saying only that solicitor-client privilege stemming from her time as justice minister forbids her from commenting.

Wernick said Thursday that, while he's not a lawyer, he doesn't believe she should be constrained from telling her side of the story because solicitor-client privilege simply doesn't apply in this case.

""My conclusion, as someone who spends a lot of time in governance ... I do not see where the former attorney general was a solicitor,"" Wernick said.

Michael Wernick the Clerk of the Privy Council spoke to the Commons Justice committee Thursday 0:27

""The prime minister said at every occasion verbally and in writing that she was the decider, so she was not giving legal advice to the prime minister. She was the decider — the full and final decider.""

Wernick added that the matter was never discussed in cabinet and thus, in his opinion, she is also not bound by cabinet confidentiality.

""There was never, never, never a cabinet conversation about the prosecution,"" he said.

4. Wernick warned Wilson-Raybould about the 'consequences'

Wernick revealed Thursday that, in a Dec. 19 phone call with Wilson-Raybould, he did warn of the consequences of not moving ahead with a DPA for SNC-Lavalin.

He said he told Wilson-Raybould that the prime minister and ""a lot of her colleagues"" were anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press — articles warning that the company could close down or move if criminal proceedings went ahead.

""Part of my conversations ... was conveying context — that there were a lot of people worried about what would happen, the consequences, not for her, the consequences for the workers and the communities and the suppliers,"" he said.

SNC-Lavalin is a major firm, a pillar of corporate Canada, and employs more than 9,000 people across the country, including 3,400 in Quebec, 3,000 in Ontario and just over 1,000 in B.C.

The company, which is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange, is widely held by Canadian shareholders, including many of the largest pension plans and mutual funds.

""There's pressure to get it right on every decision. To approve, to not approve, to act, to not act. I am quite sure the minister felt pressure to get it right,"" Wernick said.

""There was no inappropriate pressure put on the minister — at any time.""

In the end, he said, the matter may boil down to an interpretation of what constitutes 'pressure'.

""I can tell you with complete assurance that my view of those conversations is that they were within the boundaries of what's lawful and appropriate. I was informing the minister of context. She may have another view of the conversation, but that's something the ethics commissioner could sort out,"" he said.

5. Wilson-Raybould never wanted an Indigenous portfolio

While Wilson-Raybould disagreed vehemently with Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett on how best to pursue the implementation of a new Indigenous rights framework, she herself never wanted to hold any of the Indigenous cabinet positions, Wernick said.

""She played a very particular role in cabinet. She did not ever want to be the Indigenous affairs minister. She didn't want to be the Indigenous Services or [Crown-Indigenous Relations] minister, and be the Indian agent for her own people,"" he said.",What we learned from Canada's top bureaucrat about the SNC-Lavalin affair,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tasker-five-things-michael-wernick-snc-lavalin-1.5028922
531,Empty,2019-02-21T21:36:16Z,"If she wasn't demoted as punishment, then why?","Let’s cut to the chase: Despite the cascade of revelations surrounding the crisis consuming the Trudeau government, the situation has become much clearer.

From everything we know now, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his top adviser did everything they could to get Jody Wilson-Raybould to block a prosecution against SNC-Lavalin on corruption charges. Their argument — and we have the prime minister’s own statement in the House of Commons on this — was prompted by intense concern over the potential economic impact of the trial, including lost jobs.

Last year the Liberals slipped through a new law specially tailored to let SNC-Lavalin escape such a trial. But the law itself prevents economic concerns from being considered when deciding to apply it. So it would appear that the prime minister was asking Wilson-Raybould to overlook the very rules his government had put in place, even after a decision had been made to proceed with prosecution.

The bitter dispute that has developed centres on whether or not the efforts by Trudeau, and his former principal secretary Gerald Butts, constituted undue pressure. Liberal caucus members, justifiably alarmed at the damage the party has been doing to itself, now seem willing to buy into Trudeau’s insistence that he and Butts acted correctly. But the facts are running against them.

It would appear that the prime minister was asking Wilson-Raybould to overlook the very rules his government had put in place

A timeline that emerged Wednesday undermines Trudeau’s claim. The decision to proceed against Lavalin was made by director of public prosecutions Kathleen Roussel on Sept. 4. Wilson-Raybould had the power to reverse that decision, and Trudeau met with her two weeks later to discuss the matter. He acknowledges that — while he told her it was her decision to make — the economic consequences were raised.

When Wilson-Raybould stuck by Roussel, another meeting was arranged, this time with Butts, on Dec. 5. The get-together came after Lavalin launched an intense lobbying campaign with senior members of the government in the wake of Roussel’s decision. There can be little doubt the focus of the campaign was a desperate attempt to have Roussel’s decision reversed. Only Wilson-Raybould could do that, and she was so worried about the PMO’s actions that she asked Trudeau directly whether he was ordering her to block the case.

He said no, yet six weeks later, there was Butts raising the issue with her once again. What possible reason could he have for doing so unless to make clear that her boss, the prime minister, very much wanted her to change her mind and save Lavalin from its fate, and the political damage to the Liberals likely to flow from it. Leaks from Wednesday’s cabinet meeting — and the continuation of damaging leaks from inside cabinet is another sign of the discord within the party — indicate that Wilson-Raybould felt both Trudeau and Butts acted improperly.

As the Conservative deputy leader, Lisa Raitt, noted Wednesday: “If SNC-Lavalin had already been denied a special deal through an independent process and then the prime minister met with Ms. Wilson-Raybould to reaffirm her authority, the message to her would seem clear — that he’s not happy with the decision and that she should get involved.”

In addition to Trudeau and Butts, Wilson-Raybould also heard from Michael Wernick, the clerk of the privy council, Canada’s top bureaucrat. He told the justice committee Thursday he considered the conversations were “entirely appropriate, lawful (and) legal.”

Allowing her to speak her mind, as she persists in demanding, evidently hasn’t yet entered his list of considerations

Wilson-Raybould believes that, whatever Trudeau and the others might claim, the repeat meetings were clear efforts to pressure her. Despite that belief, she has held to her position, and reinforced it once again Wednesday, even after Butts’ resignation, and after Trudeau pulled a belated apology out of his hat. The prime minister is a great believer in apologies; Wilson-Raybould’s refusal to be swayed by his olive branch must further perplex and frustrate him. Here’s a woman who believes what she believes, and won’t be talked out of it. He clearly can’t figure out how to get his way with her, which is what he still wants. Allowing her to speak her mind, as she persists in demanding, evidently hasn’t yet entered his list of considerations.

He’s in a box now. Wilson-Raybould is scheduled to appear before the justice committee next week. She wants Trudeau to lift all restrictions on what she is allowed to say. His refusal to do so has only strengthened the suspicion he’s afraid of what he’ll hear, or has something to hide. By continuing to keep the gag on, he risks the possibility she’ll cancel her appearance, putting the spotlight squarely on the PMO. If he lets her speak, and she repeats what she allegedly said to cabinet, she puts him in the position of explaining why his justice minister and attorney general felt he was acting improperly, and why he continued nonetheless.

This is a crisis that has become all about Justin Trudeau. He has badly mishandled the affair from the beginning, driving one of his most important cabinet appointments into a rebellion over who is to be believed. He has undermined his oft-repeated claims of devotion to a feminist agenda and Indigenous reconciliation. He is seeking to control the damage via a wall of silence that belies his pledge of an open and transparent administration. He is forcing members of his caucus to choose sides, putting their fear of public fallout against the words of a colleague whose job was to protect and follow the law.

And he has yet to answer why he demoted Wilson-Raybould from her job after she stood up to him. If not as punishment, then why? And if it was indeed punishment, what does that say about Justin Trudeau, his respect for women, and all the talk of higher principles we’ve had from this government?

Indeed, as she and Attorney General Caroline Mulroney introduced their government’s Comprehensive Ontario Police Services, or COPS, Act this week, Jones crowed that it will replace a proposed Liberal law that “was quite frankly the most anti-police legislation in Canadian history.”

Community Safety Minister Sylvia Jones with Premier Doug Ford. ( Rick Madonik / Toronto Star )

If that’s the case, then why does her own bill draw so heavily from the Liberals’ initiative that legal experts say it amounts to just a “rebranding” of Wynne’s Safer Ontario Act? In fact, rhetoric aside, the government’s effort at police reform is a lot closer to what the Liberals had proposed than the Progressive Conservatives would like to admit. And as such, it shows that far from being “anti-police,” the Liberals were actually on the right track when they brought in changes last year aimed at ensuring that police forces across the province have the kind of effective oversight needed to ensure public confidence.

Article Continued Below

The bottom line is the Ford government would have been wiser to have just enacted the Liberal legislation with a tweak or two rather than delaying the changes and wrapping them in a lot of pro-police verbiage. Instead, they put the Liberal bill on hold last June 30, spent months on yet more consultations on top of those the Wynne government had already held (the goal of which seemed only to make nice with police unions), and then introduced a massive 350-page piece of legislation which now must be passed before anything is implemented. In the meantime, important initiatives have been on hold. Take, for example, probes by the Special Investigations Unit, which are required every time a police officer fires their gun at a person. Under the Liberal legislation the SIU would have been required to wrap up investigations in 120 days or less, and report every 60 days thereafter if there were any delays.

On this point, all the PCs did was to tweak (smartly, in this case) the Liberal legislation to require that the watchdog report every 30 days after their deadline. But to hear Jones speak you wouldn’t know the new SIU reporting requirements were originally a Liberal proposal.

Article Continued Below

She even seemed to blame the Liberals for the fact that the SIU probe into the death of Danforth shooter Faisal Hussain, who killed two people and injured 13 others last July, dragged on for six months. In fact, that investigation presumably wouldn’t have gone on for so long if her government had simply implemented the Liberal legislation last summer instead of putting it on hold. It’s not just the delay in good legislation that is a problem. Jones’s rhetoric, combined with the ongoing pandering to police associations, is concerning because it gives the appearance that the government is more beholden to cops than to the citizens they are sworn to serve. Indeed, the only thing the Ford government may have achieved with this new legislation and the language surrounding its introduction is to undermine public trust in police. And that’s just the opposite of what Jones claims the goal of the entire process was.

Kamala Harris blasted by her own dad for pushing negative stereotypes about Jamaicans

For someone running for the president of the U.S. on a politically correct identity politics ticket, it sure doesn't look good when you gratuitously throw out a negative stereotype of anyone. If you're shameless enough, not a problem. But when your own dad calls you out, yes, there is a problem. The blowback is here for Kamala Harris, who in a bid to pander to the pot vote, promoted the scuzzy stereotype of Jamaica as the pothead nation.

Much of the attention from her disastrous interview with 'Charlemagne tha God' on a Bay Area radio station rightly went to her strange timeline of pot smoking, answering the question of who she listened to when she got high, from Charlamagne tha God and his sidekick, DJEnvy, after she confirmed she smoked pot in college.

Her giggling Cheech-and-Chong-like response was this:

HARRIS: And look, I joke about it — half-joking — half my family’s from Jamaica. Are you kidding me?

Half joking?

That didn't go down well with Harris's father, Stanford University Professor Emeritus Donald Harris, 81, a Jamaican-American who, unlike her, has actually accomplished something.

I knew this was going to happen. In a devastating article published in MacLean's, the leading Canadian news magazine, the retired professor of economics told a Jamaican news wire that Harris's stereotyping of Jamaicans as potheads - and pursuit of identity politics - was as distasteful as hell.

MacLean's writes Her father exploded. Donald Harris, 81, professor emeritus of economics at Stanford University, divorced from Shyamala Gopalan since 1972, offered this comment to the website Jamaica Global Online, whose editor, Ian Randle, shared it exclusively with Maclean’s: My dear departed grandmothers, as well as my deceased parents, must be turning in their grave right now to see their family’s name, reputation and proud Jamaican identity being connected, in any way, jokingly or not with the fraudulent stereotype of a pot-smoking joy seeker and in the pursuit of identity politics. Speaking for myself and my immediate Jamaican family, we wish to categorically dissociate ourselves from this travesty.

Payless has 248 stores across Canada, and 2,500 stores in North America.

The company said in a news release after the filing on Monday that it expects these outlets will begin shutting down at the end of March though it intends for “many stores (to) remain open through the end of May.”

“Over the years, we have had highs and lows amidst significant operational and market challenges,” the company said in a recent letter to its customers. “Despite our best efforts to address the rapidly changing retail environment, we — like many other retailers — have been forced to face very difficult choices.”

Payless describes how its goal of maintaining its brand while continuing to reach customers around the world caused it to file for an earlier bankruptcy in April 2017.

This time, mounting debts and a challenging retail market are the source of the company’s woes, and it is costing 2,400 Canadians their jobs. However, the retailer’s stores abroad, including in Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia, will continue to operate.

In its news release, Payless said that the company is “seeking customary initial relief from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and Canadian Court.” It said these relief methods include getting authorization to support its operations during the bankruptcy and to continue paying its employees’ wages, along with maintaining health-care benefits.

It also said it is seeking authorization to allow customer gift cards and store credits to be redeemed until March 11. Returns and exchanges of certain non-final sale purchases made before Feb. 17 of this year will be possible until March 1.

Lauren Jeffords, senior director of corporate communications at Payless, was unable to comment on the impact the closure will have on its Ottawa employees.

Here, from","Mark is at the Oncenter in Syracuse, New York with the great Dennis Miller tonight, so, in lieu of his Saturday movie column and with tomorrow's Academy Awards looming, we thought we'd take a look back at some Steyn Oscar columns of the past. Here, from his Spectator review of twenty years ago, are Mark's thoughts on the 1999 ceremony:

Around the time of his fiftieth birthday, when he was having a little difficulty attracting A-list celebrities, President Clinton opined wistfully to a friend that it would be nice to go to a gala in his honour that wasn't hosted by Whoopi Goldberg. After Sunday's Oscars ceremony, we all know how he feels. I thought she'd have difficulty improving on her last gig three years ago, when after hearing ""Colours Of The Wind"", the overwrought eco-ballad from Pocahontas, she mused that she'd always wondered about the colour of her wind. On the evidence of her tacky commentary on Sunday night, the colour would seem to be grey: it wasn't just windy, it was stale and flat and hung in the air. If you're going to get into the ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" gags a year late, you have to do better than Whoopi's dull quips about A Bug's Life being ""The Linda Tripp Story"". It was a timely reminder that lazy mainstream Hollywood easy-listening liberalism is somehow even more irritating than those unreconstructed Stalinist fellow travellers outside the hall demanding Elia Kazan apologise. Come back, Billy Crystal, David Letterman, Bob Hope, anyone.

The awards themselves, as distinct from the show, were more interesting. Academy voters, for whatever reasons, had chosen to reject precisely the kind of film that, come Oscar time, Hollywood likes best: commercial pap with aspirations. It seems only yesterday that American critics were hailing The Truman Show as surefire Oscar material: who now even remembers it? In the end - that's to say, the final award of the evening - the same fate befell even Saving Private Ryan. The Academy was always going to have a hard job resisting Roberto Benigni, but I felt sorry for Best Actor nominee Ian McKellen, who gives a lovely performance in Gods and Monsters that's as good as anything he's ever done - better even. The villain roles, from Richard III down, can by their very nature never quite tap into that distinctive softness, gentleness of McKellen. This film does, in a way we've never seen before.

He's playing James Whale, the once famous director of Frankenstein (the 1931 Boris Karloff version, still the best), The Invisible Man (the 1933 Claude Rains version, also the best) and Show Boat (the 1936 Helen Morgan/Irene Dunne/Paul Robeson version, likewise). On 29 May 1957, Whale wound up at the bottom of his pool 'in mysterious circumstances', an obscure Gloria Swanson type reduced to playing his own William Holden. And there he lay, more or less, until a 1995 book by Christopher Bram, Father of Frankenstein. To the dying embers of Whale's reputation, Bram served as, er, stoker, and this film is one of the happy results. Most of the events depicted here are fictitious, but Bill Condon directs with a droll, precise command that is as much a tribute to Whale as anything else. We are in the last months of his life, and Whale has time on his hands and, indeed, on his eyelids and in his consonants: to listen to the way McKellen's Whale lingers over his own name 'Hhwwwhhhale' - is to understand the sprawling emptiness of his days. After 1941, he made just one film - a 40-minute adaptation of a William Saroyan play that was never released: this is a man who has had all the time in the world to perfect every detail of an empty existence - or, as Whale puts it, in a line whose delivery ought to have earned the actor an Oscar all by itself, ""My pyjamas are all tailored.""

McKellen holds the picture together with a kind of enervated panache and, even when the surrounding campery gets out of whack, he never does. I wouldn't change a thing, except maybe the title, which I'll bet is one reason why it didn't do as well at the US box-office and at the Oscars as it should have. Father of Frankenstein was much better.

As for Elia Kazan that night two decades ago, Steyn wrote in Mark Steyn's Passing Parade:

Kazan can make a claim to be the father of modern American acting, having brought Stanislavskian techniques to Broadway and then to film through Marlon Brando, James Dean, and Rod Steiger. He was the best theater director of the forties and fifties, and later a fine novelist, and when he walked onstage in 1999 to receive a belated Lifetime Achievement Oscar, he might reasonably have expected the orchestra to be vamping Leonard Bernstein's theme to On the Waterfront for a good ten minutes while Hollywood roared its appreciation. Instead, outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion elderly hack screenwriters led protests, and inside, the likes of Sean Penn sat on their hands. For both Hollywood's ancient D-list Communists and its A-list anti-anti-Communists, there's only one thing about Kazan that matters: he ""named names..."" As the former blacklisted screenwriter Norma Barzman told CNN, ""Elia Kazan's lifetime achievement is great films and destroyed lives, and even a third thing, which is a lasting climate of fear over Hollywood and maybe over the country...""

At gatherings in the arts it's boorish and tedious to become too exercised about communism—no matter how many faraway, foreign, unglamorous people it kills. Elia Kazan was on the right side of history. His enemies line up with the apologists for thugs and tyrants. Whose reputation would you bet on in the long run?

And here's Mark's Spectator column five years later on the 2004 Oscars, the year of Tolkien:

It was a night of triumph for British film. Well, okay, it wasn't. ""UK Overlooked By Oscar Voters"" was the BBC headline. ""Whatever Happened To The Brit Pack?"" wondered The Scotsman. ""Ring Of Failure,"" declared a gloomy Birmingham Post, waking up to the bleak realization that the only Tolkien tourism boom was going to be the stampede to New Zealand to see the actual Shire where the great Kiwi author wrote his famous fantasy.

So it was a crummy night for British film. But it was a great night for British Commonwealth film – New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, even Britain (the one-third of the Best Song written by Annie Lennox, plus make-up man Peter King and set designer Alan Lee, all three sharing in the Hobbit spoils); even my own decayed Dominion picked up Best Foreign-Language Film for Les Invasions Barbares. If the Eurocentric UK press weren't so parochial, it would hail the Oscars as a grand triumph for what the Queen calls ""our Commonwealth family"": if you were a nominee who had the good fortune to be a subject of the Crown, you had a much better chance of taking home a statuette than those poor souls cursed to be free-born citizens of the United States.

Indeed, the Oscars are a much better – or, at any rate, less feeble - advertisement for the Imperial family than the Commonwealth Conference. If I were Her Majesty, I'd make it the theme of this year's Christmas message: start with one of those sappy Oscar-intro things about movies bringing the world together to sit in the dark and dare to dream our dreams, blah, blah, and then put her next to an Alberta key grip and a New South Wales gaffer showing her how to grip and gaff (""Really? How interesting"") and end with her asking Charlize Theron's mum about the night she shot Charlize's dad (""Really? How interesting"").

Billy Crystal had some cute cracks about down under: ""It's official,"" he announced halfway through the night. ""There's now no-one left to thank in New Zealand."" But an opening reference to the Great White North was more pointed: ""All of Hollywood is here. It's like the Canadian Oscars."" Hollywood is the only place on the planet frightened of Canada. New Zealand is still an exotic, remote location, but Vancouver and Montreal are the default backlot. When Clint Eastwood insisted Mystic River, set in Boston, actually be filmed in Boston, it was considered as radical a move as when Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen insisted on filming On The Town in New York. In those days, if they wanted Manhattan or the mid-west or the Rockies or darkest Africa they built a set. Now they just do it in Canada: ""New York"" is Toronto, ""Philadelphia"" is Calgary... The film unions, from the carpenters to the bit-players, are sick of it.

On the campaign trail, John Kerry keeps hammering corporations about ""outsourcing"" and ""exporting"" American jobs. But you'd be hard put to find as outsourced an industry as Hollywood, except maybe children's toys. The only difference is that, unlike the toy makers, the guys making the big decisions at head office in LA seem to have forgotten the basic business rule: KYC – Know Your Customers. All last week, Oscar types were whining that Mel Gibson was stealing their buzz. That's true to the extent that it was a buzz-less Oscars, and on the big night even the frocks were dull, with a pronounced lack of cleavage, save for game gals of a certain age like Jamie Lee Curtis and Susan Sarandon. But the buzz about Mel's movie came from the Hollywooden liberals in the big media who've spent the best part of a year warning that The Passion Of The Christ was going to be the biggest thing on the anti-semitic scene since The Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion. All those liberal columnists who champion the necessity of brave transgressive artists when it comes to giving us a horny Jesus (The Last Temptation Of Christ), a gay Jesus (the Broadway play Corpus Christi) or a Jesus floating in the artist's urine (Piss Christ) have finally discovered a Jesus it would be grossly irresponsible to show to the public.

But what's really hilarious is Hollywood's failure to get The Passion Of The Christ as a business proposition. Until a month ago, the standard line from the studio execs was that Mel Gibson had blown well over 30 million bucks of his own money on a vanity project for him and and a handful of other Jesus freaks. Last week, it racked up the biggest mid-week opening – not just of any film in Aramaic but of any non-sequel movie ever; the only bigger opening gross was for The Return Of The King. Now the new rap on Mel is that he claims to be a Christian but he's making gazillions off his Saviour's suffering. Well, one reason he's making so much is because he doesn't have to share it with any of the big Hollywood muscle who were convinced the fundamentalist weirdo was out of his tree. Unlike all that Miramax pseudo-art-house stuff, The Passion is a genuine independent film: the system wasn't interested, so Mel bypassed it, and he's cleaning up.

How did they get it so wrong? Until 40 years ago, religious movies were a staple of Hollywood. The audience didn't change, Hollywood did. A couple of years back, I was at a conference at Paramount on American values and someone asked why they didn't make more religious pictures. Carmine Zozsora, producer of the Die Hard movies, replied in all seriousness: ""Well, we tried that with The Last Temptation Of Christ, and it didn't work out too well.""

That's the reality behind all that Oscar-night blather about how movies bind us together in stories of our common humanity, etc, etc. In fact, Hollywood defines our common humanity ever more narrowly. Nobody was in the mood for big anti-Bush speeches on Sunday night, and even Sean Penn contented himself with a mere subordinate clause about how actors had known there were no WMDs. But that's all you need. Like Billy Crystal's crack about Bush's National Guard service, it's the celebrity equivalent of a Masonic handshake – a way of signaling that you're in the club. But the club excludes too many people, and, if it carries on like that, the movie biz will be in as much trouble as the music biz.

That's not my main rap against Sean Penn, of course. Bill Murray was not only robbed but weirdly humiliated in his loss by Billy Crystal. As I said in my review, as you watch Mystic River Penn and Tim Robbins seem to be ""furiously tap-dancing for Oscar votes."" More fool the Academy for falling for it.

The OGarden system lets you grow herbs, tomatoes, leafy greens, and more year-round.","If you've always wanted to start your own herb or vegetable garden but don't have the yard space or the ""green thumb"" to pull it off, there's now another option. The OGarden Smart is an indoor gardening system that grows up to 90 plants at one time—20 of which are edible.

Strawberries, celery, kale, bok choy, green beans, cayenne pepper, green onion, and cherry tomatoes are just a few of the fruits and veggies the OGarden can grow. Up to 30 growing cups can be placed in a lower cabinet, where the seeds are allowed to germinate. Once they sprout, the plants can then be transferred to the rotating wheel up above, which holds up to 60 plants at a time. It takes about 30 to 40 days to harvest the produce, depending on the type of plant grown.

The system is self-watering and uses automatic LED lights to provide the right amount of sunlight, no matter what season it is. The only work that's required is planting the seeds and refilling the water tank once a week.

The OGarden Smart is the second product launched by company co-founders Pierre Nibart and Pierre-Etienne Bourget, of Quebec, Canada. The original OGarden debuted in 2017, and the Smart upgrade incorporates a few new features, including automatic watering, automatic LED lighting, and a water warning system. Some reviewers of the original OGarden commented that the system is easy to use, and that the vegetables taste better than store-bought produce.

The OGarden Smart will set you back $859 Canadian dollars (about $650 USD) if you order it on Kickstarter at a discounted rate, but the company's founders are quick to point out that it will help you save money in the long-run. The system lets you grow organic produce at a fraction of the price you'd pay at your local grocery store.

Ji won her fifth U.S. LPGA Tour title in her previous event last month, the season-opening Tournament of Champions in Florida.

She picked up right where she left off, in Chonburi.

After an opening birdie and a bogey on the third hole, Ji birdied nine out of the following 14 holes on the Siam Country Club Pattaya's Old Course.

In her wake were Minjee Lee of Australia, Danielle Kang of the United States, and Jenny Shin of South Korea, each with a 65.

""I felt really great. I didn't miss any fairways and missed just two greens,"" Ji said. ""I have a lot of confidence.

Lee was bogey free as she eagled the 15th and birdied five holes on a humid day.

""I was little bit slow starting out. I finished with three birdies on the last three holes at the front nine, and got a little bit better momentum,"" Lee said.

A group of four, three strokes off the lead, included Americans Jennifer Song and Lizette Salas, Canadian Brooke Henderson, and Australian Katherine Kirk.

World No. 1 Ariya Jutanugarn, the 2013 runner-up, carded a 4 under 68, mixing an eagle and six birdies with two bogeys and a double bogey.

The seven-time Grammy winning fourth season “American Idol” winner isn’t seeking much profit on the property she bought for $1.353 million in 2007, not too long before she hooked up with her Canadian professional ice hockey player husband Mike Fisher, and hasn’t lived in since at least sometime last year. At the end of a manicured cul-de-sac that backs up to the rolling greens of the tony Governors Club, and somewhat curiously described in marketing materials as an “Italian Style Villa,” the 7,083-square-foot, stone accented beige brick mansion, which might more accurately be depicted as a luxurious if otherwise pretty ordinary transitional traditional with a decadently celebrified basement, has four bedrooms and four full and two half bathrooms over three opulently outfitted floors.

A grand, double-height foyer featuring a curved staircase and herringbone pattern stone tile flooring is open to the formal dining room and steps down to a cavernous living room with oak floorboards, a carved stone fireplace mantel and plush velvet drapes over a double-height stack of windows. With a plethora of up-to-date stainless steel appliances and dark brown granite countertops on elaborately carved custom cabinets, the kitchen opens over a boomerang-shaped island stack bar to a breakfast area and adjoining family room with a beige brick fireplace and golf course view. The residence also offers a library/office, a games room/guest apartment with kitchenette and a mirror-walled gym with black rubber floor mats.

Each of the three guest bedrooms has a private bathroom while the wall-to-wall carpeted main floor master suite offers a fireplace, a spacious bathroom and custom-fitted walk-in closet where a corkscrew staircase winds down to a basement done up as a girlishly glitzy “glam-room” fit for an international music superstar with radiant heated polished marble floors, a hair and makeup station, a shoe and handbag display area and a roomy lounge with wet bar.

Although the house sits on just over half of an acre, outdoor living spaces are limited to a not entirely private veranda outside the family room that overlooks the golf course and a planted courtyard outside the formal living room and master suite that is mostly shielded from view of passing golfers by verdant clumps of trees and foliage.

Sometime after a freaky fall outside the home in late 2017 that left her wrist broken and put dozens of stitches in her face, Underwood and Fisher reportedly decamped Brentwood for a semi-remote spread in nearby Franklin, Tenn., where they took up residence in a rustic-luxe barn-style home on close to 1,000 acres they acquired in a handful of transactions between 2011 and 2016 for a total of about $4 million. The couple have since moved to a rambling, multi-story Cape Cod-style mansion they custom built on the vast country estate where one of their nearest neighbors is veteran country music heavy hitter Wynona Judd.

Credit: Scott Warman/Unsplash The Food Price Report 2019, released by Dalhousie University and the University of Guelph in December, suggested vegetable prices will go up by as much as six per cent this year. That's significant because, unlike meat or fish, fewer alternatives exist when it comes to replacing vegetables.

Coming on the report's heels was the new Canada's Food Guide, which recommended Canadians consume more plants and less meat.

According to the Food Report, El Niño is to blame for rising vegetable prices, since Canada imports a great quantity of veggies from regions prone to drought during El Niño periods, including the western United States and northern Mexico. And 2019 is an El Niño year.

The six per cent increase is in addition to the 4.8 per cent hike in vegetable prices in 2018.

Given that we could experience another year of significant price increases, many wonder whether eating local produce is a better option.

Global supply chains have allowed us to become more efficient and given consumers more choices and a broader selection of affordable food products. But eating local has its advantages, too.

Reducing your carbon footprint

The environmental case for eating local is almost undisputed. You can significantly reduce your carbon footprint just by increasing your locally grown food consumption.

And local food is consistently priced, if generally higher. Price is much less volatile when short-circuit distribution systems are involved. The number of intermediaries is limited compared to global food chains, which are exposed to environmental fluctuations and differing economic conditions, and can all lead to greater cost variations.

Extensive, large-scale networks always give markets what they need at the right time, at the right place, at a decent price and with an acceptable level of quality —until something goes terribly wrong. A single failure can lead to huge disruptions that affect many people.

A case in point is the romaine lettuce crisis in November. Fresh lettuce grown in California and Arizona is delivered to Canadians at a decent price. But with the E. coli outbreak in romaine lettuce, not only did people get sick, but the prices of leafy greens in Canada skyrocketed.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency prevented romaine lettuce from entering Canada. When that happens, importers must procure similar products elsewhere, likely at higher cost, to meet consumer expectations. Consumers want their leafy greens, even in winter, no matter what.

Eventually, the situation goes back to normal and most have forgotten about the romaine lettuce crisis. That's the nature of market failures. Systems adapt and improve over time.

Local food systems more stable

But many people in the marketplace envy the stability and sustainability of local food systems. Unlike global supply chain systems, transparency is a non-issue since most producers know each other.

Buying locally grown vegetables can also give some peace of mind to shoppers. You'll likely pay more, but the prices are mostly predictable. Simplicity has its virtues, but it also comes at a cost. Local food is typically more expensive than the cheapest imported varieties available in the same marketplace.

Research shows that city dwellers prefer locally grown or manufactured food products, for the simple fact that agriculture is often a distant concept to them. Some Canadians have never been to a farm. Buying local is the one way to feel a real connection with agriculture and farmers.

There's also more wealth in cities than rural communities. So although price is still a consideration for urban dwellers, it's more important to less wealthy consumers in rural areas.

That's where global supply chains come in.

Given that Canadians have access to one of the most affordable food baskets in the world relative to household income, global supply chains appear to be serving them well.

Wintry climate leaves us with few options

And getting our vegetable fix from all over the world isn't such a bad idea. Our nordic climate doesn't give us many options. But global supply chains come with their fair share of risks, which in turn generate price volatility.

At the same time, buying local produce can be critical to our agri-food economy. In many parts of the country, local vegetable production is a priority, through vertical farms, greenhouses using novel technologies and other initiatives.

Access to more locally grown vegetables, while striking a balance between local and global, will be key.

But rising vegetable prices are a challenge for many, especially those with limited incomes. That means visiting the freezer aisle may not be a bad idea. It may not taste the same as fresh, but you'll get the same nutritional value from frozen veggies.

Amid all this, there is one piece of good news: The Food Price Report 2019 suggests that the cost of meat and fish products will drop this year by up to three per cent.

That's the first decline in fish and meat prices in the study's nine-year history.

So meat lovers can do a happy dance around the barbecue next summer. Just don't forget the veggies.

Ji won her fifth U.S. LPGA Tour title in her previous event last month, the season-opening Tournament of Champions in Florida.

She picked up right where she left off, in Chonburi.

After an opening birdie and a bogey on the third hole, Ji birdied nine out of the following 14 holes on the Siam Country Club Pattaya’s Old Course.

In her wake were Minjee Lee of Australia, Danielle Kang of the United States, and Jenny Shin of South Korea, each with a 65.

“I felt really great. I didn’t miss any fairways and missed just two greens,” Ji said. “I have a lot of confidence.

Lee was bogey free as she eagled the 15th and birdied five holes on a humid day.

“I was little bit slow starting out. I finished with three birdies on the last three holes at the front nine, and got a little bit better momentum,” Lee said.

A group of four, three strokes off the lead, included Americans Jennifer Song and Lizette Salas, Canadian Brooke Henderson, and Australian Katherine Kirk.

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter in 2018 Hecla Mining Company's Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should need operating assistance at any time, please press * and then 0 on your touchtone telephone.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Westerlund, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.

Mike Westerlund -- Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you very much. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Hecla's Fourth Quarter and Yearend 2018 Financial and Operations Results Conference Call. Our Reserves and Resources news release issued last week and the Financial Results news release issued this morning before market open, along with today's presentation, are available on our website.

On today's call, we have Phil Baker, President and CEO; Lindsay Hall, Senior Vice President and CFO; Larry Radford, Senior Vice President, Operations; and Dean McDonald, Senior Vice President, Exploration.

Any forward-looking statements made today by the management team come under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and constitute forward-looking information under Canadian securities law, as shown on slide two. Such statements include projections and goals, which are likely to involve risks detailed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and in the forward-looking disclaimer included in the earnings and exploration releases and at the beginning of the presentation. These risks could cause results to differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

In addition, during this call, we may disclose non-GAAP financial measurements. You can find reconciliations of these measurements to the nearest GAAP measurements in the accompanying presentation, which is available on our website at www.hecla-mining.com.

Finally, in our filings with the SEC, we are only allowed to disclose mineral deposits that we can economically and legally extract or produce. Investors are cautioned about our use of terms such as measured, indicated, and inferred resources, which are not reserves, and we urge you to consider the disclosures that we make in our SEC filings.

I will now pass the call to Phil Baker.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Mike. Yeah, good morning, everyone. There's a couple of things I want to highlight for you this morning before turning the call over to the team for specifics. We're gonna start on slide three.

The first thing is that our best minds are getting even better. We set records for the highest level of silver, gold, and lead reserves in our history, and it was done with a drill bit, not through acquisitions. By the way, our zinc reserves would have also been a record, but fell 3,010 short. Realize these reserves were done with some of the lowest price assumptions for calculating reserves in the industry, and ours still went up significantly. And price assumptions matter. It means our least profitable ounces have more margin. So, when you consider reserves, remember that not all ounces are created equal. We have high margin ounces largely in Alaska and Quebec, great margins in great jurisdictions.

In addition, we also had the most measured and indicated resources in our history, as well as the most inferred. My expectation is for more reserve increases in the future. Particularly notable was Greens Creek, with about 15 to 20% increase in reserves of all metals, and an extension of the reserve mine life to around 2030. If you consider the reserves, the mine life could be five to 10 years longer. This mine produces about half our revenues, and over the last 10 years, a billion dollars of free cash flow. My expectation is that over the next couple of decades, it might produce maybe $2 billion of free cash flow. Greens Creek is a remarkable mine, but sometimes I think the market has just taken it for granted.

Also notable is Casa Berardi, which produces about 35% of our total revenues, adding about 400,000 gold ounces of gold reserves on surface with the new West Mine Crown Pillar Pit, a 28% increase in reserves. This pit is only slightly lower-grade than our highest-grade pit, and I suspect it will get bigger as we do the work to steepen the pit walls and do more definition drilling.

Greens Creek and Casa together generated about 85% of our revenue, all of our free cash flow, and are getting better and longer-lived. They're also the model at what we're trying to do at our three other operations -- San Sebastian, Lucky Friday, and Nevada. I just came back from Nevada and want to share with you a few of my observations. It reminds me in many respects of where we were when we acquired Casa -- more questions than answers, lots of work that we have to prioritize, people that we have to determine their capabilities -- and like Casa, we've made significant progress. Much of it will not be visible to you in many statistics yet. But Larry's gonna talk to you about the progress we've made in development. It's been significant, but we are still trying different ways of dealing with different conditions in the mine. So, while we're in a hurry to get to a steady state, we will take the time necessary to figure out the challenges of these mines so our Nevada operations will never value for the long term.

Before I move on to the 2019 outlook, I want to point out the photo that's on the right side of that PowerPoint slide. It's from Sandvik's magazine called Solid Ground, in which Alain Grenier, GM of Casa Berardi Mine, and the rest of the Casa Berardi team is featured. The article centers on the successful operation of the two Sandvik 40-ton autonomous haul trucks, and it's on our website if you'd like to read it. By the way, there are also two other cover stories from 2018 that are on our website -- one from SME and the other from CIM.

So, go to slide four, where we provide our estimates of production costs, capital, exploration, and R&D for 2019. Greens Creek and San Sebastian have similar production profiles in 2019, as in 2018. We expect silver cash costs to be only $1.10 an ounce, and all-in costs less than $11.00. Casa Berardi production estimates are a little lower than last year due to lower grades, causing cost to be slightly higher. Estimated Nevada gold production is higher with a full-year of production and considerably lower costs. The gold side of the business is expected to have cash costs per ounce of $8.75, and all-in costs of $12.50.

We estimate $150 million for capital, which is similar to last year; about $25 million expiration expenditures, a reduction of $10 million. When you add it all up at today's prices, we expect Hecla to generate free cash.

So, I'm gonna pass the call over to Lindsay.

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide six, we reported a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $27 million, or $0.06 per share, with almost all the loss occurring during the last quarter; and an adjusted net loss of $0.11 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $212 million versus $232 million in 2017. Gold cash costs and all-in sustaining cash costs, both after by-product credits, came in at $871.00 and $1,226.00 per ounce respectively; while silver cash costs and all-in sustaining cash costs after by-product credits were $1.08 and $11.44 per ounce. We're happy with our costs at our operating units, other than Nevada operations, which we reported higher costs, while we worked through what we believe are transitional issues.

Slide seven shows our revenue streams that are nicely diversified, with gold at 53%, silver at 24%, zinc at 17%, and lead at 6%. Greens Creek again continues to be the dominant source of revenues, contributing 47% of our total revenues. We realize that it has a more silver/gold ratio, the revenue of the two metals would almost be equal.

Moving to slide eight, revenues for the year totaled $567 million, versus $578 million last year. We had record gold sales of 248,000 ounces at a slightly higher realized goal price this year, with our acquisitions of our Nevada operations effective July 23rd contributing toward that record, offsetting the reduced silver production and sales, primarily at San Sebastian, and lower silver prices realized this year.

Earnings from mine operations amounted to $79 million, which is $73 million lower than last year. This reduction is not surprising, as it is primarily due to completing open pit mining at our San Sebastian operation in 2017, and moving to an underground operation in 2018, where the grades are lower and the mining costs are higher. Lower other expenses, including taxes, offset lower operating profit, resulting in a net loss of $27 million, which was similar to that of 2017.

On a consolidated basis, we generated $94 million in cash from operating activities, and invested $137 million at our mine sites. Of that $137 million, $36 million was invested at our Nevada operations, and included approximately $14 million to complete a new Tailings dam and to upgrade the CIL circuit in the mill to improve recoveries. We have a goal of financial discipline in which each of our mines should produce free cash flow. And clearly, that didn't happen with our Nevada operations that we acquired effective July of last year. We expect in 2019, the Nevada mining operations will be cash flow positive, but we'll invest those cash flows and more in exploration around the various Nevada mine sites and the development of the Hatter Graben decline. As to the other mine sites, we have no major capital initiatives planned for 2019.

Moving to the balance sheet, at yearend, we had approximately $275 million in liquidity, which includes a $250 million line of credit which was undrawn at yearend, and $27 million in cash on hand. Our debt consists of $500 million in bonds, which are repayable in 2021, and $31 million owed to Ressources Quebec, also due in 2021. The bonds are callable at par on May 1st of this year. We continually monitor the capital markets, and while we're able to refinance the bonds today, it would be at rates higher than the current bond's existing rate of 6.875%.

We will continue to focus on turning our Nevada operations into a cash flow generator, building up expected cash balances and being patient about refinancing of our bonds. We have other methods available to us to reduce our total interest expense, such as using term bank debt, so if the high-yield market continues to be pricey for single-B debt issuers, then we may use these other methods in accommodation with new bonds being issued to reduce future interest expense payments. Also, I'd point out, in the back of our release, our calculated net debt to last 12 months' EBITDA was 2.4, which would typically be representative of a higher credit rating than we currently are assigned.

So, in summary, we had a good 2018 and are very excited about the potential for 2019 and beyond. But now I'll pass it on to Larry to talk about the operations.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Thanks, Lindsay, and good morning. To start with, I want to highlight that our all injury frequency rate for 2018 declined 28% companywide, as you can see on slide 10. This is a statistic that we are very proud of, and frankly, we'll work to reduce it again this year.

Also of note, Casa Berardi recently reached one million man hours without a lost time accident. This is an incredible improvement from 2013, the year that we acquired the mine. Our Lucky Friday supervisory staff is also to be commended, having operated the mine since the strike began without an injury.

I also want to highlight the good work done at Greens Creek on slide 11, which, as Phil notes, is our most important mine, that generates about half of our cash flow. With the big jump in reserves that we have recorded and the resulting three years or so of mine life addition, the team is working hard on a new technical report. With the revised mine plan reducing the development in the next few years, moving the highest margin material from the end of the mine life to the next few years, we should see a significant increase in the value of the mine.

Greens Creek, as can be seen on slide 12, had another strong year, producing over eight million ounce of silver at a cash cost after by-product credit $0.66 per silver ounce. Contributing to this performance was record throughput of 2,301 tons per day.

Moving on to Casa Berardi on slide 13, this mine just keeps performing better and better. The 157 ounces of gold produced was the highest since we acquired the operation. Fourth quarter production level was a bit lower than the previous quarter, in part due to the removal of the primary crusher and replacement with a higher-capacity crusher, which took about a week.

The record production is primarily due to throughput, as shown on slide 14. The mill operated at an average of 3,515 tons per day in the fourth quarter 2018, and 3,769 tons per day for the year. Casa milled 825 tons per day more than 2016, and almost 2,000 tons a day greater than when the mine was acquired. In 2018, open pit feed accounted for 46% of the mill feed. We have run the mill at over 4,000 tons per day on a spot basis. We continue to study increasing throughput even further.

Casa Berardi was our second-highest cash flow generator in 2018, and a technical report is also being put together for it, reflecting the significant increase in surface reserves in what could be the fifth surface pit, called the West Mine Crown Pillar Pit.

Let's move on to Nevada on slide 15, where most of our focus is this year. We have a plan to turn around the assets, and we are working that plan. In 2018, the focus was on getting the operation back on track in terms of understanding ground conditions at Fire Creek and getting the team organized. We have come a long way in this regard. Our strategy is simple: develop and drill. We believe that the grades can be improved through new discoveries and resource conversion, and/or production can be ramped up by opening up more working zones.

Fire Creek, we have done a review of equipment and are adding equipment from Midas and from buying some new equipment. We've added two trucks, two large loaders, one jumbo, two bulkers to the Nevada fleet for costing a total of about $6 million, with the expectation that the upgrade will increase productivity. The implementation of Shot Creek at the end of the development process is resulting in better ground conditions, as expected, which should minimize the need to go back in and rehab development repeatedly, as was the case under prior management.

The CIL plant upgrade is complete, and the mill is now able to process Hollister ore. We have exceeded our annual development target of 35 feet per day in January, as shown on slide 16, and the goal will be to maintain this level and increase it where possible, because this should open up additional headings and increase production.

We have wrapped up Fire Creek manpower for -- underground manpower for 76 to about 110 through transfer of Midas and Hollister miners. Our contractor has brought in a road header at Fire Creek, and it is easily cutting the soft cup material, which is helping to speed up development, and we are considering a wider application of this type of machine. We're planning to increase Fire Creek throughput midyear to about 520 tons per day from 340 tons per day, which was the fourth quarter average, which means that the goal production will be weighted toward the second half of the year. The increased development is an important step for Dean's group, as we have worked to do on definition drilling to upgrade resources, and exploration to discover additional resources.

At San Sebastian, on slide 17, we are now collecting the bulk sample of sulfide material, and we should have it run through a third party mill for testing by the end of the second quarter. We currently have oxide material to take us well into 2020, and Dean's group has a priority of finding more oxide ore.

I'll hand it over now to Dan.

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Thanks, Larry. Last week, we announced the highest levels of silver, gold, and lead reserves in 128-year history. Total gold reserves reached 2.85 million ounces, an increase of 26% from last year, mostly due to increases in open pits at Casa Berardi as a result of successful surface drilling. Silver reserves grew up 8% to 191 million ounces, primarily from Greens Creek, due to a combination of good drilling results, advanced resource modeling techniques, and improved smelter terms. The increase in resources is also important, because this suggests the potential for increasing reserves in the future.

We continued with aggressive drill programs in the fourth quarter, following successes at Casa Berardi, Nevada, Greens Creek, and San Sebastian. A list of drill intersections is provided in the Appendix B of the Exploration release on February 14th, giving insights into the high-grade resources we are confirming and expanding.

As you can see from slide 19, Hecla reserve price assumptions of 1,450 per silver ounce and 1,200 per bold ounce are some of the lowest commodity prices used in the industry, and have been for many years. On slide 20, you can see that over the past 11 years, we have consistently replaced or grown silver reserves from 130 to 191 million ounces, in addition to the 142 million ounces of cumulative production over that time. This means we have actually added a total of 200 million silver ounces in the past 11 years, with no contributions from acquisitions.

At Casa Berardi, we had considerable drilling success again along the main trends, particularly near surface. And this has resulted in the new West Mine Crown Pillar Pit, as shown on the left-hand of slide 21; and expanded East Mine Crown Pillar and principal pits with a total of 442,000 ounces of new gold reserves added during the year. There are now a series of pits along the Casa Berardi definition zone. Underground exploration was also successful. The red arrows show the projections of high-grade shoots that will be evaluated in the coming year, particularly in the East Mine, where access was reestablished last year. A closer look at the West Mine Crown Pillar Pit in the cross-section on slide 22 shows the convergence of several broad mineralized lenses near surface, providing the critical mass for a potentially very economic open pit, and the possible exploitation of zones with underground mining in the future.

At Greens Creek, there was significant growth in reserves. As shown on slide 23, definition and exploration drilling continued to add reserves higher in the mine at the East Ore and Upper Plate Zones. Lower in the mine, we were adding to reserves and resources along some existing trends in the Gallagher Deep 200 South and Lower Southwest Zones. Three drills will be operating underground all year in these areas, with the goal of defining additional reserves.

In 2018, very little exploration occurred on the Nevada projects until the Klondex acquisition was completed. It is evident that we urgently need to upgrade resources to move into the mine plans and identify new resources. Slide 24 shows how significantly we are accelerating our efforts for both underground and surface drilling, with more crews, more drills, more technology, and increased budgets in 2019. The upper diagram on the right shows the location of underground definition and exploration drilling at Fire Creek. Intense underground drilling is planned for Spirals 2, 3, 4, and 9, and the Titan Zone to upgrade resources that can lead to near-term reserves. Exploration of the Spiral 9 and North Zone provides the opportunity to extend some of the known mineralization trends. This drilling is planned to be in combination with surface drilling that will be initiated in April, and we'll evaluate the Zeus Guard Shack and South Notice targets.

Lower in the diagram on the right shows the drills at Hollister are working to define the mineralization trends in West Gloria, Central Hollister, and Guinevere for near-term mining. The development advancing to the east toward the Hatter Graben provides underground drill platforms for the drilling of targets in the East Clementine area and into the Hatter Graben late in the year. Surface drilling is planned to begin in April, with the goal of extending the Hatter Graben resource to the east.

At San Sebastian, as shown on slide 25, mining studies are being completed on the Professor East Francine veins and the polymetallic mineralization of the Francine vein. While at the same time, surface drilling is focused on defining new near surface oxide mineralization along the West Francine and Esperanza veins. Recently, we have successfully identified new oxide veins at the El Toro target, and are pushing hard to define a new oxide source with further drilling. The emphasis of exploration in 2019 is to rapidly advance our opportunities in Nevada, define new oxide mineralization at San Sebastian, and continue the drilling successes at Casa Berardi and Greens Creek.

And with that, I'll pass the call back to Phil.

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press * and then 1 on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the # key. To limit background noise, we ask you to mute your line once your question has been stated.

And our first question comes from Cosmos Chiu from CIBC. Your line is now open.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Hi. Thanks, Phil, Lindsay, Larry, and Dean. Thanks for the call. If I may, my questions are mostly on Fire Creek here. I understand that Fire Creek and the entire sort of Nevada complex is still a work in progress. Certainly in 2018, a transitional year, there were some disappointments with the decrease of reserves beyond what was produced. I'm just trying to get a better understanding in terms of what has been the biggest surprise to you at these Nevada assets in terms of reserves, in terms of production, as you know, ownership has handed -- since ownership has been handed over to Hecla.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I'll start, and then I'll let Larry and Dean jump in. But I think the biggest surprise and disappointment was the Klondex didn't follow the budget that they had presented to us. And so, as a result, the amount of development that was done was significantly less than was supposed to be done. And so, as a result, it really has caused us to have to really focus and reestablish the mine. That's probably the biggest thing from my perspective. Larry?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Certainly operationally, the biggest challenge is getting the development caught up. Despite ground conditions, which are challenging, we are on an acceleration track. And Cosmos, for just a comment on the reserves -- and we hit them pretty hard. Clearly, there was mine depletion. There was no drilling in the first half of the year. And so, there really wasn't time to refine and identify new reserves. But the other thing, we knew that there was a challenge in reconciling the production grades with the mill. And so, we really relooked at the modeling. We narrowed the vein or the size of the vein within the models. And so, we actually -- and changed the capping or top cut. And consequently, that represented about half the reserve losses. We've been very conservative in our modeling in those -- of the existing resources and reserves.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, we want to make sure that we have a base to build from in terms of reserves, in terms of resources. The development we want to -- it's still a work in progress to figure out the development, hence why we're looking at a roadheader to go in and do the development in advance. So, we think there's a lot of different levers to pull before we will optimize this mine, and similar to what we saw at Casa Berardi.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. Of course. And Phil and Dean, it's great that you brought up the reserves and resources. Looking at it here, and you talked about Spirals 2, 3, 4, and 9, and a number of different zones -- Vonnie, Joyce, Karen, Honey, and others. I'm just trying to understand what of these new -- what of these zones that you've identified are considered -- categorized as, say, new zones, versus an extension of current mineralization? I think Dean sort of touched on that Spiral 9 looks like it could be an extension in terms of a drilling platform for current utilization. I'm just trying to get a better understanding and trying to gauge the difficulty in terms of adding to reserves and resources based on, are they new zones, or are they extensions, and whatnot.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I'll let Dean answer the question.

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Yeah. Well, Cosmos, it's really all of the above. They're clearly extensions to the existing -- you mentioned Vonnie and Joyce, the veins that have been key producers in the past. There are extensions to the north and south. In fact, there may be opportunities up dip. But as you go to the north in what's referred to as -- well, let me step back. So, for those zones, we know they're there. There's been some preliminary drilling to define them. And now, we're getting the development in place to drill them off. From an expiration point of view, particularly to the north, you have Spiral 9, you have the North Zone, that -- the North Zone's really a northern extension of the known veins. We're seeing in the Titan Zone a series of new veins there, and then in Spiral 9. Surface drilling to the northwest with Zeus, I think, are defining some new veins that certainly look encouraging. We're gonna need to drill them out. But I do see kind of near-term upgrading, expansion along trends, and then with Spiral 9, Zeus, and others, things that are gonna come in in the next few years.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. Great. And then maybe that leads into my next question here. In terms of timing, when would you be ready to potentially put out a reserve resource update? Again, there are -- and do you have some market concerns in terms of the low ounces on current reserves at this point in time? I guess understanding that, Nevada's still a work in progress, and all the other issues that we had talked about in the past, or just now. But I'm just wondering, when would you be ready to potentially put out a new reserve resource?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

We have not actually made a determination. Our typical schedule is yearend, and I'm not envisioning that we're planning to change that. Or any . . .

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Yeah. At this point, Cosmos, I'd say we'd stay with our traditional schedule. But depending on what transpires, that may change.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. And maybe one last question on Fire Creek here. We've been given the production guidance for 2019 for Nevada as a whole, as a complex. But I'm just wondering how much of the 69,000 ounces in reserves for Fire Creek have you sort of incorporated into that 2019 guidance? Have you incorporated any of the beyond reserves into that guidance?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, the answer's yes. Some of this would be beyond reserves. As far as what that percentage is, I couldn't tell you. But it's -- does anybody know?

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

I don't know the exact number on that one.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Okay. But there's some. But a lot of it, the bulk of it, I guess, would be based on reserves.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Well, it is a combination. I mean, we -- and this was part of the calculus we did in acquiring this, is that you have to convert inferred into reserves. And frankly, what happens is gonna be similar to what we've seen at other mines, where we are producing mineralization that maybe doesn't even make a category. And we certainly see that Greens Creek a lot. We don't see any -- that this would be any different than that.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Yeah. Great. And sorry, I lied. Maybe one last question on Fire Creek here. You talk about increasing the under mine, underground throughput from, I think, 350 tons per day to 520 by mid-2019. Is that as simple as, as Larry said, getting ahead on development, getting your 1,200 feet per month in place. Is that really the bottleneck?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

It's a key -- the key to expanding throughput is in expanding development, without a doubt. Obviously, we need to also drill ahead of ourselves, get our definition drilling in place, confirm the scopes before we dive into them. All of that's driven by development.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. And you're happy with the 1,200 feet per month level, Dean, or Larry?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah. I mean, we've seeded it in January. We're a little bit behind in February, only because we're driving raises right now, so we're doing less capital lateral footage. But we see the sustain on plan. It was a matter of injecting more miners and more machines, and that's on track. And now, we actually have some opportunity to improve our actual cycle at the face. That's the next challenge that we will take on.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And I just wanted to just make sure that people understand, you're still trying new things, and you don't have a standard development plan yet for the cycle yet. You're still working through that.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah. We're still working through that. We're still doing conventional drill and blast, which are typically very short rounds, at Fire Creek, in the ground, since . . . So, we have to have a lot of headings, shootings, and short blasts. And so, there's opportunity there. The roadheader, the first trial, was very successful. It kept the material very well. It left behind a very solid back and rib. And so, we're just -- we're learning as we go. We're injecting -- we have our VP Tech Services onsite pretty much all the time now. We've taken Lucky Friday expertise down, and we're making the improvements that we should be.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. Great. Thank you. That's all I have. Thanks a lot.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Cosmos.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Fields from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Hey, guys. So, back since you've issued the bonds in 2013, in your EBITDA reconciliation, you've added back or taken away, as is the case, the gains or losses unrealized on derivative contracts. So, for the first nine months to today, that was basically a $40 million hit in your EBITDA, because you've gained that in your income statement, but all of a sudden, for the fourth quarter, most of that's gone away. So, it looks like you only take away about $8 million instead of $40. So, it looks like you're inflating your EBITDA by about $32 million. Can you help me understand why that's not the case?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, the first thing I'd say is that the derivatives contracts that we had, we closed out in the third quarter and generated $35 million, $32 million of cash from those contracts. So, we have not -- when the price of zinc and lead fell, and we were able to generate that cash. And so, we were monetizing that hedge. So, we've done that. Now, prices have come back up for zinc and lead, and so, we're putting new positions in place. So, to the extent that prices continue to rise, we'll have that -- that number will grow as we put in more contracts, and to the extent those go underwater. But Lindsay, anything to add to that?

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, Matthew, maybe you're saying we're detected $40 million and arriving at adjusted net income. We take that gain out. Then we include it in our EBITDA calculation. That's still alluded to, the cash we received on the closing of the hedges. It's much the same -- we were kind of following covenants, which allowed it, so.

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Right, but the first nine months of 2018, basically you add back -- you take away $40 million, and then all of a sudden, that disappears in the full year. I'm just . . .

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

You're talking about income statement, or balance sheet, or cash flow? Pardon me?

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Income statement is, for the first nine months, you've gained $40 million on derivatives. That shows up in the full year income statement as well.

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Not much happened in the fourth quarter, Matthew.

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Right, agreed. And the EBITDA reconciliation, when you look at you know your third quarter release, that entire $40 million from the income statement was taken away, but now all of a sudden, on the fourth quarter report, only $8 million is taken away.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I think what you're saying, maybe in the third quarter, we didn't add back the cash gains on the cashed out hedges, right? Is that what you're alluding to? We'll look back in and check that, but.

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Yeah, but if I look at your cash flow statement, it looks like you've only gained modified $15 million. So, there's a lot of -- there's some screwy numbers going on, and just, maybe we can take this offline, because you reported $156 million of EBITDA for the first nine months, $28 million in the fourth quarter, and somehow, that's supposed add up to $211 million. Happy to take this offline.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, let's take it offline. I might argue, they're not screwy numbers. They're just accounting and cash flows being mixed, so. We'll deal with it.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Okay. Any other question, Matthew?

Operator

Thank you. Your next question comes from Heiko Ihle from H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure thing, Heiko.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

Great. I promised myself I wouldn't ask a Casa Berardi question this time for once. So, going over to Nevada, you mentioned the asset should be cash flow positive this year. Are you willing to quantify this just a little bit more, especially given that your all-in sustaining cost estimate there is $1,325.00 an ounce?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

No, what we've said is that the operations will be cash flow positive with the exception of the exploration and the development for the Hatter Graben. So, when you look at -- so, basically we're saying that we're right at positive cash flow from Nevada, and if you look at the all-in sustaining cost, you see that.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then, the decline is about 15% complete, so there's still bunch of work to do, obviously. Speaking of --

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, we'll do 5,000 feet of development at Hatter Graben.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

And speaking of Nevada and following up from the question that Cosmos had asked, I mean, you mentioned the increase in the throughput at Fire Creek from 350 tons per day to 520 tons per day by 2019. You also mentioned that your focus on -- and this is from your lease -- maintaining the development grade and all ground conditions. Am I reading something into here that's not there? Is there something I'm missing? I thought the ground conditions have been in that mine, as the ground conditions at Fire Creek are actually pretty solid. Is there -- are there pockets that need extra ground support? Or again, am I missing something there?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Well, you'll remember, when we first bought it, we talked about fact that we had this tuft that created road conditions that we had to come in with the synthetic liner and build a road base. Well, that's -- so, we dealt with the road conditions, but you have that same condition on the back and on the ribs. And so, that's what Larry is alluding to with the shot creating that we've had to do, and that's why we're contemplating the roadheader going through this soft material. Larry?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, it's variable. You can see very good ground conditions for -- we'll get 24 feet a day on a given head-in. And then, at times, we run into altered tufts and very clay-like material that takes short rounds and requires a fair amount of support. And the additional shot treatment. So, it's variable.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And then you also have the introduction of water into this tuft, which again -- and if you think about it, if you look at those pictures of the road, you get a sense of how soupy it becomes and difficult to operate in. And so, we're trying to figure out the best way to deal with the changing ground conditions. And so, that's why I have continued to make a point that we're experimenting, we're trying new things. I'm more interested in Larry coming to a series of standards, depending on the ground conditions, rather than just being so worried about getting the development. But, Larry.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah. You mentioned water, there's water in certain pockets, and we're looking at a bit more of a mobile dewatering plan so that we're not managing the water underground. So, yeah, we've shown -- as Phil alluded, we've shown photos of some of the poor conditions and what we're doing to manage them. We've got the right team there. I mentioned the roadheader -- it's actually a very small roadheader that we're trialing right now. And if it continues to perform as well as it seems to be, we may go all in for a large roadheader, I mean, a really large roadheader, and really jack up the advancement.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

Very helpful. Thank you, guys.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Okay, thanks, Heiko.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony Sorrentino from Sorrentino Metals. Your line is now open.

Anthony Sorrentino -- Sorrentino Metals -- Analyst

Good morning, everyone.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Nice to talk to you.

Anthony Sorrentino -- Sorrentino Metals -- Analyst

Yeah, same here. You're estimating 2019 capital expenditures at $150 million and 2019 exploration expenditures at $25 million. Would you break those down by property?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Does someone have it handy, or . . .

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Well, I'll talk about the exploration. So, you know that $25 million, Anthony, the -- half of it will be in Nevada, and the remainder will be split between Casa Berardi, San Sebastian, and Greens Creek. There'll be very little exploration outside of those four areas.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And Casa Berardi in Mexico were roughly $3 million apiece.

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, Casa's $3.6 million. San Sebastian's . . .

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And then as far as the capital goes, it's that $12 million for the Lucky Friday, about $50 million each for Greens Creek and Nevada, and then about $40 million for Casa Berardi.

Anthony Sorrentino -- Sorrentino Metals -- Analyst

Okay. Very good. Thank you for answering my questions.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure thing.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ajay Lele from Southpaw. Your line is now open.

Ajay Lele -- Southpaw -- Analyst

Hello? Can you hear me?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

We can.

Ajay Lele -- Southpaw -- Analyst

Great. I just wanted to ask about the Casa Berardi medium-term cost outlook as you move from underground what looks like into more of an open pit mine plan for your recent reserve announcement? Thank you.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, there's really no change in the percentage of surface and underground planned any time soon. We'll have a number of years of the underground based on the current reserve, and we're adding to reserves periodically. So, those will not change. It's still roughly 50-50, and the grade of the underground's about twice the grade of the open pit -- maybe a little more, not much. The new stuff that we've added from the West Mine is a bit higher-grade than the surface average. So, all in all, our expectation is to sort of maintain the cost structure that you see as we develop both the underground and the surface.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Can I add to that?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure, please.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

So, all of that's premised on a permit limit of 1.4 million tons, metric tons per year, and we are going to apply for an addition to that. Should we successfully raise the permitted limit and make some adjustments in the mill, then we could increase the amount of open pit feed going into the mill.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, that's right. And that would be increased to how much?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Well, we're applying for $1.6 million.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So, $0.2 million more?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah.

Ajay Lele -- Southpaw -- Analyst

Thanks.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Trevor Turnbull from Scotiabank. Your line is now open.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Yeah, hi. I just had one quick question, a very simple question with respect to Nevada. Is there any chance you're gonna have a site visit this year? It might make it simpler to understand some of the stuff that's been discussed on the call so far.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I'm sure we'll have one this year. We haven't made any specific plans at the moment. I want Larry and his team to have the opportunity to get their SOPs for the development in the different conditions resolved before we start bringing people onto the site. So, while we're still in this learning phase, it's probably better to wait.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Okay. My other questions were really more for Larry with respect to Greens Creek -- Larry and Dean. I guess the first thing, you've got some exploration and potential reserve additions coming at Greens. Can you give us a sense, Dean, what that's going to look like in terms of the reserve grade you've got there at Greens Creek? I think you're on the order of, what, 400 grams silver now? Are these areas likely to be consistent with that and kind of maintain a similar level of silver?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, Trevor, so, last year, and I think I announced this per ton, but last year, our reserves were 11.8, and we're at 11.5 this year. My expectation is that you're gonna see that 11.5 to 12 with potential resources converting to reserves. We are exploring upper plate. It's narrower, but very high grade. The same is true for East ore. And both of those areas are higher up in the mine. And Deep 200 South is, overall, more precious metal rich, so that you will see, with a couple of these areas, higher-grade precious metals than the reserve grade and slightly lower base metals, but that's gonna fluctuate. Overall, I don't see huge changes in the grade, the reserve grade overall.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

So, maybe a better way to think about it, really, given all the base metals, is that NSR is unlikely to change a whole lot in terms of the value per ton of the stuff you're looking at versus what you've already got.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, I think that's a good comment.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

So, I guess what I'm also wondering is, you talked about, certainly on the slide and in the presentation, looking to move some high-grade material forward in the mine plan, and it feels like you've been just kind of a little ahead of reserve grade recently. Are you looking to kind of still kind of maintain that, or are you looking for a pretty significant bump in the grade you're moving forward? And I guess my question really is trying to get at are you gonna kind of be above the reserve grade in aggregate there for a few years, and then kind of to what degree, such that I kind of understand to what degree it might -- sorry, it might dip below reserve grade going forward?

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Over the next sort of four years, 2020 through 2023, the reserve grades will be -- or production grades will be higher than what it has been. I don't off the top of my head have -- I can't remember what that will be. But as a result, we'll have higher ounce production. Larry, generally speaking -- and we'll have the -- in the 43101, you'll be able to see that. But generally speaking, Dean?

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Yeah, and next year. This will not match the technical report exactly because this is more of an internal . . .

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

This includes inferred and everything.

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Yeah, this is not gonna match the technical report, but it'll give you kind of an idea of where we'll be. We should be, next year, in the 12.5 ounce per ton silver.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So, call it an ounce better in the next few years.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Yeah, a healthy 10% or so better than where it's been. And then, Larry, I guess also just referring to that slide 11 in the deck. You show the old design with a ramp. It looks like you've been able to get away without having to put in that ramp, which is obviously a huge savings, and you've gone to this -- what looks to be a much more simplified design. I'm just curious, it looks almost too good to be true that you could get rid of all that development and do what you need to do using existing workings. Can you just explain a little bit about how that came to pass, that you could eliminate all that development and still achieve what you needed to?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

The graphic that we included is just one example. This is the East Ore in the very high end of the mine, where we anticipate when we published our report, that there'll be 15,000 fewer development feed. And a part of it is coming from this section we're showing in the graph, but not all of it. Some of it's just a good rethink of how we're accessing what are complicated ore bodies; these things are geometrically complex. And the more we can come off of the existing access, as we have in this example, the less development we're gonna do. So, 15,000 feet capitalize-wise is no small amount of money. It's actually its quite significant.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

But to the point, I think some of this has come as a result of being able to take more data and build a clear picture of where these ore bodies are. I think that -- I don't mean to give an advertisement for Leap Frog, but I think it's been very, very helpful. Dean, you . . .

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

As you know, the geometry of the ore bodies at Greens Creek are challenging, particularly when you're trying to model. Using Leap Frog primarily, we've been able to create wireframe models of the ore bodies that incorporate not only the drilling, but all the underground sampling, and really been able to develop, I think, a lot more realistic 3D model. And I think that's contributing as well to mine planning and optimizations, is that historically, Greens Creek's had a lot of mining ore zones outside of the modeling, which of course causes adjustments and time delays. I think we're doing a much better job of recreating that geometry in our models now.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And so, as a result of that, you know where to put the development, and we can be much more efficient with what we're -- how we're designing it. That Larry has.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, just the last thought is that the prior mine plan, we had 15 foot high cuts and they were horizontal cuts. And so, as we designed them, we -- as soon as you got toward the fringes, and it no longer paid. You just cut off the scope. We've now adjusted our centerlines more to the actual geometry of the ore bodies. And it's made for, well, more ore and more efficient development.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Yeah. No, it sounds like it's been a positive result all the way around. That's great. Thanks, guys.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Trevor.

Ji won her fifth U.S. LPGA Tour title in her previous event last month, the season-opening Tournament of Champions in Florida.

She picked up right where she left off, in Chonburi.

After an opening birdie and a bogey on the third hole, Ji birdied nine out of the following 14 holes on the Siam Country Club Pattaya’s Old Course.

In her wake were Minjee Lee of Australia, Danielle Kang of the United States, and Jenny Shin of South Korea, each with a 65.

“I felt really great. I didn’t miss any fairways and missed just two greens,” Ji said. “I have a lot of confidence.

Lee was bogey free as she eagled the 15th and birdied five holes on a humid day.

“I was little bit slow starting out. I finished with three birdies on the last three holes at the front nine, and got a little bit better momentum,” Lee said.

A group of four, three strokes off the lead, included Americans Jennifer Song and Lizette Salas, Canadian Brooke Henderson, and Australian Katherine Kirk.

World No. 1 Ariya Jutanugarn, the 2013 runner-up, carded a 4 under 68, mixing an eagle and six birdies with two bogeys and a double bogey.

YEAR-END HIGHLIGHTS

Silver production of 10.4 million ounces and record gold production of 262,103 ounces.

Silver equivalent production of 43.6 million ounces or gold equivalent of 540,174 ounces. 7

Cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization (""cost of sales"") of $488.0 million.

Total cash cost, after by-product credits and all-in sustaining cost (""AISC""), after by-product credits, per silver ounce of $1.08 and $11.44, respectively. 1,2

Record reserves for gold, silver and lead; increases over 2017 of 26%, 8% and 5%, respectively.

Completed the acquisition of Klondex in July 2018.

Improved safety with All Injury Frequency Rate 28% lower.

""Greens Creek and Casa Berardi are the economic engines of Hecla, and the continued increase in reserves and resources, extended mine life and positive changes to the mine plans are surfacing additional value at these operations,” said Phillips S. Baker, Jr., President and CEO. “This allows investment in our three other mines, which all have the potential to be long-lived with strong economics like Greens Creek and Casa Berardi. The turnaround of the Nevada operations continues with an increasing development rate at Fire Creek that should allow the mine to have operating consistency as we increase production. This is the same approach we took when we first acquired Greens Creek and Casa Berardi. Substantial exploration is planned for both Fire Creek and Hollister this year as we work to convert resources to reserves and discover additional resources.

SILVER AND GOLD RESERVE SUMMARY

Proven and probable silver reserves are 191 million ounces, an increase of 8% over December 31, 2017 levels. Proven and probable gold reserves are 2.9 million ounces, an increase of 26% over December 31, 2017 levels. Proven and probable zinc and lead reserves of 932,000 tons and 774,000 tons are increases of 11% and 5%, respectively, over December 31, 2017 levels. The reserves for gold, silver and lead are the highest in Company history. The price assumptions used for 2018 reserves of $14.50 for silver, $1,200 for gold, $1.15 for zinc and $0.90 for lead are unchanged from last year, with the exception of zinc, which was $1.05 in 2017. The silver price assumption is among the lowest in the industry.

Please refer to the reserves and resources tables at the end of this press release, or to the press release entitled ""Hecla Reports Record Gold, Silver and Lead Reserves"" issued on February 14, 2019, for the breakdown between proven and probable reserve and resource levels, as well as a detailed summary of the Company's exploration programs.

Revised NI 43-101 Technical Reports for Greens Creek and Casa Berardi are expected by April. At Greens Creek, the optimized mine plan accelerates access to higher-grade ore, enabling the expected highest margin reserves to be extracted in the earlier years of the mine plan. In addition, the increase in reserves is expected to extend the mine life, excluding resources, by about three years to 2030.

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW

Fourth Quarter Ended Twelve Months Ended HIGHLIGHTS December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 FINANCIAL DATA Sales (000) $ 136,520 $ 160,113 $ 567,137 $ 577,775 Gross profit (loss) (000) $ (1,265 ) $ 46,310 $ 79,099 $ 152,449 Loss applicable to common stockholders (000) $ (23,831 ) $ (29,105 ) $ (27,115 ) $ (29,072 ) Basic and diluted loss per common share $ (0.05 ) $ (0.07 ) $ (0.06 ) $ (0.07 ) Cash provided by operating activities (000) $ 19,011 $ 41,763 $ 94,221 $ 115,878

Net loss applicable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 was $23.8 million and $27.1 million, or $0.05 and $0.06 per basic share, respectively, compared to net losses applicable to common stockholders of $29.1 million, or $0.07 per basic share, for both periods of the prior year. Among items impacting the results for the 2018 periods compared to 2017 were the following:

Sales for the fourth quarter and full year were 15% and 2% lower, respectively, than the same periods in 2017. The decreases are mainly due to lower silver production due to lower grades and production at San Sebastian as well as lower average silver prices, partially offset by higher gold production due to higher throughout at Casa Berardi and the addition of the Nevada operations.

A slight loss was recorded on base metal derivative contracts for the fourth quarter 2018, while gains on base metal derivative contracts of $40.3 million were recorded for the full year 2018, compared to losses of $4.7 million and $21.3 million, respectively, in the prior year periods, mainly the result of lower lead prices. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company settled in-the-money contracts prior to their maturity date, for cash proceeds of approximately $32.8 million.

Foreign exchange gains of $7.5 million and $10.3 million were recognized in the fourth quarter and full year of 2018, respectively, compared to a $0.6 million gain and a loss of $9.7 million, respectively, in the prior year periods. The variances were primarily due to weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.

Interest expense, net of amount capitalized, was $10.9 million in the fourth quarter and $40.9 million for the full year of 2018 compared to $9.6 million and $38.0 million, respectively, in the prior year periods.

Exploration and pre-development expense was $9.4 million for the fourth quarter and $40.6 million for the full year of 2018, compared to $7.3 million and $29.0 million, respectively, in the prior year periods, primarily due to increased exploration activity in Nevada and Quebec.

Research and development expense was $0.4 million for the fourth quarter and $5.4 million for the full year of 2018, compared to $1.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively, for the prior year periods, and is related to the evaluation and development of new technologies, such as the Remote Vein Miner (RVM) project at the Lucky Friday.

Suspension costs for the fourth quarter of $2.4 million and $20.7 million for the full year of 2018, including $1.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in non-cash depreciation expense. This is compared to suspension costs of $6.9 million and $21.3 million, respectively, for the prior year periods.

Income tax benefit for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 of $5.2 million and $6.7 million, respectively, compared to provisions of $38.5 million and $21.0 million, respectively, in the prior year periods. The tax provisions in 2017 resulted primarily from the changes in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the resulting revaluation of the deferred tax asset, as well as current income and mining taxes in Mexico.

Cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 of $19.0 million and $94.2 million, respectively, was $22.8 million and $21.7 million lower, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in 2018 was mainly the result of lower production and higher exploration spending, as well as acquisition costs, partly offset by cash proceeds from settlement of base metals derivative contracts prior to their maturity date.

Adjusted EBITDA was $28.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $71.1 million for the same period of 2017, and $211.9 million for the full year of 2018, compared to $231.9 million in 2017.3 The decreases were due to lower production and higher exploration spending.

Capital expenditures at the operations totaled $53.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, including $17.6 million at Nevada operations, $13.6 million at Casa Berardi, $12.2 million at Greens Creek, $7.3 million at Lucky Friday, and $2.5 million at San Sebastian. Capital expenditures for the year 2018 totaled $140.6 million at the operations, compared to $103.4 million in 2017.

Metals Prices

Average realized silver prices in the fourth quarter and full year 2018 were $14.58 and $15.63 per ounce, respectively, compared to $16.87 and $17.23, respectively, for the prior year periods. Realized prices for gold for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 were $1,237 and $1,265 per ounce, respectively, 3% lower compared to the fourth quarter 2017, while the price for the year ended slightly higher. Average realized prices for lead and zinc for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 23% and 21% lower, respectively, compared to the prior year period. The average realized prices for lead and zinc for the full year of 2018 were 2% and 4% lower, respectively, compared to 2017.

Greens Creek Mine - Alaska

For the fourth quarter, silver production was 2,163,563 ounces and gold production was 13,097 ounces, increases of 1% and 13%, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. Full year 2018 silver production was 7,953,003 ounces, a decrease of 5% compared to the prior year period, and 2018 gold production was 51,493 ounces, an increase of 1%. The decrease in silver production resulted from lower grades, and gold production was modestly higher due to higher throughput. The mill operated at an average of 2,310 tons per day (tpd) in the fourth quarter and 2,316 tpd for the full year. The annual throughput was a record.

The cost of sales for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 was $48.3 million and $190.1 million, respectively, a decrease of 22% and 6%, respectively, over the prior year periods. The cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver ounce, for the quarter and full year was $1.79 and $(1.13), respectively, an increase from $0.66 for the fourth quarter 2017, and a decrease from $0.71 for the full year 2017.1 The AISC, after by-product credits, was $7.92 per silver ounce for the fourth quarter and $5.58 for the full year of 2018, up for the quarter from $6.23 and lower for the year from $5.76.2 The higher per silver ounce cash cost, after by-product credits, for the quarter was primarily due to higher production costs and lower by-product credits. The increase in AISC, after by-product credits, for the quarter resulted from higher capital spending. The decrease in cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver ounce for the full year of 2018 was due to higher by-product credits. The impact of higher by-product credits on AISC, after by-product credits, was partially offset by higher capital spending for the full year of 2018.

For the full year of 2018, Greens Creek generated cash provided by operating activities of approximately $125.1 million and spent $40.8 million on additions to properties, plants and equipment, resulting in free cash flow of $84.3 million.5

Casa Berardi - Quebec

Gold production of 35,864 ounces during the fourth quarter 2018, including 4,849 ounces from the East Mine Crown Pillar (EMCP) pit, was 17% lower than the same period of 2017 due to lower grades. Full year 2018 gold production of 162,744 ounces, including 32,097 ounces from the EMCP pit, was higher than the prior year period by 4% and the highest since acquisition of the operation. The mill operated at an average of 3,515 tpd in the fourth quarter 2018 and 3,769 tpd for the year, which is a record and 218 tpd more than 2017, as well as approximately 1,800 tpd more than at acquisition.

Cost of sales was $47.3 million and $199.4 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively, increases of 2% and 8%, respectively, over the prior year periods. The cash cost, after by-product credits, per gold ounce of $940 for the fourth quarter 2018 increased 31% over the prior year period, due to lower gold production.7 For the full year 2018, the cash cost, after by-product credits, per gold ounce, decreased to $800, from $820 for the prior year period, due to higher gold production and expensing of EMCP pit stripping costs during the first half of 2017.1,4 The AISC, after by-product credits, was $1,348 per gold ounce for the fourth quarter and $1,080 for the full year 2018 compared to $1,039 and $1,174 in the same periods of 2017. The increase for the quarter was due to higher capital spending, with the decrease for the full year due to higher gold production and lower capital spending.2

For the full year of 2018, Casa Berardi generated cash provided by operating activities of approximately $82.9 million and spent $39.7 million on additions to properties, plants and equipment, resulting in free cash flow of $43.2 million.5

San Sebastian - Mexico

Silver production was 443,302 ounces for the fourth quarter and 2,037,072 ounces for the full year of 2018 compared to 759,100 and 3,257,738 for the same periods of 2017. Gold production was 2,928 ounces for the fourth quarter and 14,979 ounces for the full year of 2018, compared to 5,955 and 25,177 for the same periods of 2017. The lower metal production was expected due to lower grades as a result of the transition from shallow, high-grade open pits to underground production. The mill operated at an average of 487 tpd in the fourth quarter 2018 and 429 tpd for the year.

The cost of sales was $10.6 million and $41.8 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively, compared to $5.3 million and $23.7 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2017. Cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver ounce was $14.78 in the fourth quarter and $9.69 for the full year of 2018, compared to ($3.80) and ($3.36) for the same periods of 2017.1 The AISC, after by-product credits, was $19.51 for the fourth quarter and $14.68 for the full year of 2018 compared to ($0.64) and ($0.26) for the same periods of 2017.2 The increases in cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver ounce and AISC, after by-product credits, per silver ounce, were due to lower silver and gold production and higher mining costs as a result of the transition to underground mining.

A review of sulfide ore is underway, including a bulk sample to test the capabilities of the third-party plant.

Nevada Operations

For the fourth quarter of 2018, 19,098 gold ounces and 88,156 silver ounces were produced. For the period July 20, 2018 to December 31, 2018, 32,887 gold ounces and 172,301 silver ounces were produced. During 2018, the Nevada operations focused on development at Fire Creek and Hollister, limiting production as little development had been undertaken earlier in the year by Klondex. While the development rate at Fire Creek has exceeded the planned advance, the focus remains on finding ways to maintain the development rate in all ground conditions. In addition, the increasing development is providing additional drill platforms to enhance the exploration program, and five drills are operating for stope design, in-fill drilling and exploration. The Company's plan is to increase Fire Creek's throughput from 350 tons per day to 520 tons per day by mid-2019. At Hollister, the development of a decline to the Hatter Graben exploration target is underway with completion of the initial phase expected to be late in 2019.

During the period July 20, 2018 to December 31, 2018, approximately $32.6 million in capital and $9.3 million in exploration expense was invested in Nevada. Of the $32.6 million in capital, $12.4 million related to the completion of the tailings facility at Midas which is expected to provide the waste capacity for four years of full production, while $13.2 million was for development needed to increase Fire Creek throughput, and $1.5 million was for completing the carbon in leach ""CIL"" circuit at the Midas Mill to increase the recoveries from Hollister ore.

Lucky Friday Mine - Idaho

Silver production was 13,026 ounces in the fourth quarter and 169,041 ounces for the full year 2018, a decrease from 69,578 ounces and 838,658 ounces in the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, respectively, due to the ongoing strike by unionized employees, which began in March 2017. The Company continues to invest in the mine, with limited production and capital improvements being performed by salaried staff.

Construction of the RVM machine continues in Sweden, and is expected to be completed, along with testing of the unit, and sent to the Company in 2020.

EXPLORATION AND PRE-DEVELOPMENT

Exploration

Exploration (including corporate development) expenses were $8.1 million, and $35.7 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively. This represents an increase of 37% and 52% over the fourth quarter and full year 2017. These increases were primarily the result of the addition of the Nevada operations and increased exploration at San Sebastian, the Kinskuch project in British Columbia and the Little Baldy project in northern Idaho.

A complete summary of exploration activities can be found in the news release entitled ""Hecla Reports Record Reserves For Silver, Gold, and Lead"" released on February 14, 2019.

Pre-development

Pre-development spending was $1.3 million in the fourth quarter and $4.9 million for the full year 2018, principally to advance the permitting at Rock Creek and Montanore.

1,2,4,5 Non-GAAP measure. See pages 10-11 for more information.

Rock Creek

In August 2018, the Kootenai National Forest issued the Final Record of Decision (ROD) for Phase I (evaluation phase) of the Rock Creek Project, a proposed underground copper and silver mine in northwestern Montana near Noxon in Sanders County. The Company is updating its plan of operation to reflect the ROD, and agency approval is anticipated in early 2019. The project remains the subject of ongoing litigation.

Montanore

In May 2017, the Federal District court judge in Missoula, Montana remanded back to the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service their approvals for the Montanore project. The court advised that the agencies could proceed with the approval of the evaluation phase of the project. The U.S. Forest Service determined a focused supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (""EIS"") would be prepared on the evaluation phase and published its notice of intent to do so in the Federal Register in December 2017. It is anticipated that the agency will complete its assessment and issue a new ROD in 2019. As a part of this permitting process, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing updated terrestrial and aquatic biological opinions for the project. The project remains the subject of ongoing litigation.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The Research and Development activities of the Company consisted primarily of work being conducted on the RVM, the focus of which is shifting towards fabrication of the unit, with delivery expected in 2020.

DIVIDENDS

The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.0025 per share of common stock, payable on or about March 13, 2019, to shareholders of record on March 5, 2019. The Company's realized silver price was $14.58 in the fourth quarter and therefore did not satisfy the criteria for a larger dividend under the Company's dividend policy.

The Board of Directors also declared the regular quarterly dividend of $0.875 per share on the 157,816 outstanding shares of Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock. This represents a total amount to be paid of approximately $138,000. The cash dividend is payable April 1, 2019, to shareholders of record on March 15, 2019.

NOTES

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures cited in this release and listed below are reconciled to their most comparable GAAP measure at the end of this release.

(1) Cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver and gold ounce is a non-GAAP measurement, a reconciliation of which to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization (sometimes referred to as ""cost of sales"" in this release), can be found at the end of the release. It is an important operating statistic that management utilizes to measure each mine's operating performance. It also allows the benchmarking of performance of each mine versus those of our competitors. As a primary silver mining company, management also uses the statistic on an aggregate basis - aggregating the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian mines - to compare performance with that of other primary silver mining companies. With regard to Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations, management uses cash cost, after by-product credits, per gold ounce to compare its performance with other gold mines. Similarly, the statistic is useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as it provides a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and operating characteristics. In addition, the Company may use it when formulating performance goals and targets under its incentive program.

(2) All in sustaining cost (AISC), after by-product credits, is a non-GAAP measurement, a reconciliation of which to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization, the closest GAAP measurement, can be found in the end of the release. AISC, after by-product credits, includes cost of sales and other direct production costs, expenses for reclamation and exploration at the mines sites, corporate exploration related to sustaining operations, and all site sustaining capital costs. AISC, after by-product credits, is calculated net of depreciation, depletion, and amortization and by-product credits.

Current GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain silver and gold production. Management believes that all in sustaining costs is a non-GAAP measure that provides additional information to management, investors and analysts to help (i) in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and (ii) in the transparency by better defining the total costs associated with production. Similarly, the statistic is useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as it provides a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and operating characteristics. In addition, the Company may use it when formulating performance goals and targets under its incentive program.

(3) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement, a reconciliation of which to net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, can be found at the end of the release. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to evaluate the Company's operating performance but should not be considered an alternative to net income, or cash provided by operating activities as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. In addition, the Company may use it when formulating performance goals and targets under its incentive program.

(4) Cash cost, after by-product credits, per gold ounce, is a Non-GAAP measurement only applicable to Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations production. Gold produced from Greens Creek and San Sebastian is treated as a by-product credit against the silver cash cost.

(5) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure calculated as cash provided by operating activities less additions to properties, plants and equipment.

Other

(6) Expectations for 2019 include silver, gold, lead and zinc production from Greens Creek, San Sebastian, Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations converted using Au $1,250/oz, Ag $16.00/oz, Zn $1.25/lb, and Pb $1.00/lb. Lucky Friday expectations are currently suspended as there is currently a strike. Numbers may be rounded.

(7) Silver and gold equivalent calculation based on average actual prices for each metal in the year as follows: $15.71 for Ag, $1,269 for Au, $1.02 for Pb, and $1.33 for Zn.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements, Including 2019 Outlook

This news release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws, including Canadian securities laws. Such forward-looking statements may include, without limitation: (i) estimates of future costs including cost of sales, cash cost, after by-product credits per ounce of silver/gold and AISC, after by-product credits, per ounce of silver/gold; (ii) estimates for 2019 for silver and gold production and silver equivalent production, cash cost, after by-product credits, AISC, after by-product credits, capital expenditures and exploration and pre-development expenditures (which assumes metal prices of gold at $1,250/oz, Ag $16.00/oz, Zn $1.25/lb, Pb $1.00/lb; USD/CAD assumed to be $0.79, USD/MXN assumed to be $0.06; and (iii) the Company’s mineral reserves and resources. Estimates or expectations of future events or results are based upon certain assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect. Such assumptions, include, but are not limited to: (a) there being no significant change to current geotechnical, metallurgical, hydrological and other physical conditions; (b) permitting, development, operations and expansion of the Company’s projects being consistent with current expectations and mine plans; (c) political/regulatory developments in any jurisdiction in which the Company operates being consistent with its current expectations; (d) the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar, being approximately consistent with current levels; (e) certain price assumptions for gold, silver, lead and zinc; (f) prices for key supplies being approximately consistent with current levels; (g) the accuracy of our current mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates; and (h) the Company’s plans for development and production will proceed as expected and will not require revision as a result of risks or uncertainties, whether known, unknown or unanticipated. Where the Company expresses or implies an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed, projected or implied by the “forward-looking statements.” Such risks include, but are not limited to gold, silver and other metals price volatility, operating risks, currency fluctuations, increased production costs and variances in ore grade or recovery rates from those assumed in mining plans, community relations, conflict resolution and outcome of projects or oppositions, litigation, political, regulatory, labor and environmental risks, and exploration risks and results, including that mineral resources are not mineral reserves, they do not have demonstrated economic viability and there is no certainty that they can be upgraded to mineral reserves through continued exploration. For a more detailed discussion of such risks and other factors, see the Company’s 2018 Form 10-K, filed on February 22, 2019, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as well as the Company’s other SEC filings. The Company does not undertake any obligation to release publicly revisions to any “forward-looking statement,” including, without limitation, outlook, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this news release, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. Investors should not assume that any lack of update to a previously issued “forward-looking statement” constitutes a reaffirmation of that statement. Continued reliance on “forward-looking statements” is at investors’ own risk.

Cautionary Statements to Investors on Reserves and Resources

Reporting requirements in the United States for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by the SEC and included in the SEC's Securities Act Industry Guide 7, entitled “Description of Property by Issuers Engaged or to be Engaged in Significant Mining Operations” (Guide 7). Although the SEC has recently issued new rules rescinding Guide 7, the new rules are not binding until January 1, 2022, and at this time the Company still reports in accordance with Guide 7. However, the Company is also a “reporting issuer” under Canadian securities laws, which require estimates of mineral resources and reserves to be prepared in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101). NI 43-101 requires all disclosure of estimates of potential mineral resources and reserves to be disclosed in accordance with its requirements. Such Canadian information is included herein to satisfy the Company's “public disclosure” obligations under Regulation FD of the SEC and to provide U.S. holders with ready access to information publicly available in Canada.

Reporting requirements in the United States for disclosure of mineral properties under Guide 7 and the requirements in Canada under NI 43-101 standards are substantially different. This document contains a summary of certain estimates of the Company, not only of proven and probable reserves within the meaning of Guide 7, but also of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates estimated in accordance with the definitional standards of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum referred to in NI 43-101. Under Guide 7, the term ""reserve"" means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term ""economically"", as used in the definition of reserve, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The term ""legally"", as used in the definition of reserve, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Hecla must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Hecla's current mine plans. The terms “measured resources”, “indicated resources,” and “inferred resources” are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101. These terms are not defined under Guide 7 and are not normally permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC in the United States, except where required to be disclosed by foreign law. The term “resource” does not equate to the term “reserve”. Under Guide 7, the material described herein as “indicated resources” and “measured resources” would be characterized as “mineralized material” and is permitted to be disclosed in tonnage and grade only, not ounces. The category of “inferred resources” is not recognized by Guide 7. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in such categories will ever be converted into proven or probable reserves. “Resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of such a “resource” will ever be upgraded to a higher category or will ever be economically extracted. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of a “resource” exists or is economically or legally mineable. Investors are also especially cautioned that the mere fact that such resources may be referred to in ounces of silver and/or gold, rather than in tons of mineralization and grades of silver and/or gold estimated per ton, is not an indication that such material will ever result in mined ore which is processed into commercial silver or gold.

Qualified Person (QP) Pursuant to Canadian National Instrument 43-101

Dean McDonald, PhD. P.Geo., Senior Vice President - Exploration of Hecla Mining Company, who serves as a Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101, supervised the preparation of the scientific and technical information concerning Hecla’s mineral projects in this news release. Information regarding data verification, surveys and investigations, quality assurance program and quality control measures and a summary of sample, analytical or testing procedures for the Greens Creek Mine are contained in a technical report prepared for Hecla titled “Technical Report for the Greens Creek Mine, Juneau, Alaska, USA” effective date March 28, 2013, and for the Lucky Friday Mine are contained in a technical report prepared for Hecla titled “Technical Report on the Lucky Friday Mine Shoshone County, Idaho, USA” effective date April 2, 2014, for the Casa Berardi Mine are contained in a technical report prepared for Hecla titled ""Technical Report on the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimate for the Casa Berardi Mine, Northwestern Quebec, Canada"" effective date March 31, 2014 (the ""Casa Berardi Technical Report""), and for the San Sebastian Mine are contained in a technical report prepared for Hecla titled ""Technical Report for the San Sebastian Ag-Au Property, Durango, Mexico"" effective date September 8, 2015. Also included in these four technical reports is a description of the key assumptions, parameters and methods used to estimate mineral reserves and resources and a general discussion of the extent to which the estimates may be affected by any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant factors. Information regarding data verification, surveys and investigations, quality assurance program and quality control measures and a summary of sample, analytical or testing procedures for the Fire Creek Mine are contained in a technical report prepared for Klondex Mines, dated March 31, 2018; the Hollister Mine dated May 31, 2017, amended August 9, 2017; and the Midas Mine dated August 31, 2014, amended April 2, 2015. Copies of these technical reports are available under Hecla's and Klondex's profiles on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

The current Casa Berardi drill program was performed on core sawed in half and included the insertion of blanks and standards of variable grade in every 24 core samples. Standards were generally provided by Analytical Solutions Ltd and prepared in 30-gram bags. Samples were sent to the Swastika Laboratories in Swastika, Ontario, a registered accredited laboratory, where they were dried, crushed, and split for gold analysis. Analysis for gold was completed by fire assay with AA finish. Gold over-limits were analyzed by fire assay with gravimetric finish. Data received from the lab were subject to validation using in-built program triggers to identify outside limit blank or standard assays that require re-analysis. Over 5% of the original pulps and rejects are sent for re-assay to ALS Chemex in Val d’Or for quality control.

Dr. McDonald reviewed and verified information regarding drill sampling, data verification of all digitally-collected data, drill surveys and specific gravity determinations relating to the Casa Berardi mine. The review encompassed quality assurance programs and quality control measures including analytical or testing practice, chain-of-custody procedures, sample storage procedures and included independent sample collection and analysis. This review found the information and procedures meet industry standards and are adequate for Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation and mine planning purposes.

(1) Cash cost, after by-product credits, per ounce and AISC, after by-product credits. per ounce represent non-U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measurements. A reconciliation of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization (GAAP) to cash cost, after by-product credits can be found in the cash cost per ounce reconciliation section of this news release. Gold, lead and zinc produced have been treated as by-product credits in calculating silver costs per ounce. The primary metal produced at Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations is gold, with a by-product credit for the value of silver production.

Non-GAAP Measures

(Unaudited)

Reconciliation of Cost of Sales and Other Direct Production Costs and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (GAAP) to Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP) and All-In Sustaining Cost, Before By-product Credits and All-In Sustaining Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP)

The tables below present reconciliations between the most comparable GAAP measure of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization to the non-GAAP measures of (i) Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits, (ii) Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, (iii) AISC, Before By-product Credits and (iv) AISC, After By-product Credits for our operations at the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, San Sebastian, Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations units and for the Company for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and for estimated amounts for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.

Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce is a measure developed by precious metals companies (including the Silver Institute) in an effort to provide a uniform standard for comparison purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that these non-GAAP measures as we report them are the same as those reported by other mining companies.

Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce is an important operating statistic that we utilize to measure each mine's operating performance. We have recently started reporting AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce which we use as a measure of our mines' net cash flow after costs for exploration, pre-development, reclamation, and sustaining capital. This is similar to the Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce non-GAAP measure we report, but also includes on-site exploration, reclamation, and sustaining capital costs. Current GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain silver and gold production. Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce also allow us to benchmark the performance of each of our mines versus those of our competitors. As a primary silver and gold mining company, we also use these statistics on an aggregate basis. We aggregate the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian mines to compare our performance with that of other primary silver mining companies and aggregate the Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations units to compare our performance with that of other primary gold mining companies. Similarly, these statistics are useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as they provide a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and operating characteristics.

Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and AISC, Before By-product Credits include all direct and indirect operating cash costs related directly to the physical activities of producing metals, including mining, processing and other plant costs, third-party refining expense, on-site general and administrative costs, royalties and mining production taxes. AISC, Before By-product Credits for each mine also includes on-site exploration, reclamation, and sustaining capital costs. AISC, Before By-product Credits for our consolidated silver properties also includes corporate costs for general and administrative expense, exploration and sustaining capital projects. By-product credits include revenues earned from all metals other than the primary metal produced at each unit. As depicted in the tables below, by-product credits comprise an essential element of our silver unit cost structure, distinguishing our silver operations due to the polymetallic nature of their orebodies.

In addition to the uses described above, Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce provide management and investors an indication of operating cash flow, after consideration of the average price, received from production. We also use these measurements for the comparative monitoring of performance of our mining operations period-to-period from a cash flow perspective.

The Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations sections below report Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce for the production of gold, their primary product, and by-product revenues earned from silver, which is a by-product at Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations. Only costs and ounces produced relating to units with the same primary product are combined to represent Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce. Thus, the gold produced at our Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations units is not included as a by-product credit when calculating Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce for the total of Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian, our combined silver properties. Similarly, the silver produced at our other three units is not included as a by-product credit when calculating the similar gold metrics for Casa Berardi.

Reconciliation of Net (Loss) Income Applicable to Common Shareholders (GAAP) to Adjusted Net (Loss) Income Applicable to Common Shareholders (non-GAAP)

This release refers to a non-GAAP measure of adjusted net (loss) income applicable to common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share, which are indicators of our performance. They exclude certain impacts which are of a nature which we believe are not reflective of our underlying performance. Management believes that adjusted net (loss) income per common share provides investors with the ability to better evaluate our underlying operating performance.

Reconciliation of Net Loss (GAAP) and Debt (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) and Net Debt (non-GAAP)

This release refers to the non-GAAP measures of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (""Adjusted EBITDA""), which is a measure of our operating performance, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months (or ""LTM adjusted EBITDA""), which is a measure of our ability to service our debt. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income (loss) before the following items: interest expense, income tax provision, depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense, exploration expense, pre-development expense, acquisition costs, interest and other income (expense), foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses on derivative contracts, unrealized gains on investments, provisions for environmental matters, stock-based compensation, and provisional price gains and losses. Net debt is calculated as total debt, which consists of the liability balances for our Senior Notes, capital leases, and other notes payable, less the total of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Management believes that, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, adjusted EBITDA and net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. The following table reconciles net loss and debt to adjusted EBITDA and net debt:

(1) The term “reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term “economically,” as used in the definition of reserve, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The term “legally,” as used in the definition of reserve, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Hecla must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a time frame consistent with Hecla’s current mine plans.

I will now pass the call to Phil Baker.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Mike. Yeah, good morning, everyone. There's a couple of things I want to highlight for you this morning before turning the call over to the team for specifics. We're gonna start on slide three.

The first thing is that our best minds are getting even better. We set records for the highest level of silver, gold, and lead reserves in our history, and it was done with a drill bit, not through acquisitions. By the way, our zinc reserves would have also been a record, but fell 3,010 short. Realize these reserves were done with some of the lowest price assumptions for calculating reserves in the industry, and ours still went up significantly. And price assumptions matter. It means our least profitable ounces have more margin. So, when you consider reserves, remember that not all ounces are created equal. We have high margin ounces largely in Alaska and Quebec, great margins in great jurisdictions.

In addition, we also had the most measured and indicated resources in our history, as well as the most inferred. My expectation is for more reserve increases in the future. Particularly notable was Greens Creek, with about 15 to 20% increase in reserves of all metals, and an extension of the reserve mine life to around 2030. If you consider the reserves, the mine life could be five to 10 years longer. This mine produces about half our revenues, and over the last 10 years, a billion dollars of free cash flow. My expectation is that over the next couple of decades, it might produce maybe $2 billion of free cash flow. Greens Creek is a remarkable mine, but sometimes I think the market has just taken it for granted.

Also notable is Casa Berardi, which produces about 35% of our total revenues, adding about 400,000 gold ounces of gold reserves on surface with the new West Mine Crown Pillar Pit, a 28% increase in reserves. This pit is only slightly lower-grade than our highest-grade pit, and I suspect it will get bigger as we do the work to steepen the pit walls and do more definition drilling.

Story continues

Greens Creek and Casa together generated about 85% of our revenue, all of our free cash flow, and are getting better and longer-lived. They're also the model at what we're trying to do at our three other operations -- San Sebastian, Lucky Friday, and Nevada. I just came back from Nevada and want to share with you a few of my observations. It reminds me in many respects of where we were when we acquired Casa -- more questions than answers, lots of work that we have to prioritize, people that we have to determine their capabilities -- and like Casa, we've made significant progress. Much of it will not be visible to you in many statistics yet. But Larry's gonna talk to you about the progress we've made in development. It's been significant, but we are still trying different ways of dealing with different conditions in the mine. So, while we're in a hurry to get to a steady state, we will take the time necessary to figure out the challenges of these mines so our Nevada operations will never value for the long term.

Before I move on to the 2019 outlook, I want to point out the photo that's on the right side of that PowerPoint slide. It's from Sandvik's magazine called Solid Ground, in which Alain Grenier, GM of Casa Berardi Mine, and the rest of the Casa Berardi team is featured. The article centers on the successful operation of the two Sandvik 40-ton autonomous haul trucks, and it's on our website if you'd like to read it. By the way, there are also two other cover stories from 2018 that are on our website -- one from SME and the other from CIM.

So, go to slide four, where we provide our estimates of production costs, capital, exploration, and R&D for 2019. Greens Creek and San Sebastian have similar production profiles in 2019, as in 2018. We expect silver cash costs to be only $1.10 an ounce, and all-in costs less than $11.00. Casa Berardi production estimates are a little lower than last year due to lower grades, causing cost to be slightly higher. Estimated Nevada gold production is higher with a full-year of production and considerably lower costs. The gold side of the business is expected to have cash costs per ounce of $8.75, and all-in costs of $12.50.

We estimate $150 million for capital, which is similar to last year; about $25 million expiration expenditures, a reduction of $10 million. When you add it all up at today's prices, we expect Hecla to generate free cash.

So, I'm gonna pass the call over to Lindsay.

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide six, we reported a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $27 million, or $0.06 per share, with almost all the loss occurring during the last quarter; and an adjusted net loss of $0.11 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $212 million versus $232 million in 2017. Gold cash costs and all-in sustaining cash costs, both after by-product credits, came in at $871.00 and $1,226.00 per ounce respectively; while silver cash costs and all-in sustaining cash costs after by-product credits were $1.08 and $11.44 per ounce. We're happy with our costs at our operating units, other than Nevada operations, which we reported higher costs, while we worked through what we believe are transitional issues.

Slide seven shows our revenue streams that are nicely diversified, with gold at 53%, silver at 24%, zinc at 17%, and lead at 6%. Greens Creek again continues to be the dominant source of revenues, contributing 47% of our total revenues. We realize that it has a more silver/gold ratio, the revenue of the two metals would almost be equal.

Moving to slide eight, revenues for the year totaled $567 million, versus $578 million last year. We had record gold sales of 248,000 ounces at a slightly higher realized goal price this year, with our acquisitions of our Nevada operations effective July 23rd contributing toward that record, offsetting the reduced silver production and sales, primarily at San Sebastian, and lower silver prices realized this year.

Earnings from mine operations amounted to $79 million, which is $73 million lower than last year. This reduction is not surprising, as it is primarily due to completing open pit mining at our San Sebastian operation in 2017, and moving to an underground operation in 2018, where the grades are lower and the mining costs are higher. Lower other expenses, including taxes, offset lower operating profit, resulting in a net loss of $27 million, which was similar to that of 2017.

On a consolidated basis, we generated $94 million in cash from operating activities, and invested $137 million at our mine sites. Of that $137 million, $36 million was invested at our Nevada operations, and included approximately $14 million to complete a new Tailings dam and to upgrade the CIL circuit in the mill to improve recoveries. We have a goal of financial discipline in which each of our mines should produce free cash flow. And clearly, that didn't happen with our Nevada operations that we acquired effective July of last year. We expect in 2019, the Nevada mining operations will be cash flow positive, but we'll invest those cash flows and more in exploration around the various Nevada mine sites and the development of the Hatter Graben decline. As to the other mine sites, we have no major capital initiatives planned for 2019.

Moving to the balance sheet, at yearend, we had approximately $275 million in liquidity, which includes a $250 million line of credit which was undrawn at yearend, and $27 million in cash on hand. Our debt consists of $500 million in bonds, which are repayable in 2021, and $31 million owed to Ressources Quebec, also due in 2021. The bonds are callable at par on May 1st of this year. We continually monitor the capital markets, and while we're able to refinance the bonds today, it would be at rates higher than the current bond's existing rate of 6.875%.

We will continue to focus on turning our Nevada operations into a cash flow generator, building up expected cash balances and being patient about refinancing of our bonds. We have other methods available to us to reduce our total interest expense, such as using term bank debt, so if the high-yield market continues to be pricey for single-B debt issuers, then we may use these other methods in accommodation with new bonds being issued to reduce future interest expense payments. Also, I'd point out, in the back of our release, our calculated net debt to last 12 months' EBITDA was 2.4, which would typically be representative of a higher credit rating than we currently are assigned.

So, in summary, we had a good 2018 and are very excited about the potential for 2019 and beyond. But now I'll pass it on to Larry to talk about the operations.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Thanks, Lindsay, and good morning. To start with, I want to highlight that our all injury frequency rate for 2018 declined 28% companywide, as you can see on slide 10. This is a statistic that we are very proud of, and frankly, we'll work to reduce it again this year.

Also of note, Casa Berardi recently reached one million man hours without a lost time accident. This is an incredible improvement from 2013, the year that we acquired the mine. Our Lucky Friday supervisory staff is also to be commended, having operated the mine since the strike began without an injury.

I also want to highlight the good work done at Greens Creek on slide 11, which, as Phil notes, is our most important mine, that generates about half of our cash flow. With the big jump in reserves that we have recorded and the resulting three years or so of mine life addition, the team is working hard on a new technical report. With the revised mine plan reducing the development in the next few years, moving the highest margin material from the end of the mine life to the next few years, we should see a significant increase in the value of the mine.

Greens Creek, as can be seen on slide 12, had another strong year, producing over eight million ounce of silver at a cash cost after by-product credit $0.66 per silver ounce. Contributing to this performance was record throughput of 2,301 tons per day.

Moving on to Casa Berardi on slide 13, this mine just keeps performing better and better. The 157 ounces of gold produced was the highest since we acquired the operation. Fourth quarter production level was a bit lower than the previous quarter, in part due to the removal of the primary crusher and replacement with a higher-capacity crusher, which took about a week.

The record production is primarily due to throughput, as shown on slide 14. The mill operated at an average of 3,515 tons per day in the fourth quarter 2018, and 3,769 tons per day for the year. Casa milled 825 tons per day more than 2016, and almost 2,000 tons a day greater than when the mine was acquired. In 2018, open pit feed accounted for 46% of the mill feed. We have run the mill at over 4,000 tons per day on a spot basis. We continue to study increasing throughput even further.

Casa Berardi was our second-highest cash flow generator in 2018, and a technical report is also being put together for it, reflecting the significant increase in surface reserves in what could be the fifth surface pit, called the West Mine Crown Pillar Pit.

Let's move on to Nevada on slide 15, where most of our focus is this year. We have a plan to turn around the assets, and we are working that plan. In 2018, the focus was on getting the operation back on track in terms of understanding ground conditions at Fire Creek and getting the team organized. We have come a long way in this regard. Our strategy is simple: develop and drill. We believe that the grades can be improved through new discoveries and resource conversion, and/or production can be ramped up by opening up more working zones.

Fire Creek, we have done a review of equipment and are adding equipment from Midas and from buying some new equipment. We've added two trucks, two large loaders, one jumbo, two bulkers to the Nevada fleet for costing a total of about $6 million, with the expectation that the upgrade will increase productivity. The implementation of Shot Creek at the end of the development process is resulting in better ground conditions, as expected, which should minimize the need to go back in and rehab development repeatedly, as was the case under prior management.

The CIL plant upgrade is complete, and the mill is now able to process Hollister ore. We have exceeded our annual development target of 35 feet per day in January, as shown on slide 16, and the goal will be to maintain this level and increase it where possible, because this should open up additional headings and increase production.

We have wrapped up Fire Creek manpower for -- underground manpower for 76 to about 110 through transfer of Midas and Hollister miners. Our contractor has brought in a road header at Fire Creek, and it is easily cutting the soft cup material, which is helping to speed up development, and we are considering a wider application of this type of machine. We're planning to increase Fire Creek throughput midyear to about 520 tons per day from 340 tons per day, which was the fourth quarter average, which means that the goal production will be weighted toward the second half of the year. The increased development is an important step for Dean's group, as we have worked to do on definition drilling to upgrade resources, and exploration to discover additional resources.

At San Sebastian, on slide 17, we are now collecting the bulk sample of sulfide material, and we should have it run through a third party mill for testing by the end of the second quarter. We currently have oxide material to take us well into 2020, and Dean's group has a priority of finding more oxide ore.

I'll hand it over now to Dan.

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Thanks, Larry. Last week, we announced the highest levels of silver, gold, and lead reserves in 128-year history. Total gold reserves reached 2.85 million ounces, an increase of 26% from last year, mostly due to increases in open pits at Casa Berardi as a result of successful surface drilling. Silver reserves grew up 8% to 191 million ounces, primarily from Greens Creek, due to a combination of good drilling results, advanced resource modeling techniques, and improved smelter terms. The increase in resources is also important, because this suggests the potential for increasing reserves in the future.

We continued with aggressive drill programs in the fourth quarter, following successes at Casa Berardi, Nevada, Greens Creek, and San Sebastian. A list of drill intersections is provided in the Appendix B of the Exploration release on February 14th, giving insights into the high-grade resources we are confirming and expanding.

As you can see from slide 19, Hecla reserve price assumptions of 1,450 per silver ounce and 1,200 per bold ounce are some of the lowest commodity prices used in the industry, and have been for many years. On slide 20, you can see that over the past 11 years, we have consistently replaced or grown silver reserves from 130 to 191 million ounces, in addition to the 142 million ounces of cumulative production over that time. This means we have actually added a total of 200 million silver ounces in the past 11 years, with no contributions from acquisitions.

At Casa Berardi, we had considerable drilling success again along the main trends, particularly near surface. And this has resulted in the new West Mine Crown Pillar Pit, as shown on the left-hand of slide 21; and expanded East Mine Crown Pillar and principal pits with a total of 442,000 ounces of new gold reserves added during the year. There are now a series of pits along the Casa Berardi definition zone. Underground exploration was also successful. The red arrows show the projections of high-grade shoots that will be evaluated in the coming year, particularly in the East Mine, where access was reestablished last year. A closer look at the West Mine Crown Pillar Pit in the cross-section on slide 22 shows the convergence of several broad mineralized lenses near surface, providing the critical mass for a potentially very economic open pit, and the possible exploitation of zones with underground mining in the future.

At Greens Creek, there was significant growth in reserves. As shown on slide 23, definition and exploration drilling continued to add reserves higher in the mine at the East Ore and Upper Plate Zones. Lower in the mine, we were adding to reserves and resources along some existing trends in the Gallagher Deep 200 South and Lower Southwest Zones. Three drills will be operating underground all year in these areas, with the goal of defining additional reserves.

In 2018, very little exploration occurred on the Nevada projects until the Klondex acquisition was completed. It is evident that we urgently need to upgrade resources to move into the mine plans and identify new resources. Slide 24 shows how significantly we are accelerating our efforts for both underground and surface drilling, with more crews, more drills, more technology, and increased budgets in 2019. The upper diagram on the right shows the location of underground definition and exploration drilling at Fire Creek. Intense underground drilling is planned for Spirals 2, 3, 4, and 9, and the Titan Zone to upgrade resources that can lead to near-term reserves. Exploration of the Spiral 9 and North Zone provides the opportunity to extend some of the known mineralization trends. This drilling is planned to be in combination with surface drilling that will be initiated in April, and we'll evaluate the Zeus Guard Shack and South Notice targets.

Lower in the diagram on the right shows the drills at Hollister are working to define the mineralization trends in West Gloria, Central Hollister, and Guinevere for near-term mining. The development advancing to the east toward the Hatter Graben provides underground drill platforms for the drilling of targets in the East Clementine area and into the Hatter Graben late in the year. Surface drilling is planned to begin in April, with the goal of extending the Hatter Graben resource to the east.

At San Sebastian, as shown on slide 25, mining studies are being completed on the Professor East Francine veins and the polymetallic mineralization of the Francine vein. While at the same time, surface drilling is focused on defining new near surface oxide mineralization along the West Francine and Esperanza veins. Recently, we have successfully identified new oxide veins at the El Toro target, and are pushing hard to define a new oxide source with further drilling. The emphasis of exploration in 2019 is to rapidly advance our opportunities in Nevada, define new oxide mineralization at San Sebastian, and continue the drilling successes at Casa Berardi and Greens Creek.

And with that, I'll pass the call back to Phil.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And our first question comes from Cosmos Chiu from CIBC. Your line is now open.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Hi. Thanks, Phil, Lindsay, Larry, and Dean. Thanks for the call. If I may, my questions are mostly on Fire Creek here. I understand that Fire Creek and the entire sort of Nevada complex is still a work in progress. Certainly in 2018, a transitional year, there were some disappointments with the decrease of reserves beyond what was produced. I'm just trying to get a better understanding in terms of what has been the biggest surprise to you at these Nevada assets in terms of reserves, in terms of production, as you know, ownership has handed -- since ownership has been handed over to Hecla.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I'll start, and then I'll let Larry and Dean jump in. But I think the biggest surprise and disappointment was the Klondex didn't follow the budget that they had presented to us. And so, as a result, the amount of development that was done was significantly less than was supposed to be done. And so, as a result, it really has caused us to have to really focus and reestablish the mine. That's probably the biggest thing from my perspective. Larry?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Certainly operationally, the biggest challenge is getting the development caught up. Despite ground conditions, which are challenging, we are on an acceleration track. And Cosmos, for just a comment on the reserves -- and we hit them pretty hard. Clearly, there was mine depletion. There was no drilling in the first half of the year. And so, there really wasn't time to refine and identify new reserves. But the other thing, we knew that there was a challenge in reconciling the production grades with the mill. And so, we really relooked at the modeling. We narrowed the vein or the size of the vein within the models. And so, we actually -- and changed the capping or top cut. And consequently, that represented about half the reserve losses. We've been very conservative in our modeling in those -- of the existing resources and reserves.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, we want to make sure that we have a base to build from in terms of reserves, in terms of resources. The development we want to -- it's still a work in progress to figure out the development, hence why we're looking at a roadheader to go in and do the development in advance. So, we think there's a lot of different levers to pull before we will optimize this mine, and similar to what we saw at Casa Berardi.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. Of course. And Phil and Dean, it's great that you brought up the reserves and resources. Looking at it here, and you talked about Spirals 2, 3, 4, and 9, and a number of different zones -- Vonnie, Joyce, Karen, Honey, and others. I'm just trying to understand what of these new -- what of these zones that you've identified are considered -- categorized as, say, new zones, versus an extension of current mineralization? I think Dean sort of touched on that Spiral 9 looks like it could be an extension in terms of a drilling platform for current utilization. I'm just trying to get a better understanding and trying to gauge the difficulty in terms of adding to reserves and resources based on, are they new zones, or are they extensions, and whatnot.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I'll let Dean answer the question.

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Yeah. Well, Cosmos, it's really all of the above. They're clearly extensions to the existing -- you mentioned Vonnie and Joyce, the veins that have been key producers in the past. There are extensions to the north and south. In fact, there may be opportunities up dip. But as you go to the north in what's referred to as -- well, let me step back. So, for those zones, we know they're there. There's been some preliminary drilling to define them. And now, we're getting the development in place to drill them off. From an expiration point of view, particularly to the north, you have Spiral 9, you have the North Zone, that -- the North Zone's really a northern extension of the known veins. We're seeing in the Titan Zone a series of new veins there, and then in Spiral 9. Surface drilling to the northwest with Zeus, I think, are defining some new veins that certainly look encouraging. We're gonna need to drill them out. But I do see kind of near-term upgrading, expansion along trends, and then with Spiral 9, Zeus, and others, things that are gonna come in in the next few years.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. Great. And then maybe that leads into my next question here. In terms of timing, when would you be ready to potentially put out a reserve resource update? Again, there are -- and do you have some market concerns in terms of the low ounces on current reserves at this point in time? I guess understanding that, Nevada's still a work in progress, and all the other issues that we had talked about in the past, or just now. But I'm just wondering, when would you be ready to potentially put out a new reserve resource?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

We have not actually made a determination. Our typical schedule is yearend, and I'm not envisioning that we're planning to change that. Or any . . .

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Yeah. At this point, Cosmos, I'd say we'd stay with our traditional schedule. But depending on what transpires, that may change.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. And maybe one last question on Fire Creek here. We've been given the production guidance for 2019 for Nevada as a whole, as a complex. But I'm just wondering how much of the 69,000 ounces in reserves for Fire Creek have you sort of incorporated into that 2019 guidance? Have you incorporated any of the beyond reserves into that guidance?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, the answer's yes. Some of this would be beyond reserves. As far as what that percentage is, I couldn't tell you. But it's -- does anybody know?

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

I don't know the exact number on that one.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Okay. But there's some. But a lot of it, the bulk of it, I guess, would be based on reserves.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Well, it is a combination. I mean, we -- and this was part of the calculus we did in acquiring this, is that you have to convert inferred into reserves. And frankly, what happens is gonna be similar to what we've seen at other mines, where we are producing mineralization that maybe doesn't even make a category. And we certainly see that Greens Creek a lot. We don't see any -- that this would be any different than that.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Yeah. Great. And sorry, I lied. Maybe one last question on Fire Creek here. You talk about increasing the under mine, underground throughput from, I think, 350 tons per day to 520 by mid-2019. Is that as simple as, as Larry said, getting ahead on development, getting your 1,200 feet per month in place. Is that really the bottleneck?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

It's a key -- the key to expanding throughput is in expanding development, without a doubt. Obviously, we need to also drill ahead of ourselves, get our definition drilling in place, confirm the scopes before we dive into them. All of that's driven by development.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. And you're happy with the 1,200 feet per month level, Dean, or Larry?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah. I mean, we've seeded it in January. We're a little bit behind in February, only because we're driving raises right now, so we're doing less capital lateral footage. But we see the sustain on plan. It was a matter of injecting more miners and more machines, and that's on track. And now, we actually have some opportunity to improve our actual cycle at the face. That's the next challenge that we will take on.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And I just wanted to just make sure that people understand, you're still trying new things, and you don't have a standard development plan yet for the cycle yet. You're still working through that.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah. We're still working through that. We're still doing conventional drill and blast, which are typically very short rounds, at Fire Creek, in the ground, since . . . So, we have to have a lot of headings, shootings, and short blasts. And so, there's opportunity there. The roadheader, the first trial, was very successful. It kept the material very well. It left behind a very solid back and rib. And so, we're just -- we're learning as we go. We're injecting -- we have our VP Tech Services onsite pretty much all the time now. We've taken Lucky Friday expertise down, and we're making the improvements that we should be.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. Great. Thank you. That's all I have. Thanks a lot.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Cosmos.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Fields from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Hey, guys. So, back since you've issued the bonds in 2013, in your EBITDA reconciliation, you've added back or taken away, as is the case, the gains or losses unrealized on derivative contracts. So, for the first nine months to today, that was basically a $40 million hit in your EBITDA, because you've gained that in your income statement, but all of a sudden, for the fourth quarter, most of that's gone away. So, it looks like you only take away about $8 million instead of $40. So, it looks like you're inflating your EBITDA by about $32 million. Can you help me understand why that's not the case?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, the first thing I'd say is that the derivatives contracts that we had, we closed out in the third quarter and generated $35 million, $32 million of cash from those contracts. So, we have not -- when the price of zinc and lead fell, and we were able to generate that cash. And so, we were monetizing that hedge. So, we've done that. Now, prices have come back up for zinc and lead, and so, we're putting new positions in place. So, to the extent that prices continue to rise, we'll have that -- that number will grow as we put in more contracts, and to the extent those go underwater. But Lindsay, anything to add to that?

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, Matthew, maybe you're saying we're detected $40 million and arriving at adjusted net income. We take that gain out. Then we include it in our EBITDA calculation. That's still alluded to, the cash we received on the closing of the hedges. It's much the same -- we were kind of following covenants, which allowed it, so.

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Right, but the first nine months of 2018, basically you add back -- you take away $40 million, and then all of a sudden, that disappears in the full year. I'm just . . .

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

You're talking about income statement, or balance sheet, or cash flow? Pardon me?

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Income statement is, for the first nine months, you've gained $40 million on derivatives. That shows up in the full year income statement as well.

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Not much happened in the fourth quarter, Matthew.

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Right, agreed. And the EBITDA reconciliation, when you look at you know your third quarter release, that entire $40 million from the income statement was taken away, but now all of a sudden, on the fourth quarter report, only $8 million is taken away.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I think what you're saying, maybe in the third quarter, we didn't add back the cash gains on the cashed out hedges, right? Is that what you're alluding to? We'll look back in and check that, but.

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Yeah, but if I look at your cash flow statement, it looks like you've only gained modified $15 million. So, there's a lot of -- there's some screwy numbers going on, and just, maybe we can take this offline, because you reported $156 million of EBITDA for the first nine months, $28 million in the fourth quarter, and somehow, that's supposed add up to $211 million. Happy to take this offline.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, let's take it offline. I might argue, they're not screwy numbers. They're just accounting and cash flows being mixed, so. We'll deal with it.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Okay. Any other question, Matthew?

Operator

Thank you. Your next question comes from Heiko Ihle from H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure thing, Heiko.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

Great. I promised myself I wouldn't ask a Casa Berardi question this time for once. So, going over to Nevada, you mentioned the asset should be cash flow positive this year. Are you willing to quantify this just a little bit more, especially given that your all-in sustaining cost estimate there is $1,325.00 an ounce?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

No, what we've said is that the operations will be cash flow positive with the exception of the exploration and the development for the Hatter Graben. So, when you look at -- so, basically we're saying that we're right at positive cash flow from Nevada, and if you look at the all-in sustaining cost, you see that.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then, the decline is about 15% complete, so there's still bunch of work to do, obviously. Speaking of --

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, we'll do 5,000 feet of development at Hatter Graben.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

And speaking of Nevada and following up from the question that Cosmos had asked, I mean, you mentioned the increase in the throughput at Fire Creek from 350 tons per day to 520 tons per day by 2019. You also mentioned that your focus on -- and this is from your lease -- maintaining the development grade and all ground conditions. Am I reading something into here that's not there? Is there something I'm missing? I thought the ground conditions have been in that mine, as the ground conditions at Fire Creek are actually pretty solid. Is there -- are there pockets that need extra ground support? Or again, am I missing something there?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Well, you'll remember, when we first bought it, we talked about fact that we had this tuft that created road conditions that we had to come in with the synthetic liner and build a road base. Well, that's -- so, we dealt with the road conditions, but you have that same condition on the back and on the ribs. And so, that's what Larry is alluding to with the shot creating that we've had to do, and that's why we're contemplating the roadheader going through this soft material. Larry?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, it's variable. You can see very good ground conditions for -- we'll get 24 feet a day on a given head-in. And then, at times, we run into altered tufts and very clay-like material that takes short rounds and requires a fair amount of support. And the additional shot treatment. So, it's variable.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And then you also have the introduction of water into this tuft, which again -- and if you think about it, if you look at those pictures of the road, you get a sense of how soupy it becomes and difficult to operate in. And so, we're trying to figure out the best way to deal with the changing ground conditions. And so, that's why I have continued to make a point that we're experimenting, we're trying new things. I'm more interested in Larry coming to a series of standards, depending on the ground conditions, rather than just being so worried about getting the development. But, Larry.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah. You mentioned water, there's water in certain pockets, and we're looking at a bit more of a mobile dewatering plan so that we're not managing the water underground. So, yeah, we've shown -- as Phil alluded, we've shown photos of some of the poor conditions and what we're doing to manage them. We've got the right team there. I mentioned the roadheader -- it's actually a very small roadheader that we're trialing right now. And if it continues to perform as well as it seems to be, we may go all in for a large roadheader, I mean, a really large roadheader, and really jack up the advancement.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

Very helpful. Thank you, guys.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Okay, thanks, Heiko.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony Sorrentino from Sorrentino Metals. Your line is now open.

Anthony Sorrentino -- Sorrentino Metals -- Analyst

Good morning, everyone.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Nice to talk to you.

Anthony Sorrentino -- Sorrentino Metals -- Analyst

Yeah, same here. You're estimating 2019 capital expenditures at $150 million and 2019 exploration expenditures at $25 million. Would you break those down by property?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Does someone have it handy, or . . .

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Well, I'll talk about the exploration. So, you know that $25 million, Anthony, the -- half of it will be in Nevada, and the remainder will be split between Casa Berardi, San Sebastian, and Greens Creek. There'll be very little exploration outside of those four areas.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And Casa Berardi in Mexico were roughly $3 million apiece.

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, Casa's $3.6 million. San Sebastian's . . .

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And then as far as the capital goes, it's that $12 million for the Lucky Friday, about $50 million each for Greens Creek and Nevada, and then about $40 million for Casa Berardi.

Anthony Sorrentino -- Sorrentino Metals -- Analyst

Okay. Very good. Thank you for answering my questions.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure thing.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ajay Lele from Southpaw. Your line is now open.

Ajay Lele -- Southpaw -- Analyst

Hello? Can you hear me?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

We can.

Ajay Lele -- Southpaw -- Analyst

Great. I just wanted to ask about the Casa Berardi medium-term cost outlook as you move from underground what looks like into more of an open pit mine plan for your recent reserve announcement? Thank you.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, there's really no change in the percentage of surface and underground planned any time soon. We'll have a number of years of the underground based on the current reserve, and we're adding to reserves periodically. So, those will not change. It's still roughly 50-50, and the grade of the underground's about twice the grade of the open pit -- maybe a little more, not much. The new stuff that we've added from the West Mine is a bit higher-grade than the surface average. So, all in all, our expectation is to sort of maintain the cost structure that you see as we develop both the underground and the surface.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Can I add to that?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure, please.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

So, all of that's premised on a permit limit of 1.4 million tons, metric tons per year, and we are going to apply for an addition to that. Should we successfully raise the permitted limit and make some adjustments in the mill, then we could increase the amount of open pit feed going into the mill.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, that's right. And that would be increased to how much?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Well, we're applying for $1.6 million.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So, $0.2 million more?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah.

Ajay Lele -- Southpaw -- Analyst

Thanks.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Trevor Turnbull from Scotiabank. Your line is now open.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Yeah, hi. I just had one quick question, a very simple question with respect to Nevada. Is there any chance you're gonna have a site visit this year? It might make it simpler to understand some of the stuff that's been discussed on the call so far.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I'm sure we'll have one this year. We haven't made any specific plans at the moment. I want Larry and his team to have the opportunity to get their SOPs for the development in the different conditions resolved before we start bringing people onto the site. So, while we're still in this learning phase, it's probably better to wait.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Okay. My other questions were really more for Larry with respect to Greens Creek -- Larry and Dean. I guess the first thing, you've got some exploration and potential reserve additions coming at Greens. Can you give us a sense, Dean, what that's going to look like in terms of the reserve grade you've got there at Greens Creek? I think you're on the order of, what, 400 grams silver now? Are these areas likely to be consistent with that and kind of maintain a similar level of silver?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, Trevor, so, last year, and I think I announced this per ton, but last year, our reserves were 11.8, and we're at 11.5 this year. My expectation is that you're gonna see that 11.5 to 12 with potential resources converting to reserves. We are exploring upper plate. It's narrower, but very high grade. The same is true for East ore. And both of those areas are higher up in the mine. And Deep 200 South is, overall, more precious metal rich, so that you will see, with a couple of these areas, higher-grade precious metals than the reserve grade and slightly lower base metals, but that's gonna fluctuate. Overall, I don't see huge changes in the grade, the reserve grade overall.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

So, maybe a better way to think about it, really, given all the base metals, is that NSR is unlikely to change a whole lot in terms of the value per ton of the stuff you're looking at versus what you've already got.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, I think that's a good comment.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

So, I guess what I'm also wondering is, you talked about, certainly on the slide and in the presentation, looking to move some high-grade material forward in the mine plan, and it feels like you've been just kind of a little ahead of reserve grade recently. Are you looking to kind of still kind of maintain that, or are you looking for a pretty significant bump in the grade you're moving forward? And I guess my question really is trying to get at are you gonna kind of be above the reserve grade in aggregate there for a few years, and then kind of to what degree, such that I kind of understand to what degree it might -- sorry, it might dip below reserve grade going forward?

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Over the next sort of four years, 2020 through 2023, the reserve grades will be -- or production grades will be higher than what it has been. I don't off the top of my head have -- I can't remember what that will be. But as a result, we'll have higher ounce production. Larry, generally speaking -- and we'll have the -- in the 43101, you'll be able to see that. But generally speaking, Dean?

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Yeah, and next year. This will not match the technical report exactly because this is more of an internal . . .

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

This includes inferred and everything.

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Yeah, this is not gonna match the technical report, but it'll give you kind of an idea of where we'll be. We should be, next year, in the 12.5 ounce per ton silver.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So, call it an ounce better in the next few years.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Yeah, a healthy 10% or so better than where it's been. And then, Larry, I guess also just referring to that slide 11 in the deck. You show the old design with a ramp. It looks like you've been able to get away without having to put in that ramp, which is obviously a huge savings, and you've gone to this -- what looks to be a much more simplified design. I'm just curious, it looks almost too good to be true that you could get rid of all that development and do what you need to do using existing workings. Can you just explain a little bit about how that came to pass, that you could eliminate all that development and still achieve what you needed to?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

The graphic that we included is just one example. This is the East Ore in the very high end of the mine, where we anticipate when we published our report, that there'll be 15,000 fewer development feed. And a part of it is coming from this section we're showing in the graph, but not all of it. Some of it's just a good rethink of how we're accessing what are complicated ore bodies; these things are geometrically complex. And the more we can come off of the existing access, as we have in this example, the less development we're gonna do. So, 15,000 feet capitalize-wise is no small amount of money. It's actually its quite significant.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

But to the point, I think some of this has come as a result of being able to take more data and build a clear picture of where these ore bodies are. I think that -- I don't mean to give an advertisement for Leap Frog, but I think it's been very, very helpful. Dean, you . . .

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

As you know, the geometry of the ore bodies at Greens Creek are challenging, particularly when you're trying to model. Using Leap Frog primarily, we've been able to create wireframe models of the ore bodies that incorporate not only the drilling, but all the underground sampling, and really been able to develop, I think, a lot more realistic 3D model. And I think that's contributing as well to mine planning and optimizations, is that historically, Greens Creek's had a lot of mining ore zones outside of the modeling, which of course causes adjustments and time delays. I think we're doing a much better job of recreating that geometry in our models now.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And so, as a result of that, you know where to put the development, and we can be much more efficient with what we're -- how we're designing it. That Larry has.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, just the last thought is that the prior mine plan, we had 15 foot high cuts and they were horizontal cuts. And so, as we designed them, we -- as soon as you got toward the fringes, and it no longer paid. You just cut off the scope. We've now adjusted our centerlines more to the actual geometry of the ore bodies. And it's made for, well, more ore and more efficient development.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Yeah. No, it sounds like it's been a positive result all the way around. That's great. Thanks, guys.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Trevor.

Operator

Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I will now like to turn the call back to Mr. Phil Baker for any further remarks.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

The only thing I'll say is, I know it's a busy day for you guys with lots of calls. So, feel free later in the day to give Mike or I a call. I'd be happy to answering more questions that you might have. Thanks very much. Have a good day.

sum-up of the wedding vibe: A cozy backyard dance party wedding at our favorite neighborhood restaurant.

Planned Budget: $10,000 (CAD)

Actual Budget: $9,500 (CAD)

Number of Guests: 45

Location: Windsor, Ontario, Canada

Where we allocated the most funds:

Our priorities for the wedding were good food, good music, good dancing, and good company, so our budget followed that model. The most funds went to the cost of our dinner, which we knew would be excellent because our venue is our favorite local restaurant. We were able to sit down with Josh, the chef and owner, and chat with him about our dietary restrictions and the atmosphere we wanted for the wedding, and he came up with an amazing meal for us. We also invested in our photography, and we are so glad we did because Sarah was great to work with and we love our photos. A large portion also went on rentals. We used the restaurant itself for the dinner, but our ceremony, cocktail hour, and dance party were all outdoors in the backyard. Given that the wedding was in October, we had no idea what the weather would do, so we made sure to rent a big tent, a dance floor, and a heater just in case. (It poured with rain, so we were grateful for the tent. It was also strangely very warm for October, so we didn’t need the heater. Nevertheless, we were glad to be prepared).

Related Post Is There A Better Way To Do A First Look?

Where we allocated the least funds:

We didn’t put a lot of money into flowers. We didn’t have a wedding party, so we only needed one bouquet and a handful of boutonnières for family. We also didn’t buy arrangements for the tables because Oliver’s mother and one of her friends bought cut flowers and greens from our florist and did a lovely job arranging them for us. We also decorated with seasonal items like pumpkins, which added to the (Canadian) Thanksgiving weekend coziness but without adding a lot of cost. We were lucky enough to be gifted our wine, which Kate’s parents made (and Kate designed the labels), as well as our beer, which was a custom brew by Oliver’s brother Jeremy (who is a German-certified brewmaster) in conjunction with local brewery Chapter II. Our friend Ivy, who is an incredible artist, designer, and illustrator, also generously designed and made our invitations, our friend Keenan, a talented chef, made us a beautiful and delicious cake as a gift, and our friend Dana gifted us her artistic skills on our chalk signs. We were able to do the graphic design for the seating chart, table numbers, and other printed signage ourselves.

What was totally worth it:

The day went by so quickly, and we couldn’t be everywhere at once, so receiving our photos and being able to go through them and experience the day all over again at a more relaxed pace was absolutely wonderful. Sarah, our photographer, has an amazing way of putting people at ease, even those people who don’t usually like being in photos. We were so completely overwhelmed not only at how well the photos turned out, but also by her kindness and the amount of care she puts into her work. We loved working with her so much on our wedding and our engagement photos, and she has become a friend. Our day-of coordinator, Grace, was also incredible. Any time there was a potential problem, she solved it immediately without letting the stress of it even reach us. She is incredibly organized, patient, and great at getting things done right, so she was perfect. She had no problem running around in the rain and getting muddy setting up our venue, which is worth noting! And, of course, she’s a friend too (there’s a pattern here I think!).

What was totally not worth it:

Honestly, not much. The only thing we didn’t end up needing was the heater for the tent because it was unseasonably warm. It was really cold the day before, however, so we were glad to be prepared for whatever weather came our way. We knew we had a small budget throughout the whole process, so we eliminated pretty much all of the expenses that wouldn’t be worth it. For example, we knew we wanted to do a donation to a charity instead of wedding favors. Because our black cat Winn is such a big part of our lives (yes, we took wedding photos with him, and the portrait our friend Ivy drew of him was hanging at the reception), we decided to donate to the Windsor Essex Humane Society (where we adopted him) instead of doing traditional favors.

A few things that helped us along the way:

Taking eighteen months to plan the wedding from engagement to wedding day was a great decision because it allowed us to take our time, book things well in advance, and keep our budget and priorities straight without too much stress (plus, we got the October wedding Kate wanted). Also, working on it together and not letting one person take on too much work made the process a lot easier and more balanced. We were also lucky to have family who we could ask favors and bounce ideas off, including Kate’s brother and sister-in-law who live nearby. It meant we could sit on their porch when we got stressed or stuck on a decision and get some advice without even leaving the neighborhood.

My best practical advice for my planning self:

Remember that you can’t control everything. Kate is a very organized but anxious person, so when the wedding started approaching, it was hard for her to let go of little details. Giving in to the fact that there were inevitably things out of our control was important but difficult. Don’t be afraid to go against tradition if it does not align with your priorities. Also, don’t check the weather. Ever. The forecast changed about thirty-six times before our wedding day, and there was nothing we could do about it, so it was pointless to check and stress about. Yes, it was freezing the day before while we set up the tent. Yes, we were sweating in the heat the day of the wedding. Yes, there was a massive rain storm in the afternoon. We couldn’t control any of it, we were well-prepared (and Rino’s owner Josh saved the day with some hay for the backyard mud), and luckily the sky cleared up just when we needed it to for our photos, ceremony, and dance party.

Favorite thing about the wedding:

How it became, through design or serendipity, this amazing little neighborhood-focused event. We started counting how many of our vendors were based within a short walking distance of our venue (which is also in the neighborhood where we live), and it was most of them: photographer, DJ, both florists, hairdresser, baker… This really added to the cozy feeling of the wedding along with the fact that we are friends with a lot of our vendors. It made the atmosphere very relaxed and familiar. Some of our vendors even commented on how they felt included and how much they enjoyed knowing some of the guests and other vendors at the wedding. We also loved doing a first look and getting to share that moment together before our family photos. The build up of anticipation throughout the morning and afternoon was exciting, and we really enjoyed the experience of surprising one another. Oh, and our dance party was phenomenal.

Something else We’d Like to Share:

We loved that every part of our wedding felt like us. During our planning, it was suggested that we might be focusing on the little details too much, but it was the details that really made the day our own. We chose music that was meaningful to us for our ceremony musicians, we wrote our own secular ceremony to reflect our life together (with a focus on being equal partners and including some serious sappy stuff, but also a couple jokes), we made a dinner playlist with songs that had meaning to us and our guests (including some that we listened to with our families as children), we drew (Oliver) and designed (Kate) table number signs that told the story of different bicycles throughout our relationship (and a pair of roller skates because Kate is a roller-derby skater), and we prioritized the things that meant the most to us without worrying too much about tradition.

We kept it small to share it with our closest family and friends (we both have small families, so that made this easier). We were able to spend time with each and every guest, which was incredibly important to us. And, this was a huge priority for us, we had the most fun dance party I have ever experienced. Our dance floor was packed all night, Jamie, our DJ, was fabulous, and everyone had a really fun time. That’s about all we could ask, so we wouldn’t change a thing. Finally, our wedding hashtag #ourOKwedding got a few laughs. The running joke was that we were turning an OK (Oliver/Kate) romance into a more-than-OK wedding.",Our Cozy $9K Wedding In The Backyard Of Our Favorite Restaurant,Apracticalwedding.com,https://apracticalwedding.com/rinos-kitchen-wedding/
548,Empty,2019-02-21T15:02:14Z,"From its earliest honorees to the present, the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Subject doubles as a kind of history of the ever-changing medium.","Photo: Walt Disney Pictures

This story has been updated to include the recent Oscar winner “Bao.”

Though animation has been around since before the first Academy Awards, it wasn’t until the fifth Oscars ceremony, for films released between 1931–32, that the Academy created the Best Short Subject categories, including one for animation. At that point, every major studio had an animation wing producing cartoons for theaters, and these cartoons dominated the Oscars for almost the first 30 years. When the studios shuttered their animation departments in the early 1960s, independent and international filmmakers began to dominate category, a trend that reached its peak in the ’70s and ’80s. By the beginning of the 1990s, studios like Pixar, Aardman, and Blue Sky helped mainstream animation in the English-speaking world and brought a newfound legitimacy to the art form that had not been seen since the golden age of the ’40s and ’50s.

Hailing from more than 20 countries and encompassing almost every style, the 87 winners of the Best Animated Short Subject Oscar double as a microcosm of the history of world animation. Watching them also reveals that the definition of what constitutes animation has expanded from the colored cells of “Three Little Pigs” to the cutouts-on-acetate collage of “Frank Film.” What follows is an attempt to rank all 87 winners, from a recent dud to some timeless classics that help define the medium.

87. “Dear Basketball” (2017)

Every Oscar category has its Crash — the winner that makes you go, “What the hell were they thinking?” “Dear Basketball” is essentially a sappy, four-minute Nike commercial that had no business being nominated. Making matters worse, it gave accused sexual assaulter Kobe Bryant an Oscar at the first post-#MeToo ceremony. Although most nominees and winners are invited to join the Academy each year, Bryant was denied an invite due to his lack of a footprint in the industry, although the assault may have had something to do with it too.

86: “Logorama” (2009)

“Logorama” makes every building, person, and prop out of corporate logos. It’s cool to look at, but it makes its point after the first two minutes. The rest of it is an overblown action sequence with horrible dialogue and voice-over work.

85. “Sundae in New York” (1983)

In his 1983 essay “1,112 and Counting,” gay activist Larry Kramer accused then-New York mayor Ed Koch of allowing gay men to die of a disease that had recently been dubbed Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, writing that he had “not allow[ed] himself to be perceived by the non-gay world as visibly helping us.” (That Koch was less-than-forthcoming about his own sexuality adds another layer to the story.) That same year, Jimmy Picker made this astoundingly tone-deaf Claymation short wherein Koch (voiced by an impressionist) improvises his own version of Kander & Ebb’s hit song “New York, New York.” By the time he won his Oscar, at least 200 more gay men had died from AIDS-related illnesses.

84. “Knighty Knight Bugs” (1958)

The only Bugs Bunny cartoon to get an Oscar, “Knighty Knight Bugs” is the animated equivalent of Al Pacino winning for Scent of a Woman instead of Dog Day Afternoon. Its mediocrity is especially egregious given that most of Bugs’s greatest films — including “What’s Opera Doc?,” regarded by some as the greatest cartoon of all time — weren’t even nominated.

83. “The Little Orphan” (1948)

In this Tom and Jerry short, Jerry adopts a starving orphan named Nibbles and treats him to a Thanksgiving feast, while he and Tom enact Pilgrim-Indian fights. The only thing worse than this cartoon’s racial and historical insensitivity is that it’s not funny.

82. “Frank Film” (1973)

This autobiographical film presents an unfolding collage of magazine cutouts glued onto acetate cells, while animator Frank Mouris tells his life story over dueling audio channels. Although considered an animation landmark, it’s a headache-inducing experience that’s too overwhelming to watch more than once.

81. “A Greek Tragedy” (1986)

This cartoon about three maidens holding up a building is a situation stretched out to six minutes. That same year, Pixar got its first nomination for “Luxo Jr.,” which, at only three minutes, tells a satisfying story about two lamps with distinct personalities.

80. “The Two Mouseketeers” (1951)

Tom, Jerry, and Nibbles engage in swordplay in 18th-century France. This short features some good music, but it’s one of the weaker cartoons in the series.

79. “Milky Way” (1940)

Disney’s eight-year winning streak broke this year when none of their cartoons received a nomination. The winner, “Milky Way,” is an MGM cartoon about three kittens produced by Rudolf Ising and Hugh Harman, animators who bounced around from studio to studio during the golden age of animation. Many of their cartoons, like this one, are as vapid and cutesy as “The Happy Little Elves” cartoons from The Simpsons. But they deserve a place in history for creating the MGM and Warners animation studios, which released the other two shorts nominated in 1940: “Puss Gets the Boot,” the debut film of Tom and Jerry, and “A Wild Hare,” which introduced the world to a rabbit who casually asked a hunter, “What’s up, doc?”

78. “The Fly” (1980)

This short offers an insubstantial jaunt from a fly’s point of view as it flies around a house.

77. “Surogat” (a.k.a. “Ersatz,” a.k.a. “The Substitute”) (1961)

The first completely foreign-made cartoon to win, this is a Yugoslavian short in which every prop, background, and person is inflatable. There are some cool moments when the protagonist manipulates the animation and changes the scenery, but on the whole, it’s just weird for weirdness’s sake.

76. “Three Orphan Kittens” (1935)

This Silly Symphony features cute Disney kittens getting in trouble. Nothing makes it stand out from similar Disney cartoons, nor does anything act as testing ground for new camera techniques or styles, which the later Silly Symphonies became during the ’30s. And it gets docked points for the racial stereotypes.

75. “The Pink Phink” (1964)

This marked the cartoon debut of the Pink Panther, the animated character who first appeared in the main titles of Blake Edwards’s 1963 film of the same name. Like the Panther’s other cartoons, this one suffers from repeating one joke over and over — the Panther paints everything pink while his foil wants to paint everything blue. That said, it’s always worth it to hear Henry Mancini’s theme music.

74. “Lend a Paw” (1941)

Mickey Mouse’s only appearance on this list, “Lend a Paw” mostly focuses on Pluto, who debates between his inner angel and devil whether to save a small kitten. The film, with its message to help friends in need, heavily foreshadows a conflict to come: Two months after its release, the United States entered the Second World War and Disney converted his studio into a propaganda factory.

73. “Is It Always Right to Be Right?” (1970)

Orson Welles narrates a parable about a world divided because everybody feels the need to be right. The animation and the music are bad, but the story is a good reminder of how we can better ourselves with a little humility.

72. “Magoo’s Puddle Jumper” (1956)

UPA’s Stephen Bosustow produced all three of 1956’s nominees, guaranteeing him an Oscar that night. Here, Mr. Magoo gets a car that defies the laws of gravity and can drive underwater. It’s typical Magoo fare, combining jokes about nearsightedness with the beauty of UPA’s animation.

71. “Leisure” (1976)

A recounting of man’s pursuit of leisure from caveman days to the present, “Leisure” features a cool mixed-media approach but it’s not very engaging.

70. “Great” (1975)

If you were confused when Kenneth Branagh came out at the 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony looking like Abraham Lincoln, “Great” offers a musical biography about who he was actually playing: Isambard K. Brunel, the English equivalent of Thomas Edison. The songs are catchy, but it’s basically a Schoolhouse Rock video stretched to half an hour.

69. “The Tortoise and the Hare” (1934)

Max Hare, the star of this fairly standard retelling of the Aesop’s fable, has been cited by many as an inspiration for Bugs Bunny, who would turn this story on its head in “Tortoise Beats Hare.”

68. “The Country Cousin” (1936)

Another retelling of a fable, this time with the creatures who made the studio famous. It’s always weird watching Disney mice who look nothing like Mickey, so the animation takes some getting used to. The best part is the music, which alternates between country banjo and a Gershwin-like motif, to reflect the two characters.

67. “When Magoo Flew” (1954)

In 1949, UPA released a cartoon called “Ragtime Bear” which worried their distributor, Columbia Pictures, because bears were not popular characters. The film was a hit, not because of the bear, but because it was the debut of Mr. Magoo, a nearsighted old man who became UPA’s first breakout character. Magoo was one of the first human characters to have his own cartoon series, and it became a signature role for actor Jim Backus (who would later play millionaire Thurston Howell III on Gilligan’s Island). In this entry, Magoo mistakes an airplane for a movie theater and walks on top of it mid-flight. The jokes grow a little stale, but any UPA cartoon is worth watching for the animation, and the shots of Magoo’s silhouette walking on the plane are gorgeous.

66. “Winnie-the-Pooh and the Blustery Day” (1968)

The last of Walt Disney’s astonishing 26 Academy Awards came posthumously for the second of the studio’s three Winnie-the-Pooh cartoons. One of the final projects he green-lit, Disney chose to release these shorts one at a time to introduce the characters to American audiences — hard to believe, given how famous they have become. That said, the short reveals how the animation division was starting to go adrift without Walt’s presence, including recycling some old ideas. The Heffalumps and Woozles sequence is the best example of this, since it tries to copy the demented fantasia of Dumbo’s “Pink Elephants on Parade” number but fails to equal it. The best element of the cartoon is the voice acting, a reminder that several of the actors voiced these characters for more than 30 years.

65. “Yankee Doodle Mouse” (1943)

Tom and Jerry go at it, WWII style. Sticks of dynamite are tossed back and forth, Jerry uses a brassiere as a parachute, and the score offers an enjoyable mix of patriotic anthems.

64. “Father and Daughter” (2000)

Of the three nominees for 2000, “Father and Daughter” got all the accolades, and it’s easy to see why: It tugs at the heartstrings with a simple story of a little girl who spends her life waiting for her father to return after he abandons her. The second nominee was similarly bleak, an adaptation of Daniel Defoe’s Journal of the Plague Year called “The Periwig Maker.” The third nominee, however, was Don Hertzfeldt’s “Rejected,” which went on to spawn countless internet memes and ridiculous catchphrases like “I am the queen of France!” As film fans know, the Oscars don’t necessarily predict which films will last.

63. “Manipulation” (1991)

The gags are funny and the special effects impressive in this short in which a cartoon man struggles to escape the sketchpad his animator has confined him to. Unfortunately, it can’t help but pale in comparison to the classic Looney Tunes cartoon “Duck Amuck,” which is The Godfather of fourth-wall-breaking, drawing-versus-animator cartoons.

62. “Flowers and Trees” (1931–32)

The first cartoon ever to win depicts a love triangle between two slender trees and an evil stump who starts a forest fire out of revenge. It features the usual dancing reeds, birds, and trees that appear in Disney’s early Silly Symphonies, and the animation is coarse compared to later Disney efforts. What makes “Flowers and Trees” a landmark, however, is that it is the first cartoon — and technically, the first film — ever produced in three-color Technicolor, the process that would later be used for Gone With the Wind, The Wizard of Oz, and many other films. As always, Disney knew what the audiences wanted before they did.

61. “Piper” (2016)

Pixar has just about owned the Best Animated Feature category since it was first introduced in 2001, but for the next 15 years they went home empty-handed for their shorts. “Piper,” about a cute young sandpiper overcoming her fear of the water, broke that losing streak, but it’s not one of their best. Still, it’s worth watching for the beautiful animation of the birds.

60. “A Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature” (1966)

John Hubley’s Storyboard Studios won its third and final Oscar for this charming animated music video of two Herb Alpert songs: “Spanish Flea” and “Tijuana Taxi.” (More on Hubley and Storyboard below.)

59. “Ferdinand the Bull” (1938)

Nearly 70 years before Blue Sky’s feature about this good-natured bull, Disney made its own version. Although popular at the time of its release, it’s faded from the canon, probably because it never had follow-ups. The voice acting comes from Milt Kahl (one of Disney’s Nine Old Men) as Young Ferdinand, Jack Benny announcer Don Wilson serves the narrator, and Walt Disney himself plays Ferdinand’s Mother.

58. “Tin Toy” (1988)

When Steve Jobs acquired Pixar for their computers in 1986, he didn’t expect to make any money off its small animation division, and engineers wondered why the animators were even on the payroll at all given the company’s lack of revenue. In 1988, knowing they were on thin ice, John Lasseter and his team asked Jobs for $300,000 to make “Tin Toy,” a cartoon about a toy one-man-band named Tinny escaping the clutches of a toddler. Jobs agreed, and the film wowed audiences when it premiered, even though the animation hadn’t been completed. The next year, “Tin Toy” became the first computer-animated short to win the Oscar. The only reason this cartoon is not higher on the list is the animation — that baby is ugly, and in one shot where it falls over, it barely even touches the floor — but these problems are mostly due to the limitations of the technology. “Tin Toy” served its purpose, legitimizing computer animation as an art form, and convincing Jobs to keep funding the animation unit. In 1991, Lasseter wrote a treatment for a feature film about Tinny and a cowboy doll finding their way home. The title was Toy Story.

57. “The Crunch Bird” (1971)

56. “For the Birds” (2001)

At two minutes, “The Crunch Bird” is the shortest cartoon to win the Oscar, and “For the Birds” isn’t much longer. They’re both one-joke cartoons about birds, but they’re very funny jokes and they don’t overstay their welcome.

55. “Speedy Gonzales” (1955)

The official debut of everyone’s favorite Latino mouse, Speedy Gonzales brings cheese to the poor Mexican mice while getting the better of cheese factory guard Sylvester every time. In one absurd gag, he runs through Sylvester’s open mouth and exits through the back of his tail, the kind of gag that Warners directors like Tex Avery and Bob Clampett pioneered. While Speedy may strike some as a stereotype today, he has always been popular among Latinos, and a feature film where he will be voiced by comedian Eugenio Derbez is in development.

54. “It’s Tough to Be a Bird” (1969)

Ward Kimball became the only one of Disney’s Nine Old Men (his nickname for his nine favorite animators) to win an Oscar with this 20-minute history of birds, narrated by a bird drawn to resemble the great animator himself. Kimball, who drew most of the characters in Alice in Wonderland, was a master of zaniness, and he pulls out all the stops here. The film’s combination of animation and live action makes it the first mixed-media short to win, and it climaxes with a chaotic montage reminiscent of Terry Gilliam’s work on Monty Python — which, by sheer coincidence, premiered two months before “It’s Tough to Be a Bird” was released.

53. “The Box” (1967)

In a sweet cartoon about an old man with a mysterious box, the sparse setting, heavily percussive score, and final reveal add to the impact.

52. “Feast” (2014)

In a heartwarming story that becomes too sentimental in the final 30 seconds, a cute dog who loves eating unhealthy food reunites his owner with his girlfriend after she dumps him over his bad diet. But the dog is really cute.

51. “Mouse Trouble” (1944)

Tom gets a book of ways to trap mice and fails at all of them in a short that’s pretty much just a series of mishaps. But it also includes one of the best jokes in any Tom and Jerry cartoon, when a beaten-up Tom turns to the camera and says in a basso profundo voice, “Don’t you believe it!”

50. “Quiet, Please!” (1945)

“Quiet, Please!” does a great job at stacking the deck against Tom, who has to prevent Jerry from waking up Spike the dog. The best joke involves him catching lightbulbs Jerry tosses down before they can shatter on the floor, a joke that pays homage to W.C. Fields’s It’s a Gift, although the punch line is much more violent: Jerry plugs Tom’s tail into a socket and he lights up like a Christmas tree.

49. “La Maison en Petits Cubes” (“The House of Small Cubes”) (2008)

Japanese animation had never been recognized in this category until “La Maison en Petits Cubes,” the story of a fisherman in a flooded home who looks back on his life. The film takes on Proustian dimensions by using a smoking pipe as the catalyst for the old man’s memories, which come to life in beautiful drawings by animator Kunio Katō. When he got his Oscar, he brought down the house by ending his speech with “Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto!”

48. “Tango” (1982)

Except for the producers of La La Land, no one ever had a worse Oscar night than Zbigniew Rybczyński, the Polish director of “Tango” who spoke limited English. After silencing the orchestra who tried to play him and his translator off, he went outside to smoke a cigarette, Oscar still in hand, and left his ticket in the theater. When the security guard refused to let him back inside, he screamed, “American pig, I have Oscar!” and supposedly hit him, landing him in jail for the night. The film itself is a cool experiment where live-action characters repeat actions and movements in an impossibly large room, and more are added until it becomes like the stateroom in the Marx Brothers’ A Night at the Opera. You’ll want to watch it more than once to see how the characters overlap with each other.

47. “Mr. Hublot” (2013)

French steampunk artist Stephane Halleux provided the inspiration for “Mr. Hublot,” which brings his futuristic universe to life. The story is little more than your standard “man and dog friendship” tale, but the dog being a robot gives it a clever spin and the animation of the Blade Runner–like city looks spectacular.

46. “The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore” (2011)

Animator and children’s book author Bill Joyce co-directed this short about a man transported via tornado to a magical library with flying books. The animation reflects Joyce’s whimsical style, and there are some funny gags with the books, particularly when Lessmore has to perform surgery on one of them.

45. “The Lost Thing” (2010)

Narrated by songwriter Tim Minchin, “The Lost Thing” depicts a friendship between an awkward boy and a mysterious tentacled thing that looks like it wandered out of “Mr. Hublot.” It’s a touching story with a solid punch at the end, and the scene in the Department of Odds and Ends doubles as a nice homage to Terry Gilliam’s Brazil.

44. “A Close Shave” (1995)

Is there a single more expressive character in all of animation than Gromit, Wallace’s dog companion? With no mouth, he has to convey everything through his brow and his eyes, combining Chaplin’s warmth with Keaton’s deadpan. Here, he and Wallace uncover a plot to kidnap sheep and make them into pet food. As always, Gromit plays detective and action hero while the bumbling Wallace is just lucky to be along for the ride. The film also introduced audiences to Shaun the Sheep, who later got his own TV show and film series. The only trouble is that the half-hour running time works against the film, due largely to the overstuffed final action sequence where director Nick Park tries to top his efforts from the preceding Wallace and Gromit film. (More about that one later.)

43. “Johann Mouse” (1952)

In 1940, MGM animators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera teamed up a cat named Jasper and a mouse called Jinx in “Puss Gets the Boot,” but it didn’t leave much of a mark. A year later, they produced a follow-up film that redesigned the characters and renamed them Tom and Jerry. They became MGM’s breakout stars, and Hanna and Barbera would go on to make more than 100 cartoons with them, netting MGM 13 Oscar nominations and seven wins. The last was for “Johann Mouse,” wherein Tom and Jerry become a musical sensation in 1890s Vienna. There are some funny jokes involving Tom’s piano playing, and the music, performed by the MGM orchestra, is a reminder of how the old studios spared no expense on their cartoons. After MGM shuttered its animation unit in 1957, Hanna and Barbera set up their own company and went on to create The Flintstones, The Jetsons, Scooby-Doo, and dozens of other memorable TV cartoons. As with Disney, it all started with a mouse (and a cat).

42. “The Danish Poet” (2006)

Liv Ullmann narrates a touching story about how coincidence and chance shape one’s destiny, with a nice twist ending. She also plays all the characters, and her lilting tones help make this cartoon a lovely experience.

41. “Special Delivery” (1978)

A man’s refusal to clean the snow off his front porch leads to to the death of his mailman — and hilarity ensues. “Special Delivery” has just one purpose: to entertain, and it does so admirably.

40. “Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom” (1953)

Co-directed by “It’s Tough to Be a Bird” director Ward Kimball, “Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom” tells the history of music from cavemen to the present day. This entertaining cartoon was the first produced in Cinemascope, and its flat, stylized animation — which recalls UPA — is a radical departure from previous Disney films. Although the studio produced some inventive and entertaining short cartoons during the 1950s, by the end of that decade it had more or less given up on them, as the company moved into the black by diversifying into TV, live-action films, and theme parks.

39. “Quest” (1996)

This German student film depicts puppets traveling through various lands of sand, stone, and machinery to find the source of a mysterious dripping noise. The animation is extremely cool, especially in the backgrounds. The only trouble is the ending, which seems profound at first but feels a little too “student film” on second viewing.

38. “Closed Mondays” (1974)

Director Bob Gardner, the inventor of Claymation, spent 14 months with his filmmaking partner Will Vinton making this stop-motion film about a drunk who wanders into a museum after hours and finds the artwork coming to life: an abstract painting turns into a series of swirling musical notes; a slot machine with lips speaks abstract poetry; and a traditional painting of a scullery maid talks back to him. Unlike “The Critic” (to be discussed below), which scoffs at art, “Closed Mondays” speaks to its power to involve us through the emotions it conjures.

37. “Bao” (2018)

Domee Shi, a Chinese-Canadian immigrant, became the first woman to direct a Pixar short with “Bao.” She shared her Oscar with producer Becky Neiman-Cobb, making this the first animated short for which a female directing and producing team shared a prize. Shi based this heartwarming story of a mother who raises a dumpling from birth to adulthood on her own relationship with her overprotective mother. The use of food as a metaphor for parenting is specific to Chinese culture: Shi has said in interviews that Chinese parents substitute “Have you eaten yet?” for “I love you.” This specificity allows “Bao” to express universal truths about parents and children. Shortly before it premiered last summer, Pixar founder John Lasseter announced he would leave the company after he was outed for sexually harassing women and fostering a “boys club” mentality that kept female employees from rising through the ranks. Hopefully, “Bao” is a sign of things changing for the better, not just at Pixar, but throughout Hollywood itself.

36. “Paperman” (2012)

After dominating this category in its early years, Disney won its first Animated Short Oscar since “It’s Tough to Be a Bird” for “Paperman,” which is also the first (and so far only) black-and-white cartoon ever to win. The main character is an anonymous office clerk inspired by one spot of color — a woman’s red lipstick kiss on a piece of paper — to go after her, with papers piling up around him. The style and the lack of dialogue serve the story beautifully.

35. “Charade” (1984)

Have you ever played charades with your friends and gone nuts when they can’t guess what you’re miming? Charade takes this premise to a hilarious extreme, as the main character makes it obvious he’s miming titles like Jaws and Superman, but his friends’ guesses completely miss the mark. At the same time, one player becomes the first person in history to successfully mime The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Rotations, which the others get right away.

34. “Balance” (1989)

Like the best stop-motion films, “Balance” leaves viewers breathless, wondering how the animators did it. Set atop a floating platform in space, it depicts five identical men fishing for a rare device and causing the platform to tilt back and forth whenever they walk. It also inspired the finale of National Treasure: Book of Secrets.

33. “The Dot and the Line” (1965)

Chuck Jones won his only competitive Oscar for this adaptation of a book by Norton Juster about a male Line who seeks the love of a female Dot. The animation is unlike any of Jones’s Warners cartoons, echoing the work of abstract pioneer Oskar Fischinger, and the scenes where the Line morphs from two to three dimensions are beautifully done — all while Robert Morley provides humorous math puns in his dry voice.

32. “Crac!” (1981)

One of the greatest things about animation is the way it can imbue inanimate objects with emotions. In “Crac!” the protagonist is a rocking chair who begins his life when a French-Canadian farmer builds it from the wood of a tree. Over its life, it observes the farmer, his wife, and their family for generations. Like the opening montage of Up, the film collapses a century into a little less than 15 minutes, coming together harmoniously in the final moments, when the chair reflects on all it has seen in its final home, an art museum.

31. “The ChubbChubbs!” (2002)

Sony Animation won its first and (so far) only Oscar for this computer-animated sci-fi film about an alien janitor with dreams of being a karaoke singer who must face off with the menacing ChubbChubbs. The film is filled with inside jokes for sci-fi nerds, including cameos from Yoda, E.T., and Jar-Jar Binks — who dies in the opening two minutes. The twist at the end is great too.

30. “Moonbird” (1959)

UPA’s John Hubley was forced to go into TV commercials after he was blacklisted and thrown out of the company, but he found success producing the ad campaign for Maypo Oatmeal, which starred an animated child played by Hubley’s son Mark. Using the money from these ads, he and his wife Faith Hubley made “Moonbird,” a film based on a tape recording of Mark and his brother Ray playing together. Watching all these Oscar winners chronologically, “Moonbird” is a radical departure in style from any of the ones before it, going beyond the flatness of UPA to create characters based entirely on crudely drawn outlines. Its limitation is the fact that the two boys’ improvisation can’t help but lag at times, but it was a huge step forward for Hubley. A 1968 follow-up called “Windy Day” uses an improvisation by his two daughters, and is even better.

29: “A Christmas Carol” (1972)

This made-for-TV film of Charles Dickens’s most famous story was such a hit when it aired in 1971 that it received theatrical distribution the following year, allowing it to qualify for the Oscar (the rules were then changed to prevent this from happening again). It’s a quite effective adaptation, aided by Alistair Sim and Michael Hordern reprising their roles as Scrooge and Marley from the famous 1951 movie. Marley in particular is a standout — whenever he speaks, he just opens his mouth wide and unleashes the words with no lip movements. Bonus points for including the shriveled children representing Ignorance and Want, a powerful scene from the book cut from most adaptations. It’s only weakness is that at 25 minutes, it feels rushed, particularly when Scrooge changes his ways at the end.

28. “The Old Mill” (1937)

As production moved ahead on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Disney used his shorts to experiment with the technology he knew would make his first feature-length film stand out. The most famous of these is “The Old Mill,” the first animated cartoon to use the multiplane camera. This device placed a camera atop multiple planes of glass to provide a depth of field never before seen in animation. Just as he had embraced Technicolor before live-action filmmakers, Disney embraced deep-focus cinematography four years before Citizen Kane, making this short about animals weathering a bad storm look like it was shot by Kane cinematographer Gregg Toland, and the storm itself is one of the most suspenseful scenes in any cartoon.

27. “Tweetie Pie” (1947)

Director Friz Freleng threatened to quit Warner Bros. when producer Edward Selzer opposed his pairing of a bird named Tweety and a cat named Thomas (later renamed Sylvester), but “Tweetie Pie” would net Selzer and the Looney Tunes their first Oscar. The film showcases Freleng at his absolute best, with his virtuosic matching of action to music and absurdist gags. What made him a genius, however, was how he imbued his characters with moments of humanity amid the chaos, as when Sylvester throws his hammer on the ground after finishing a contraption. When asked why he included it, he just said, “Because it’s human.” Upon Selzer’s death, his Oscar was given to Freleng.

26. “Bob’s Birthday” (1994)

“Bob’s Birthday” introduced audiences to Bob and Margaret, the middle-aged British couple who got their own TV series in the late 1990s, and it’s the raunchiest cartoon to ever win. Bob, terrified of turning 40, comes home and rants about his fears to Margaret without realizing she’s planned a surprise party for him — and worse, that all the guests are listening from their hiding spots as he insults them and walks around with no pants on. The awkwardness of the situation and Bob’s callousness make this cartoon hard to watch, but there’s genuine tenderness between him and Margaret, and the conclusion, when she realizes it’s better just to be there for him, is touching.

25. “Bear Story” (2015)

Chilean director Gabriel Osorio made a haunting allegory of the Pinochet regime with this cartoon about a bear whose toy music box tells how he was kidnapped from his family and sold into the circus. The designs on the mechanical music box, and how they contrast with the bear’s world, are gorgeously rendered, and the story is a moving tale about the relationship between storytelling and trauma.

24. “Der Fuehrer’s Face” (1942)

Originally titled “Donald Duck in Nazi Land,” the most famous of Disney’s World War II cartoons depicts Donald Duck living under Hitler’s tyranny. His home, and most of the props, are shaped like swastikas, and he’s forced to work in a munitions factory where every time a photograph of the Fuehrer comes down the conveyor belt, he has to scream “Heil Hitler!” in his distinctive squawk. One of the rare Disney films that includes laugh-out-loud gags, it’s as entertaining today as it was 77 years ago, and features one of the most absurdist moments in Disney animation, when the shells come to life. The title song became a hit for Spike Jones and his band. (It loses points for insensitive drawings of the Japanese, however.)

23. “Birds Anonymous” (1957)

If there is a patron saint of cartoon voice-over it’s Mel Blanc, who, until his death in 1989, voiced almost all of the Looney Tunes characters. Here he plays Tweety, Sylvester, and a cat named Clarence who takes Sylvester to Birds Anonymous, AA for cats. His voices for Sylvester and Tweety are iconic, but it’s as Clarence that he really excels here, using a flat voice to give him the appearance of control even though he reverts to his old ways at the end. Blanc said this was his favorite cartoon, and, as with Freleng, after producer Edward Selzer’s death, Selzer’s Oscar was passed on to Blanc.

22. “Peter and the Wolf” (2007)

Literalizing Prokofiev’s famous piece, which is meant to live in the imagination of its listeners, is a tricky undertaking, but director Suzie Templeton’s approach in this half-hour film produces excellent results. Her adaptation makes several smart changes to the story by setting it in contemporary times, making the hunters into bullies who torment Peter, and establishing a dynamic between the title characters that leads to a satisfying and touching conclusion. The stop-motion animation seems to have influenced Wes Anderson’s Fantastic Mr. Fox and Isle of Dogs.

21. “For Scent-imental Reasons” (1949)

Edward Selzer, who once unironically barked to his animators, “I don’t see what laughter has to do with the making of animated cartoons!” told Chuck Jones that nobody would laugh at his amorous French skunk, Pepé Le Pew, but once again he was wrong. As in all his films, Pepé longs for Penelope Pussycat, whom he thinks is a skunk, but she wants nothing to do with him. This time, however, Penelope goes after him at the end, freaking him out. Bonus points for writer Michael Maltese’s hilarious faux-French dialogue.

20. “Munro” (1960)

“Munro” originated with a short story by Jules Feiffer, who turned 90 last month and has spent his career drawing cartoons, illustrating children’s books, and writing for stage and screen. The title character is a bratty 4-year-old boy who gets drafted into the army as punishment, but none of his superiors believe it because they’re convinced anyone who enlists must be motivated by the army’s “cause.” The savagery of the satire and the humor of the animation, modeled after Feiffer’s drawings, make this cartoon as funny as a Mark Twain story. Interestingly, this very American short was the first Oscar winner made outside the United States — the animation came from Gene Deitch’s studio in Prague, where he moved to receive financing and has lived for the past 60 years.

19. “Geri’s Game” (1997)

Most people were introduced to “Geri’s Game” when it played before A Bug’s Life in 1998, inaugurating Pixar’s tradition of showing one of their shorts before their features. It’s one of the studio’s funniest films, taking a simple concept — an old man playing chess with himself — and executing it perfectly. The best part is that the old man develops two distinct personae throughout the game — one needy and conniving, one cold and calculating — and their interactions make you think you’re watching two people instead of one. Geri cameos in Toy Story 2 as the repairman who sews Woody’s arm back on.

18. “Anna and Bella” (1985)

17. “Bunny” (1998)

“Anna and Bella” is a hand-drawn Danish short where two sisters look back on their lives and make peace over the heartbreaking way their friendship ended; “Bunny” is a battle between an elderly rabbit and a moth who won’t leave him alone. They’re tied here because they’re structurally quite similar: They begin as one thing and go someplace you don’t expect, leading to two of the most moving endings on this list. Tom Waits provides the soundtrack for “Bunny” and sings over the end credits.

16. “Every Child” (1979)

Producer Derek Lamb made “Every Child” in conjunction with UNICEF’s International Year of the Child campaign. The story of a baby passed from home to home could have been maudlin in the wrong hands, but Lamb brings humor to it to by having every voice, sound effect, and musical note performed by a male duo called Les Mimes Electriques. The short begins and ends with them in the recording studio, an image that acquires additional resonance when the child is finally adopted at the end by two old men.

15. “Harvie Krumpet” (2003)

Adam Elliot’s sympathy for the differently abled has always come through in his short films and his cult feature film Mary and Max. Like those, “Harvie Krumpet” combines a wry sense of humor with heartfelt drama to tell of a Polish émigré to Australia who never loses his optimism, despite the many setbacks that come his way. Funny without being ironic, and moving without being sentimental, Elliot never condescends to his characters or their situations. It’s the work of a true humanist.

14. “The Sand Castle” (1977)

Thin in story but rich in atmosphere, Co Hoedeman’s “The Sand Castle” depicts humanoid, serpentine creatures who rise from the sand, build a fortress, and watch it crumble as the winds sweep it away. The film is a haunting tribute to the impermanence of art, best summarized by Calvin and Hobbes creator Bill Watterson, who once drew a Michelangelo-inspired painting on the ceiling of his dorm knowing it would be erased by whoever lived there next year. “My fondest memories,” he said, “are [of] times like these, where things were done out of some inexplicable inner imperative, rather than because the work was demanded.”

13. “The Moon and the Son: An Imagined Conversation” (2005)

John Canemaker, an NYU professor and historian who has written authoritative books on animation, is the son of an Italian who spent five years in jail for (allegedly) burning down his hotel to collect the insurance money when John was a child. Ten years after his father’s death, he produced this “imagined conversation” between them with John Turturro as himself and Eli Wallach as the old man. Told through a collage of animation, live-action clips, and photographs, it tells a universal story about the necessary distance children must keep from their parents, and a father who, to paraphrase Philip Larkin, was “fucked up in [his] turn / By fools in old-style hats and coats.” It could have easily been a feature, especially with the stellar performances of Turturro and Wallach, but it’s a remarkable achievement at half an hour.

12. “Three Little Pigs” (1932–33)

Where to begin with the impact of the most popular cartoon short ever made? The fact that it was held over in theaters for months by popular demand? The legions of merchandise it spawned? The catchy hit song that inspired the title of one of the most famous American plays? Leave it to Chuck Jones, who said it was “the first time that anybody ever brought characters to life … who looked alike and acted differently.” This makes the short stand out from the standard Silly Symphonies because Fifer and Fiddler Pig are a fun-loving unit offset by their smart brother, Practical Pig. Separately, they get into trouble, but when they team up to outsmart the Big Bad Wolf, who dons a variety of unconvincing disguises to trap them (including a stereotypical Jewish peddler), they’re unstoppable. Bonus points for the morbid family photos in Practical Pig’s home of Uncle Earl (a football) and Father (sausage links.)

11. “Creature Comforts” (1990)

The short that launched a multiyear U.K. advertising campaign, Nick Park’s “Creature Comforts” takes street interviews with real English homeowners describing their living conditions, and puts them in the mouths of stop-motion animals. The juxtaposition of the human voices with the animals is hysterical, like the lion who speaks with a Brazilian accent about wanting more heat. Park’s ability to use eyes to convey emotions is unparalleled in stop-motion animation (see also, Gromit) and the deadpan, sullen looks he gives the animals only adds to the comedy.

10. “The Critic” (1963)

In 1962, Mel Brooks attended a screening of an abstract cartoon by animator Norman McLaren, where he heard an audience member mumbling sarcastic comments to himself. He then hired animator Ernest Pintoff to draw three minutes of abstract imagery, to which he recorded an improvised commentary as a 71-year-old audience member. As the images fly by, Brooks (then only 36) yells out things like, “It must be some kind of symbolism — I think it’s symbolic of junk!” and “Two dollars out the window, Murray!” At three minutes, it doesn’t overstay its welcome, but it’s also hard not to want more. Fortunately, we have more, in the landmark sketches, comedy routines, movies and musicals that Brooks has created throughout his 60-plus-year career in show business.

9. “Mona Lisa Descending a Staircase” (1992)

Joan Gratz’s film depicts the history of 20th-century art in seven minutes as famous paintings break apart and transform into each other, as when a Picasso of a nude girl in bed becomes Munch’s The Scream. By placing these and other works next to each other, Gratz reminds us how all artists influence one another, even when their work seems to have nothing in common. Even more astonishing is that the animation was achieved entirely through oil-based clay, which she spread on a vertical easel. The effects of her thumbprints molding the clay from frame to frame gives the paintings a living quality, similar to how King Kong’s fur appears to move in the 1933 film. It took Gratz eight years of planning and two and a half of filming, and you can see the effort.

8. “The Ugly Duckling” (1939)

In Danny Boyle’s Steve Jobs, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak asks Jobs, who can’t design or code, what it is he actually does. Jobs replies, “Musicians play the instruments — I play the orchestra.” The same could be said of Walt Disney. He wasn’t a great animator; he didn’t “invent” sound or color cartoons; and he wasn’t the first person to make an animated feature film. But he understood how to use technology to its full extent; he was an expert judge of talent; and he had an impeccable knowledge of dramatic storytelling. “The Ugly Duckling,” the final Silly Symphony cartoon, is a remake of a 1931 cartoon that sticks closer to the Hans Christian Andersen story. Unlike that one, which was played mostly for laughs, this adaptation features one of the saddest scenes in the Disney canon, when the rejected duckling takes solace by playing with the one creature who will not judge him — a duck decoy. Disney once said, “The primary purpose of any of the fine arts is to arouse a purely emotional reaction in the viewer.” That may not be true of all art, but it’s certainly true for much of his.

7. “The Hole” (1962)

John Hubley was never shy about his liberal politics, and fused them with animation in this powerful 1962 film where two construction workers, voiced by character actor George Matthews and jazz artist Dizzy Gillespie, debate whether accidents are caused by human failings or karmic coincidence. Released the same year as the Cuban Missile Crisis, the short foreshadows films like Fail-Safe and Dr. Strangelove, and given the context of the civil-rights movement, also resonates as a conversation between a complacent white man and a person of color who can hear dog whistles. Considering that all of it was improvised, it’s remarkable that Matthews and Gillespie’s dialogue becomes as profound as that of the two tramps in Waiting for Godot. It’s an eternally relevant parable about the dangers of not listening closely to the warning signs around us.

6. “The Old Man and the Sea” (1999)

Despite Russia’s history of animation, no Russian animator ever won an Oscar until Aleksandr Petrov made this 20-minute adaptation of Ernest Hemingway’s novel, producing what is possibly the finest screen adaptation of any of his books. He and his son spent two and a half years hand-painting 29,000 oil pastel frames on glass, shooting each of them with a special IMAX camera, and moving the paints with their hands in between shots. This style, reminiscent of the early-20th-century paintings of George Bellows, captures Hemingway’s masculine prose, particularly in the scene depicting the old man’s 24-hour arm-wrestling standoff where it looks like you can see the muscles tensing. It also captures his romanticism: The old man’s dreams of Africa are beautifully drawn, and Petrov departs from the novel by adding dream sequences where the protagonist swims and flies alongside his beloved fish. Denis L. Chartrand and Normand Roger provide the beautiful score.

5. “Ryan” (2004)

“We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are,” said Anaïs Nin. This quote cuts to the heart of “Ryan,” Chris Landreth’s documentary about Canadian animator Ryan Larkin, whose two short films, “Walking” and “Street Musique,” made him a rising star in ’70s animation. By the time they met in the early 2000s, Larkin had been living on the streets of Ottawa for more than 20 years, a victim of alcohol and drug addiction. Landreth worked for two and a half years on the film, recording interviews with Larkin and then working with a team of animators to depict the characters as oblong beings with holes in their bodies and faces that represent their psychological torment. When those wounds are touched on, spikes and colored lines emerge from their faces. What’s more, none of the people were drawn through motion-capture, an astonishing achievement given how realistic their movements are. Landreth’s film rescued Larkin from obscurity: Upon his death in 2007, he was working on his first animated film in more than 30 years, “Spare Change,” which was completed the following year by his collaborator Laurie Gordon.

4. “Gerald McBoing-Boing” (1950)

After leaving the Disney studios during the infamous 1941 strike, John Hubley, Steve Bosustow, and a group of young animators created United Productions of America, known as UPA. Although the studio produced work throughout much of the 1940s, they didn’t achieve mainstream recognition until they adapted the Dr. Seuss record “Gerald McBoing-Boing,” the story of a little boy who can only speak in sounds. Its success sent shock waves through the industry: Here was a radical departure from your typical animated cartoon, with no cute animals, no cartoon violence, and an intentionally unrealistic animation style. The film’s backgrounds flow seamlessly into each other (there are no walls), with locations changing only through props. Their color changes with the ups and downs of Gerald’s trajectory: When he’s happy, both he and the screen are bright yellow, but at his lowest point, dark blues and blacks dominate. The flat, limited animation allows for expressionistic camera angles, like the famous shot of Gerald walking up the stairs, inspired by Carol Reed’s The Fallen Idol. The short made UPA a force in the industry, and 70 years after its release, “Gerald McBoing-Boing” remains one of the most remarkable and influential cartoons ever produced.

3. “The Man Who Planted Trees” (1987)

Frédéric Back (who also directed “Crac!”) was a lifelong environmentalist who planted thousands of trees on his own property, which made him the perfect person to adapt Jean Giono’s short story, “The Man Who Planted Trees.” This powerful film tells of the friendship between a young man and a peasant farmer who has devoted his life to planting trees throughout his desolate homeland. Over 30 years and two World Wars, he remains undaunted in his mission to cultivate and nurture the French-Canadian countryside, astonishing government officials who never realize that all of this beauty comes from one man’s efforts. To achieve the film’s look, Back and his assistant, Lina Gagnon, sketched on matte acetate with colored pencils, adding in layers of shading as scenes blend from one to the other, using multiple exposures and no cuts. As in “Gerald McBoing-Boing,” the colors evolve with the trajectory of the landscape, from black, craggy lines to lush blues and greens. As an environmental parable, “The Man Who Planted Trees” never becomes preachy or bathetic; it’s a plaintive character study of a saint. Tolstoy would have loved it.

2. “The Cat Concerto” (1946)

Tom and Jerry’s finest outing has the duo at a piano recital where Tom, playing Liszt’s “Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2,” disturbs Jerry, who has made the piano his home. From there, they torment each other using every part of the instrument. Unlike many of their cartoons, this one is an even-handed battle: Tom gives just as good as he gets, and it’s funny to watch Jerry get smacked around over the keys. The jokes involving Tom’s fingers, especially when he attempts to play a tremolo while avoiding a mousetrap, will make any pianist sweat. Warner Bros. cartoons used the “Hungarian Rhapsody” numerous times — including in an uncannily similar cartoon called “Rhapsody Rabbit” with Bugs in the Tom role, that came out the same year. But with “The Cat Concerto,” MGM bested its rival, making this music inseparable from animation’s favorite cat and mouse team.

1. “The Wrong Trousers” (1993)

Nick Park’s follow-up to the first Wallace and Gromit film, 1989’s “A Grand Day Out,” is the best of the duo’s cartoons. “The Wrong Trousers” pits them against a villainous penguin, Feathers McGraw, who attempts to manipulate Wallace’s mechanical trousers to steal a rare jewel. Feathers’s dead-eyed, emotionless stare, combined with Gromit’s expressions, make for hysterical viewing as the penguin replaces him as Wallace’s companion. The gags come fast and furious, some of them subtle (Gromit reading “Pluto’s” Republic), some of them broad, as when Wallace goes on his first “walk” in the trousers and gets yanked all over the countryside.

If only for the hilarious gags and story, “The Wrong Trousers” would still be high on this list, but what puts it at the top is the two-minute climactic chase sequence where Wallace and Gromit go after Feathers on a mechanical train set that runs through their impossibly large home. David O. Russell studied it for the final action sequence in Three Kings, and Danny Boyle has called it “the best action sequence I’ve ever seen in a film.” It is truly one of the most remarkable scenes in all of animation: a triumph of editing, scoring, and sound design that proves animation can hold its own with live action.","Every Oscar Winner for Animated Short Subject, Ranked",Vulture.com,http://www.vulture.com/2019/02/every-oscar-winner-for-animated-short-subject-ranked.html

Is a total collapse of the financial system next or will we see the globalists taking control of the world? Either way, the world is now at one of the most critical crossroads ever in history. Shakespeare expressed it eloquently in Julius Caesar:

There is a tide in the affairs of men.

Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;

Omitted, all the voyage of their life

Is bound in shallows and in miseries.

On such a full sea are we now afloat,

And we must take the current when it serves,

Or lose our ventures.

THE NOT SO BRIGHT FUTURE FOR THE WORLD

One of the brightest minds in finance, R.E. McMaster, has summarised the global situation as follows:

“The globalist New World Order could fall apart. First of all, all of the world’s governments today are socialist, a guarantee of failure.

Moreover, debt globally has reached a tipping point (by 2022 at the latest). (A root meaning of the word “debt” is “death”.)

Social Credit Red China could implode from all its excessive reckless debt and imperialistic over-extension.

The un-elected elitist EU is already coming part with Italy, France, the UK, Poland and Hungary in revolt.

The US Empire is self-destructing from military overstretch, bloated debt at all levels, and spoiled, childlike, take-offense-at-everything selfishness by identity groups and welfare recipients squabbling over the loot taken from productive citizens by the government, while billionaire oligarchic-run corporations pick them apart.

Plus, nearly all governments are equally destructive cultural Marxist.

Then there is the instability of the earth’s magnetic poles, its fast weakening magnetic field, the increasing numbers and intensity of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, plus solar instability, not to mention expensive and increasingly scarce energy.

The risk of an internet shutdown.

The risk of a population-exterminating epidemic (likely a virus, man-made), and the risk of a destructive global nuclear war.

Mankind today, at least the mad narcissistic sociopathic and psychopathic Luciferian rulers, seem to have a comprehensive death wish. …”

It is hard to argue against many of these projections. R.E. McMaster is a moderate person with an immaculate 50 year track record.

It is possible that the elite is working hard on their globalist agenda to assume control of the world. If they achieve what they have set out, life on earth will be extremely unpleasant to say the least. Also, there will be nowhere to escape.

A DISORDERLY RESET NEXT

But even the best plans can go badly wrong. The most likely spanner in the works for the elite will be a total collapse of the financial system. This would involve first a final round of money printing creating hyperinflation in most Western countries as well as in emerging markets. But this will have no effect as the world discovers that worthless pieces of paper or computer entries cannot create eternal prosperity.

After a brief hyperinflationary phase, we will see an implosion of the financial system when global debt and liabilities of at least $2 quadrillion currently, disappears into a black hole. As the debt implodes, so will all the bubble assets financed by the debt, including stocks, property and bonds.

So the world is not in the position to take the flood that leads to fortune. Sadly whatever current the world takes will lead to miseries. We are now in a LOSE – LOSE situation and it will be a question of the least painful outcome.

Since the world cannot choose which way to go, we must look at the most likely option. Personally I believe that a collapse of the financial system and the world economy is more likely than globalist control of the world. You could argue that the globalists will orchestrate the collapse and take advantage of the anarchy which will arise to take control. But I think that the coming disorderly reset of the world economy will be impossible to control by any individuals, state or military power.

A GLOBAL FIRE IS REQUIRED

So the coming years and decades will be horrific which ever path the world takes. A reset is totally necessary for the world to start the next growth phase. We need a global fire that burns the current system down to the ground. Only from that position can we get strong green shoots that will form the foundation for a healthy growth of the new world economy.

Michael Snyder recently wrote an article about life in Major Wester Cities called:

“Rats, Public Defecation And Open Drug Use:

Our Major Western Cities Are Becoming Uninhabitable Hellholes”

The advantage with the fire is that it will also destroy the decadence as well as the false values and false morals which have become rampant in the last few decades.

The suffering that we, our children and grandchildren will go through during this period of transition will be horrendous but sadly it will be necessary in order to give the world a chance to eventually take the right current.

DEUS EX MACHINA – THE ONLY SOLUTION?

It is with no pleasure I discuss the above alternatives for the world. I obviously wish that the outcome of the mess we are in now could treat the world more gently. But I cannot see another realistic solution. Possibly that would be Deus ex Machina which I discussed many years ago in an article. This is from the old Greek plays when god was lowered down on the stage in a little machine or basket and solved all the problems. But unfortunately I think that this is a very unlikely solution to the problem we are in.

GOLD ON THE WAY TO NEW HIGHS IN ALL CURRENCIES

So let’s finish with some more uplifting news for the ones who understand the importance of wealth preservation or insurance against the current risks in the world economy and financial system. In my article last week I talked about the Gold Maginot Line. Gold in US dollars has not yet broken the important $1,350 line but is now on its way, finishing at $1,320 last Friday.

Important moves often start in the periphery. As the chart below shows, Gold in Swiss franc for example broke out of the same line last week and is now on its way to new highs.

Gold is now breaking out to new all time highs in a number of currencies including the Swedish and Norwegian Krona, Canadian and Australian dollars and many more. In Venezuela gold was 200 Bolivars in 2000 and now it is 327 million. In Argentina gold was 270 pesos in 2000 and now it is 50,000. We are likely to see these hyperinflationary levels in the West in coming years.

Subscribe

As I discussed in my article last week, the time when gold can be bought at current levels is quickly coming to an end. And we might get to the point when gold, due to shortages, cannot be bought at any level.

Finally, remember that gold is the only currency that has survived in history. A 5,000 year old tradition will not change whatever governments or globalists try to achieve.

Gold is not just a store of value, it is also beautiful. Below are 3 pictures of gold, dating back 4,500 to 6,250 years, from Timothy Green’s book “The Ages of Gold”

The bull below is 6,250 years old. It is a symbol of gold being both timeless and eternal as the only money which has survived throughout history.

HISTORY’S BIGGEST BEAR MARKET IN FIAT MONEY AND BULL MARKET IN ETERNAL MONEY OR GOLD IS ABOUT TO START.

Whooping Cough Symptoms What Does Whooping Cough Sound Like? Whooping Cough Diagnosis Whooping Cough Treatments Whooping Cough…,"Coughing fits can be irritating and embarrassing, especially when you're in a public place. There may be instances when you could not control it, but know that coughing is the body's way to get rid of foreign particles or mucus from your lungs.

Commonly caused by viruses, a cough may ease on its own without having to be medicated.1 But when a cough persists or you get a ""whoop"" as you inhale, it may not be a mild cough anymore — it could be that you have whooping cough.

What Is Whooping Cough?

Whooping cough, also known as pertussis or the 100-day cough, is a highly contagious respiratory disease brought on by the Bordetella pertussis bacterium. Its name was derived from the prolonged and intense coughing fits that produce a whooping sound when inhaling.

A person with pertussis can infect up to 15 people2 when the whooping cough bacteria3 spread from their coughing or sneezing. It generally starts off with cold-like symptoms such as mild fever and occasional cough, but the coughing spells can last for more than two weeks.4

Whooping Cough Causes: How Does It Spread?

As mentioned, the Bordetella pertussis bacterium causes whooping cough. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, the droplets of fluid with the bacteria coming from their mouth or nose spread into the air and get inhaled by people close by. When inhaled, the bacteria will reproduce in the cells of the nose and throat. This process generates toxins that inhibit the clearing of airways in the lungs and windpipe.5

A milder illness that's similar to whooping cough is caused by Bordetella parapertussis. Though parapertussis has a shorter duration and is less common,6 both can be fatal when acquired.7,8

Is Whooping Cough Contagious?

Whooping cough is highly contagious and is a common infectious disease in the United States. A recent peak in the number of cases occurred in 2012, with 48,277 reported cases of pertussis,9 although there was a 37 percent decrease in the number from 2014 to 2015.10 The latest report shows 18,975 cases in 2017.11

Outbreaks in day care centers and schools that happen annually12 may have contributed to the significant increase in the number of pertussis cases in 13- to 16-year-olds. But among age groups, the majority of deaths occurred in babies younger than 3 years old.13

How Long Is Whooping Cough Contagious?

Infected people may likely spread the disease during the first stage of the illness, known as the catarrhal stage, and two weeks after the coughing fits start. This is when coughing fits begin to get worse and the ""whooping"" sound is produced.14

Whooping Cough Symptoms You Should Look Out For

Symptoms of whooping cough in adults may be determined through the three stages that an infected person undergoes.15,16

Catarrhal stage — Lasting for one to two weeks, symptoms may include sneezing, occasional cough, runny nose and nasal congestion. In some cases, mild fever may occur.

Lasting for one to two weeks, symptoms may include sneezing, occasional cough, runny nose and nasal congestion. In some cases, mild fever may occur. Paroxysmal stage — The common symptoms are vomiting, exhaustion, bluish discoloration of the skin or mucous membrane, choking and acute coughing. The whooping sound may also be evident in this phase.

The common symptoms are vomiting, exhaustion, bluish discoloration of the skin or mucous membrane, choking and acute coughing. The whooping sound may also be evident in this phase. Convalescent stage — At this point, the prolonged coughing fits become less intense.

Other symptoms of pertussis may include:17

Dehydration

Loss of appetite

Inflammation of the middle ear

In many cases, babies do not cough but they experience apnea, a condition that turns their skin blue and causes their breathing to temporarily stop.18

What Does Whooping Cough Sound Like?

The whooping cough sound may be characterized by a high-pitched ""whoop"" when you breathe in. This sound may be heard after coughing fits during the paroxysmal stage of the disease.19 Not everyone infected with pertussis may produce this sound, though, and some may not even cough, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).20

Whooping Cough Diagnosis

If you have been coughing for 14 days or more, it is important to consult with your health care provider to verify if you have pertussis.21 A number of laboratory tests will determine pertussis including culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology.22 Other tests that you may undergo are blood tests and chest X-rays.23

Whooping Cough Treatments You May Follow

Babies who have been infected by whooping cough may need hospitalization or attentive care from their physician, as this can become a very serious condition for a baby.24 For children and adults, who may not need to be admitted to a hospital, here are lifestyle and home remedies for whooping cough that you may follow:25,26,27,28

• To decrease vomiting, eat small, frequent meals. • Avoid foods that trigger mucus production such as peanuts and wheat. Even healthy foods like raw milk and eggs should be temporarily avoided or minimized while you're suffering from the symptoms. • Consume vitamin C-rich foods such as lime, tangerine, berries, bell pepper and broccoli to boost your immune system. A study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal29 found that vitamin C, when taken in substantial doses, may help ease coughing fits in the paroxysmal stage of pertussis. • To avoid dehydration, drink at least 70 ounces of pure water per day if you're a 75-kilogram (165 pounds) individual. Refrain from consuming commercial fruit juices and sports drinks, as they not only may contain inflammation-causing sugars, but are lacking in a variety of organic nutrients. • Get rid of irritants in your home that may cause coughing fits, such as aerosol sprays and smoke from tobacco and stoves. • Rest and relax in a cool and quiet bedroom. • Help ease coughing fits by using a cool-mist vaporizer.

A 2014 study found that antihistamines, pertussis immunoglobin and salbutamol may not help ease coughing fits caused by pertussis.30 If you plan to take these medications to help relieve whooping cough, seek your health care provider's advice before doing so.

Also, unless advised by your doctor, cough medicines are not recommended to be taken by people with pertussis, especially children under 6 years old. Coughing is the body's way of clearing airways, which is why it must not be suppressed.31

Whooping Cough Prevention: Is There a Way to Restrain This Disease?

Whooping cough is an airborne respiratory disease that targets the immune system. Simply inhaling the tiny droplets released from an infected person's mouth might put you at risk. Here are some ways to help prevent acquiring this disease:32

If you have pertussis, cover your mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing — doing this may help restrain the spread of bacteria in the air.

Promote proper hygiene everywhere you go. Pertussis is as contagious as the common cold. As much as possible, wash your hands using mild soap and water. While many hospitals and health care factions also endorse using hand sanitizers, actually many of these sanitizers contain isopropyl alcohol, which can dry your hands and increase your risk of absorbing toxins, so if you do use sanitizers, do it minimally.

A 2007 study showed that whooping cough in infants is largely transmitted from household members — including asymptomatic persons who were fully vaccinated 33 — who come in close contact with the babies. 34 To avoid this, keep infants away from known infected persons, especially those in the early stages of the disease. 35

— who come in close contact with the babies. To avoid this, keep infants away from known infected persons, especially those in the early stages of the disease. Boost your immune system by getting enough sleep and including foods rich in B vitamins, protein, vitamins A, C and D, fiber and probiotics to your diet.

Diet for Whooping Cough: Which Kinds of Food Should You Eat?

Since pertussis is an airborne disease, it is essential to boost your immune system to prevent it. One way to do this is by keeping an eye on what you eat. To help reduce the risk of having pertussis, here are the kinds of nutrients that you may need to consume:

• Protein — Commonly found in lean meat, bone broth, fish, eggs, nuts and seeds, protein may help fight infections. However, be mindful of your protein consumption, as too much protein can also be detrimental to your health, putting you at risk of insulin sensitivity and even cancer. • Vitamin C — Good sources of vitamin C include broccoli, berries, leafy greens, citrus fruits and bell peppers. • Vitamin A — Add carrots, squash, sweet potatoes, cantaloupe, organic, pastured eggs, grass fed beef and dark, leafy vegetables to your diet to lower your risk of infection. • Fiber — Help balance your gut microbiome by adding fibrous foods like blueberries, cucumbers, nuts, celery, carrots, banana, papaya and mango to your diet. • Vitamin D — Best acquired through sun exposure, vitamin D may help support your immune response. Raw grass fed milk, wild-caught Alaskan salmon and organic, pastured eggs also contain vitamin D. • Probiotics — Fermented foods are rich in probiotics that help balance the intestinal bacteria. These include fermented vegetables, natto, kimchi, pickles, miso, kefir, tempeh and raw grass fed yogurt. • B vitamins — Boost your immunity by consuming foods with vitamin B1 (thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B7 (biotin), B9 (folic acid) and B12 (cobalamin) such as dark, leafy greens, mackerel, sardines, anchovies, pastured organic chicken, yogurt, cheese and raw, organic grass fed milk.

Croup Versus Whooping Cough: What's the Difference?

Whooping cough, as mentioned, is a respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. Its notable symptoms are runny nose, mild fever and coughing bouts that produce a ""whoop"" sound when inhaling.36

On the other hand, croup is another name for laryngotracheobronchitis and laryngotracheitis. Croup is commonly caused by the parainfluenza virus, but respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, enterovirus, influenza and adenovirus may also lead to croup. It is an infection that interferes with breathing and is common in children because they have small airways.

Croup symptoms include nasal congestion, rhinorrhea and fever. An infected person may develop a hoarse voice, a high-pitched wheezing sound or stridor and a seal-like cough. Similar to pertussis, croup may be fatal to infants, but it is rare.37

Unlike whooping cough, croup may not be as serious. Home treatments may help ease it, and only about 5 percent of infected children will require hospitalization.38

551,Empty,2019-02-19T03:21:32Z,"Enjoy a quiet paddle, watch wildlife or swim with delightful manatees","INVERNESS, FLORIDA – It’s a cool morning by Florida standards and a light fog is hanging over the dark waters of the Withlacoochee River.

The mist rises and swirls over the top of the river as we pull away from the dock for our tour of the river with captain Doug Riggs of Wild Bill’s Airboat Tours. Across the small bay, a blue heron sits motionless, waiting for its breakfast to appear in the water below. Off to our right, a startled ibis flaps its wings and sails over a patch of brilliant yellow flowers.

Riggs slowly motors through the shallow water, pointing out the birds and some native plants. I should be writing down the names of them but instead I’m gazing out at the flat water and the surprising tapestry of colours in the trees that line the riverbank.

The words “fall colour” don’t pop into my mind when I think of Florida, but we’re surrounded by cypress, gum trees, oaks and even what I think might be maple trees. It’s not quite the colour you’d see in Canada, but there’s an impressive palette of rusty reds, burnt oranges and deep yellows.

The temperatures are a little low for alligators to be sunning themselves, but we spot one that’s about a meter long just a few feet away. Riggs explains that every inch between an alligator’s eyeball and nostril indicates roughly one foot in length. I don’t have a tape measure on my person, so I take his word for it.

It’s a mostly placid ride, but near the end Riggs decides he needs to emulate the “Wild Bill” in the company title. He fires up the throttle and sends us careering and sliding across the water at a rapid speed as we head across a broad bay, the water spraying up and over the boat.

Riggs slows thing down as we mosey through a small opening in the river and creep towards the dock, the autumn colours reflected in the still waters ahead of our boat.

I was lucky enough to get out on the water or into it on every day of my recent six-day trip to central Florida, where I did a couple of days in delightful New Smyrna Beach and then headed into the interior to explore the freshwater rivers and surprising springs that pop up out of the earth in a wide arc that stretches across the state.

Most tourists heading south on the interstates in the general direction of The Mouse or Miami slide right past these glorious springs, which send billions of gallons of fresh water out of the Florida limestone every day, all at a constant 22 degrees Celsius. I got to spend four days in around the springs near Ocala and Crystal River, a Gulf Coast community that’s a couple hours north of Tampa with stunning, clear springs and hundreds of manatees.

Manatees – gentle, lumbering grey creatures that usually live in the ocean– flock to Florida’s springs every winter to stay warm; much like the Canadians flying by on Interstate 75,

The Plantation on Crystal River has a program where folks can do dives with the manatees. We gather early one morning and watch a video on the animals and are given a few rules. Manatees are curious and probably will approach us at very close range, but we’re not to swim after them, seek out their attention or touch them.

We don our wetsuits and, after a very short boat ride out into Kings’ Bay, slide gently into the water to observe the animals in a protected natural springs area that’s cordoned off by buoys. As advertised, they’re quite curious; swimming right up to our masks and showing no trace of fear. They roll and glide and move silently in the water as we snap away with our underwater cameras.

Later that day I do a kayak trip on the nearby Chassahowitzka River with Dave Perry from Hunter Springs Kayaks. We paddle into quiet, small bays lined with trees with deep orange leaves and graceful palms that arch out over the dark water. I take a deep breath and try to soak it all in.

Manatees laze about below our kayaks in the warm spring water. Over on the river bank, a dark brown/black otter slinks along the edge of the river.

I had another fine paddle on the Rainbow River southwest of Ocala. The folks at KP Hole County Park rent kayaks, stand-up paddle boards and other water gear for visitors who want to explore the area and Rainbow Springs State Park.

There are lovely cottages on the west bank of the river, with families splashing about in the water. On the east side it’s all natural, with towering trees and small parks dotting the landscape. As I round one of the bends in the river I see a woman on her paddleboard with a small dog riding up front.

Just outside of Ocala is Silver Springs State Park, where you can take a lovely glass bottom boat ride and peer deep down into the spring-fed water. They’ve filmed several movies here over the years, including Tarzan flicks and the James Bond film Thunderball.

We spot large gators sunning themselves on exposed logs, as well as a mother manatee with a couple of babies. Our guide points out a 500-year-old native American canoe that rests at the bottom, as well as underwater caves, several species of fish and a variety of birds, including sleek, black-and-white Anhingas.

A half-hour or so east of Silver Springs is Juniper Springs Recreation Area, where they’ve built a small pond you can swim in (just warm enough for a Canadian in winter, I can say with authority) that uses the natural spring water, as well as a lovely boardwalk that meanders through the palmettos and live oak trees draped with Spanish Moss. I wander through the quiet forest and take a short walk over to Fern Hammock, where the water takes on a remarkable shade of blue.

As much as I loved the springs and the kayak trips in the inland regions, I also had a marvellous time checking out beaches on both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Coast. New Smyrna Beach sits on the east coast of Florida, just south of Daytona, and features a cheerful, low-key downtown with galleries, home décor stores, surf shops and old-time ice cream joints.

I have lunch one day at a casual, beachfront place called The Breakers and run into a group of winter refugees from Wisconsin, ladies passing out vanilla vodka shots as part of a birthday celebration. A rocket is being launched down the road at Cape Canaveral that day, so we dash out onto the sand to watch it quickly rise through the deep blue sky.

Across the Intracoastal Waterway is the New Smyrna Beach Museum of History, which tells wonderful stories of pioneer days and terrific tales of the town’s first female mayor, a real fireplug named Hannah Detwiler Bonnet. Around the corner is a terrific gallery/event space called The Hub on Canal, where you’ll find artists creating everything from pastoral beach scenes to thought-provoking political works to jewelry and moccasins.

I take a couple hours to test a bike that’s specially outfitted for riding on the beach, rented by a company called Salty Rentals. It’s an easy afternoon ride as I pass kids playing in the surf and lovers walking hand-in-hand.

My last morning in town I wake up early to catch the sunrise at the Flagler Avenue Boardwalk and spot a group of locals chatting about the weather and various goings-on in the town. Dave, who hails from Indiana, tells me he’s been coming every morning for seven years.

I take a minute to listen to the chatter, then snap some photos of a glorious sunrise filled with deep oranges, pinks and yellows.

On the west coast, I take time to check out Fort Island Beach, a short drive west of downtown Crystal River. There’s a small but nice beach and a sturdy wooden pier that’s perfect for fishing.

The day I arrive a group of locals are playing in a drum circle as the sun settles into the Gulf of Mexico, pounding out a beat as a handful of folks dance and whirl in the sand.

Retired New York taxi driver Steve Schwartz, who helped form the current drum circle, tells me they play every second Sunday of the month. He tells me it’s kind of an homage to the sun and talks briefly about some kind of pyramid power. Over his shoulder, a woman of a certain age twirls a gauzy scarf around her and shimmies to the beat.

I soak up the joy of the drums and the smiles of the dancers and the colours of a Florida sunset and slowly drive back to my hotel in the fading light.

If you go:

NEW SMYRNA BEACH

The Breakers serves up tasty fish tacos and other casual treats. Ocean Breeze has a tiki bar and an upstairs patio with great views of the beach. Further along the main drag, Flagler Avenue, Aa Garden Fusion features solid Asian fare and a nice outside garden. Riverpark Terrace has a wonderful outdoor seating area under the shade of towering trees and serves up outstanding food. The dipping sauce for your bread features olive oil, balsamic, honey, garlic and other spices and is to die for. Equally splendid was my salad with greens, sliced apples, goat cheese and pecans. The Hampton Inn and Suites in New Smyrna Beach is a few short blocks from the water and features nice rooms with a small pool, free breakfast and warm cookies in the evening. South of town, the Canaveral National Seashore features wonderful nature trails, endless beaches and plenty of solitude.

OCALA

In Ocala, Brick City Southern Kitchen serves very good ribs and other barbeque specialties. Happy hour specials are outstanding, and they make a potent, tasty old-fashioned at the bar. Around the corner is Sayulita Tacos, which makes a number of great tacos. One is called “the cowboy” and features, steak, bacon and cheese. The Best Western Ocala Park Center is right off Highway 75 and close to restaurants and shopping. The Reilly Center in Ocala is a fine theatre that puts on great shows; from jazz and classical to laser Pink Floyd Shows. I saw a terrific performance from the jazzy Manhattan Transfer. Not far from Ocala is the riverfront town of Dunnellon, home to a fun, casual restaurant/tiki bar called the Blue Gator, which often has live music.

CRYSTAL RIVER

Homosassa Springs is home to the delightful Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park, where you’ll find everything from Florida cougars and a hippopotamus to bald eagles, Florida key deer, and, in season, tons of manatees. The town of Homosassa has waterfront restaurants and hotels and an expansive elaborate tiki bar called Crumps Landing. There’s even a tiny island in the Homosassa River that’s populated entirely by monkeys who were set free from a local wildlife center some years ago. The Plantation on Crystal River offers stylish rooms in a quiet setting just south of downtown. There’s a fine pool and a tiki bar, as well as a good on-site restaurant and shops. There’s a nice golf course right across the road. Greenhouse Bistro in Homosassa has very good regional food, while Seafood Seller and Café in Crystal River offers up great Cajun cuisine at affordable prices. In nearby Lecanto, Katch Twenty Two features a sleek interior design and a chef who’s worked at top hotels around the United States. I had marvellous scallops with bacon, pistachios, carrot puree and tiny slices of jalapeno, along with a massive portion of sweet, tender short rib.

552,Empty,2019-02-22T13:00:00Z,Julia* was 16 years old when a man more than three times her age tried to undo her bra.,"Loading She was told it was her own fault that she was repeatedly harassed by her male co-workers, she says. Julia believes that the fact her abusers also had intellectual disabilities meant their alleged offences were seen as lesser crimes. Now 31-years-old, the trauma is still with her. “I felt I had no control over what happened to me,” Julia says. “That feeling is never completely gone."" Julia is just one of many women with intellectual disabilities who have been harassed, abused, assaulted - and ignored. Momentum is building behind the push from Labor and the Greens' for a royal commission into abuse in the disability services sector. The government waved through the parties' motion on Monday, agreeing in principle to a royal commission. However, Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not commit to a timeline for the inquiry, saying it would first need the agreement of all states and territories.

But the first hurdle to any meaningful inquiry is Australia's lack of robust data that traces the true extent of what experts call an endemic and hidden crisis. “We know women with disability are silenced by the perpetrators of the abuse,” says Associate Professor Patsie Frawley at Deakin University. ""We know violence against women with disabilities is often unreported and when it is reported it is dismissed, ignored or covered up."" Through her community outreach work Frawley has collected countless testimonials from women with an intellectual disability who have been sexually abused. But the reports of abuse are not being tracked at a state or national level.

The 2016 Australian Bureau of Statistics Personal Safety Survey shows that more than 43 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds with a disability or long-term health condition report experiencing sexual harassment. That is almost double the proportion of people without a disability or long-term health condition. But because the figure is based on a household survey, it does not capture the population of women with a disability living in facilities or who would not readily disclose abuse, Frawley says. And many facilities, such as boarding houses, prisons and women's shelters, don't identify women with disabilities in their records, ""so there's not a clear and full picture"", she says. And an erroneous, often-quoted statistic: ""90 per cent of women with disability have experienced violence and abuse"", is a two-decade-old conflation of several Canadian studies. “A royal commission would give us the opportunity to get some really good Australian data,” Frawley says. 'I was very terrified'

Soon after Julia started working at the sheltered workshop, several older male employees found her in the phone directory and left countless voicemail messages asking her to be their girlfriend. Loading Through tears, Julia recalls working alone in a storeroom when she felt hands fumbling with her bra clasp. It was a male co-worker aged in his 50s. “I turned around and said ‘why did you do that?’ and he said ‘because I can’.” On another occasion, a male co-worker in his 20s touched her bottom, rubbed himself against her and laughed. She reported the incidents to her boss, who said he would talk to the men.

But Julia was later told that their behaviour was expected, given her youth and appearance, she says. She was advised not to engage with or smile at her co-workers. As she rode the bus home from work one afternoon she saw one of her abusers on the same bus. She panicked, got off the bus, crossed the road and was hit by a car. She sustained a skull fracture and a mild brain injury. She was again traumatised when one of her abusers visited her in hospital. The day she returned to work, she learned the man who had touched her bottom had been making loud sexual noises, moaning her name and making lewd gestures with the workshop machinery as he invited other men to join in. “A female co-worker told me she was scared for me … she was worried [the man] would take the next step of rape,” Julia says. “I was very terrified and became angry.""

She confronted the man in the lunchroom, yelling at him and threatening to call the police. But the most demoralising act, she says, was the reaction from her managers. Julia was ordered to the head manager’s office where several other section bosses were waiting. She says the door was slammed shut behind her and locked, she was reprimanded and her job was threatened. “They told me I had no right to have an outburst at a male with an intellectual disability,” she says. “They said it was very inappropriate of me and it was not tolerated in the workplace.” The intimidating experience was the final straw. Julia had a nervous breakdown and was hospitalised. 'It's okay to speak up'

When the perpetrators of harassment and assault are people with an intellectual disability it can be seen as “less of a crime”, Frawley says. The daily, pervasive sexual abuse of women with a disability were usually reported as ""incidents"" and dealt with internally, she says. “We need to take them out in the open and call them what they are. These are crimes.” Julia was an exception. The teenager and her mother launched a long and costly court battle against her employer; it was later settled. But she had lost her job, her self-esteem and her friends. “I couldn’t leave the house for three years. I was very paranoid that someone was going to touch me,” she says. International evidence shows women with disabilities are subjected to higher rates of physical and sexual abuse, both from people close to them and total strangers. The perpetrators might be intimate partners, co-workers, managers, carers and, in isolated cases, transport providers such as taxi drivers. A 2008 survey in the United States found women with severe disabilities were four times more likely to be sexually assaulted than women without disabilities. And a 2005 New Zealand study found women aged between 11 and 17 disclosed experiences of sexual abuse at the hands of step-fathers, mothers' boyfriends and older brothers.

For Julia, it has taken several years of intensive work with a counsellor to claw back her life. “He told me a person who doesn’t have a disability struggles [to overcome the trauma of sexual harassment] but a person with intellectual disabilities struggles 10 times worse,” she says. Julia believes women with intellectual disabilities may be perceived as vulnerable and less likely to defend themselves from sexual harassment and assault. “I want them to know it’s not their fault and it's okay to speak up,” she says. Lawyer and senior advocate at the NSW Council for Intellectual Disability Jim Simpson says a royal commission would “put a spotlight on the terrible injustices that happen so often to people with intellectual disability”. “It's extremely important to have the spotlight of a royal commission because people with disability - by the nature of their disability - find it really hard to identify when their rights are being abused, know what to do about it and have the confidence to seek redress,” Simpson says. “Reporting sexual abuse is so often difficult for any woman. It can be much more difficult for women with intellectual disability.”

It is vital that a royal commission examine all settings, including residential facilities, schools, hospitals, jails, workplaces and within homes, Simpson says. Frawley says there is a role for the National Disability Insurance Scheme Quality and Safeguards Commission to address these issues. The commission - which covers NSW and South Australia - received 29 reports of sexual assault against NDIS participants, and 184 reports overall of abuse or neglect in three months. The Human Rights Commission’s National Inquiry into sexual harassment in Australian workplaces was also taking notice, holding a targeted consultation with people with disability in Sydney on Monday. “There is good work being done, but there is a hell of a lot more we need to understand and a lot more that needs to be done,” says Frawley. *Name has been changed","Push for a royal commission into disability sector: the endemic, hidden crisis facing women",Smh.com.au,https://www.smh.com.au/national/push-for-a-royal-commission-into-disability-sector-the-endemic-hidden-crisis-facing-women-20190218-p50ymy.html

THIS WEEK:

By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)

It’s Not Real; It’s Puccini: People often suspend realism. In the movie “Spiderman” the hero swings through the canyons of Manhattan using threads of “spider silk” he attaches from building to building as he travels down the street. In Puccini’s La Boheme, the leading lady sings a beautiful aria on her death bed, in the last stages of consumption, tuberculous filling her lungs will bodily fluids. The realist may say that is not possible. The opera buff may respond it’s not real; it’s Puccini.

Human imagination is boundless.

Unfortunately, many scientists, commentators and politicians expect other physicists and commentators to suspend realism when examining climate science produced by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and other reports from similar organizations. Critical thinking is not welcome.

For example, 40 years of calculations from comprehensive satellite data show that the atmosphere is warming modestly, but not over the Antarctic. The calculations are verified using temperature measurements by different instruments in weather balloons, taken over a part of the atmosphere. The greenhouse effect occurs in the atmosphere. The temperature trends in the atmosphere include effects of all greenhouse gases, such as changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor occurring from natural El Niño events.

The IPCC, etc. use surface temperatures, which are not comprehensive and include many other influences such as urbanization and change in land use. Surface temperature trends show a far greater warming rate than atmospheric trends. The IPCC, etc. claim that the primary cause of surface warming is carbon dioxide and that it is dangerous for humans. The advocates of dangerous warming have not produced a substantiated foundation, a tested hypothesis that demonstrates how a minor warming of the atmosphere causes a far greater warming of the surface. Further, the models they use predict a pronounced warming of the upper troposphere above the tropics, a “tropical hot spot.” Observations by balloons, and satellites show that it’s simply not there. It is as if the Climate Establishment is saying about their work: it’s not physics, it’s climate science!

********************

Will Happer – Realist: President Trump did the unthinkable for many. He appointed a distinguished physicist, William Happer, to a committee being formed to review the security risks to the nation from climate change. Readers may recall that TWTW has suggested that the threat assessments are dubious at best. They lack critical thinking. Fort Eustis, VA, on the James River, is listed as one of the military facilities most at risk from sea level rise caused by global warming. The tidal gages in the area show that sea levels are not rising by an unusual extent.

But, the entire area of Norfolk / Newport News, which is on the low coastal plane, is sinking. Land subsidence is occurring, primarily from ground water extraction from two major wells which are forming clear funnels that show subsiding land centered on these wells. One well is at West Point on the York River about 30 miles northeast of Fort Eustis. The other well is in Franklin, Virginia, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Eustis. A cost-effective alternative for water may be to replace these wells with one or two desalination plants similar to that employed in Carlsbad, CA, using prefiltration technology developed in Israel.

When the appointment of Happer was announced, the global warming chorus roared – how dare the president appoint a physicist who may question the threat assessments by experts. The noise may be reminiscent of the uproar the occurred when President Reagan dared question the assessments of the experts who considered that the Soviet economy was comparable to that of the US, including the first US Nobel laureate in economics. After the Soviet economy collapsed, the critics of Reagan forgot their previous economic assessments.

A sample of the response to Happer can be found in an editorial in Science Magazine written by a journalist for an environmental news service, E & E News.

“William Happer, a prominent opponent of climate science in the Trump administration, is heading a new White House effort to downplay the national security risks posed by climate change.”

“Happer, who is not a climate scientist, has rejected mainstream climate science for years. He routinely says that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and that the world could burn more fossil fuels without harm. Happer heads a group called the CO2 Coalition, which advocates for a rejection of climate science, and he has said the world is in a ‘CO2 drought.’”

“’Frankly, it’s insulting to those in the intelligence community and those who are in our science agencies,’ [Francesco] Femia [co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security] said. ‘Within the Pentagon and within the intelligence community, there are a lot of people who are evidence-driven, fact-driven, science-driven patriots, and they see a risk and they begin to put that into their analysis because they know if you don’t do so, you’re going to have a blind spot on security. And that’s never a good thing.’”

Such comments prompt a response such as, “Why do these evidence-driven, fact-driven, science-driven patriots ignore atmospheric temperature trends, where the greenhouse gas effect occurs?” And “What is fact-based about claims of exponential sea level rise, increasing sea levels by an ever-increasing rate?”

But, perhaps the most pointed response came from physicist Luboš Motl in his blog, The Reference Frame, when addressing political comments by former mayor Michael Bloomberg and Senator Chuck Schumer:

“Can’t they see that Happer clearly knows more about these matters – especially the absorption of electromagnetic radiation (the greenhouse effect is an example) and the relative CO2 famine in the present – than they and their Senate clubs and aides combined? Bullying of a scientist by a politician is the right word here.”

This goes to the core. The enormous benefits of carbon dioxide fertilization are well-documented, substantiated by experiments and real-world observations, but ignored by the IPCC and the climate chorus. Worse, the IPCC, etc. have produced a distorted version of the absorption and reemission of electromagnetic radiation (the greenhouse effect). See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy, Defending the Orthodoxy, Changing Seas, and Other Scientific News.

********************

The Greenhouse Effect: this is the first in a series on the greenhouse effect as it is being measured in the atmosphere.

Greenhouse gases are nearly transparent to sunlight but partially opaque to thermal radiation from Earth’s surface and atmosphere. The greenhouse effect is a predicted warming of the surface and lower atmosphere and a cooling of the stratosphere and upper atmosphere as the concentration of greenhouse gases increases. The most important greenhouse gas is water vapor, H2O. Carbon dioxide, CO2, is of lesser importance. Nitrous oxide, N2O, and methane, CH4, make only minor contributions to greenhouse warming. The most abundant gases in the atmosphere, nitrogen, N2, and oxygen, O2, are not greenhouse gases since they are nearly transparent to both sunlight and thermal radiation. There is no doubt that the greenhouse effect exists, but there is considerable uncertainty about how large it is.

Many economic models show that small warming of any kind will benefit the Earth, for example, by lengthening growing seasons and by lessening human mortality due to extreme cold. Separately, increasing concentrations of CO2 have enormously positive effects on the growth of crops and forests. Greening of the Earth from more CO2 is already being observed from satellites. It is important to resolve whether the greenhouse effect from credible increases in CO2 concentrations will be modest and beneficial or large and harmful. Theoretical uncertainties in science have traditionally been resolved by comparing theoretical predictions with observations. Comparing predicted and observed temperature changes of the surface and lower atmosphere is an incisive way to resolve theoretical uncertainties about the magnitude of the greenhouse effect.

Surface and lower-atmospheric temperatures are expected to warm in response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. But surface temperatures, and their global averages, are influenced by other factors, like land-use changes, suburban and urban development. Surface temperatures are measured by thermometers here and there—sometimes in very bad locations—, and effort is made to interpolate between sites, often poorly. In contrast, satellites can measure atmospheric temperatures with nearly full sampling of the globe and with few of the systematic errors that plague surface measurements.

Instruments on satellites measure the intensity of microwave radiation emitted by the atmosphere. Temperatures are deduced from these intensities by methods analogous to those used in scanning temporal thermometers, available in most pharmacies. Atmospheric temperatures determined from satellite observations have been confirmed by direct measurements of temperature from weather balloons, many hundreds of which are launched every day.

Another reason to use atmospheric rather than surface temperatures as the touchstone for testing climate models is that climate models predict maximum warming at altitudes of 5 to 10 km in the tropical atmosphere. Lesser warmings are predicted for the surface, where it is harder to make reliable measurements.

Using atmospheric temperature data, John Christy et al. have repeatedly shown that the global climate models, in general, greatly overestimate the warming of the bulk atmosphere. Using 60 years of weather balloon data, Ross McKitrick and Christy have shown that an assumed pronounced warming centered over the tropics at about 30,000 to 35,000 feet (9 to 11 km, 300 to 200 millibars) is not found. The McKitrick and Christy study reinforces a 2007 study by Douglas, Christy, Pearson and Singer. This “hot spot” may be logically derived from a warming of the surface, whatever the cause. Its failure to appear after 60 years of observations is significant. There is something wrong with the theory. methodology, and/or procedure used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its followers such as the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the models on which they rely.

TWTW addressed this lack of a pronounced warming in the context of the widely accepted Global Annual Energy Budget by Kiehl and Trenberth on January 26 and February 2. The vicinity of center of the graphic depicts the concepts at issue “Thermals and Evapotranspiration” at the surface absorbing heat then rising in the atmosphere then releasing latent heat in the atmosphere. Based on the evidence presented by McKitrick and Christy, these processes are not intensifying. Thus, assumptions that storms, floods, droughts, etc. are intensifying are not justified by observational evidence.

Using observed evidence, Christy et al. have shown that the divergence between climate models and actual nature is increasing. The divergence is likely to continue unless the theory and methodology used by the IPCC, et al., are changed substantially. This is the first of several TWTWs that will address our understanding of the actual greenhouse gas effect and why the efforts of the IPCC, et al. are faulty.

Although not comprehensive and not embodied in a coherent theory, significant observational data of the atmosphere are being collected. These data suggest the IPCC has significantly overestimated the total greenhouse gas effect, especially that of carbon dioxide. These data bring into question the right side of what is depicted in the Kiehl and Trenberth diagram, the outgoing surface radiation resulting in far less outgoing longwave radiation. Unfortunately, outgoing longwave radiation, which is in the infrared range, cannot be observed from the surface.

The 1979 Charney report assumed that the greenhouse gas effect of carbon dioxide, which had been measured by laboratory experiments, would be greatly amplified by increased water vapor. Since there were no comprehensive measurements of outgoing longwave radiation, there was no hard evidence supporting or refuting this concept. Thus, the 1979 Charney report embodied speculation concerning the impact of greenhouse gases that may have been appropriate at that time; but, as with atmospheric temperature trends, this speculation has been superseded by observational data.

To better express the effects of greenhouse gases on outgoing infrared radiation, it is useful to think of placing thin layers of slightly smoky glass over a bright light shining through a window with each layer of glass being less smoky, clearer. As more layers are placed on, the total effect increases, but effect of the last layer is less noticeable than the previous one. In terminology that will follow in future TWTWs, if there is no interference with the light (electromagnetic energy) passing through the atmosphere (the window), it is said to be transparent. If there is considerable interference with the light (electromagnetic energy) passing through the atmosphere, it is said to be opaque. Different greenhouse gases interfere with different wavelengths of outbound infrared energy. At a particular wavelength, carbon dioxide may be transparent to infrared energy, yet at a different wavelength, opaque to infrared energy. The ability of greenhouse gases to absorb, then re-emit energy varies with the wavelength of the energy.

Since the advent of the satellite era, several countries have been compiling data on the atmosphere. For example, with what is called the A-Train of multiple satellites, and a similar, lower orbiting, C-Train, satellites from the US, France, and Japan collect a wide variety of data, including visible, infrared and microwave energy, phases of water, studies of vegetation, atmospheric pollutants, greenhouse gases, aerosols, clouds, water levels on land areas, snow depths, etc. The information is shared among international partners.

Future installments in TWTW will discussed how these data, and other data, are compiled and developed into databases that are available to the public and can be downloaded onto personal computers. Further discussions will include how these calculations based on observations contradict the findings of the IPCC, etc., and their models. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy and Measurement Issues – Atmosphere.

********************

Hurricanes and Climate Change: On her web site, Climate Etc., Judith Curry has posted two installments on a series about Hurricanes & Climate Change. The first is on detection, going back about 5,000 years. The second is on attribution which she states must be based on observations, not models. See links under Models v. Observations.

********************

Additions and Corrections: A reader on WUWT wrote that TWTW linked to the headline of comments on a paper changing ocean pH with changing wind patterns. The link created the impression that the paper contradicted recent lowering of pH claimed by many. Actually, the paper showed 159-year reconstruction of pH based on a set of coral collected in the northern South China Sea. TWTW should have made such a comment under the link.

********************

Number of the Week: Not €1.57 billion, but closer to €7 billion. An EU energy study claimed that annual levies on UK consumers in 2016 for subsidies to renewable electricity were €1.57 billion, whereas the correct figure is closer to €7 billion. It seems that subsidies for green energy are experiencing more exponential growth than increases in sea level. See link under Problems in the Orthodoxy.

Climate change science pioneer Wallace Smith Broecker dies

US professor raised early alarms about climate change and popularised term ‘global warming’

By Jonathan Watts, The Guardian, Feb 19, 2019

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/19/climate-change-science-pioneer-wallace-smith-broecker-dies

“Broecker said his studies suggested that the conveyor belt was the ‘Achilles heel of the climate system’ and a fragile phenomenon that could change rapidly for reasons not fully understood. It would take only a slight rise in temperature to keep water from sinking in the North Atlantic, he said, and that would bring the conveyor to a halt.

“In the 1970s, he worked as a consultant for Exxon and wrote several papers on the effects of carbon dioxide for the oil company.

“His 1975 paper “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?”, which predicted rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to pronounced heating of the planet. This built on earlier studies and helped to push the subject to a wider audience.”

The Climate Scales in Our Eyes

By David Whitehouse, GWPF, Feb 20, 2019

https://www.thegwpf.com/the-climate-scales-in-our-eyes/

“You would not teach in Physics 101 that you quote a measurement of a continuous variable to one part in a thousand when its error is a hundred parts in a thousand, as is the case for HadCrut4. The sensible way is to round the annual global temperature to 0.1 degree C. To rank years swimming about in statistical noise yet hype it as a big media story and a policy driver is nonsense.”

Hurricanes & Climate Change: Detection

By Judith Curry, Climate Etc. Feb 17, 2019

https://judithcurry.com/2019/02/17/hurricanes-climate-change-detection/#more-24723

“I am preparing a new Special Report on Hurricanes and Climate Change.

“There has not been a timeline or synthesis of these results for the past five thousand years, either regionally or for the entire coastal region. However, it is clear from these analyses that significant variability of landfall probabilities occurs on century to millennial time scales. There appears to have been a broad ‘hyperactive period’ from 3400 to 1000 years B.P. High activity persisted in the Gulf of Mexico until 1400 AD, with a shift to more frequent severe hurricane strikes from the Bahamas to New England occurring between 1400 and 1675 AD. Since 1760, there was a gradual decline in activity until the 1990’s.”

Hurricanes and Climate Change: Attribution

By Judith Curry, Climate Etc. Feb 20, 2019

https://judithcurry.com/2019/02/20/24737/#more-24737

“Models and theory suggest that hurricane intensity and rainfall should increase in a warming climate. There is no theory that predicts a change in the number of hurricanes or a change in hurricane tracks with warmer temperatures.

“Convincing attribution of any changes requires that a change in hurricane characteristics be identified from observations, with the change exceeding natural variability.”

“There is no need to delve into levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and all the minutia associated with LCOE calculations. The cost and output of units being installed worldwide establishes, unequivocally, that wind and PV Solar are more expensive.”

“There was some modest activity yesterday in the Mann vs Steyn climate-change hockey-stick case, which will shortly be entering its eighth year. As that ludicrous fact testifies, it has been procedurally bollocksed by the District of Columbia courts, which is why it will almost certainly be headed to the Supreme Court. When it gets there, it will be the most consequential free-speech case since New York Times vs Sullivan fifty-five years ago.”

[SEPP Comment: The New York Times-vs-Sullivan decision established an actual malice standard which requires that a plaintiff [person making the complaint of wrongdoing], who is a public official or public figure, and who alleges defamation, must prove that the publisher of the statement in question knew that the statement was false, or acted in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity.]

“In the case of the 1976 Swine Flu episode, President Ford, acting on the advice from the country’s best medical advisors, authorized dramatic action — aggressive intervention, in the form of a national immunization campaign — which turned out badly. Many of the advisors that had originally convinced President Ford to act almost immediately had second thoughts, long before the adverse effects started to turn up. Historians have been critical of Ford but the blame stems from the difficulty of decision making under deep uncertainty.”

“Scientists will this week warn that Italy may be forced to import the basic ingredients for pasta, its national food, because climate change will make it impossible to grow durum wheat.

“In a report to be released by Britain’s Met Office today, scientists predict that Italy’s durum yields will start to decline from 2020 and the crop will almost disappear from the country later this century.

“The report will say: ‘Projected climate changes in this region, in particular rising temperature and decreasing rainfall, may seriously compromise wheat yields.’

1. The Green New Deal’s Impossible Electric Grid

Renewable energy can’t consistently balance power supply with demand.

By Robert Blohm, WSJ, Feb 20, 2019

https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-green-new-deals-impossible-electric-grid-11550705997

“Mr. Blohm is an elected member of the Operating Committee and the Standards Committee of the North American Electric Reliability Corp., the continental bulk electric system’s reliability regulator designated by the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 and by all the Canadian provinces’ energy regulators.”

In expressing a critical concern Mr Blohm writes:

“The Democrats’ Green New Deal calls for a fully renewable electric power grid. Regardless of the economic or political challenges of bringing this about, it is likely technologically impossible.

“An electric power grid involves second-by-second balancing between generated supply and consumer demand. In the case of a sudden imbalance—such as from the loss of a generator’s output—all the remaining generators on the grid instantaneously pool together. Each one pitches in a small part of the required power to make up for the lost generator fast enough to keep supply and demand balanced.

“This doesn’t work for wind and solar because you can’t spontaneously increase wind or sunshine. Hydro power is limited and unevenly distributed around the country. And for safety reasons, nuclear power—even if the Green New Dealers accepted it—can’t be cranked up to neutralize imbalances. Nor can consumer demand be suddenly reduced enough.

“Fossil-fuel turbines, by contrast, very naturally compensate for sudden supply outages. The inertia of the spinning mass of rotors provides the extra energy needed to compensate for the loss for the first few seconds. (Wind-rotor inertia is too short-lived.) Meanwhile the generators’ on-line reserve capacity kicks in, giving a rapid boost in power output to prevent the turbines from slowing down. That substitute power, called “governor response,” lasts as long as 15 minutes. During that time a single replacement generator ramps up to compensate entirely for the loss. All the turbines on the grid are thereby restored to their original speed, and the governor response is rearmed for the next disturbance.

An all-renewables grid would require prohibitively expensive battery storage to compensate for sudden power losses. Even with batteries, the lost power would have to be fed through “inverters”—a technology that converts variable-wind-speed alternating current, solar-power direct current, and battery-power direct-current into alternating current—to allow for synthetic inertia and governor response in the case of a disruption.

“But according to a 2017 report from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, if a large enough share of the power grid flows through inverters, the grid itself may collapse. Existing inverter technologies have faced serious software problems and prompted outages where they have been deployed. The IEEE is trying to create a global standard for inverter design—though heavy input by Chinese suppliers bent on commandeering the technology may pose a national-security risk if the U.S. were to incorporate the standard.

“How could the market price in the cost of providing rapid replacement energy that renewable sources can’t provide reliably? The entity that caused the outage should need to pay. Yet the power industry—to say nothing of the Green New Dealers—hasn’t given this much thought. An all-renewables power grid is destined to collapse.”

Ji won her fifth U.S. LPGA Tour title in her previous event last month, the season-opening Tournament of Champions in Florida.

She picked up right where she left off, in Chonburi.

After an opening birdie and a bogey on the third hole, Ji birdied nine out of the following 14 holes on the Siam Country Club Pattaya’s Old Course.

In her wake were Minjee Lee of Australia, Danielle Kang of the United States, and Jenny Shin of South Korea, each with a 65.

“I felt really great. I didn’t miss any fairways and missed just two greens,” Ji said. “I have a lot of confidence.

Lee was bogey free as she eagled the 15th and birdied five holes on a humid day.

“I was little bit slow starting out. I finished with three birdies on the last three holes at the front nine, and got a little bit better momentum,” Lee said.

A group of four, three strokes off the lead, included Americans Jennifer Song and Lizette Salas, Canadian Brooke Henderson, and Australian Katherine Kirk.

World No. 1 Ariya Jutanugarn, the 2013 runner-up, carded a 4 under 68, mixing an eagle and six birdies with two bogeys and a double bogey.

555,Empty,2019-02-25T08:01:47Z,"Southern Utah wasn't always a riding paradise, but as they say, if you build it, they will come. The post 2019 Bible Feature Story: Slow Roll appeared first on BIKE Magazine.","As I climbed out of a truck in Utah's Gooseberry Mesa parking lot, toothy, redrock peaks filled the view to the north and east, highlighted by the world-famous skyline of Zion National Park. I'd been told to expect a two- to three-hour ride that was rugged and technical. But perusing our flat surroundings made me skeptical.

Perhaps sensing my apprehension, Jake Weber, a retired Army combat engineer-turned guide with Utah Mountain Biking Adventures, offered a measure of reassurance. ""We get a lot of people who show up and say they want to ride 30 miles every day of their trip,"" he told me. ""But after about 15 miles on their first day, they're like, 'Yeah, we're good,' and they're ready for a beer at the trailhead.""

Welcome to the land of ""mesa miles."" Maybe you've heard of them. In short—no pun intended—they're harder than standard miles which makes them feel longer. The more you ride them, the more comfortable you get disclosing that you ""only"" rode 10 miles today and it still took two hours.

I had never ridden a mesa mile when I got to Washington County, Utah, which is well known to desert aficionados as a singletrack oasis and has hosted the world's premier freeride competition, Red Bull Rampage, off and on since 2001. Still, it remains something of a hidden gem to the rest of the riding world, in part because it's remote: four hours from Salt Lake City, six hours from Phoenix, nine hours from Denver.

St. George, the county seat and a city of roughly 90,000 people, spent decades as a retirement community for golfers and still attracts celebrities like Michael Jordan to its greens come winter. But starting around the mid 2000s, adventure took a bite out of golf's place as the area's top attraction. The number of local outfitters swelled from a dozen to more than 50. Mountain biking overtook road biking as the most popular two-wheeled pursuit. With an almost 90-percent population jump since 2000, Washington County ranks as the fastest-growing metropolitan area in America. It also has a warmer climate than its sometimes-rival, Moab, five hours to the northeast, and offers legitimate riding and 60-degree temps in the belly of winter.

On this beaming morning in early October, photographer Margus Riga and I had joined a local crew for a spin along the South Rim and through Hidden Canyon. Gooseberry, the original mesa ride and still a lot of locals' favorite mesa of the five with trails, carries an almost-mythical reputation among those who know about it. Mostly that is due to Goose's sandstone features and their surprising, albeit intimidating, ridability.

""They're like giant rock biscuits that you can just roll up onto,"" said 54-year-old Kenny Jones, who owns Gooseberry Yurts and once finished 14 straight Leadville 100s back-to-back. ""A lot of the bottom sections of the rocks have a nice, roll-y out. So they look really steep but then the tranny grabs your front wheel and gets you out of the vertical position.""

We followed Quentin Morisette, owner of Over the Edge Sports in nearby Hurricane, as he weaved between puddles in the rock—and the brine shrimp they hold, making it a no-no to ride through them—and abided by the local code not to leave tracks in the dirt. He led us to a playground that he called the Skatepark: two deep, connected bowls that mimic the flow of a purpose-built concrete bowl. From there we swooped between stands of juniper, piñon and cedar trees, as well as the mesa's namesake gooseberry bushes. After 15 minutes of wrestling our bikes up, down and over the sandstone landscape—a full-body workout that longtime local Bill Bergeron compares to ""being stuck in a cage with a gorilla""—we came upon a 20-foot-tall biscuit that looked like a soft-serve ice-cream tower. It was steep and layered, with a small drop at the entry over significant exposure. Morisette hiked to the top for the second time in his life and prepared to drop in.

The line, my riding partners explained, was not to be confused with the Wall of Considerable Consequences, which we'd pass later, or the Wall of Death, which we'd skip. Morisette rolled in, landed the initial drop and rocketed out the bottom as the rest of us filmed it with our phones. ""You've got to be kidding me!"" shouted Weber, who served two tours in Iraq and left the military after a pair of traumatic brain injuries saddled him with PTSD. Now he coaches a local high school team and rarely sees someone test the sharp end, hence his incredulous response.

Morisette let out a sly grin. ""I've been riding here for 23 years, and it just gets better,"" he said. ""When you're on the rock, the sky's the limit.""

As we continued toward Gooseberry's high point, I realized why locals pay attention to their tires' side knobs here: You need a lof of support to grip the off-camber sandstone. It helps that the trail is marked by white dots on the rock, too; otherwise it's easy to wander off track.

We pedaled over a 4-foot-wide plank to the Point, an airy perch overlooking the valley and Zion. The trail only gains 300 vertical feet from the White Trailhead (elevation: 5,100 feet above sea level) to here, but the entire ride includes about 900 feet of gain. ""It's all 10 feet at a time,"" Morisette quipped.

We ogled the old Rampage venue to the north, which includes the notorious King Kong descent, as well as Flying Monkey, a mesa across the valley where the government, legend has it, used to send furry primates down a rail propelled by a rocket at supersonic speeds to test military ejector seats.

Then we returned the way we came, back to the trailhead. Slightly under the weather, I collapsed in the gravelly shade, feeling like I'd ridden 20 miles if not more. Someone informed me it was actually less than 10. I sighed, chalked it up to the mesa effect and closed my eyes for a nap, while the others tipped back beers in the sun.

According to Washington County's GIS department, the local mountain biking scene encompasses 296 miles of mapped trails to go with a gnarliness spectrum ranging from sublime cross-country favorites like Hurricane Rim, J.E.M. and Dead Ringer, to the five local mesas and their sandstone playgrounds, to big-boy gravity lines that attract the world's best freeriders every October.

The area's rise to prominence happened neither quickly nor due to a mass movement. On the contrary, it started in late 1993 when a pair of native sons took up the sport at age 49. Twin brothers Morgan and Mike Harris had grown up in Rockville, a tiny town on the Virgin River at the mouth of Zion Canyon, but because their father forbade them from riding dirt bikes, they didn't start until they were 26. As Morgan tells it, they rode motos for 20 years, then performance ATVs for three, at which point they grew wary of the danger and turned to mountain bikes.

In the early days, Morgan rode a primitive bike with a shoddy fork. ""Boy, I went home bloody a lot,"" he chuckles. A few other locals were riding at the time, but they mainly stuck to the mellow Green Valley Loop. ""There wasn't any real anchor trail to draw people to the area,"" Harris recalls.

He and Mike used to hunt deer, coyotes and rabbits on Gooseberry Mesa, and they often heard visitors talk about slickrock riding in Moab. They knew Gooseberry contained similar features and started poking around, starting with the slab that parallels the White Road. They built a short trail through one of the mesa's mini-canyons, then found out they needed a permit. So they met with the BLM in 1994 to talk about expanding their work to the north and south rims and Hidden Canyon. ""Originally they wanted 15 cents a foot, per year, for the use of the land,"" Harris says. Then the agency softened its stance. ""They said if you can have everything completed by Trail Days of 1996, we'll do a trail dedication. We had it done, but it took them until '98 to dedicate it.""

With Gooseberry complete, the Harris brothers turned their attention to Little Creek Mountain, which they'd been staring at for years from Gooseberry. They started exploring its slabs, ancient petroglyphs and fossils (there's actually a dinosaur bone embedded in the sandstone in one spot) and potential trail corridors that didn't require slaughtering flora. After a year-and-a-half of building there—with unofficial permission from a BLM official, Harris says—the agency changed its mind and asked them to stop. So they did, again shifting to where they thought the next destination could be. In this case it was a long redrock spine that would come to be known as Church Rocks.

Mike Harris quit riding after Little Creek, leaving Morgan to continue alone. Luckily others picked up the slack, and soon enough a growing community of riders had built Guacamole, which fostered its own mini-network on the mesa including The Whole Guacamole, Holy Guacamole and Salt on the Rim.

Harris left to build trails in Nevada after constructing Holy Guacamole, and now, at age 73, he just maintains existing routes. But the foundation he and Mike laid continues to anchor the network. If you ask 20 locals to name their favorite trail, like I did, you could get 15 different answers. The scene now includes a 100-mile race—True Grit, held every March in St. George—and a respected advocacy organization, the Dixie Mountain Bike Trails Association (DMBTA), which was launched in 2010 by True Grit founder Cimarron Chacon. ('Dixie' is a common moniker in Washington County because the early settlers grew cotton, which led to the area being known as 'Utah's Dixie.')

DMBTA only counts about 75 official members, but more than 2,000 people follow the organization on social media, ""and a lot of them come out to our volunteer days,"" says club president Kevin Christopherson. Others hand him money on the trails, even if they're not from the area. In addition, the Rampage organizers have donated about $14,000 to DMBTA each of the past two years.

The roots and robust support keep the area on the broader map, attracting riders from around the world—with a healthy dose of freeriders each spring, an influx that Morisette affectionately calls the Canadian Invasion. The key to providing such a reliable product when so many other destinations in the region cannot, he says, is the geography. Just north of Hurricane, Interstate 15 goes from 3,500 feet in elevation to above 5,000 and stays there, which places Zion on the northern edge of viable winter and early spring riding.

Although a lot of local rides, particularly the mesas, require driving a fair distance to park at a trailhead, not everywhere does. One of the guys we rode Gooseberry with, a diehard XC fanatic named Josh Wolfe, lives in St. George and doesn't own a car. We bumped into him the next morning in the nondescript parking lot for Zen and Barrel Ride, just over a dirt mound from St. George's subdivisions and commercial sprawl. We had just finished up an ambitious combo ride in a group of eight.

Wolfe was on his way out for a midday loop, and after our morning figure-eight on Zen and Barrel, I understood why he lives so close to these trails. Zen features the kind of ledgy, technical terrain that makes your forearms cramp. Kenny Jones called it a ""rim-basher trail,"" and halfway through our descent it delivered. Jake Miller, a Red Rock ambassador and standout local rider, buckled an $1,800 carbon wheel in two places without crashing. Despite its ride-from-home proximity to a city of 90,000, you still feel like you're away from the hectic rush of civilization when you reach the top. Then the real fun begins. Both Riga, who lives in Vancouver and calls the North Shore home, and I deemed it our favorite trail of the week.

We continued on to the freeride-friendly Barrel from there, led by longtime St. George rider Bryce Pratt, who built it 15 years ago, and Mitchell Curwen, who recently refurbished it and added some features. ""If you want to see what a bike can do, this is a great place to take it,"" Curwen said as we pedaled up a wash toward the top. Pratt designed the trail to snake through a series of barrel cactuses, which look like stunted pony kegs with 3-inch-long thorns.

I followed a mother of three named Angie Anderson down the Waterfall, an aptly named chunky section that serves as Barrel's crux, if you don't count the jumps below. Some of those jumps dropped blindly off of giant boulders into perfectly sculpted transitions. Others were gaps, including one over a creek. Everything seemed to flow just as it should until we were back at the parking lot.

""Doing Zen and Barrel in the same day is a big day. They're probably our two most technical trails in St. George City,"" Curwen said. ""If you can get out of here without a broken bike part or broken body part, that's a win.""

Victorious, Riga and I returned to St. George later that afternoon to check out the Snake Hollow St. George Bike Park—the newest addition to the area's stable of radness. Built on 80 acres of city-owned land through a collaboration between DMBTA, the Southern Utah Bicycle Alliance and the Washington County Tourism Office, the facility was funded by $1.6 million in tax dollars and was slated to open the month after our visit. But there were already dozens of kids testing it out after school. This winter, city workers and volunteers are planning to add a 5.5-mile NICA racecourse through the lava field on the lot's southern end. According to county tourism director Kevin Lewis, it will be the only year-round bike park in Utah.

The most recent addition to Washington County's singletrack menu arrived two years ago when DMBTA finished a 7-mile intermediate loop on Wire Mesa. In its first year of existence, trail counters recorded 16,000 visitors—or an average of 44 a day. It's close to Gooseberry and Grafton mesas, so you'd expect it to see traffic, but the number still quantified the area's growing renown. (In total, 178,000 people rode BLM trails around Washington County last year, including 30,000 on Gooseberry.)

The numbers are a far cry from when Morgan Harris broached the idea of a Gooseberry trail to the BLM 25 years ago. ""At that first meeting, they said, 'Being that remote, 7-and-a-half miles off the highway, you're probably only going to see 36 riders a month, at most,'"" Harris recalled. Within three years of Gooseberry's trails being open, the local bike shop owners told Harris they'd seen a 60-percent increase in sales. Five years later, when Harris' fork fell apart, Zion Cycles founder Fred Pagles gave him a new Trek Remedy and free service and parts for life. When Harris protested, Pagles said: ""If you hadn't done what you did, I wouldn't have a business.""

There is still a touch of uncertainty about what will happen to unofficial trails on BLM land that have become wildly popular and mapped, like Little Creek and Dig It on Grafton Mesa. A long-in-the-works travel management plan is nearing completion, and locals are optimistic the BLM will bring them into the fold and declare them legal, since closing them would be more complicated and potentially hurt the area's economic growth.

But whatever happens, the local scene is plenty healthy, as evidenced by a recent show of support for Harris after he was diagnosed with gum cancer. In mid-May, Harris underwent surgery to remove a tumor, and doctors removed his fibula from his lower right leg and used it to rebuild his jaw. Locals held a fundraiser to help cover his medical bills, bringing in nearly $25,000. Over the Edge built a new Ibis Mojo HD for Harris to ride into his 80s. At a post-ride barbecue in October, Harris said he still didn't have the leg power to ride technical terrain, as much as he wanted to.

Instead, he had been maintaining trails he built a generation ago. ""I get out there at daylight and get done before it gets too hot,"" he said. ""Me and the dog, Hazel."" His tools were hidden in the bushes as he spoke.

I asked Harris what he thinks of the community that he and his brother helped to create. ""It amazes me what's happened here,"" he said. ""When I was building trail, I never expected any payback. Payback was people having a smile on their face, loving what you built. I can't believe this came out of us wanting to ride a trail on Gooseberry.""

RIDE: Although most trails are on MTB Project, for a more localized resource check out swutahtrails.com, a brand-new, one-stop tool for trail descriptions, photos and videos with downloadable maps and GPS navigation. Trails are sorted into geographical zones to showcase the various regions throughout the county.

STAY: You'll find ample lodging options throughout the county via Google. We stayed at a rental house in Sand Hollow Resort, which suited our large group well and was convenient to both Hurricane and St. George. You can also check out Gooseberry Yurts for a more primitive, adventurous option—with four days' worth of riding from your front door. The 20-foot-diameter yurts sleep five to seven adults and cost $150 a night.

EAT: Again, options abound, but you can't go wrong with Lonny Boy's BBQ in Hurricane, George's Corner Restaurant in St. George and the Bit and Spur Restaurant and Saloon in Springdale. Affogato is a worthy coffee shop in St. George, while River Rock Roasting Co., in La Verkin, serves tasty food and everything from coffee to beer on the edge of a canyon carved by the Virgin River.

SHOP: Over the Edge Sports in Hurricane treated our team well, whether that meant providing TLC to the day's testing steeds each evening, sharing local beta on where to ride or leading the way on hard-to-follow loops (OTE also runs a free shop ride every Saturday, which is a great way to see the area's nooks and crannies).

Like most grandmothers, she never wrote down the recipe. After she died I kept a lookout for it at Chinese restaurants, hoping it would pop up on a menu. So far no luck. With the GTA rife with restaurants reflecting our diverse population, I had to believe I’m not the only one in this situation. There have to be other people like me, with favourite lesser known culinary gems that haven’t found their way on to menus, yet. So I sent a shout out to readers asking for dishes they enjoy at home and haven’t yet seen on a restaurant menu. The responses were overwhelming. Readers had me salivating at descriptions of Bajan flying fish and coucou (cornmeal and okra), Portuguese tripe and pig ear salad, Scottish clootie dumpling (dessert pudding), Thai yen ta fo (noodle soup in a tangy and spicy broth), Greek pastitsio (baked pasta with ground beef and bechamel), Norwegian pinnekjott (salted and smoked lamb or mutton), and Austrian Zwetschgenknödel (potato dumplings stuffed with plums). Italians chimed in with specific regional specialties from pizzoccheri, a short tagliatelle made with buckwheat flour in northern Italy, to pasta e ceci, ditalini pasta cooked with chickpeas in Rome. Here’s a snapshot of well-loved dishes we hope to see on restaurant menus someday.

People in neighbouring towns can make the same dish and have vastly different results due to varying techniques passed down from families. Assenza is from a proud Sicilian family from the city of Modica, famous for its scaccia. This savoury hand-held stuffed flatbread consists of a thin hand-rolled dough repeatedly folded on top of assorted fillings, then baked to a delicate crispness. Assenza comes from a long line of cooks carrying on old culinary traditions. Her mother Grace Occhipinti was featured in a 1976 Star article about how to roll out pasta by hand. “Our grandmother lived with us and whenever there was a school dance she’d ask us to stay home and make cookies, so I learned how to cook early on from my mother and grandmother. The key to our scaccia is folding the dough three times, rather than sandwiching two layers like a sandwich. The secret is also in the dough, it’s delicate like a very thin pizza crust. It’s a very comforting food that’s made at Christmas Eve and at Easter after church. My cousin Assunta Gintoli is 81 and she’s the queen of making scaccia. She makes her own tomato sauce in September and goes through 30 bushels of tomatoes, makes her own ricotta and sausages for the stuffing, and bakes them on the same pan she’s been using for the last 50, 60 years. In Modica there are scaccia places everywhere like McDonald’s here. You can make them different ways and fill them with cheeses, herbs, vegetables and tomato sauce but historically not often meat because it was expensive. It’s definitely a regional dish.”

Sephardi Dolmades De Tomatoes E Biber (Sephardi-style Tomatoes stuffed with Rice) Most diners know about dolmades, grape leaves stuffed with rice popularized through Greek cuisine in Toronto but the dolmades from Regina Callaghan’s family are different — tomatoes are the vessel of choice for the rice stuffing. The 65-year-old Scarborough resident originally from Istanbul and raised in a Jewish household says her family’s cooking is a mix of Turkish, Jewish and Spanish, partly due to the Spanish Inquisition in which thousands were prosecuted for not following Catholicism in Europe and the reason her family fled to Turkey. “My parents and myself were born in Istanbul while my brother was born here after we immigrated in 1958. When the Spanish Inquisition was happening, the eastern countries were offering asylum and that’s how our ancestors arrived in Istanbul in the 1400s. Our recipes are influenced by what was available in Turkey but they had a Spanish-Jewish spin on it. It’s very weird but very delicious. Dolmades refer to anything that’s stuffed and if it’s made with rice, they’re served at room temperature. If it’s with meat, they’re served hot. My mom cooked them by feel and taste but my sister-in-law sat down with her 10 years ago and measured everything out to make a recipe. We’re not practising Jews but when my parents passed we reconnected with the Sephardi community (Jewish people with ancestral roots in Spain) but I don’t know anyone who really makes that dish. My girls are going to make it, and that’s how it’s going to live on.” Caribbean Chicken Souse (Citrusy chicken soup) Torontonian Janelle Hinds still remembers her first bite of chicken feet while visiting family in Trinidad nearly 20 years ago. She immediately fell in love with the chicken souse, a refreshing soup of chicken feet (also commonly prepared with other parts of the bird) simmered in a light broth loaded with vegetables, allspice, plenty of lime juice and chilies. With roots in the Bahamas, the dish is often prepared on weekends as a hangover cure, but it’s something the entire family enjoys nonetheless. “Chicken souse was always that one dish that I couldn’t find in the GTA. My mother is from Trinidad and I remember being down there as a kid for Carnival. We were in a small town having a pre-celebration and someone handed me this cup with a chicken foot in it. I was hesitant but I tried it and it was so good I had seconds and thirds. It’s a soup that’s cooling because there’s cucumber and there’s also a bit of pepper in it because Trini people can’t live without peppers. I’m 26 now and I’m still trying to recreate what I had when I was 7, but I just can’t make it like they do it down there so I’m looking on Yelp, restaurant menu sites, anything that would help me find a restaurant in the GTA that serves it. I don’t know why I just didn’t ask one of my family members in Trinidad to send me a recipe, but for now I think I’ll just ask someone to make it for me cause it’s hard to recreate something I had that long ago.” Quebecois Macaroni and Tomato Juice

Article Continued Below

When it comes to French-Canadian cooking most think of tourtière or poutine, but one dish that’s popular in Quebecois households is macaroni tossed with tomato juice (Google macaroni au jus de tomate to find recipes on Quebecois food sites). Some add ground beef while most versions add cheese, onion, garlic and herbs. For the most part it’s cooked pasta tossed in tomato juice — not a marinara or bolognese — but straight-up tomato juice from a can. It’s a dish mostly associated with poor families, but Toronto-based genealogist Wanda Sinclair, 61, says she’s been eating it since she was a kid and now makes it whenever she babysits for her grandniece and nephew. “My mother got us on it, and I see on Facebook that my relatives have made it. It seemed our grandmother made it too. My maternal grandmother is Scottish but my maternal grandfather’s mother is French-Canadian and his father was born in Quebec. His family dates back to the 1600s there. You boil the macaroni, strain it, put it back in the pan, pour in tomato juice, then heat it up. I can add ground meat on top or a hard cheese like cheddar and then I put it in the oven. I don’t like anything with sauce but I’ll eat spaghetti with tomato juice. ” North Indian Rajma (red kidney bean curry) The GTA has a range of Indian restaurants highlighting the country’s vast culinary offerings be it region specific, fine-dining or street-food focused as well as a mix of old and new recipes reinterpreted by a new generation of cooks. But rajma is one dish Ryerson University journalism student Dhriti Gupta, 18, says she seldom sees at restaurants. It’s a red kidney bean curry with roots in northern India. “I was born in New Delhi and that’s where my mom and dad grew up and my family still lives. Since then, because of my dad’s job as a chartered accountant we’ve moved to Houston, San Francisco, Calgary, Edmonton, back to Calgary and then Toronto. But no matter where we moved, rajma was always my staple. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why I like it, but something about it is very nostalgic and I never had any rajma as good as my mom’s. She uses cardamom, cilantro and cumin, which is a common spice makeup but I noticed she also puts cinnamon in it. It’s a north Indian food where a lot of dishes are really rich and creamy, the food of the royals. I’m not sure why it didn’t catch on in restaurants because there are a lot of similar dishes like dhal makhani. Maybe rajma wasn’t fancy enough. I guess in North America it’s like a chili because of the red kidney beans and it’s slow-cooked in a tomato base. My mom actually once entered her rajma in a chili cooking competition and won!” Chinese Steamed Three Eggs (savoury egg custard with salted duck egg and thousand-year egg) Almost every Chinese family will have some form of a savoury steamed egg dish: egg whisked with a bit of water then mixed with anything including ground pork and pickled greens before it’s steamed in a little dish. Torontonian Jonathan Chant, 35, says his mom makes a version popular with many Chinese households that uses three types of egg: regular eggs as a base then topped with salted duck eggs and thousand-year eggs — eggs preserved in an alkaline mixture. “My parents immigrated from Hong Kong separately and I was the first child born in Toronto. When I was 3, we moved to Thunder Bay, then Leamington and then back to Toronto for university. Growing up in Thunder Bay, we didn’t have access to as many Chinese restaurants as in Toronto so most of the Chinese food I ate was made by my mom. At school I definitely got my share of teasing even from my so-called friends about my lunches but for whatever reason I always thought the hot lunches she made were better than the sandwiches they ate. One of my favourite dishes is the steamed eggs. My mom mixes ground pork and chicken eggs then pours them into a dish. She then places a whole salted duck egg yolk right in the middle. Finally, she spreads diced thousand-year eggs around the salted duck egg yolk before steaming it. The Jell-O-like softness of the ground meat and steamed eggs combined with the taste of the thousand-year old egg is what draws me to it. This dish is good on its own, or mixed with rice and a bit of soy sauce. I might have it once a year now when I see my parents. My mom thought that restaurants probably don’t make it because the steaming process might take too long, and it’s not something you can make ahead of time.” Bengali Pork Sausage (Indian-spiced sausages) Pork isn’t a popular ingredient in the Indian subcontinent but in the city of Kolkata located in the state of West Bengal, the famous Entally Market is known for its Anglo-Indian offerings such as pork sausages that cater to the local Catholics (this was where Mother Teresa spent most of her life). You probably won’t see pork sausages in most Indian and Bangladeshi restaurants in the GTA, but for Brampton resident Henry Gomes, 26, it’s been a family favourite for generations. “I was born in Dubai but my dad was born in Kolkata and my mom was born in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. Ethnically we’re Bengali but we’re also Catholic and consume pork. We moved to Canada in 1996 and my Uncle Luke thought it would be fun to take up making the sausages in the summer when the mint came up in the back garden. We first used this hand-crank machine but now we have a KitchenAid mixer with the sausage attachment to make things easier. My parents and I alternate between grinding the fresh pork; making the spice mixture that includes onion, garlic, ginger, green chilies, nutmeg, cloves and fresh mint; feeding the machine and stuffing the casings, which we get from an Italian butcher shop. To prepare them, you simply poach them in simmering water, followed by a quick fry in a skillet along with some parboiled potatoes. They’re served alongside rice and daal (as are most Bengali dishes). A spicy mango achar (pickle) is a good condiment to serve with them, though I usually reach for a bottle of Frank’s Red Hot Sauce while my sister prefers ketchup. The sausages are really delicious, but that’s only half the appeal. During our annual sausage-making day, I can’t help but think of my late Uncle Luke who revived the tradition in our family. They’re a unique way to connect with my identity as a Bengali-Catholic with roots in both India and Bangladesh, who currently lives in a suburb of a city often called Hogtown!” Karon Liu is the Star’s food writer and is based in Toronto.

558,Empty,2019-02-22T16:00:00Z,"OPINION: The leaky homes scandal was an education in mismanagement on a grand scale, writes Andrew Bydder.","OPINION: Thank you to all the readers who give great feedback on these columns. Your stories of your own battles with bureaucracy motivate me to keep writing. Suggestions for topics are always welcome, although I have quite a backlog already.

After I touched on untreated timber a couple of weeks ago, several people asked for me to expand on leaky buildings. It is a woe-begotten tale of mismanagement on a grand scale.

In 1996, the Commission of Inquiry into leaky buildings of the previous decade bemoaned ""a loss of collective memory, and lack of conventional wisdom, among inspectors, architects, engineers, developers, and contractors regarding the requirements for effective building"".

""Hang on"" the astute reader may ask, ""wasn't the problem in the period from 1998 to 2003?""

The National Party had been under pressure from the Greens because timber treatment uses some particularly nasty chemicals (such as arsenic) that could be bad for the environment. Untreated timber was allowed to be used for house framing on 28 February 1998, until the Building Industry Authority issued a directive on 9 March 2003, re-introducing treatment for all consents.

The Commission of Inquiry mentioned above was the Canadian inquiry. They had a massive and highly publicised problem. Sure, this was the era before Google, so research took more than a mouse click, but the most basic due diligence a government should carry out prior to changing regulations would be to check what other countries' experiences have been. New Zealand blindly copied a known disaster.

The blame doesn't lie solely with untreated timber. Town planners with no construction experience started using roof area instead of floor area, measuring boundary dimensions to roof lines instead of walls, and setting arbitrary height limits – all because it meant more resource consents would be needed.

Developers responded with the infamous ""Mediterranean style"", totally unsuited to our climate conditions, with flat roofs and no overhangs allowing them to squeeze the most building space into the rules.

Post-disaster, planners actually returned to rules that reflected the needs of the building industry to some extent. But after a decade, I started to see an influx of the same rules and interpretations that created so many problems. It seems we don't learn from history.

Most architects, including myself, had trained at Auckland University, where the Architecture School was split into petty factions, many staff had no practical experience, and it was greater ""status"" to teach theory than technical skills. In short, the education was negligent and the qualification just about worthless for anything outside of academia. It took ten years to teach myself to be competent for the sort of complicated buildings we were designing.

The standard of drawings given to builders was not good enough for the high-risk details that were required.

The dismantling of apprenticeships meant young chippies and tradies were unleashed on buildings without the experience to work through difficult projects. In earlier times, skilled main contractors would be on site to check and coordinate work, but a new breed of project managers were saving clients money by tendering out each trade separately, with no supervision of specialist skills on the actual project. I set up my own practice primarily so I could refuse projects that involved working with them.

Product suppliers, such as a certain Australian firm, happily sold materials that were simply not suitable for what, where, and how they were being used. Some claddings

relied on nothing more than a coat of paint at every joint to keep water out. It was never going to last.

Helen Clark's Labour Party responded to the disaster by disbanding the Building Industry Authority – the government agency that was the ultimate regulator of the construction system. This was a cynical ploy to remove the government from liability as the BIA could no longer get sued.

Instead, the liability was dumped on councils. Building inspectors had probably the smallest part to play in the debacle. They had no say over the design, did not carry out the faulty workmanship, and were not present during most of the construction.

By tradition, they checked some basic structural, fire, and plumbing issues, as accepted by the BIA and courts up until then. Their processes failed to change with the times, and the courts retrospectively decided that building inspectors should have done more. Their employers - the councils, and therefore the ratepayers, had to shoulder a small proportion of the responsibility.

There is a grossly unfair legal principle that is applied to construction projects called ""joint and several liability"". It exists mainly to ensure lawyers make money by always having someone to sue. That small proportion of responsibility meant councils were jointly liable for the whole thing. When problems arose, building firms went bust, and councils were the ""last man standing"".

The courts reached deep into ratepayers' pockets. You, the public, ended up paying for the damage, while most perpetrators never paid a cent.

Along with many others in the architecture profession, I have lobbied hard to change the law to ""proportional liability"" for leaky buildings and any other problems. We should each take our fair share of responsibility, and limit councils' exposure to their small share. Government legal advisers have resisted.

I would like to see all councils join together with building professionals and ratepayers' associations to promote this at the national level on behalf of ratepayers.
