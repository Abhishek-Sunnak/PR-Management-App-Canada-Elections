0,Empty,2019-02-23T11:00:00Z,The country offers a cautionary tale about democracy and voting rights.,"Some of the evacuees expressed anger at the discomforts of the trip: long queues at the Beirut waterfront; crowded ships that lacked air-conditioning. A Toronto TV station quoted one man: “It’s a humiliation. Is this because we are of Arab origin? The government said ‘trust us’ and this is the trust I put in them?” It soon became public knowledge—although this, too, was never officially confirmed—that nearly half of the evacuees returned home to Lebanon within the month.

Comments like that did not sit well with many people back in Canada. Some politicians and commentators began to speak of “Canadians of convenience”: people who lived permanently abroad, did not pay Canadian taxes, and remembered their Canadian citizenship only when they needed rescue.

As a partial step to addressing these complaints, the government took steps to tighten rules about expatriate citizenship. It began for the first time to seriously enforce the ban on voting by long-term expatriates, people who had lived outside Canada for five years or longer. As Canada headed into a federal election in 2011 under the new rules, two expatriate Canadians filed a lawsuit to demand restoration of their voting rights. That litigation wended its way through the judicial system. In January 2019, the Supreme Court of Canada pronounced an answer: All Canadian citizens may vote in Canadian elections, no matter how long they have lived outside the country. The text of the decision would seem to apply even to those Canadian citizens who have never lived in Canada at all, or who have acquired nationality in another country.

Even before the decision, the Liberal government of Justin Trudeau had moved ahead with legislation. I number among those supposedly benefited by the new legislation. In November 2018, I testified to the Canadian Senate against it.

My advice went unheeded, obviously. Yet it’s still worth thinking together: How is democracy supposed to work in a world of dissolving national boundaries and proliferating dual, triple, and quadruple citizenships?

Perhaps you think of Canada as an immigration magnet, but Canada also exports people in large numbers: perhaps 2.8 million people, or about 9 percent of the country’s population. (In contrast, only about 9 million nonmilitary Americans live abroad, or less than 3 percent of the U.S. population.)

Naturalized Canadians are three times as likely to live outside Canada as native-born Canadians, according to the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada. About 24 percent of immigrants from Hong Kong return to the territory after acquiring Canadian citizenship, as do 30 percent of immigrants from Taiwan.

You can see the appeal. Hong Kong’s economy is growing much faster than Canada’s. Its income-tax rates top out at 17 percent. Canada does not tax the foreign-source income of nonresident citizens, in effect creating a geopolitical arbitrage opportunity too attractive to miss: the protections of Canadian nationality at low Hong Kong prices.",What Does It Mean to Be a Canadian Citizen?,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/should-expats-always-be-able-vote-home-country/583318/

DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Jagmeet Singh faces the biggest test of his NDP leadership in a by-election on Monday as he vies for a seat in the House of Commons.

The Burnaby South vote in the Vancouver region is one of three by-elections taking place on Monday, with others north of Toronto and in Montreal. The votes come just six months before campaigning is likely to officially begin for the general federal election.

Much is at stake for Mr. Singh, who was elected leader of the NDP in the fall of 2017 on a decisive first-ballot victory. Previous NDP leader Tom Mulcair said in January that it would be difficult for Mr. Singh to stay on as leader if he loses Burnaby South. Mr. Singh at the time insisted he would lead the NDP this fall regardless of the by-election result. The 40-year-old has struggled at times as party leader: He has been criticized for low poll numbers and poor fundraising.

Brad Lavigne, who helped orchestrate Jack Layton’s orange wave in 2011 as NDP campaign chief, said on Sunday that a victory in the by-election would be essential to unite the NDP.

Mr. Lavigne said Mr. Singh has poured considerable personal energy into the riding, through extensive door-knocking and meetings with constituents. The riding has voted NDP in the past on a federal and provincial level. The B.C. NDP dominated Burnaby when John Horgan was elected in 2017, and on Saturday the Premier on Twitter called on voters to get to the polls to back Mr. Singh.

The Burnaby South contest has been turbulent. The Liberals’ first candidate, Karen Wang, stepped down after a social media post on the social messaging app WeChat that zeroed in on Mr. Singh’s ethnicity and highlighted that she was only candidate of Chinese ethnicity. A recent all-candidates’ debate became heated on issues of race and immigration.

Richard T. Lee is the new Liberal candidate. Jay Shin is running for the Conservatives. Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson represents the upstart People’s Party of Canada. The Greens chose not to run a candidate against Mr. Singh.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced criticism last fall for delaying a by-election call after the NDP’s Kennedy Stewart vacated the Burnaby South seat in September to become the mayor of Vancouver.

Mr. Singh said voters are “very disappointed” in Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal government.

“It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation,” said Mr. Singh, referring to the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Story continues below advertisement

Political scientist Richard Johnston at the University of British Columbia said the SNC-Lavalin case could be a “gift” for Mr. Singh, because it could turn some potential Liberal voters to the NDP.

David Moscrop, a political scientist at the University of Ottawa, said it is unclear whether Mr. Singh should stay on as leader of the NDP if he lost.

“There’s this assumption that if he lost the by-election, he couldn’t show his face in the general election. I don’t think Canadians would really care,” Mr. Moscrop said. “The NDP caucus might see things differently.”

In 2015, the NDP barely won Burnaby South, as the Liberals had a strong showing in the province when Mr. Trudeau swept to power. Mr. Stewart, who had won a close race in Burnaby-Douglas in 2011, won 35.1 per cent of the vote in Burnaby South, ahead of the Liberals’ 33.9 per cent. The margin was 547 votes. The Conservatives had 27.1 per cent of the vote.

The Burnaby-South riding is an amalgam of two older ridings, the southern half of Burnaby-Douglas – where the NDP had a long, but narrow, hold on power federally – and the western half of Burnaby-New Westminster – where the NDP had a long, and mostly dominant, hold on power federally.

Germany's Alternative For Germany (AfD) party (previously) are an insurgent neofascist movement with ties to senior mainstream politicians and the country's super-wealthy would-be oligarchs; the party put on a hard push in the the 2018 Bavarian elections and their meme warfare was full of familiar voter-suppression tactics, from garden-variety disinformation to exhortations to stay home on election day.

Also prominent in the group's messaging: hashtags and tropes from the US far-right conspiracy theory Qanon (previously), an incoherent toxic stew of antisemitism, murder accusations, numerology, Islamophobia, and other pathologies of the moment.

The connection between Qanon and AfD comes from an unreleased report from the London School of Economics-affiliated Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which bills itself as an ""anti-extremist think tank""; some details of the study have been reported in the German and US press.

The researchers traced the inclusion of Qanon-affiliated hashtags in AfD social media, including German translations and adaptations of popular Qanon tags (e.g. #linksliegenlassen, #MerkelMussWeg); as with the US-based Qanon activists, the German Qanon phenomenon was driven by small numbers of incredibly prolific social media users -- not bots (Erin Gallagher's research found that Qanon tweeters posting 500+ messages/day were often ""older retired people with a lot of free time"").

There's evidence that US-based Qanon activists forged alliances with German neofascists; some popular fascist hashtags (""#ChemnitzIstDerAnfang"") originated with US Qanon accounts.

Qanon is becoming a kind of ideological signifier among far-right groups: members of the far-right who have adopted the yellow vest for street demonstrations in Canada and the UK have been spotted decorating the vests with Qanon memes and carrying Qanon-boosting signs. Qanon networks have also been used to boost the virality of racist videos.

I think far-right extremism is the intersection of garden-variety bigotry/xenophobia with economic precarity and a breakdown of the epistemological consensus about what constitutes a reliable indicator that something is true.

Xenophobia and bigotry are always around, but they surge when people feel afraid for their overall economic circumstances, and that surge has been supercharged by decades of both scientific denialism (well-funded campaigns to sow doubt about the motives of climate scientists, doctors who warn of the link between smoking and cancer, etc) and corruption -- for example, anti-vax builds on the assertion that experts have corrupt motives and that regulators are so captured that they let them get away with murder. The thing is, regulators really are that captured.

I can't say for sure that a more equitable economic system -- which would cut off the resources used by corporate influences to distort policy, and by ideological entrepreneurs to push expensive, profitable scientific denial -- would neutralize the far-right, but I think it's worth a try.

The crossover between QAnon and far-right German movements like the Chemnitz riots makes sense. Both movements are aggressively anti-Muslim and anti-refugee. And both make vague gestures toward a right-wing revolution. “At the time I got the impression that some people thought Chemnitz was going to be ‘Germany's great awakening,’” Gallagher said, referencing QAnon’s promise of a “great awakening” in America. It’s a trend she’s previously observed, as America’s alt-right moved on to trolling on behalf of their counterparts in Europe after Trump’s victory in 2016. “I've noticed crossover of US alt-right networks with European alt-right for a long time,” she said. “How QAnon fits into all that is a great question, but the international alt-right coordinated swarms—QAnon related or not—do not surprise me.”

Juan Guaidó, the Venezuelan parliament leader who many countries now recognize as the country’s interim president, has worked with the U.S. government to bring millions of dollars worth of aid to the country, where a humanitarian crisis has driven millions to the edge of starvation and forced more than 3 million people – one tenth of the population – to flee. Trucks and warehouses filled with food, medicine and other supplies now sit at several locations just outside the country – in the Colombian border city of Cúcuta, at points along the southern border with Brazil and on the nearby island of Curaçao.

But Maduro, who has refused to abandon the presidency and retains the support of Venezuela’s powerful military, is refusing to let the aid in. He says it is an attempt “to humiliate the Venezuelan people” and has labelled the food “carcinogenic.” On Wednesday he banned all travel to Curaçao and on Thursday closed the border with Brazil. There, soldiers opened fire on civilians who tried to reopen it to get the aid in, killing two indigenous people.

Despite all that, Guaidó has promised the aid will get into Venezuela “one way or another” by Saturday. As aid amasses on the border and Maduro’s military prepares to face-off with Guaidó supporters, here’s what to know about the stand-off:

Why do Venezuelans need humanitarian aid?

Venezuela’s current crisis dates back to its Socialist Revolution in 1998, led by Maduro’s predecessor and mentor Hugo Chávez, who was elected on a platform of eliminating poverty. For years he used Venezuela’s vast oil wealth (the country has the largest proven reserves in the world) to fund expansive social programs, such as subsidized utilities and free health care and education.

But both Chávez and Maduro also presided over widespread corruption and economic mismanagement. The government structured Venezuela’s economy to focus on oil revenues and importing food in order to benefit the military and political elite, which controls both sectors, says Diego Moya-Ocampos, a Venezuela expert at risk analysts IHS Markit.

“They started to generate a crisis, where the country was producing less and less,” he says, adding that the country produces only around 20% of the food it needs. “These shortages have been common in Venezuela for many years now.”

Things got dramatically worse in 2014, when a drop in global oil prices meant the government had less cash to import food. At the same time, falling investor confidence in the country sent the value of Venezuela’s currency, the Bolívar, into free fall. Since then acute shortages of food and other imported goods have lead to widespread hunger, with the average Venezuelan losing 24 pounds in 2017. The lack of basic medicine has crippled the health system. People with chronic illnesses can’t access treatment, and diseases like measles and malaria, previously wiped out, have surged.

Determined to maintain his grip on power, Maduro has grown increasingly authoritarian, sidelining the opposition-held parliament, replacing judges on the supreme court, repressing protests with violence, and imprisoning political opponents.

Who is trying to bring aid into Venezuela?

Guaidó, the 35 year-old leader of an opposition party, claims that Maduro won his second term in May 2018 in rigged elections. Because of this, Guaidó says, the constitution mandates that he, as the head of parliament, take charge to call new elections.

The U.S., along with most other Western democracies, quickly recognized Guaidó as interim president after his inauguration ceremony on Jan. 23 and the Trump Administration has vowed to help him take power. They also answered his call for humanitarian assistance, with National Security Adviser John Bolton pledging $20 million of aid. Canada, Germany and others have also contributed.

Colombia, which has dealt with an influx of over a million desperate Venezuelan refugees, is helping to coordinate efforts to get the aid in. Meanwhile, British billionaire Richard Branson has helped to organize a massive pop concert at the Tienditas bridge near Cúcuta on Friday and Saturday, featuring some of Latin America’s most famous acts, to raise money for more supplies. Maduro has organized his own rival concert on the other side of the border.

U.N. agencies, along with the Red Cross and Catholic charity Cáritas, have refused to help bring aid in, saying that it is too political a move for neutral aid groups to join in. “The action of the Red Cross is based on two principles: humanity and neutrality. Neutrality is the most important one in situations like this,” Francesco Rocca, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies told CNN.

Will the aid get in?

Though Guaidó has pledged to get the supplies into Venezuela by Saturday, it is far from clear that he will be able to do so, because the military is enforcing Maduro’s blockade.

The military used oil tankards to close off the main road bridge to Cúcuta in Colombia. On Thursday night, the Venezuelan national guard blocked the path of a convoy of buses transporting opposition members of parliament participating in the aid efforts. Many fear the next few days will see more violent clashes between the armed forces and Guaidó supporters, like the one at the Brazilian border.

The military’s continued support for the regime in the face of the humanitarian and political crisis can be explained by the comfortable life top generals have enjoyed under him. The regime has given the military control over imports, oil and other industries, and also allowed them to take part in a widespread corruption and organized crime.

“Corruption has corroded the entire institution, all along chain of command, and the counterintelligence agency has kept track of who is involved in what,” Raul Gallegos, a political analyst based in Bogotá, told TIME last month. “We cannot readily expect the security forces to respond the way any other institution would under similar pressure.”

Will the aid help topple Maduro?

Whatever happens, though, the stand-off will undermine Maduro’s grip on power, Moya-Ocampos says. “If he manages to block the aid, it will be clear he is out of touch with the population’s need,” he says. “If it enters, it will show he no longer controls the security apparatus – either way he looks weaker and weaker.”

The international community is hoping that the spectacle of badly-needed aid piled up on the border will prompt the lower ranks of the military to rebel against the high command, either by allowing the supplies in, or even by abandoning their support for Maduro entirely.

Moya-Ocampos says the showdown over aid will be the start, not the end, of fundamental change in Venezuela. “It might not happen immediately, but this episode is going to start off a process of division inside the armed forces, which I do think is irreversible.”

5,Empty,2019-02-21T11:05:05Z,A new poll also shows Canadians have little or no confidence that social media companies can prevent foreign entities from interfering in the election. View Entire Post ›,"BuzzFeed News and the The Toronto Star are investigating the ways in which political parties, third-party pressure groups, foreign powers, and individuals are influencing Canada’s political debate in the run-up to this fall’s federal election. This is the second report. The first report can be found here.

A clear majority of Canadians believe foreign governments — including its closest international ally — will attempt to “influence” the country's 2019 federal election.

New polling conducted by Abacus Data and released exclusively to BuzzFeed News and the Toronto Star shows 60% of Canadians believe it’s likely foreign governments will try to influence the results of this October’s general election.

Where do most expect that influence to come from? Canada’s closest neighbour and ally, the United States.

Most respondents (69%) said it was either moderately, highly, or very highly likely the US would attempt to influence the election, rating it as likely as interference from China.

Abacus CEO David Coletto said that Canadians recognize the US has as much interest in Canadian affairs as Beijing.

“The US has an interest in making sure that our government aligns closely with them as our number one trading partner and security partner, but I think [Canadians] also recognize other global powers are also looking to influence our allies and alliances as well.”

Russia, which has been accused of active interference in multiple western democratic elections including the 2016 U.S. presidential, followed with 65% of respondents perceiving them as a threat.

“Influence” covers everything from a public endorsement — or a 140-character presidential put-down — to more serious clandestine activity.

The Abacus online poll was conducted between Jan. 30 and Feb. 5, with 2,500 Canadians aged 18 and over. Abacus put the margin of error at plus or minus two percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

In 2017, Canada’s electronic intelligence agency warned parliamentarians that they expect it’s “very likely” hackers will target Canada during the 2019 election.

While the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) said it's yet to observe hostile nations attempting to influence Canada’s domestic politics, it’s not a given they won’t in an election year. And the agency is expected to release an updated threat assessment in the coming weeks.

CSE is one of several law enforcement, intelligence and civilian agencies that have been tasked with safeguarding the 2019 vote, including detecting hostile nations’ attempt to meddle in the election.

According to Abacus’ data, Canadians are largely confident that the federal government is up to that task. A full 66% of respondents said they were somewhat or very confident in Ottawa’s ability to prevent “interference” in the federal election, while 34% expressed little to no confidence.

The numbers flipped when respondents were asked about social media platforms. Only 36 per cent said they were somewhat or very confident in social platforms’ ability to prevent foreign interference, while the rest were either not that confident (43%) or not at all confident (20%).

Facebook is acutely aware of concerns and in October announced a Canadian Election Integrity Initiative “to help ensure the platform is a space for authentic civic engagement.” Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould is in the midst of conversations with social media companies, including Facebook, about their obligations this election year.

Coletto said Canadians are giving the government “the benefit of the doubt” when it comes to preventing election interference.

“If we had gotten into some of the details and asked them how they feel about specific aspects of the government’s plan [to safeguard the election] they might feel differently,” Coletto said.

“But on the surface, [Canadians] generally think that the government is competent enough on this and there’s less confidence in social media companies to self-regulate.”",Canadians Say The US Is More Likely Than Russia To Try And Influence The Next Federal Election,Buzzfeed,https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/canadian-election-interference-us-china-russia
6,Empty,2019-02-23T06:00:00Z,The B'nai Brith and the Conservative Party resort to�gutter tactics in an attempt to stifle Canada's populist alternative.�,"Recently, with major elections soon taking place, the B'nai Brith of Canada, the sister organization of American ""hate-watch"" group the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), launched a defamatory broadside against the People's Party of Canada (PPC), that nation's brand-new populist alternative to the more establishment-friendly Conservative Party of Canada.

Instead of yielding to pressure, Masse and the PPC fired back, claiming that the attack was completely meritless and that the Conservatives were actually likely involved. In a tough election year against Justin Trudeau's Liberals, and with outspoken PPC founder Maxime ""Mad Max"" Bernier increasingly scoring points against (as he calls them) the ""intellectually corrupt"" Conservatives, even in Canada's otherwise ultra-polite political arena, the Conservatives' involvement looks highly believable.

Although covered by most of Canada's institutional media, the basis for the B'nai Brith's attack was remarkably thin. In their press release, the group quoted lines from blog posts that were not only over a decade old (having appeared on a French-Canadian blog in 2002), but, according to Masse, highly exaggerated and clearly out of context.

For instance, the B'nai Brith accused Masse of ""racism"" and ""having Nazi sympathies"" for stating at the time that the media's labeling of Austria's Freedom Party as a ""group of Nazis"" was overblown — that party is now part of Austria's coalition government. But as Masse had to point out later in his own press release, the B'nai Brith apparently ""missed"" the part in his post where he quoted Simon Wiesenthal saying the exact same thing.

Elsewhere, they accused Masse of anti-Semitism for raising concerns about Israel's policies toward Zionism and its treatment of its Palestinian minority (these were the heady days of the Second Intifada), to which Masse later responded that he most certainly hadn't intend to attack Jewish people as a whole and that, in any case, his general views on Israel had since become more ""nuanced."" Had the B'nai Brith reached out to Masse first to see if his views had indeed since changed, they may have held back. They may have also discovered that Masse is homosexual and accordingly tempered their claims that he is homophobic.

(For a full account of the ""offending"" quotations and their context, find the B'nai Brith's and Masse's press releases.)

But groups like the B'nai Brith never do this. When it comes to individuals or organizations they disagree with, it's shoot first, debate never. Like the ADL or the Southern Poverty Law Center, the B'nai Brith's business model depends on finding ""hate"" wherever it can so as to ensure that donations remain high and steady. This should give major media sources serious pause before they report on their investigations or turn to them for ""expert opinion.""

The B'nai Brith's more direct motivation for the smear campaign was likely related to its CEO, Michael Mostyn, who is closely connected with the Conservative Party. Mostyn ran as a candidate twice for the party in recent federal elections (he lost both times). This was a fact raised in Masse's response but, unfortunately, not in the media's coverage. The media did note that the Conservatives suspiciously had an official condemnation of the PPC ready to go ""less than an hour"" after the B'nai Brith put out its press release. Speculating about the ""political motivations"" behind the attack, when asked about the accusations by reporters, Bernier told them that ""[m]aybe they want to do that because they're supporting another party ... by doing that, they are not doing a favor to their organization.""

This, and the general timing of the attack — again, just two weeks before several key byelections, which kick off the full election year — seems to raise far more questions about the Conservative Party than it does about Masse.

Again, the Conservatives' motivation behind their coordination with Mostyn's B'nai Brith seems clear. If the PPC show strong results in the upcoming byelections (followed by the general election later this year), they'll be taking votes away from the Conservative Party, pressuring them to change their ""Liberal Party-lite"" platform, as some call it. This is something most Conservatives are apparently loath to do. Just as our own conservative establishment before President Trump came to power, the Conservative Party has long tried to keep issues that working-class conservatives care about, like immigration, off the party's platform. Even with property values hitting crisis levels in Canada's heavily immigrant major cities — Nearly 90 percent of Canada's immigrants go to just Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal — Conservatives have not proposed a migration reduction. The PPC, on the other hand, have.

Whether the PPC can persevere through these attacks and establish themselves as a serious conservative alternative, we'll see with the upcoming elections. This latest challenge has certainly proved their leadership's mettle. Unlike what's expected of most conservatives when hit with these sorts of allegations, Masse and Bernier did not back down, and instead castigated the B'nai Brith and the Conservative Party for their gutter tactics and apparent underhanded coordination. Standing firm and staying true to self, this is how conservatives should fight.",Making Canada Great Again?,Americanthinker.com,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2019/02/making_canada_great_again.html

The pair of photos show Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi, before and after a US-backed NATO coalition ejected him from power with an air bombing campaign in 2011. That year, he was captured by a rival militia in Libya’s ongoing civil war, tortured, and executed in the streets.

Why is Rubio sharing these images? To threaten Venezuela’s embattled leader, Nicolas Maduro, who was returned to power after elections last year that were called unfair by numerous international bodies, including the European Union, Freedom House and Amnesty International.”

The collapse of Venezuela’s socialist economy and political system—which began after the death of president Hugo Chavez in 2013—is now a full-scale humanitarian crisis. Following large protests against Nicolás Maduro’s government, an elected opposition leader, Juan Guaido, declared himself interim president and was recognized by other Latin American countries, the US, Canada, and eleven European states.

Maduro, however, isn’t going quietly, and his decision to block food, medicine, and other necessaries from reaching people in his country has abetted political chaos. On Saturday (Feb. 23), pro-Maduro security forces set fire to a convoy of aid trucks attempting to cross into the country from Columbia, killing at least four people.

Rubio, whose politics are driven in part by his family’s experience of the socialist revolution in Cuba, has been a vocal supporter of US military action to oust Maduro and relieve the humanitarian crisis. Earlier on Sunday, he shared a less-graphic pair of photos featuring former Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, a US-backed strongman who lost the backing of Washington and was eventually ousted during a US invasion in 1989.

Experts question the wisdom of using US military action to break Maduro’s embargo and allow humanitarian aid, much less to affect regime change. Maduro has already used existing US sanctions to rally his supporters, and a foreign invasion could have a similar effect. A former US Air Force general says that military force is not the right choice. Venezuela is comparable in size to Iraq or Afghanistan, and could require a commensurate commitment of US resources.

8,Empty,2019-02-25T12:00:00Z,The nation’s eyes are on B.C. for Monday’s byelections across Canada,"Ballots will be cast in Ontario’s York-Simcoe and Quebec’s Outremont ridings, but no race is being watched more closely than the one in Burnaby South, B.C., where New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh is vying for his first seat in Parliament.

BURNABY, B.C.—A trio of federal byelections on Monday will offer more than just an early glimpse of voters’ dispositions, potentially shaking up the political landscape months before Canadians head to the polls en masse.

“There’s already rumblings that if he loses, it will be difficult for him to stay on as leader — and (it) would probably further undermine the NDP’s electoral prospects going into the federal election after an already underwhelming year.”

“Singh needs to win to consolidate his power as the leader of the party,” explained political scientist David Moscrop, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Ottawa.

Burnaby South is a key test of both Singh’s hold on his left-leaning party and the popularity of Maxime Bernier’s new far-right populist party, focused on immigration and carbon taxes.

Burnaby South is historically a diverse, working-class riding. Its median income falls 18 per cent below the national average. It has a higher proportion of visible minorities than neighbouring Vancouver or Surrey — even higher than Toronto. It was previously an NDP stronghold.

“I think he will win,” said Moscrop. “But he doesn’t have federal experience as MP … Forget forming government: He needs to show he can hold the government accountable, with only months left until the election.”

So it may be Singh’s to lose.

And with Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada running its first big candidate in Burnaby South — former radio host Laura Lynn Tyler Thompson — the election has seen tense all-candidates debates devolve into audience heckling and allegations of racism and extremism.

“If she can nab even 10 per cent, Bernier will be crowing for months,” Moscrop argued. “This is the perfect time for his party to do well. It’s getting outsized media attention, and they can focus on locking down a smaller segment of the electorate.

“Plus, there’s enough disaffection, not to mention xenophobia, today that could express itself as support.”

Here’s what’s at stake in Burnaby South, what voters are saying their top issues are and why this byelection is being so scrutinized across the country.

Who is running?

Singh, a former Ontario provincial politician and lawyer, is facing off against three rival party hopefuls.

One of those rivals, Thompson of the People’s Party of Canada, has generated considerable controversy by tapping into public anxieties around immigration and refugees.

Also running is another former provincial politician, Richard Lee, with the Liberals. Jay Shin is carrying the flag for the federal Conservative party, mounting concerns over the Liberals’ more than three years in office, expressing particular opposition to certain taxes and drug policies.

There are also two independent candidates running.

What is at stake nationally?

It’s seen as a high-stakes byelection beyond the borders of B.C.’s Lower Mainland mainly because experts say it’s a key test of Singh’s hold on the leadership of his party — which he’s headed since 2017 despite not yet holding a seat in Parliament. Facing the Liberals in Ottawa is seen as essential to his party’s chances, and some have speculated he could face an internal coup if he fails his first ballot-box test.

It also remains to be seen whether Bernier’s right-wing populist party, the People’s Party of Canada, has the kind of broad appeal he claims. Burnaby South is the first chance to test that support in a largely working-class city.

Another dynamic is how well the Liberal brand performs, as the party is currently embroiled in allegations that staffers pressured the former attorney general to stop prosecuting Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid a high-profile campaign visit to Lee and faced cheering crowds, but Liberal support has fallen in recent polls across the country, including in B.C.

“Byelections are pretty silly tests of public mood,” Moscrop cautioned, “because they don’t really mimic the conditions of a general election.

“They’re a really strange one-off, or in this case, three. People try to read a lot into them but shouldn’t.”

What is the tone on the campaign trail?

Unusually bitter and divisive for a local riding byelection. Three all-candidates debates in a row have descended into audience members shouting accusations of racism, fascism and extremism against each other and candidates onstage.

The spark has been any conversation about immigration, refugees and people illegally crossing the border into Canada. The subjects have stoked anger at recent Yellow Vests rallies and from the People’s Party of Canada, which alleges all three rival parties are soft on screening people entering the country. The People’s party wants a tighter cap on immigration numbers and more prevention of irregular asylum-seekers.

That’s led to accusations of racism and xenophobia — but some in Burnaby South have cited the murder of a Chinese-Canadian teen, allegedly by a Syrian refugee, as evidence of a public safety risk. Meanwhile, the Liberal and NDP candidates have countered that the actions of one individual should not represent an entire group of people.

The People’s party candidate has accused her Conservative opponent of “smearing” her in a pamphlet delivered to constituents, which included pictures of marijuana leaves and empty syringes and alleged the party supports drugs.

The original Liberal candidate in Burnaby South was forced to resign by the party after the Star unearthed online posts in Chinese pointing out that Singh is South Asian.

What do locals say?

Despite Singh’s future hanging in the balance, when the Star hit the suburban city’s streets to find out what regular voters think, locals appeared more focused on anything but the NDP leader’s prospects in Ottawa.

By far, the most commonly cited issue in this byelection was affordable housing, followed by taxes, jobs, the environment and immigration.

Who are Burnaby’s voters?

Burnaby’s demographics are increasingly young and not white, the 2016 census found. Its average age is three years below B.C.’s average, and 69 per cent of its population identifies as a visible minority, more than triple Canada’s rate. (The Greater Toronto Area, by comparison, was 51 per cent visible minorities.)

Burnaby South is home to a sizable Chinese-Canadian community, followed in number by Caucasians, South Asians and Filipinos.

In fact, 54 per cent of Burnaby South residents say they are immigrants, according to the 2016 census, compared to the Canada-wide figure of 14 per cent. (Immigrants in the Greater Toronto Area make up 46 per cent of the population.)

It’s also a historically working-class riding, with the median income at just $28,183 per year, 18 per cent less than the national average. Burnaby South’s poverty rates are significantly higher than the national average, with 22 per cent of residents being defined by Statistics Canada as low income, compared to 16 per cent nationally.

How can eligible voters cast their ballots?

Polls are open to any eligible Burnaby South resident from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday. Since not all Burnaby residents are eligible — the city contains multiple federal ridings — you can find out if you can vote, and where, on Elections Canada’s website.

9,Empty,2019-02-23T23:10:32Z,"As tech giants grow ever more powerful, Canada and others are under pressure to act TheSpec.com As tech companies grow ever more powerful, countries such as Canada must decide how to protect the public without turning away economic benefits.","Practically it's about tech giants collecting and selling our data to third parties without our consent, she adds. This has been exposed in a slate of recent scandals, from the discovery of a microphone built into Google's Nest Secure home security system, to tracking by Google services on Android devices and iPhones even when privacy settings are turned on.

She singles out Facebook and Google as particularly being a concern.

""They have created a state of surveillance,"" she says.

Amazon is not as bad but there are still concerns, she adds, like with their controversial facial recognition technology, Amazon Rekognition. The company's own shareholders urged Amazon not to sell it to governments, fearing potential human rights abuses.

Microsoft and Apple deserve more credit, she says, and their CEOs have both made public commitments to privacy.

That's because companies like Apple are selling a physical product, unlike Facebook and Google, says Avner Levin, a professor at the Ted Rogers School of Management, Law and Business Department.

""The people that are using the service are the product that is actually being sold to advertisers,"" he says, referring to Facebook and Google.

""We are the product that they are selling.""

Privacy is linked to wider issues like fake news, and the weakening of democratic institutions, he adds. This was illustrated in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, when Russians deployed targeted information to manipulate social media users.

What others are doing:

In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, is currently investigating to see if Facebook violated a 2011 ""consent decree,"" that said they would address concerns about the tracking and sharing of user data, Cavoukian says. Facebook could face a hefty fine if found to be in breach of this order.

But the ""gold standard"" for privacy legislation is the EU, says Levin. The EU passed the comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation, in 2016.

The legislation includes hefty fines (up to 4 per cent of a company's global revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater). It also has strict language on consent, the concept of privacy by design, and the right to be forgotten, under which individuals can apply to have negative search results deleted.

Similar laws have been passed in Japan, Brazil and California, Cavoukian says, and there's discussion in the U.S. about national legislation.

What Canada is doing:

Canada is in ""a significantly weaker situation than the EU,"" says Andrew Clement, professor emeritus in the Faculty of Information, at the University of Toronto.

The federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) was developed in 2000, before Facebook and smartphones, and lacks the ""fining powers"" of the EU law.

""There appears to be more willingness in the EU to use existing powers for bringing the tech giants to account,"" he says.

Levin says there's been an ""absolute lack of will,"" on the part of both the Trudeau and Harper governments to do anything about privacy.

In 2012 in response to complaints, the federal privacy commissioner did an investigation into Facebook. But the office doesn't have the ""power to force Facebook to do anything,"" he says.

The EU, influenced heavily by the Germans, is more attuned to the dangers of a loss of privacy, given their history of totalitarian governments.

""They're a lot more willing to regulate the companies, they're a lot more worried about the consequences,"" he says.

But Cavoukian is optimistic that Canada can catch up.

In 2018, the federal Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics issued a report entitled ""Towards Privacy By Design,"" which she believes shows a ""clear intent"" to enhance the law.

Disinformation

The issue:

In recent years, the world has rudely awakened to the proliferation of hate speech and ""fake news"" on social media — especially during election cycles, when online content can be used to disrupt democratic processes.

Regulators and social media companies have come under pressure to stem the flow of online hate speech and malicious ""disinformation."" But these are complicated problems with no easy fixes; the sheer volume of harmful content online is overwhelming and the notion of regulating speech will always provoke free speech concerns while drawing fierce opposition.

And while some countries have legal definitions for hate speech, defining ""fake news"" is a tricky proposition; it can also be a dangerous one, especially in the hands of authoritarian regimes that want to censor information or crack down on the free press.

Regulators have struggled to find workable solutions. ""No one's figured it out,"" says Heidi Tworek, an assistant professor of history at the University of British Columbia who studies media, democracy and the digital economy. ""We continue to have to really evaluate many of these different schemes that are being proposed. These are such large and complex questions.""

What others are doing:

Several European countries are now moving toward regulating social media platforms, deploying strategies that have drawn both criticism and praise. In France, the government passed a law in November that empowers judges to order the removal of ""fake news"" during elections; violators face a penalty of one year in prison or a €75,000 fine.

In the United Kingdom, a new parliamentary report — released this week following an 18-month investigation — is also calling for platforms like Facebook to be brought under regulatory control. The report proposes several new regulations, including a mandatory code of ethics and independent regulator who can bring legal proceedings against social media companies.

Germany has taken a particularly bold approach to regulating hate speech on social media. In January 2018, the country passed its Net Enforcement Act — sometimes dubbed the NetzDG or ""Facebook law"" — which forces tech companies to remove hate speech within 24 hours of illegal content being reported. (When it's unclear whether content is actually illegal under German law, tech companies have seven days to consult and decide.)

The penalty for breaking this law? Up to €50 million in fines. ""This is probably the furthest anyone has gone in trying to get large social media companies to adopt their policies to local laws,"" Tworek says.

What Canada is doing:

""Canadians, and the Canadian government, are alive and alert to the issues,"" says Dwayne Winseck, a journalism professor at Carleton University and director of the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project.

He points to Canada's recently-passed electoral reform bill, C-76, as a positive step. Online platforms like Facebook and Google must now create a registry of digital advertisements placed by political or third parties during elections and ensure they remain visible for two years. The law also bans the use of foreign money by ""third party"" advocacy groups during campaign periods — meaning social media companies can't knowingly accept advertisements paid for with foreign funds.

Another provision prohibits making false statements about a candidate to influence an election. This only applies narrowly to certain types of statements, however (for example, statements about whether a candidate has broken the law or their place of birth).

In January, the federal government unveiled plans for safeguarding the upcoming election, including a $7 million initiative to improve the public's ability to detect ""online deceptive practices"" and a team of five bureaucrats who will alert the public whenever they find evidence of election interference.

But where Canada could be innovating more is with social media regulation more generally, says journalist Chris Tenove, a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia who studies global governance and digital politics.

He would like to see Canada follow the lead of jurisdictions like the European Union, which worked together with social media companies to develop a code of conduct. As a result, platforms have voluntarily committed to ""quickly and efficiently"" addressing hate speech and early reports have shown good results, he says.

One promising spot is Canada's involvement with an international effort called the Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News. Comprising parliamentarians from nine countries, the committee is scheduled to meet in Ottawa this May and has called for social media executives — including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai — to appear so they can explain what they're doing to stop the spread of disinformation.

Taxation

The issue:

In the mid 1980s, when Canada's GST was still a twinkle in then prime minister Brian Mulroney's eye, the World Wide Web had not yet been invented and Google's founders were still pre-teen boys. Since then, digital technologies have advanced at breakneck speeds and companies like Google — not to mention Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon — have become essential to how Canadians spend their time and money.

They have also been reaping billions in profits. Tax codes, meanwhile, have evolved more slowly and governments are now grappling with how to bring their taxation systems into the digital age.

""There is a missed opportunity for taxing these companies,"" says Rosalie Wyonch, a policy analyst with the C.D. Howe Institute. ""Digital technology has been outpacing our ability to regulate (and) tax.""

Traditionally, tax systems were dependent on the idea of ""permanent establishment,"" Wyonch explains — this assumes a company has a physical presence within a country, or relates to physical goods crossing borders. But ""our tax code hasn't been updated to deal with intangibles,"" she says.

Yet as digital services become more popular, the potential losses in sales tax revenue grow bigger, says University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist, the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law. (In 2017, Wyonch wrote that if Netflix alone were to collect and remit GST/HST, this would inject $50 million per year into Canada's tax coffers).

Meanwhile, domestic companies — which do have to collect and remit sales taxes — argue they are left at a competitive disadvantage, Geist adds.

When it comes to taxing corporate income, global discussions are now underway to figure out how this should be handled when it comes to big tech. ""That is a very complex international system, that we're waiting for consensus on,"" according to Wyonch.

There are major challenges when it comes to simply defining the income of digital companies, she says. Say a foreign company does a digital marketing campaign for a Canadian company. ""Did they earn that income where they're located, or did they earn that income in Canada, if they never entered Canada (or) hosted any of its content on Canadian servers?"" Wyonch asks. ""We don't have a clear way to define, in a black and white way, what would — and would not — be considered Canadian income.""

What others are doing:

The G20 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have set a 2020 deadline for fighting tax avoidance (which tech giants are frequently accused of) and developing international standards for taxing big tech. But several countries — like the U.K., France, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand — are already considering interim measures, raising concerns of creating a hodgepodge of different approaches around the world. The European Union has also unveiled plans for a digital tax of three per cent of revenues, an idea that has received blowback, including from some member states.

What Canada is doing:

Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters last October that Ottawa is studying whether a new regulatory landscape is needed for the digital economy and he is pushing the G20 to speed up its timeline for establishing new rules. But Morneau says Canada's goal is to wait for an international consensus before taking action.

Quebec and Saskatchewan, however, have forged ahead on the sales tax issue and this year, both started applying provincial sales taxes to foreign digital companies. In Quebec, more than 80 international companies — including Amazon, Apple, Google and Netflix — were registered as of Feb. 18 to collect and remit provincial sales tax in that province.

Jennifer Yang

Competition

The issue:

The rise of a short list of dominant tech companies has put reform of traditional notions of competition law at the top of the agenda for policy-makers around the globe.

Modern competition law holds that when companies control large market shares, the result is higher prices and lower quality. It does not, however, make a monopoly illegal, prohibiting only the abuse of the power that a monopoly makes possible through exclusionary practices.

Experts say practices such as a company giving its own products top ranking in its online search engine have been given a boost by so called big data — the corporate accumulation of massive data sets that are automatically processed through computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. Big data could pose competitive threats by allowing exclusive licensing deals for critical data sets, for example, says Ariane Le Strat, a U.K.-based associate with international law firm Bird & Bird, or companies could agree to price-discriminate — charge more to certain people based on their perceived ability to pay — as a result of customer data they have obtained.

The public outcry over the misuse of personal data after the Cambridge Analytica scandal early last year when it was revealed that Facebook had harvested personal information for political purposes without consent ratcheted up the pressure on regulators, Le Strat says, with the U.S. among others vowing vigorous antitrust enforcement in the area.

What others are doing:

The European Union has taken the lead in enforcing stricter laws aimed at tech companies suspected of wilfully abusing their market dominance.

Its competition directorate, for example, has imposed heavy sanctions in cases where it has alleged market abuse by technology giants, including the €2.4 billion fine levied against Google in 2017 for privileging its own products in search results. The European Union has also taken dramatic steps against Microsoft, now requiring its ubiquitous Windows operating system to enable a variety of web browsers.

Germany's competition watchdog has ordered Facebook to curb its data collection excesses and is investigating Amazon after complaints from third-party sellers that their business was being hurt by the company's dual role as both a retailer on its Amazon Marketplace and the platform's owner/operator. The European Commission's competition watchdog is probing whether Amazon gains unfair advantage from the data it collects via transactions on the an e-commerce platform.

Against this backdrop some consumer advocacy groups have called for a breakup of the big U.S. tech companies similar to the tearing asunder of the U.S. Bell system in the 1980s — or at the very least an overhaul of competition statutes to address the new threats from the tech giants' market dominance.

What Canada is doing:

Canada has maintained that while the emergence of firms that control and exploit data can raise new challenges for competition law enforcement, ""this is not in and of itself cause for concern,"" according to the Competition Bureau.

In a February 2018 report, the bureau concluded that while ""big data may require specific methods and tools, the bureau's traditional enforcement framework will continue to apply.""

The report says data tools that analyze and adjust to changes in the conduct of consumers and competitors may ""soften competition"" but this is really just an extension of practices that companies used before information technology was developed.

Moreover, it says conscious parallelism (where firms in an oligopoly are aware that their pricing and output decisions have a significant impact upon rivals and without an explicit agreement co-ordinate their behaviour as if they were engaged in collusive behaviour) is not by itself prohibited under Canadian competition law.

""For competition law enforcement in Canada,"" according to Sandy Walker, a competition law partner at Dentons in Toronto, ""it's déjà vu for now.""

Michael Lewis

Addiction

The issue: This is a newer area, and there's no scientifically established condition of social media or smartphone addiction.

There are however ""problematic behaviours"" associated with the technologies that are similar to the ones found in recognized addictions to drugs, alcohol or gambling, such as not being able to cut back on use, says Centre for Addiction and Mental Health senior scientist Dr. Robert Mann.

Mann says a 2016 CAMH survey of adults found 40 per cent said yes to at least one of a number of questions such as whether screen habits had ever caused the respondent to miss school, work, or important social activities, or whether a family member had ever expressed concern.

Eight per cent of respondents said yes to three or more of the questions.

Matthew Johnson, director of education at digital literacy non-profit, MediaSmarts, wouldn't call it an addiction either. But he has heard of serious problematic behaviours especially among young people using apps or social media sites that seem designed to keep them coming back.

Snapchat streaks, where kids keep sending Snapchats to their friends every day to keep their streak and earn a flame icon, even if it means missing sleep, are one example.

Benjamin Wong, a registered clinical counsellor in behavioural addictions in B.C., says he's seen about a five-per-cent increase over the last five years in people with screen or tech issues. He believes ""hooking"" customers with colourful, engaging social media sites or apps is a ""cornerstone"" of the tech business.

What others are doing:

Other jurisdictions haven't gone as far as they have on issues such as data collection, or fake news.

France recently passed a law that companies with more than 50 employees can't email employees after business hours, giving individuals ""the right to disconnect.""

The goal, said officials in that country at the time, was to prevent burnout and reduce work-related stress. But Mann says such an idea might also help with addictive behaviour.

""I think it's interesting to consider that that kind of a law might reduce the need or the urge to continually access your devices,"" he says.

In the U.K., the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport parliamentary committee launched an inquiry into the growth of ""immersive and addictive technologies"" in December 2018, looking into the ""addictive nature of some technologies,"" and how they can impact behaviour.

What Canada is doing:

""Not a whole lot has been done,"" in this country, says Wong, adding even much of the advocacy around regulating tech giants has been around privacy and data.

Mann says it's a rich area for researchers, who might start by developing guidelines for healthy use.

Copyright

The issue:

Copyright protections are evolving in the digital age as countries ramp up efforts to combat piracy and online infringement. The need for new measures has come to the forefront amid a torrent of illegal downloads of online content from providers including Netflix and YouTube and the pirating of material for commercial and personal use.

What others are doing:

Protections are being updated in jurisdictions including the U.S. and especially the European Union, which is set to vote this spring in the European Parliament on an overhaul that would block copyright-protected material, including software, films, music and books, from being uploaded or electronically shared without permission from creators.

A provision of the proposed policy would effectively mandate that companies including Facebook and Google develop and fund technology to automatically filter out infringed content on their sites and search engines on a mass scale.

In the U.S., meanwhile, momentum is building around proposals in Congress that could formalize and increase royalty payments for music creators whose work is played on digital services.

In many developing jurisdictions, the push to reform intellectual property protections has become part of a plan to boost economic competitiveness, with China for example proposing to make websites liable for promoting unlicensed works as part of a broader reform of property rights.

Australia, which was described by the country's attorney general in 2014 as the ""worst offender"" of pirated content, has proposed new laws that would make if far easier for copyright owners to achieve court orders that would force search engines and internet service providers to block or delete pirated content.

What Canada is doing:

In Canada, part of the response is contained in the Copyright Modernization Act which requires that providers give notice to customers suspected of pirating content. It is left to the injured party to sue with awards capped at $5,000 for non-commercial infringement.

Provisions in Canada's legislation also prohibit demands for payment in the infringement notices, as well as links to any other sites where payments can be made to content creators.

The notice provision has been criticized by groups including the International Intellectual Property Alliance of content creators since if ""fails to provide meaningful incentives for network service providers to co-operate with copyright owners to deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital network environment.""

Another possible impediment to the notice provision stems from the new trade agreement among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico that limits internet platforms' liability for users' content, while the deal also stipulates that Canada eventually extend its copyright term. The liability provision could prevent Canada from adopting European-style digital copyright rules, experts note.

Klynge was referring to former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel's comments during the 2008 financial crisis. Fast-forward a decade, and the world is grappling with another crisis, fuelled by the creations of tech's biggest titans.

""The [Facebook] Cambridge Analytica case, some of the other data leaks — 500 million people have been involved in data leaks in the last 10 months alone,"" says Klynge, appointed by Denmark as the world's first tech ambassador.

WATCH: The National's interview with Casper Klynge, Sunday night on CBC Television and streamed online

""Now, that has been a blessing in disguise in the sense that it sort of makes it evident to most people that there are boundaries, and there are real issues at stake, and it is necessary for us to have a conversation with the companies. Also, to make sure that they [companies] assume a responsibility which is proportional to the kind of influence that they're exercising.""

When you consider that Facebook and Google have more combined users than half the global population, the influence they wield is monolithic, he says. The sheer size and scale of these companies has forced a power shift not seen since the Industrial Revolution.

Now, amid scandals surrounding personal data leaks and hacked elections, governments are scrambling to catch up.

Enter Klynge.

Denmark was ahead of the curve, dispatching Klynge to Silicon Valley 18 months ago with a lofty mandate: to protect Danish interests and democracy in the digital age.

A career diplomat who has served in Kosovo, Darfur and Helmand province, Klynge admits it wasn't the easiest of transitions.

So what exactly is Techplomacy?

While many traditional ambassadors focus their attention on economic issues, Klynge has a different mandate.

""I spend very little time on promoting investment opportunities or export opportunities for Danish companies,"" Klynge says. ""What we're really talking about is the big issues. How technology is potentially undermining democracy, election processes. How content, illegal content like terrorism or extremism, how that is a huge problem for all of us, all democratic countries.

And rather than being posted to a specific country, Klynge's responsibilities are global.

""My embassy is slightly different than all other embassies in the Danish foreign ministry, because it's almost a virtual embassy. Part of my team is in Silicon Valley, another part of it is in Copenhagen, and a third part is actually in Beijing. So we're also trying to treat this in a different way, we have a global mandate, it's not all about Silicon Valley.""

Klynge recently brought his vision for ""techplomacy"" to Ottawa, meeting with Minister of Democratic Institutions Karina Gould to discuss how Canada plans to protect itself in the lead-up to the next federal election.

Watch: Casper Klynge says his mandate is to see that technology protects democracy

With upcoming elections in Denmark and Canada, Danish tech ambassador Casper Klynge says democracy needs to be protected at all costs. 0:40

Klynge hopes to persuade Canada to join an alliance of like-minded nations, and perhaps even create its own tech ambassador.

""To some extent that's almost part of my success criteria, that we do get a critical mass around the table. Because it goes without saying that as a small country with less than six million people, we [Denmark] will never be able to move the agenda, vis-a-vis the big technology companies,"" Klynge says.

""We need other countries around the table and we need more international collaboration, not less, in the digital age. And that again goes back to why this is a foreign policy initiative.""

When coders cross the line

Klynge is a proponent of creating a sort of Hippocratic Oath for people who write software, to ensure they adhere to code of ethics. (Jonathan Castell/CBC)

Aside from protecting democracy, Klynge is pushing for the creation of an international code of ethics that all tech companies would need to adhere to.

He points to a recent airline scam in the U.K. as an example of just one way software engineers have crossed the line in the pursuit of corporate profit.

""Algorithms in some airlines were set up to make sure that families were basically split when they did the seat allocation, to make a little bit extra off having families pay to be seated together. And as a family member I've experienced that many times myself,"" Klynge says.

""But I think the interesting bit is that it also initiated a debate among coders, among programmers, to say who on Earth would actually write algorithms that disperses families across an airline? Is that really what coders should be involved in?

""So I think that resulted in sort of almost a Hippocratic Oath from coders — saying you work in a decent way, you write algorithms without biases — I think that's an important dimension of it as well.""

Can China be trusted?

Klynge says the world's government and corporate leaders are currently wrestling with rules and protections that could determine whether technology will ultimately be a force for good or be abused by those in power. (Jonathan Castell/CBC)

Questions over ethics and trust are at the centre of much bigger debate — whether or not Chinese tech giant Huawei poses a threat to Canadian security.

Ottawa and Beijing have been locked in a diplomatic dispute since the December arrest of Meng Wanzhou. The Huawei executive was detained in Vancouver at the request of the United States, which is seeking her extradition on fraud allegations.

The Trudeau government is still deciding whether to ban Huawei from Canada's 5G networks.

Klynge says whether the debate is over 5G technology or artificial intelligence, China's influence cannot be ignored.

Watch: Casper Klynge says it's important to keep the conversation with China going

Amid tensions between Ottawa and Beijing over the possible ban of Chinese tech giant Huawei's gear from Canadian communications networks, Casper Klynge answers a question on the minds of many: Can China be trusted? 0:40

Whether the finger is being pointed at Beijing or Silicon Valley, Klynge says a much bigger battle is being waged.

""The big debate, or the big conflict if you like, is of course whether technology will be a doer of good. Whether it will promote democracies and freedom, whether it will empower people, bring better health care, better education, or whether technology could also be a means for increased control. And those authoritarian aspects of it — it goes without saying that China plays an important role here that we need to pay attention to.

""But that doesn't mean that we don't need a dialogue with China.

The White House is in discussions with former Michigan Senate candidate John James about the vacant United Nations ambassador post, with President Donald Trump leaning toward nominating the former businessman and Iraq War veteran, according to three people close to the process.

The talks have included frequent phone calls as Trump’s team searches for a new top diplomat after State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert withdrew herself from consideration for the post over the weekend, citing family concerns. Trump and James have not met in person since Nauert pulled her name, and it’s unclear if they have spoken by phone.

A White House official said James, 37, was previously the “runner-up” for the position last December before Trump nominated Nauert. At the time, James met with several senior Trump administration officials, including the president, vice president and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. James is a “favorite” of Vice President Mike Pence, added a senior White House official, and has won a stamp of approval from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, both of whom are involved in deliberations.

James appeared on Fox News Wednesday afternoon in what some White House officials viewed as a formal audition for the role. He used the six-minute segment to pitch himself as an experienced businessman who could cut through the U.N. bureaucracy to deliver meaningful reforms, and also as someone who is willing to communicate the president’s “America First” vision. Trump has told advisers he wants someone in the job — recently downgraded from its Cabinet rank — who agrees with his foreign policy outlook and can be a ubiquitous presence on television.

“It’s an honor to be considered and I’m looking forward to getting the call should it come,” James told the network, touting his experience as a combat veteran and “someone who understands the growing spheres of communism around the world.”

Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been pushing the White House to tap U.S. Ambassador to Canada Kelly Knight Craft. Like James, she was also previously in the running for the post before Nauert was named.

“The Leader has spoken to the president and recommended Kelly Craft for the position,"" said David Popp, a McConnell spokesman.

Additionally, Trump is considering U.S. Ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell for the position, according to the senior White House official. But two White House officials said Grenell, despite earning the president’s praise, is unlikely to land the job. The openly gay Trump administration official was just tapped to lead a global initiative against the criminalization of homosexuality in dozens of developed countries, NBC reported on Tuesday.

James, who lost a race to unseat Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow last November, has long been discussed in GOP circles as a rising star in the Republican Party. A West Point graduate who helps runs a family-owned shipping business in Michigan, James drew several high-profile guests, including Trump, to stump for him in the final weeks before the 2018 midterm elections.

His closer-than-expected performance in 2018, along with his appeal among black communities — James is African-American — has some people close to the White House encouraging Trump to select a different person for the U.N. so that James can challenge Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan in 2020, according to a person familiar with those conversations.

“If he doesn’t get it this time, I don’t think it’s because they don’t like him, it’s because they want him to run again,” the person said.

An administration official said there “is a desire to find a big league position for” James but cautioned that the U.N. post “may not be the right fit” for him.

Nauert decided to withdraw her nomination last Friday in part because she believed her past employment of an au pair who wasn’t authorized to work in the U.S. would have further complicated the Senate confirmation process, sources familiar with her thinking previously told POLITICO.

Despite James’ popularity within the White House, some outside allies are worried that James may lack sufficient foreign policy experience, echoing a common critique of Nauert, who worked in broadcast journalism prior to joining the State Department in a senior communications role.

One person close to key U.S. senators said there are members who care deeply about the selection for this position and want to ensure the president’s eventual nominee is not untested in the foreign policy arena. Senate Democrats reacted with almost uniform dismay to Nauert’s nomination last year, claiming her loyalty to Trump should not supersede qualifications.

James would likely face similar pushback if nominated, even if some foreign policy experts insist that expertise in their field is not an absolute determiner of who can represent the U.S. well at the powerful international organization.

“Nikki Haley had very little foreign policy credentials before she did it and she did a great job,” said James Carafano, a national security expert at The Heritage Foundation. “She was … a quick learner and she was a strong leader, and those were the most valuable credentials.”

“The one difference,” Carafano allowed, “is Haley had a lot of time in government. She knew how government operated [and] she started doing her homework on foreign policy issues well before she was up for the U.N. appointment.”

Like Nauert, James also has young children at home, potentially complicating a move to New York City, where the official U.N. headquarters is located. A source familiar with the process dismissed such concerns, noting that his wife is already at home full-time and that their three children are not school age yet.

Asked about the status of the U.N. search, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told POLITICO she had “nothing to announce at this time.”

“I thought hard about what life was going to be like as a private citizen, and I think what I’ve always loved is policy — whether it’s foreign policy or domestic policy, I’ve always loved it, and I always want to have a voice,” Haley told the Washington Post.

Stand for America, a social welfare group that cannot endorse candidates or make political donations, vows to help every American accomplish the “American dream” and claims Americans’ success is “being threatened by socialist schemes of higher taxes, burdensome job-destroying regulations, government-run health care, and unsecure borders.” The group also says numerous rogue regimes internationally are jeopardizing U.S. national security.

""As U.S. Ambassador to the UN, I was able to see firsthand the challenges we face around the globe. Iranian-backed radical Islamic terrorism threatens the lives of innocent Americans,” Haley said in a statement Monday. “Communist China is spreading its influence throughout the world and engaging in unfair and illegal trade practices. North Korea still has nuclear weapons that can hit us. Russia meddles in our elections and invades its neighbors with no regard for their sovereignty. In our own backyard, socialist dictators in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua oppress their own people and support narco-trafficking that invades America.”

Haley, a former governor of South Carolina and daughter of immigrants, said her life story is evidence the American dream is still alive, due to “hard work, determination, and the incredible support of the people of South Carolina.”

""My story is proof positive that the American dream is alive and well,” Haley said in a statement Monday. “America’s greatness comes from our freedom and our values and they must be protected for future generations.”

""Even though I have entered private life, I will never stop standing up for America’s freedom and values,” Haley said. “We all have a part to play in keeping our country safe, strong, and prosperous.""

Burnaby South, which was vacated by former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart, who is now Vancouver’s mayor, is an important race for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who is vying for a seat in Parliament.

Liberal Richard T. Lee, Conservative Jay Shin, independent candidates Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu, and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson are also running in Burnaby South.

Polls are open Monday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

Lee is running after Karen Wang stepped down earlier this year after singling out Singh’s ethnicity in an online post. Tyler Thompson, who ran unsuccessfully for a school trustee position on the Burnaby school board, is the first candidate seeking a seat for Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC.

Green party Leader Elizabeth May said her party will respect the “leader’s courtesy” by not running a candidate against Singh.

It could be a close election to watch. The New Democrats beat the Liberals by just over 500 votes in the riding in the 2015 election.

Byelections are also being held in the Ontario riding of York–Simcoe and the Quebec riding of Outremont.

On 5 January, lawmaker Juan Guaido was elected as the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which all other Venezuelan government branches have refused to recognize. On 23 January, two days after the Venezuelan Supreme Court annulled his election, Guaido declared himself the country's ""interim president"". Incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, who was sworn in for his second presidential term on 10 January after winning reelection in a contest partially boycotted by the opposition in May, qualified Guaido's move as an attempt to stage a coup orchestrated by Washington.

The United States immediately recognized Guaido, after which some 50 other countries followed suit. Russia, China, Cuba, Bolivia and a number of other states have, in the meantime, voiced their support for the legitimate government of constitutionally elected Maduro. Mexico and Uruguay have refused to recognize Guaido, declaring themselves neutral and promoting crisis settlement via dialogue.

US Vice President Mike Pence said in Colombia on Monday that the Trump administration was mulling new sanctions against Venezuela's government. Pence also urged Monday all Lima Group members to freeze the assets of Venezuela's oil giant PDVSA and restrict visas for Venezuelan officials. The US vice president also called on these countries to immediately transfer the ownership of Venezuelan assets from the government of incumbent President Nicolas Maduro to self-proclaimed Interim President Juan Guaido.

Earlier on Monday, the US Treasury Department sanctioned four Venezuelan governors.

The United States has imposed numerous rounds of sanctions on Venezuela. In January, Washington blocked around $7 billion in assets belonging to Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA. Maduro said that the restrictions were tantamount to illegal seizing.

The Lima Group of 14 countries was created in 2017 and currently seeks to end the political crisis in Venezuela. The group includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Guyana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Saint Lucia. The majority of the organization's member states are backing Guaido.

15,Empty,2019-02-22T04:14:06Z,Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's principal secretary Gerald Butts resigned on Monday amid a growing scandal concerning the allegations that PMO tried to interfere with the potential criminal trial of Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.,"Sputnik discussed this story with Rémi Tremblay, the editor of Le Harfang and a contributor to the Council of Euro-Canadian and the author of Le Canada français, de Jacques Cartier au génocide tranquille.

Sputnik: How seriously will the Trudeau scandal hurt his chances of victory in the next election? Do you think it is a coincidence that this scandal emerged just a few months before the election campaign will officially begin?

Rémi Tremblay: The timing could not be worst for the Liberals, with the elections being just around the corner. It is extremely hard to evaluate the impact on the vote, but ethics has always been the Achille's heel of the federal Liberals. One of the reasons that explain the Conservative victory of 2006 is the corruption scandal revealed by the Gomery commission of inquiry. It took ten years for the Liberals to finally regain Canadians' trust and this new scandal will certainly hurt them. The question is simply to what extent. To add to that, although the decision has nothing to do with politics, Stéphane Roy, a former SNC-Lavalin employee accused of being involved in the corruption scandal in Libya, has seen his charges dismissed this month because the judicial procedures were too long. For many Canadians, it gives the feeling that the men involved will be able to avoid facing justice for what they have done. It is hard to believe that the timing of the revelations is a coincidence, but we must keep in mind that it is the Globe and Mail that first unveiled this scandal to the public. The Globe can definitely not be labelled a Conservative newspaper. We can doubt that it was published to intentionally hurt Trudeau's campaign. In fact, Trudeau could have tried defusing the whole affair and ensured the story deflated quickly and be long forgotten by this fall's elections.

Rémi Tremblay: Butts, although he may not be well-known to the general public was Trudeau's policy maker, his mastermind as well as a close friend since McGill's years. In September 2015, Macleans ran an article about Butts, describing him as the man who ""has shaped and branded the vast majority of policy"" that Trudeau campaigned on. Since then, his influence has increased, not decreased and he was called ""PM Butts"" by some Liberal caucus members. Trudeau, who sees himself as a delegate, an ambassador, relied on Butts for actual policy-making and explained to his MPs that what Butts said could be considered to be Trudeau's own thoughts. Trudeau Senior had Gérard Pelletier, and Trudeau Junior had Gerald Butts.

Sputnik: Both other major parties (the Conservatives & NDP) have spoken out in support of a public inquiry into the Trudeau SNC-Lavalin scandal. Could this lead to new revelations?

Rémi Tremblay: The question that is still left unanswered is the personal involvement of Trudeau. The pressure on Jody Wilson-Raybould and the fact that she was subsequently downgraded to the Veteran Affairs, even if she had been a much publicized caucus member, shows that the pressure came from the top of the government. The resignation of Butts gives the impression that he was the one who actually put pressure to avoid prosecutions for SNC-Lavalin, but he could very well be taking the shot for his personal friend Trudeau. Has tried taking the blame to save private Trudeau? It is the impression left by the move and it is what the Conservatives and Neo-Democrats would like to know.

Ian Hammond / Change.org 'Seems Pricey': Canadians LOL as Petition to Sell Montana to Canada Gains Steam

Rémi Tremblay: The way the whole affair was handled by the government does raise legitimate questions. It is now said that the decision for not suing the company was based on economically based reasons. With around 16 000 employees in Canada, its bankruptcy or major losses could have had a major impact on the economy. However, it is extremely hard to believe that the Liberals did so for economic reasons. If it was so, they would probably have been open about it and not acted the way they did. If the reason was purely rational and for the benefits of Canadians, the Liberals would have been open and transparent about it and would not have pressured and later retrograded Wilson-Raybould.

The thing is the Liberals have had many issues with ethics and corruption in the last decades, so their credibility is limited at best. And we must not forget that SNC-Lavalin is itself accused of corruption. So the whole affair is suspicious, not to say more. As for SNC-Lavalin, allegations of corruption and fraud have been made several times in the past. Since 2010, it has been caught in a fraud linked to McGill's superhospital, bribery in Bengladesh, and was denied contracts by the World Banks because of wrongdoings in Cambodia. It has been hit by the longest ban ever imposed by the World Bank. So there again, it is far from being a spotless record and the credibility is questionable.

© Photo: YouTube/Hunter Gatherer Trigger Unknown: Canadian Woman on Bus Outraged by Absence of Gentlemen (VIDEO)

Rémi Tremblay: In my personal opinion, many media genuinely try to understand what is going on in Ottawa. No one saw the scandal coming and Butts' resignation was a unanimous surprise. We have seen some Canadian media trying to imply that Trudeau defended SNC-Lavalin because it was from the province of Quebec or much respected CBC explaining that this was damageable for Trudeau as he had lost his only Native minister, but they really miss the point. They just prove how narrow minded they are and the CBC has truly ridiculed itself with that analysis.

What is important to note though is that most media focus on the surface: how Trudeau has handled the affair since the Globe's revelation. But this goes deeper than that. This whole affair first raises the question of corruption in Canada, an issue that is closely linked with the Liberal Party, and also the separation between justice and politics. There again, the questions raised seemed very important. Why does a politician have the power to stop prosecution or alter the course of justice? Talking about the lack of Native representation in Ottawa is a convenient way out of this debate.

Singh is standing in a by-election in Burnaby South in the Vancouver metropolitan area, a crucial test for the New Democratic Party (NDP) leader ahead of October’s general elections. He is by no means a dead cert to win: at the last federal legislative vote, in 2015, the party won this seat by a mere 500 votes. And in Monday’s by-election, the two main parties, the centre-left Liberals and the Conservatives, have put up candidates against Singh, breaking with the tradition that other parties do not run candidates against leaders.

Canadian politics operates according to the Westminster model, in which the executive is drawn from the legislature – so party leaders must have a seat in the House of Commons before they can become prime minister.

He became leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP) in October 2017, winning a plurality of the vote in the first round, six years after taking a seat in the Ontario provincial parliament.

‘We need to rethink what it means to be secular’

Singh was born in 1979, to parents from India’s Punjab region. Fluent in Hindi and Punjab as well as Canada’s official languages English and French, he grew up in Newfoundland on Canada’s sparsely populated east coast, before his family moved to the town of Windsor, Ontario, just across the US border.

After being called to the bar in 2006, Singh worked as a defence lawyer in the Toronto area until his election to the Ontario legislature. He has credited this work – especially pro bono work for underprivileged clients – as inspiring him to enter politics.

Indeed, Singh’s political platform is focused on social democratic policies aimed at reducing poverty and inequality. Notably, he advocates increasing the national minimum wage to 15 Canadian dollars (10 euros) per hour, legalising possession of all drugs (on the grounds that “it is not a criminal justice problem” but “a social justice problem and a healthcare problem”) and the removal of tax deductions on higher-rate taxpayers.

The NDP leader has also attracted attention with his opposition to Quebec’s proposed ban on public sector workers wearing religious symbols – which would prevent him from wearing his turban if he worked for the state in the French-speaking province. In an interview with CBC, the Canadian public service broadcaster, Singh argued that “we need to rethink what it means to be secular”, and said he feels he can wear a turban to work while still following Canadian secularism. On a Québécois talk show he added that “my objective is never to convince someone else to accept my identity – it’s to convince people that I share the same progressive values as them”.

‘A very telegenic, easy-to-like guy’

Analysts say that Singh communicates his agenda with considerable charisma. “His leadership can be seen as refreshing. People saw him as this very telegenic, easy-to-like guy, who might be able to compete on the celebrity level with Trudeau,” Lori Turnbull, the director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University, told the Guardian.

Yet – for all his charisma and forthright views on such issues as drugs and secularism – it seems likely that Singh will face a tough challenge in October’s general elections. An aggregate of voter intention surveys by specialist website Calculated Politics on February 21 predicts that the NDP will win a paltry 26 seats, compared to 156 for the Liberals and 141 for the Tories. By contrast, the New Democrats managed to win 44 seats in the 2015 elections.

In a column for Canadian daily the National Post, editorialist Chris Selley pointed out that the New Democrats’ may be polling poorly despite – not because of – Singh’s leadership: “The NDP has always been a party of contradictions not so much a big tent as a tent city. It’s supposed to be a party of both champagne socialists and farmers, of both autoworkers and environmentalists, of both staunch multiculturalists and Quebec nationalists.”

Selley also argued that “if Singh wins his seat, there is reason to hope he might grow into the job. To skeptics [sic] he evinces a distinctly Trudeauvian brand of superficiality, and a similar gift for quotes that land well but fall to pieces if you actually read them back. That hasn’t hurt Trudeau, though.”

Singh has vociferously called for a public inquiry over the SNC-Lavalin scandal, in which Trudeau has alleged to have pressured the justice minister – who subsequently resigned – to help the Montreal-based engineering firm avoid criminal prosecution on corruption charges. However, it remains to be seen whether the NDP leader can capitalise on this issue ahead of the October elections.","Jagmeet Singh, Canada’s ‘Trudeauvian challenger to Trudeau’",France24.com,https://www.france24.com/en/20190224-jagmeet-singh-canada-trudeau-ndp-politics

Singh addressed his supporters, saying “My friends, it’s a new day. It’s a new day,” and promising to take the issues of Burnaby residents to Ottawa.

Singh said many Canadians are falling behind, despite working hard, and they are starting to become fearful for themselves and their children.

He said some people will use that fear to “point at your neighbours, the people you live with, the people you work with.”

Singh said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was trying to protect his “friends at SNC-Lavalin” and subsidizing big oil. He said Canadians are drowning in debt, as he attacked corporations, saying the Liberals and Conservatives are not helping Canadians.

“Times up,” Singh said. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”

The results

Singh has 38.7 per cent of 20,346 votes counted, enough to be declared the winner.

There are 76,204 registered voters in the riding. 181 of 196 polls have been counted so far, representing 92 per cent of the vote.

Singh was up against Liberal Richard T. Lee, Conservative Jay Shin, independent candidates Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu, and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson.

In the 2015 federal election, the NDP won with 35 per cent of the vote, with the Liberals taking 33.9 per cent, the Conservatives 27.1 per cent, Greens 2.8 per cent and 1.1 per cent for the Libertarian party.

Lee has 26 per cent of the votes counted so far. The right-wing vote appears to be split, with Shin so far holding 22.7 per cent of the vote and Thompson with 10.9 per cent. Thompson is the first candidate seeking a seat for former Conversative Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC.

“Singh, Singh, Singh!”

Postmedia News reporter Matt Robinson said Singh supporters broke out into spontaneous chants of “Singh, Singh, Singh”, prior to Singh taking the podium at the election night party at the Metrotown Hilton.

Vancouver-Kingsway MP Don Davies has earlier taken the mic with an optimistic: “Welcome to the victory party.”

Peter Julian, MP for New Westminster-Burnaby, said with voters giving Singh the seat, “they’re saying they want a fighter. They’re saying they want someone who will stand up when the government makes bad choices.”

Jenny Kwan, a former and longtime MLA and now MP in Singh’s party, said “it’s a very exciting night. It’s one we’ve been waiting for for a long time. I know that Jag is so looking forward to going to Ottawa.

“We need a voice in the House of Commons that is on the side of the people and we haven’t had that with the Liberals and not with the Conservatives.”

Second place for Lee

Postmedia reporter Dan Fumano was with supporters of Liberal candidate Lee at the Delta Hotel.

Harjit Sajjan, the Liberal MP for Vancouver South an the Minister of National Defence, was at Lee’s event Monday night. Sajjan said he was happy to support Lee, who he described as a “humble, great person” and “I’ve had the opportunity to go door-knocking with him as well,” Sajjan told Postmedia.

“His compassion that he has for his community, that’s what really, I think, sets him apart.”

The Greens did not run a candidate in this byelection in order to improve the chances of an NDP win.

Burnaby South was vacated by former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart last October, when he was voted in as Vancouver’s mayor.

Quick things to know

• In the 2015 election, the New Democrats beat the Liberals in this riding by just over 500 votes.

• Lee announced he would be running after Karen Wang stepped down earlier this year after singling out Singh’s ethnicity in an online post.

• Tyler Thompson, who ran unsuccessfully for a school trustee position on the Burnaby school board, was the first candidate to seek a seat for Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC. She has been vocal against SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity) education in B.C.’s education curriculum.

• Green party Leader Elizabeth May had said her party will respect the “leader’s courtesy” by not running a candidate against Singh.

The company announced the development via a blog post by the company’s corporate vice president, Customer Security & Trust, Tom Burt.



AccountGuard service, which is already available in the U.K. and Ireland, has now been extended to 12 new European countries, namely Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, Lithuania, Portugal, Spain and Slovakia.



Notably, the service is accessible across the United States and Canada.



AccountGuard Features & Benefits



Microsoft AccountGuard is developed to provide highly targeted individuals and organizations in the political space with robust protection from cybersecurity threats. The service is free of cost “to eligible organizations” and other enterprises utilizing Office 365 email address.



Per the terms of AccountGuard service, the customers will be notified and provided with recommendations in case a threat is verified. The customers are also anticipated to benefit from security guidance and associated practices, including access to cybersecurity workshops and webinars.



We believe Microsoft’s expansion of AccountGuard offering is well-timed, given the uncertainty regarding Brexit and European Parliament elections around the corner. The fact that selection of the new free service complements Office 365 adoption makes it a smart move.



Into the Headlines



Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (“DCU”) and Threat Intelligence Center (“MSTIC”) have recently identified “activity targeting democratic institutions in Europe”.



Microsoft notes that the attempts to disrupt elections is broad-based and is not just limited to democratic institutes but also targets education institutes, think tanks and non-profit organizations.



In fact, the company claims to have identified attacks targeting employees of The Aspen Institutes in Europe, The German Marshall Fund and the German Council on Foreign Relations.



Microsoft claims to have notified the concerned organizations of the phishing attempt. The company is of the opinion that the group it calls “Strontium” is behind the cyber attacks which took place “between September and December 2018.”



In this regard it is important to note that in the recent past, Microsoft’s solid execution to thwart Russia’s attempts to disrupt U.S. mid-term elections has been commendable. Notably, Strontium is also suspected to be responsible for the 2016 Democratic National Committee (“DNC”) email leak.



In the past two years, Microsoft has disabled over 84 fake websites connected with the group, known variously as Fancy Bear, APT28 or Strontium.



What the Investors Need To Know?



The growing need for stringent security measures will compel governments and enterprises to increase spending on cyber-security software.



Going ahead, higher spending on defense globally in 2019 as reflected in the latest Deloitte study is anticipated to boost innovative cybersecurity schemes.



Moreover, there is an underlined correlation of increasing cyber attacks and elections primarily in democratic nations. With European Parliament elections around the corner and the Presidential elections in the United States in 2020, demand for cyber security solutions is projected to grow.



In fact, per MarketsandMarkets data, worldwide cyber-security spending is anticipated to reach $231.94 billion by 2022. Microsoft’s initiatives in cybersecurity position it well to capitalize on the alluring prospects.

To Conclude



Microsoft is assessing various opportunities wisely and devising strategies to fortify its position in the technology sector. The company’s efforts in digitizing retail outlets, revolutionizing education mechanisms, among others highlight its well-versed technology capabilities.



In fact, its plans to up the ante in cybersecurity with AccountGuard solution are a welcome move. With these initiatives, we believe Microsoft’s brand reputation is likely to get a boost.

I WAS one of four African trade unionists who observed the 2002 Zimbabwean Presidential elections under the African Union Observer Mission. The international observers including those from Nigeria, led by former Head of Interim Government, Chief Ernest Shonekan, met daily at the Sheraton Hotel to compare notes. There was a consensus that the elections in which President Robert Mugabe had 54 per cent and opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai had 40 per cent, were free and fair. It was, therefore, a shock when the Commonwealth Observer Mission led by former Nigerian Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, had a contrary report; one that was not based on observed facts.

Ukraine’s farcical drama

Based on this contrived report, then Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, Australian Prime Minister, John Howard and South African President Thabo Mbeki, announced the suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth claiming the elections were “marred by a high level of politically motivated violence.” Violence that was not visible to other international observers.

This confirmed my position that nothing involving human beings is value-free. Yes, humans can be objective, but in a subjective way. It is like journalism; the journalist is charged to be objective because ‘facts are sacred’. However, the angle he picks his report, the type of headline cast and the way he interprets the story, cannot be entirely objective. So it is with election monitors and observers. For example, in the 2015 Nigeria elections, the international observers were supposed to have done a clinical job. But the biases of their home governments were quite visible.

These included the refusal to sell the Jonathan government arms to fight the Boko Haram, obstructing the sale of arms by other countries and making statements that seemed innocuous, but clearly tilting towards the then opposition All Progessives Congress, APC. The international observers who are mainly Western or Western-funded, picked their cue from these. The APC benefitted from this as it coasted home to victory assisted by a gentleman President Goodluck Jonathan who insisted that his ambition for a second term was not worth the blood of a single Nigerian.

When, therefore, Western countries began to make the same seemingly innocuous statements in the run up to tomorrow’s Presidential elections, the ruling APC could see through the smokescreen and started shouting about ‘foreign intervention’. Interestingly, it does not see the visit of two governors from Niger Republic to campaign for Buhari, as foreign intervention.

The current drama began on November 18, 2018 when the European Union, EU, and some 24 countries, including the United States of America, USA, United Kingdom, UK, France, Germany, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden, issued a statement which stated in part: “As friends of Nigeria and its people, we will follow the campaigns and election process closely.

Who wins the elections is for the Nigerian people to decide. Our concern is to see a process leading to free, fair, transparent and peaceful elections. We hope to see transparent campaigns and we urge all voters to use their democratic right and vote… We urge all involved to refrain from using hate speech and take a firm stance against violence.”

The APC which had tried in vain to prevent the January 17, visit to the USA by the opposition People’s Democratic Party, PDP, Presidential Candidate, Alhaji Abubakar Atiku, could take it no more when the EU, UK and USA criticised the January 25 controversial suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen by President Buhari. Given this unprecedented Executive action, the countries had worried about the credibility of the Presidential elections.

The ruling APC’s Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State who claims to be close to President Buhari, sent out a chilling message to the Western countries and their observers: “Those that are calling for anyone to come and intervene in Nigeria, we are waiting for the person that would come and intervene, they would go back in body bags…Nobody will come to Nigeria and tell us how to run our country. We have got our independence and we are trying to run our country as decently as possible and we know the history of those countries that are trying to teach us.”

To demonstrate that the governor had official backing, the APC National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu affirmed to the press that: “what Governor El-Rufai said, clearly, is the position of this government.” The Presidency also backed El-Rufai. Presidential Spokesperson, Mallam Garba Shehu in a rather ambiguous statement said: “The governor spoke strongly in defence of national interest.” In reaction, the obviously rattled Western Observers opted to stay rather than flee the country. It was left for President Buhari to assure the observers of their safety.

But I do not think the foreign observers should worry too much as they will not be the only ones in body bags; President Buhari has said those who try to disturb the electoral process or snatch ballot boxes, would also find themselves in body bags. He told the APC National Executive Council meeting this Monday: “Anybody who decides to snatch ballot boxes or lead thugs to disturb it (elections), maybe that would be the last unlawful action he would take. I have directed the police and the military to be ruthless…I am going to warn anybody who thinks he has enough influence in his locality to lead a body of thugs to snatch boxes or to disturb the voting system, he would do it at the expense of his own life.”

But who really puts much stock on what election observers think? Usually, they sanctify election results on the basis that they ‘substantially comply’ with democratic rules. In very rare cases, they cast doubts on the results. For instance, the West condemned the results of the December 30, 2018 Presidential Elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Belgium threatened to drag the country before the United Nations Security Council while French Foreign Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, claimed that the results “do not conform with the results that we have noticed.” That did not stop the country from swearing in President Felix Tshisekedi.

Nigeria should consider itself lucky that the West is here to observe our elections. When Venezuela conducted its May 20, 2018 general elections and invited the EU and UN to observe, it was ignored. That did not stop the EU, USA and their allies from condemning the elections as fraudulent and recognising a fraudster who did not even contest the elections as “Acting President.”

If the foreign observers do not want to return home in body bags, they should allow Nigerians to democratically choose tomorrow, who can better stop the massacres, banditry, insecurity and impunity in the country.","Nigeria, politics of elections and International Observers",Vanguardngr.com,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2019/02/nigeria-politics-of-elections-and-international-observers/

The US vice-president, Mike Pence, has repeated a veiled threat of military intervention in Venezuela, but Washington appeared increasingly isolated in its willingness to contemplate using force to oust President Nicolás Maduro.

European powers and some of Donald Trump’s key Latin American allies – all of whom have recognised the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as Venezuela’s legitimate leader – warned that they would oppose sending troops into the country.

Guaidó had for weeks insisted his movement was focused on peaceful, democratic change. But after the opposition failed in a weekend bid to defy Caracas and bring aid into the country, he called on the international community to “keep all options open”.

That hint at the use of military force won an enthusiastic response from hawks like US senator Marco Rubio, but sparked alarm elsewhere, particularly as Trump has previously mooted ordering an invasion.

Speaking at an emergency summit of regional leaders in the Colombian capital Bogotá, Pence renewed the threat of intervention, describing Maduro as “a usurper”, and calling for a global push to oust him.

“To leaders around the world: it’s time. There can be no bystanders in Venezuela’s struggle for freedom,” he said. “We hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But beyond the US, few appear willing embrace the prospect of violence. In Latin America, there is a painful and bloody history of US interventions, and the terrible fallout from the 2003 invasion of Iraq is another deterrent to the use of military force.

An invasion would be complicated and bloody, with a strong chance of sliding into protracted civil war. Venezuela has armed forces that are more than 300,000 strong, thousands more members of pro-government gangs or guerrilla groups, complex terrain – and a government that still has some support from international partners including China and Russia.

Brazil’s vice-president, retired general Hamilton Mourão, said on Monday that under no circumstances would his country allow the United States to intervene militarily from Brazilian territory, even though the country’s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro has previously vowed to do “everything for democracy to be re-established” in Venezuela.

Colombian president Iván Duque has also now ruled out intervention, according to sources in his administration. Chile and Peru were among other regional powers opposing military action on Monday.

There was similar concern across the Atlantic, where European nations including Spain and Germany made clear they considered the deployment of troops a line that should not be crossed.

“Not every option is on the table,” the country’s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, told the Spanish news agency Efe on Sunday, in a blunt rebuke to both Guaidó and US supporters of intervention.

The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, insisted there could be no military solution to a political crisis.

“The origins of the ongoing crisis in Venezuela are political and institutional, hence the solution can only be a political one,” she said in a statement. “We reiterate our firm rejection and condemnation of violence and of any initiatives that can further destabilise the region.”

Before the meeting of the Lima group of Latin American powers and Canada, Pence told Guaidó, attending as Venezuela’s interim president: “We are 100% with you.”

The Lima group also said credible threats have been made against the life of Venezuelan opposition leader Guaidó and his family, adding that President Nicolas Maduro was responsible for Guaido’s safety.",'Maduro must go': Pence bids to ramp up effort to oust Venezuelan leader,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/apos-maduro-must-apos-pence-193214527.html
21,Empty,2019-02-21T13:21:00Z,Strong cases can be made for owning or avoiding the most polarizing pot stock in the world.,"After years of being stuck behind the curtain of prohibition, the legal cannabis industry is finally thriving. In October, Canada became the first industrialized country, and the second overall behind Uruguay, to legalize recreational pot. It was followed not long after by a handful of U.S. states legalizing or expanding access to cannabis in the November midterm elections, and President Trump signing the Farm Bill into law in December, giving the green light to hemp and hemp-based products.

Just how big could the legal weed industry be? While estimates are all over the place, investment firm Cowen Group offers the most robust sales prediction of $75 billion in worldwide sales by 2030. Meanwhile, a co-authored report from Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics is calling for $31.3 billion in global sales by 2022, up from $12.8 billion in 2018.

Figures like these are what has made Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) the most popular stock among millennial investors on free-trading app Robinhood. However, there's probably also no stock that's more polarizing to investors as a whole than Aurora Cannabis. You either think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread, or you find it grossly overvalued, with few if any investors taking a middle-of-the-road stance.

Three very good reasons Aurora Cannabis could make you rich

With this in mind, below you'll find three arguments in favor of buying one of the largest publicly traded pot stocks in the world. Afterwards, I'll tackle three arguments against buying Aurora Cannabis.

If there's a clear top reason to buy into the Aurora Cannabis growth story, it's the company's peak production potential. Although Aurora's management team has guided to ""in excess of 500,000 kilograms"" annually when running on all cylinders, it's hard to see the company near a figure this low. Rather, management had been calling for 570,000 kilos prior to the purchase of ICC Labs in South America for 264 million Canadian dollars late last year. With 92,000 square feet of existing production and 1.1 million square feet of under-construction greenhouse capacity, ICC Labs should help push Aurora close to 700,000 kilograms per year.

Even though production isn't everything, the company's sheer amount of annual output should help lead to ample long-term supply deals with domestic provinces and overseas countries where medical weed is legal. Also, the cannabis industry tends to benefit from economies of scale. This suggests that as production rises, Aurora's per-gram production costs should fall.

Also, Aurora has perhaps the most impressive overseas footprint of any marijuana grower. Having recently reported its quarterly results, Aurora now has a presence in 23 countries on five continents. Being able to export weed to overseas markets will become incredibly important by early next decade when growers are fully operational and licensed, and domestic output handily outpaces Canadian demand. In order to avoid a serious decline in per-gram dried flower pricing, growers need foreign outlets to sell their product. Aurora has done a remarkable job of finding these outlets, which should help somewhat shield it from a decline in dried cannabis flower pricing.

The third reason Aurora Cannabis looks to be a buy is the company's focus on the medical marijuana community. Whereas a substantial majority of Canopy Growth's sales in its most recent quarter were from the recreational side of the business, Aurora still counted more medical weed sales (CA$26 million) than adult-use sales (CA$21.6 million) in its latest quarter. Though the consumer pool is smaller for medical marijuana, the product margins tend to be significantly higher. That's because medical weed patients are more willing to purchase higher-margin alternative consumption options, such as softgel capsules, oil products, and eventually cannabis-infused beverages and/or edibles. By making medical marijuana patients a priority, Aurora appears to be setting itself up for superior operating margins.

Three arguments why Aurora will send its investors to the poor house

Of course, there are two sides to every argument. Here's a look under the hood at why Aurora Cannabis may not be such a blazing-hot buy.

To begin with, it's a company that's been blessed with a couple of quarters of profitability due to one-time benefits, but that's been losing money hand over fist on an operating basis. As an active acquirer and company that's aiming to expand overseas, Aurora's expenses to construct and retrofit greenhouses, and establish overseas sales channels, are immense. Mind you, this doesn't include growing costs for sales and marketing, the addition of new employees, and the ongoing focus on branding and innovation. In other words, it could be some time before Aurora Cannabis is generating a meaningful per-share profit, and an operating profit without the aid of one-time benefits.

Secondly, Aurora Cannabis remains in the shadows in the partnership department. Whereas Canopy Growth landed a $4 billion equity investment from Constellation Brands, Cronos Group snagged a $1.8 billion equity stake from Altria, and HEXO formed a joint venture with Molson Coors Brewing, the largest producer by peak output is still by itself in the corner. There were reports that Coca-Cola was interested in a partnership or possible equity stake in Aurora this past September, but a deal was never reached. Without a brand-name partner with a keen marketing prowess, Aurora could struggle to gain the same validity as its peers.

Third and finally -- and you knew this was coming -- there's the ongoing share-based dilution. Until recently, pot stocks have had minimal or no access to nondilutive forms of financing, such as lines of credit or bank loans. Instead, they've often turned to bought-deal offerings, which involve selling common stock, convertible debentures, options, and/or warrants to raise capital to undertake their expansion strategy. While these offerings are successful, they also wind up ballooning a company's outstanding share count, which weighs on existing investors and pushes down the earnings per share of profitable companies. Aurora's outstanding share count is now just a stone's throw from 1 billion when it was at 16 million less than five years ago.

Following President Nicolás Maduro's inauguration for a disputed second term in January, the speaker of the opposition-dominated parliament, Juan Guaidó declared himself ""interim president"" of the country.

Guaidó was immediately recognised by the US, Canada and a group of Latin American conservative governments, who called upon the Venezuelan military to rise up against Maduro. The UK, France, Spain, Germany and other European countries also recognised Guaidó after Maduro rejected their demand for fresh elections. Paredes, who presented his credentials to President Hage Geingob at State House last week, said the situation is normal, while accusing external forces for attempting to cause political instability in Venezuela.

""If you visit the main cities in Venezuela, you can see people going to work, the kids going to school. Unfortunately, foreign forces are trying to create instability in the country,"" he told New Era and NBC in an interview.

""One of the topics I discussed with President Hage Geingob, who is also the Chairperson of Sadc [Southern African Development Community] was to thank him on behalf of the government of President Nicolás Maduro and the people of Venezuela for his brave and strong support,"" Paredes said.

Last month, Namibia added her voice to growing international concern over the situation in Venezuela, calling on the international community to allow the Venezuelans to resolve their internal issues in an amicable and peaceful manner.

Namibia's Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah at the time said the international community should allow the people of Venezuela to resolve their internal issues within the confines of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

""Namibia has been following with great concern the political developments in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The concern is that the political developments are arising from the unwarranted interference in the domestic affairs of Venezuela by foreign powers,"" Nandi-Ndaitwah said.

Paredes noted that Namibia's support is well received by the democratic institutions in Venezuela as it supports the truth, adding Maduro last year was elected with more than 67 percent of the voters in a process where more than a million people participated in the elections.

He said the African Union (AU) also send a delegation who validated the results. Hence, he said the position of the African countries was very important for the true democratic processes and respect of the international law and the United Nations charter. Since Guaidó's declaration, US President Donald Trump's administration has imposed new sanctions on Maduro's government, seized billions-worth of Venezuelan oil-related assets on US soil, and started making barely veiled threats of military intervention.

Paredes admitted that the country is experiencing hyperinflation due to economic blockade and sanctions imposed by unilateral position of the government of the United States.

According to him, the Venezuela economy has lost more than U$30 billion in the last few years. ""So please tell me which country in the world can resist an impact on their economy with such criminal blockade against our financial institutions and oil industry. That is why we are seeing the challenges in our economy. Despite, this situation, our government never stopped providing assistance to the poor people through social programmes in education, health, housing and in other sectors to stabilise our country,"" he noted.

Because of challenges emanating from the hyperinflation, more than three million Venezuelans are said to have fled the country, causing consternation across the continent.

On Saturday, clashes broke out in Venezuelan border towns, as government allegedly blocked humanitarian aid from crossing from Colombia and Brazil.

Venezuelan opposition leader and self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido will personally accompany a convoy of humanitarian aid currently stationed at the Colombian border as it makes its way into Venezuela on Saturday, Reuters has reported.

According to fellow opposition lawmaker and Guaido ally Edgar Zambrano, the opposition plans to bring the aid in by land and sea to alleviate shortages of food and medicine.

""We will go around the circumstances that arise along the way…constitution in hand, accompanying Guaido,"" Zambrano vowed, speaking in a square in eastern Caracas on Thursday.

It remains unclear just how Guaido and his fellow opposition leaders plan to pass into Venezuela, with the country's military declaring Tuesday that it would be ""on alert"" for any violations of Venezuela's territorial integrity amid plans by opposition-backed groups to bring humanitarian assistance into the country.

On Wednesday, Trump National Security Adviser John Bolton told the Venezuelan military not to ""condone or instigate violence against peaceful civilians at the Colombian and Brazilian borders"" and to ""allow them to peacefully bring in humanitarian aid,"" warning that any infractions ""will not be forgotten.""

© REUTERS / Jorge Silva Tankers Pile Up in Gulf of Mexico Due to US Sanctions on Venezuelan Oil – Report

The Venezuelan government has described Mr Guaido's presidential claims as an attempted coup d'état, and blasted Washington over its talk about bringing millions of dollars of humanitarian aid into the country while freezing billions in Venezuelan assets abroad and funding the opposition via a special account using oil money from the country's state-owned PDVSA oil company.

Earlier, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro warned that the US and its allies were using ""the pretext of delivering humanitarian aid"" to try to ""destroy the independence and sovereignty of the country."" Caracas would not allow such aid into the country, Maduro said, saying the country was coping with its difficulties and that US 'concerns' over Venezuela's humanitarian crisis were ""fabricated by Washington over the last four years to justify intervening in our country.""

The long-running crisis in Venezuela escalated late last month, after Guaido, leader of the semi-defunct opposition-controlled National Assembly, declared himself interim president pending snap elections. The US, Canada, and numerous US allies in Latin America and Europe rushed to support Guiado, while Russia, China, Iran, Cuba, Nicaragua, Turkey, Syria and others voiced their support for the Maduro government, and urged outside powers not to interfere in the Latin American country's internal affairs.",Juan Guaido to Personally Accompany 'Aid' Convoy Into Venezuela - Lawmaker,Sputniknews.com,https://sputniknews.com/latam/201902211072630527-guaido-to-accompany-aid-convoy-reports/
26,Empty,2019-02-22T13:00:39Z,"Convincing voters is one thing, but Singh's fate may rest on whether his party is well-enough funded and organized to get those voters to the polls.","The only candidate who lives in Burnaby South and is able to vote in Monday’s federal byelection is the guy who has come the longest way to contest it, and has the most to prove and the most to lose.

Despite a history as an NDP stronghold with decades of the party’s federal and municipal politicians in control, Burnaby South is far from a safe bet for NDP leader Jagmeet Singh.

His path to a win got harder when the Liberals’ first candidate resigned over racist remarks and the party appointed Richard T. Lee, who for four terms represented the provincial riding with similar boundaries.

And, for weeks now, members of Singh’s own party (including former leader Tom Mulcair) have openly talked about the Plan B that is in place in case Singh loses.

Canada’s two NDP premiers are feuding over pipelines, with Singh having sided with B.C.’s John Horgan in opposing the twinning of an existing pipeline, which Alberta’s Rachel Notley says is essential for her province.

The split intensified this week with Singh’s support for the $40-billion LNG Canada project in northern B.C. challenged by both Svend Robinson, the Burnaby North-Seymour NDP candidate in October’s federal election, and Julia Sanchez, who is running for the NDP in the Outremont byelection.

With all this going on, it’s fair to say that some party stalwarts are sitting out this byelection in a riding that the NDP barely held on to in 2015.

But fortune may still favour the Ontario-born Singh. The Liberals appear to be in meltdown, especially with all the questions about what exactly happened between former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, the prime minister and his staff regarding SNC-Lavalin’s attempts to halt a federal prosecution.

As for the Conservatives, they seem to be spending a lot more time scrapping it out with Maxime Bernier’s nascent People’s Party of Canada than focusing on either Singh or the Liberals.

While environment is a top-of-mind issue here, at street level it’s housing.

In Burnaby South, 22 per cent of the residents fall below the low-income cut-off line, six percentage points higher than the Metro Vancouver average. Nearly one in four residents spends more than a third of their household income on housing.

And when you look at the average income and the average house price, the gap is unbridgeable.

As the only candidate with a home in the riding, Singh has firsthand knowledge of how hard it is to get a place to live — a problem that he says is driving the insecurity and fears of many Canadians.

Singh lost out on several rentals because he didn’t show up with a cheque for the first months’ rent. It was only after friends interceded and vouched his ability to pay the second month’s rent that Singh managed to get a place.

The riding is a perfect foil for NDP campaign promises of 500,000 units of affordable housing in the next decade, immediate investments in co-ops and non-market housing, elimination of GST on developments with a significant amount of affordable units, an increase in the first-time homebuyers’ tax credit, and relief for renters whose housing costs exceed 30 per cent of their income.

Of course, there is no chance that Singh can make any of that happen. With his party so low in the polls nationally, the best that Singh may be able to do even after the fall federal election is to push either the Liberals or the Conservatives to steal his best ideas.

But it’s immigration that has drawn the heat at all-candidates meetings.

In 2017, 13-year-old Marissa Shen was murdered in 2017 and Syrian refugee Ibrahim Ali has been charged. The case has fuelled worries about Canada’s screening of refugees and ignited ugly comments by both candidates and their supporters at raucous community gatherings.

It’s a potent issue in a riding where 54 per cent of the residents are immigrants. Of those, 89 per cent came for economic opportunity or for family reunification.

People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Thompson has poured the most fuel on the fire, even though the Conservatives have staked it as one of their election issues. Meantime, the Tory candidate, Jay Shin, a Korean-Canadian, has tried to retain social conservatives from defecting to Thompson, a Christian TV talk show host, with brochures in English and Chinese highlighting PPC leader Maxime Bernier’s support for an NDP bill to expunge past pot convictions, and that Marc Emery, the so-called “Prince of pot”, is one of his prominent supporters.

Thompson has responded with a complaint to Elections Canada saying she doesn’t support either cannabis legalization or supervised injection sites.

Singh’s challenges are considerable. He must convince voters that he can be their most effective representative in Ottawa.

But he also needs his party’s members to believe in his leadership strongly enough that they will be there Monday to mobilize voters.

Because with voter turnout traditionally low in byelections, Singh’s fate rests as much on that as it is does on anything else.

About 48 hours later – and after weeks, if not months of repeatedly assuring the public that the commission was ready – he unexpectedly announced a one-week postponement of the elections. He set himself up not just for a fresh round of execution but also to have his remains burnt at the electoral stake.

The Yakubu picking up the pieces and rallying his team to fix Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections through a purgatory of remedial steps is a Yakubu in a bad place. Only after the elections have been successfully conducted at the same time in the 36 states and Abuja and the results announced will Mahmood Yakubu begin to get his life back.

It’s pointless going over the details of what happened. That’s old story. We have been told that a combination of logistics nightmare, bad weather – and possibly sabotage – made it impossible to go ahead with the polls last week. This was the official version. The conspiracy theories, like most conspiracy theories, were far more complicated, and even surreal.

While the version peddled in Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, circles claimed that the postponement was the fallout of resistance by Yakubu to give in to pressure by the ruling APC to stagger the elections, starting with 26 states, the common version in All Progressives Congress, APC, circles was that PDP moles in INEC compromised the system by deliberately mis-dispatching or delaying the dispatch of election materials to APC strongholds. The only things constant are Yakubu’s name and politicians’ desperation.

The promise made

I think Yakubu understands that unlike his predecessor, Attahiru Jega, he would not get another chance. He understands that unlike 2007 when significant amounts of electoral materials arrived in the country from South Africa one week after the election, voters deserve a better deal and that’s what he promised them.

He understands that unlike 2011 when the election was postponed hours after voting had commenced, or 2015 when the country was forced to shift the vote for six weeks for security reasons, voters will not accept any further excuses because that’s not what he promised them. Yakubu promised results. He promised free, fair and credible elections that will deepen voter confidence.

He has done well so far. On his watch the commission has conducted 195 rerun and off-season elections, recording fewer court-ordered re-elections than in any other elections in the last two cycles. He has recorded the largest expansion in the voter roll through continuous registration and, for the first time, made significant changes to help the physically challenged have easier access.

He has successfully planned and faithfully executed 13 of the 14 items on the 2019 election timetable, though the cost of tripping on the last task could be more disastrous that the sum total of his success so far. Yakubu has stood his grounds against party principalities and powers battling the commission in hundreds of court cases, insisting that the legal challenge, though costly, is essential to safeguard the commission’s integrity and independence.

Where the devil lies

It would appear, however, that the toughest battles he has to fight are not against politicians, who are his known enemies. The battles may not even be against the weather or logistics supply, however daunting these factors may be in a country plagued by poor infrastructure. These are small potatoes. From what he left unsaid about the possibility of a sabotage, his toughest battle may well be against insiders who betrayed him and the system in favour of politicians desperate to win at all costs. If nothing happens to the conduits inside INEC – the wolves in sheep’s clothing – the system will remain in danger. Not a witch hunt. I’m talking about a thorough root-and-branch investigation that strips every tribal covering and reveals the fraudsters for the danger they truly are.It doesn’t matter how many peace accords they sign, politicians won’t do INEC the favour of making its work easy. Politicians are in the game to win, by means fair and crooked. In their desperation they value thugs above heroes and moles above methods. But the good thing is that unlike the conduits within the commission, politicians are enemies in plain sight.If it’s true, as Yakubu said, that the commission was not under any political influence and he put his reputation on the line by repeatedly assuring voters that everything was on course, then he has serious work to do. He must fish out those in the system who seduced him with a false hope. The danger is both human and systemic.

Yakubu’s head

Some have said Yakubu should go. I disagree. We had false starts in two previous election cycles (2011 and 2015), and a near disaster in 2007 when election materials arrived in the country after the elections, forcing three out of seven Supreme Court justices to declare the results of the election a sham. We have to do more than sacrifice one man’s head to get things right: we’ll also have to examine the system closely.

The Justice Muhammed Uwais report is probably the most audacious attempt in the last 20 years to reform the electoral system, bringing it close to what exists in plural, multi-party democracies like Ghana, South Africa, India and Canada.

A number of the recommendations by the Uwais committee, including moving INEC’s funding to first line charge; use of biometrics; and continuous registration of voters, among others, have already been implemented. These changes have brought tremendous improvements to the quality of elections in the country.

An important aspect of the committee’s work, still untouched, however, is the unbundling of the commission. This aspect came to light again this week. Uwais recommended the creation of three other commissions from the existing one: one to register and regulate political parties; the other to deal with electoral offences; and the last one to handle constituency delimitation.

Unbundling INEC?

Will an “unbundled” INEC be more efficient? Will it save the country from the sort of embarrassment witnessed last week?

I doubt it. From Ghana to South Africa and from Canada to India, the election commissions perform largely similar functions with their Nigerian counterpart, though in South Africa and Canada, they are primarily answerable to the legislature.

INEC is inefficient because it has added to its own inherent problems the incompetence of other commissions set up to do precisely what it is now doing. It is plagued by the self-inflicted virus of bureaucracy-litis – the condition of adding the jobs of other failed bureaucracies to its own.

Two examples will suffice. If the National Population Commission, NPC, was doing its job, why would INEC spend billions of naira to continuously vet or update the voter register when the data could easily have been obtained from the NPC? The NPC has 22 commissioners with SUVs, fat allowances and big offices, yet the commission has not conducted a census in the last 13 years. It doesn’t even have reliable data on births and deaths.

The National Boundary Commission, NBC, is also another national joke. There are members of the commission who only remember that it exists either when they’re drawing their allowances or when they’re sending their wards or cronies to get jobs or contracts from there.

What’s the point creating new commissions from INEC that will do the jobs of the NPC, NBC or the NIMC except to multiply incompetence? If these three agencies alone can do their jobs, while citizens’ vigilance and conscience compel the security services to play a professional role, INEC’s burden would be significantly reduced.

The setback of last week should be a watershed moment to implement far-reaching reforms, from inside out, after Saturday.

29,Empty,2019-02-21T11:00:00Z,A clear majority of Canadians believe foreign governments — including the U.S. — will attempt to impact the outcome.,"The Star and BuzzFeed News are investigating the ways in which political parties, third-party pressure groups, foreign powers, and individuals are influencing Canada’s political debate in the run-up to this fall’s federal election. This is the second report. The first report can be found here. A clear majority of Canadians believe foreign governments — including our closest international ally — will attempt to “influence” the 2019 federal election.

Voters wait to collect their ballots for Canada's federal election at an advanced polling station in Toronto on Oct. 9 , 2015. For the next federal election in October 2019, there are fears that foreign governments will attempt to influence the outcome. ( Chris Young / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

New polling conducted by Abacus Data and released exclusively to the Star and BuzzFeed News shows 60 per cent of Canadians believe it’s likely foreign governments will try to influence the results of this October’s general election. Where do most expect that influence to come from? Canada’s closest neighbour and ally, the United States. Most respondents (69 per cent) said it was either moderately, highly, or very highly likely the U.S. would attempt to influence the election, rating it as likely as interference from China.

Abacus CEO David Coletto said that Canadians recognize the U.S. has as much interest in Canadian affairs as Beijing. “The U.S. has an interest in making sure that our government aligns closely with them as our number one trading partner and security partner, but I think (Canadians) also recognize other global powers are also looking to influence our allies and alliances as well.” Russia, which has been accused of active interference in multiple western democratic elections including the 2016 U.S. presidential, followed with 65 per cent of respondents perceiving them as a threat. “Influence” covers everything from a public endorsement — or a 140-character presidential put-down — to more serious clandestine activity. The Abacus online poll was conducted between Jan. 30 and Feb. 5, with 2,500 Canadians aged 18 and over. Abacus put the margin of error at plus or minus two percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

In 2017, Canada’s electronic intelligence agency warned parliamentarians that they expect it’s “very likely” hackers will target Canada during the 2019 election. While the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) said they’ve yet to observe hostile nations attempting to influence Canada’s domestic politics, it’s not a given they won’t in an election year. And the agency is expected to release an updated threat assessment in the coming weeks.

Article Continued Below

CSE is one of several law enforcement, intelligence and civilian agencies that have been tasked with safeguarding the 2019 vote, including detecting hostile nations’ attempt to meddle in the election. According to Abacus’ data, Canadians are largely confident that the federal government is up to that task. A full 66 per cent of respondents said they were somewhat or very confident in Ottawa’s ability to prevent “interference” in the federal election, while 34 per cent expressed little to no confidence. The numbers flipped when respondents were asked about social media platforms. Only 36 per cent said they were somewhat or very confident in social platforms’ ability to prevent foreign interference, while the rest were either not that confident (43 per cent) or not at all confident (20 per cent). Facebook is acutely aware of concerns and in October announced a Canadian Election Integrity Initiative “to help ensure the platform is a space for authentic civic engagement.” Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould is in the midst of conversations with social media companies, including Facebook, about their obligations this election year. Coletto said Canadians are giving the government “the benefit of the doubt” when it comes to preventing election interference. “If we had gotten into some of the details and asked them how they feel about specific aspects of the government’s plan (to safeguard the election) they might feel differently,” Coletto said. “But on the surface, (Canadians) generally think that the government is competent enough on this and there’s less confidence in social media companies to self-regulate.” Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

30,Empty,2019-02-22T06:56:51Z,"Imagine, the President of the self-declared, exceptional and unique Superpower, Donald Trump of the United States of America, has the audacity to threaten the Venezuelan military with their lives, if they keep standing behind the democratically elected Presid…","Imagine, the President of the self-declared, exceptional and unique Superpower, Donald Trump of the United States of America, has the audacity to threaten the Venezuelan military with their lives, if they keep standing behind the democratically elected President Nicolás Maduro, and defending his Government. An open threat – yesterday, 18 February, at a Miami University, in a speech of ‘fire and fury’; this time against socialist Venezuela with which he wants to finish, like with all other socialist nations – especially those in his ‘backyard’. So, Cuba, Nicaragua and Bolivia are next in Trump’s crosshairs – and / or the crosshairs of his handlers. Don’t forget, he is a staged and convenient fool for the “Deep State” or the “Profound Government” – whatever you want to call this secret clan of the Chosen People that intends to rule the world.

I cannot help being amazed at what level of inhumanity we have arrived. Trump calls openly out to assassinate those who stand behind the legitimate President of Venezuela – and the rest of the world just looks on, watches and says NOTHING – zilch, zero – tolerates such atrocity coming from the mouth of a buffoon, aka the strongman of the self-proclaimed one and only superpower of the globe. – No, much worse – the so-called civilized west, the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan – and some second- and third class puppet developing countries from South America, whose people are being starved while the elite admires and dances to the tune of the USA; united in what they call the “Group of Lima” (created in Lima in August 2017, to “safe” Venezuela). Members include, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay and Peru.

In the meantime, Mexico, under her new leftwing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, or simply, AMLO, abstains from any decision against Venezuela. To the contrary, Mexico is part of the “Montevideo Mechanism” that comprises Mexico, Uruguay, Bolivia and the member countries of CARICOM and seeks conflict resolution through dialogue with the opposition, for which the Maduro Government has been ready from the beginning of the conflict, but which has been boycotted by the opposition, as were the 20 May 2018 elections which the non-participating opposition now calls a fraud.

The Lima Group was initiated, as such unofficial clubs always are, to out-rule the official routes, by Washington. Similarly, Washington created “The Friends of Syria” – all with the objective to bring about “Regime Change”. In the case of Venezuela, to circumvent the official representation of the Americas – the OAS – Organization of American States. – Why? – Because the empire was unable to get the legitimate majority of the OAS members to side with them against Venezuela. So, they organized the Lima Group, a club of the willing, of the utmost corrupted vassals, who believe at the end of the days to receive some crumbs of ‘gracias’ from their northern master and tyrant – or the vassals’ leaders (sic) hope perhaps for a safe haven, a castle in Miami?

I often wonder whether such a dream of eventually, at the end of the day – the end of all days perhaps? – being saved by the surviving elite of the US of A in an untouched paradise, is also the dream of the European puppets, for example those that pull the EU’s strings – the Macrons, Merkels and Mays – and, of course, the rest of the EU, the puppets of the puppets? – What else could make them so miserably betray their people, hundreds of millions of people? – Do they have not an iota of morals left?

—

Coming back to Venezuela – the Buffoon calls for outright war against the Maduro regime – and to salvage the Venezuelan people, he sent US$ 20 million worth of “humanitarian aid” to Cucutá, border town in Colombia, which, of course, the Bolivarian army does not let enter Venezuela. There is no need for humanitarian aid, let alone for US$ 20 million worth, peanuts, as compared to what Venezuela buys on a daily basis in food and medical supplies.

Undeniably, the US warmongers – specially Bolton, Pompeo and Pence – are preparing for a hot war. Whether they will execute it, remains to be seen. But the Bolivarian military does not idly watch what may happen. They are ready to face any Yankee aggression. The US southern military command, SOUTHCOM, stationed in Florida, is preparing an impressive military build-up. The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, with 3,200 military personnel, 90 fighter planes and helicopters is positioned off the Florida coast, accompanied by the cruise missile carrier, USS Leyte Gulf, and the destroyers, USS Bainbridge, USS Gonzalez, USS Mason, and USS Nite. Joining the fleet is also the Spanish marine ship ESPS Mendez Nuñez.

The Spanish participation in this war game of criminal aggression is outrageous. The Spanish socialist leader, Pedro Sanchez (who certainly does not deserve the attribute of ‘socialist’), has also had the audacity requesting Nicolas Maduro to resign and call elections. Who is the (faltering) head of the fallen Spanish empire to meddle in another country’s internal affairs? – Maybe because the Spaniards can still not stomach having been defeated by Simón Bolívar, still feel superior and behave racist over the ‘brown’ Latinos, or maybe because he wants to please the masters in Washington – or simply because he needs popular support in his own country, as he is leading a minority, currently non-government and had to call snap elections for 28 April 2019?

There are, however, also Russia and China, solid, but rather quiet partners of Venezuela’s. Russia has made it clear, though, “Don’t mess with Venezuela”. Russia has two nuclear capable bombers, TU-160, deployed to the Venezuelan Caribbean island of la Orchila, where Moscow will establish, with the agreement of Venezuela, a permanent military base.

Both Russia and China have tens of billions worth of investments in Venezuela’s hydrocarbon industry. But besides the commercial interests, Russia and China vie for a multipolar world and want to guarantee the independence of Latin America, the sovereignty of the peoples of the Americas.

On 26 January 2019, the US dragged the “Case Venezuela” to the UN Security Council, in an attempt to condemn Venezuela and to trailblaze the path for a military invasion. However, while nine of the 15 UNSC members voted for a special meeting on Venezuela (Belgium, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Kuwait, Peru, Poland, United Kingdom, United States), four voted against (China, Equatorial Guinea, Russian Federation, South Africa), with two abstentions (Côte d’Ivoire, Indonesia). The Russian Federation’s delegate countered that the Council has no role to play in a domestic matter that poses no threat to international peace and security. And right he is!

This UNSC event prompted a solidarity movement of more than 50 states, including China, Russia, Cuba, DPRK, Syria, Iran, Palestine, Nicaragua, and many more, supporting Venezuelan’s Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza’s statement before the Security Council, declaring the illegality of unilateral coercive economic sanctions, and territorial invasions by the United States. As Carla Stea reports,

this new alliance “constitutes a formidable force which Western capitalism will antagonize at its own peril. This is a long overdue counterforce to Western domination of the United Nations, a domination based on money, on the large payments enabling the US and other capitalist powers to bribe, threaten and otherwise control the direction of the UN, and distort and destroy the independence, impartiality and integrity which the UN requires in order to maintain its legitimacy, and implement the sustained global peace and justice for which Franklin Delano Roosevelt created it.”

This new alignment of more than 50 states comprise more than half of the world’s population, to a large extent people who have been exploited, slaughtered and their countries raped and ravaged for hundreds of years by wester capitalist and colonialist powers. This alliance promises to become a solid new face in the otherwise western dominated and bought United Nations.

As to Venezuela’s fate, Trump has made vague indications of 23 February being the deadline for an assault on Venezuela. We will see whether this remains nothing but an intimidating insinuation, or whether it will be real. The latter case would be a disaster not only for Venezuela, and Latin America, but for the entire world. Will Trump’s handlers allow such blunder? – In any case, Venezuela’s armed forces are disposed to confront the empire’s nuclear aircraft carrier, missile launchers, countless fighter planes and the up to 5,000 US troops and mercenaries newly stationed in Colombia and ready to cross the border into Venezuela. – And, not to forget, there are also Russia and China.

32,Empty,2019-02-22T16:38:23Z,"Beijing’s race to control supplies of lithium, used in powering electric cars, is leaving its rivals far behind.","China is increasingly dominating the supply of what’s been described as “white petroleum,” the soft, silvery metal lithium, seen as key to the momentum-gathering electric vehicle (EV) revolution.

Discoveries of lithium in North America and Europe may loosen China’s tightening hold on the market in time, but the race to find and exploit new deposits is also throwing up other concerns, namely the risk of oversupply or even a glut and political risks that may affect countries with some of the biggest reserves and production.

Lithium is one of the main components of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in smartphones, laptops, and EVs, with demand for the latter anticipated to surge over the next decade or so as manufacturing costs fall and environmental concerns rise. China, eager to reduce oil imports and address chronic air pollution, is driving production of EVs, accounting for 37 percent of passenger EVs sold globally since 2011, according to Bloomberg. The agency forecast in 2017 that by 2040 more than half of all new car sales will be electric vehicles.

Beijing government subsidies and quotas for EV sales appear to have incentivized efforts to corner the electric vehicle supply chain. Reuters reports that Chinese entities now control nearly half of global lithium production and 60 percent of the electric battery production capacity. By 2030, Goldman Sachs predicts China could supply 60 percent of the world’s EVs.

In recent years, China, the biggest global consumer of lithium, has been snapping up stakes in mining operations in South America and Australia, the principal global sources of the metal – derived from brine flats in South America and spodumene ore in Australia. In South America alone, China has reportedly invested $4.2 billion in lithium deals in the past two years. It has also been tightening its grip on the supply of cobalt, another important lithium-ion battery component.

Beijing’s buying spree has worried electric battery- and EV-makers in Japan, South Korea, and Europe. But China has not had it all its own way. In a recent reversal of fortunes, a German company beat off a Chinese challenge in Bolivia – which has one of the world’s largest reserves of lithium – to secure a deal to build a plant mining the country’s biggest deposit. Most of the output will go to Germany, which lobbied heavily for the deal that includes the construction of a rechargeable battery plant.

Yet, not to be outdone, and in a measure of its determination, Beijing quickly sought to secure a foothold in Bolivia with a mining venture in another promising prospect in the country. The Chinese ambassador to Bolivia described the preliminary deal as “historic.” That came just weeks after one of China’s leading miners, Tianqi, completed the purchase of a 24 percent stake in neighboring Chile’s lithium producer SQM, fending off local opposition to the deal – centered on concerns it would unfairly favor the Chinese in the contest to secure resources for EVs.

China’s increasing domination of the global lithium supply appears to have prodded the Europeans and the Americans, whose EV markets are still very much in their infancy, to explore closer to home. Deposits in Germany, the Czech Republic, Portugal, and Sweden have been the focus of attention, while some within the industry have expressed hopes that Canada might have sufficient volumes to meet demand in North America.

But the race for supplies has sparked concerns about the pace of production output. Extraction has been fueled by soaring lithium prices, which more than tripled in the three years to 2018 to over $20,000 per tonne. The data and analytics company GlobalData predicted in September that EV demand will double global lithium production from 26,700 tonnes in 2018 to 58,300 tonnes in 2022. In August, Macquarie Research suggested that the market was “sleepwalking into a tsunami of oversupply.” Then in late November, Moody’s Investor Services warned of excessive production in the early years of the next decade, due to factors including a “heavy concentration” of new mines.

Oversupply left its mark last year when lithium prices in China nearly halved, a problem compounded by the government’s removal of some subsidies on EVs, which slowed sales. Some analysts believe the market will recover in the medium to long term as demand increases, but the risk is that the slough may discourage investment in new production, leading to shortages when prices pick up. Yet that may not be the only break on supply.

President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, a top lithium producer, has opened up the country’s economy, introducing market reforms and easing regulations, but his attempts to repair the economic mismanagement of his predecessors are misfiring, plunging the county into a financial crisis that forced him to go cap in hand to the IMF. His ratings have shrunk, raising the prospect of a populist victory in elections later this year. That might make life difficult for mining investors, especially if his reformist agenda is reversed.

While Bolivia has barely begun to export its lithium, it has huge potential as a supplier – potential being the operative word. The country’s left-wing leader, Evo Morales, recognizes the value of the resource to Bolivian economic prospects. But if he is re-elected in October, investors may be put off if interventionist policies introduced in other sectors are extended to lithium production.

It is unclear how China will deal with such challenges, but given its relentless pursuit of lithium, and the strategic importance it attaches to the metal, solutions will no doubt be found. In many ways, China’s embrace of green transport is a good thing, as it expands interest in the sector and spurs competitor nations to try to catch up in terms of their share of lithium supply and the rechargeable battery market. The danger is that they continue to lag behind, leaving China with a monopoly over what could soon become a mainstream transport sector.

Scenes of destruction and despair were on full display worldwide over the weekend as the Maduro regime used force to deny entry into Venezuela of desperately needed humanitari…","Scenes of destruction and despair were on full display worldwide over the weekend as the Maduro regime used force to deny entry into Venezuela of desperately needed humanitarian assistance, leading to increasing speculation about what comes next. Or, rather, will the United States invade Venezuela to topple the despotic regime that has ruined Latin America’s once-wealthiest economy and created Latin America’s worst humanitarian crisis in many years.

The threat of invasion has increasingly been implied, with senior U.S. administration officials suggesting routinely that “all options are on the table.” Indeed, they are, as they always are in the conduct of foreign affairs. But the implication is clearly that if Maduro and his inner circle refuse to depart, then the use of force may be employed.

Maduro plainly needs to go. His mandate as president expired on January 10, 2019, at which point he re-inaugurated himself based on the results of a clearly fraudulent election in May 2018. According to Venezuela’s constitution—a document instituted under Hugo Chavez, the founder of the so-called Bolivarian Revolution and Maduro’s political godfather—in the absence of a president the head of the National Assembly becomes the interim president and is then obligated to call for new elections. Under this scenario, Juan Guaido, the newly-installed, thirty-five-year-old head of the National Assembly, became the constitutional leader of Venezuela. The United States, the Lima Group of Latin American nations and Canada, European nations, Japan, and numerous others have now recognized Guaido as the legitimate, albeit interim, leader of Venezuela.

Over the past six years of Maduro’s misrule, Venezuela has become a humanitarian disaster. Fully 10 percent of the population has fled due to lack of food and healthcare, hyperinflation, and out of control crime. National oil company PDVSA, the life-blood of the economy, has been politicized and corrupted, and production is falling rapidly. The educational system has been fully coopted by Chavismo, and every institution of the state except the National Assembly has been bent to the will of the executive. Venezuela’s sovereignty has been sold cheaply to Cuba, which has thoroughly infiltrated the security services and state functions, and sweetheart deals have been cut to provide Venezuela’s national patrimony—oil—to China, Russia, and others in exchange for short term financing and support. In short, Chavismo has mortgaged Venezuela’s future. Interim president Guiado himself has obliquely called for an armed international response.

As bad as the situation continues to get in Venezuela, however, an armed response is unlikely. First of all, there is no casus belli that would justify a U.S.-led invasion. Nor is there a mandate from the United Nations or OAS. The doctrine of Responsibility to Protect is not sufficiently developed or accepted at this point, and circumstances do not yet justify its application to Venezuela in any event. Latin American nations, including those that support strong actions against Maduro, have publicly indicated little support for armed intervention, and, despite the rhetoric, there does not appear to be much enthusiasm in Washington for such a step.

In particular, while the U.S. military would be able to decapitate the Maduro regime and install Guaido in the Miraflores Palace without significant exertion, the aftermath of such action would be messy. Venezuela is a large country, much of it rural or jungled, and numerous non-state actors occupy large portions of the nation, from regime-sponsored goon squads, to FARC and ELN guerrillas seeking safe haven from Colombia, to illegal goldminers and wildcatters, to drug traffickers and common criminals and highwaymen. Invasion would be relatively easy; pacification could be complicated. Of course, with invasion would also come the responsibility to lead recovery efforts and shoulder the blame if such efforts did not lead to desired results. Within the context of administration efforts to deal with China and North Korea and Iran, pass the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, address domestic issues including the economy, border enforcement, and the activities of the Special Counsel, an invasion of Venezuela is not necessarily high on the priorities list.

What can be anticipated, however, is that there will be further intensified pressure on the regime, which will squeeze it like the large anacondas that inhabit Venezuelan waters. In addition to efforts to entice regime officials, including the military, to shift their loyalty from Maduro to Guaido, the United States, in coordination with other nations, looks to amplify asset seizure and forfeiture. Collectively, they aim to deny new and cancel existing visas for regime officials and their families, thus forcing departures from the United States, Europe, and Latin American nations that host them, and increase humanitarian assistance. All of these activities will further the goal of turning Maduro into an international pariah, and, it is hoped, create conditions that will ultimately see him turfed from office.

The key is to keep the Maduro regime on the defensive. There are no guarantees, and nobody can say when the dam will ultimately break—or if it will break. Meanwhile, Venezuelans face an unpleasant choice between protesting and exposing themselves to the excesses of the regime, hunkering down, or joining the millions of Venezuelans who have already left their nation behind. It is a tragedy lain squarely at the feet of Chavismo.

In an interview with Univision’s Jorge Ramos, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has just announced that he will run for US president in the 2020 election, has refused to recognise Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s president, having suggested that the US should ensure “free and fair” elections in the Latin American country.

“No. I think what has to happen right now — I think there are serious questions about the recent election. There are many people who feel it was a fraudulent election, and I think the United States has got to work with the international community to make sure that there is a free and fair election in Venezuela”, Sanders said.

When asked whether he believes that Nicolas Maduro is a “dictator” and should step down, Sanders seemingly avoided giving a direct answer to the question:

“I think clearly he has been very, very abusive. That is a decision of the Venezuelan people, so I think, Jorge, there’s got to be a free and fair election”.

Sanders’ reluctance to recognise Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president came shortly before the opposition leader issued his “presidential” decree number 001 in order to authorise the deliveries of humanitarian aid currently stockpiled in neighbouring Colombia.

His decision was made despite President Nicolas Maduro’s strong opposition to the deliveries, which he said might be used as a pretext for a foreign intervention in Venezuela.

White House National Security Adviser John Bolton, in turn, said that the Venezuelan military, who support the Maduro government, should let “peaceful civilians at the Colombian and Brazilian borders peacefully bring in humanitarian aid”, warning that any infractions “will not be forgotten”.

Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump called on Venezuelan military officers to not follow orders given by Maduro to block the humanitarian aid deliveries to the country, adding that Washington is seeking a peaceful transition of power in the country but ""all options"" were on the table.

In the meantime, Maduro said Thursday that he sees a certain connection between Washington's rhetoric against Venezuela and the re-election campaign of Trump.

""Donald Trump has started his pre-election campaign… He's desperate, and so he really liked the idea of attacking Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua, and he thinks that, using this rhetoric of Cold War, he will improve [his rating], which in reality could lead to his total collapse"", Maduro said in remarks broadcast by a local TV channel.

Tensions have been simmering in Venezuela since mid-January when Guaido declared himself the country’s president, challenging last May’s re-election of Maduro. The United States, Canada, Japan, Israel, a host of Latin American countries and a number of European nations have recognised the opposition leader, while Russia, Turkey, China, Mexico, and many others have voiced their support for Maduro as Venezuela’s legitimately elected president.

(“Pan American” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:PAAS) (TSX:PAAS) and Tahoe Resources Inc. (“Tahoe”) (TSX:THO) (NYSE: TAHO) today completed the previously announced transaction (the “Arrangement”) whereby Pan American acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Tahoe.

Michael Steinmann, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pan American Silver, said: "" The completion of the Arrangement establishes the world's premier silver mining company with an industry-leading portfolio of assets, a robust growth profile and attractive operating margins. We are also now the largest publicly traded silver mining company by free float, offering silver mining investors enhanced scale and liquidity.""

Added Mr. Steinmann: ""We have a 25-year track record in Latin America of building successful partnerships with the communities around our operations, respecting the diversity of local populations and safeguarding the natural environment. We welcome the opportunity to work with local communities around the new operations for the benefit of all stakeholders.""

Results of elections by Tahoe shareholders

Pursuant to the Arrangement, Tahoe shareholders had the right to elect to receive either US$3.40 in cash (the “Cash Election”) or 0.2403 of a Pan American share (the “Share Election”) for each Tahoe share, subject in each case to pro-ration based on a maximum cash consideration of US$275 million and a maximum number of Pan American shares issued of 56.0 million. Tahoe shareholders who did not make an election by the deadline of 4:30 pm EST on January 3, 2019 were deemed to have made the Share Election.

The following elections were made:

holders of 23,661,084 Tahoe shares made the Cash Election; and

holders of 290,226,406 Tahoe shares made, or were deemed to have made, the Share Election.

Since the aggregate number of Tahoe shares in respect of which Cash Elections were made is less than the Aggregate Cash Consideration (as defined in the Arrangement agreement dated as of November 14, 2018 among Pan American, Tahoe and 0799714 B.C. Ltd.), holders of Tahoe shares who made or were deemed to have made the Share Election are subject to pro-ration in the manner described in Tahoe's management information circular dated December 4, 2018 and will receive consideration per Tahoe share of approximately 19.7% in cash (US$0.67) and approximately 80.3% in Pan American shares (0.1929 of a Pan American share). Tahoe shares in respect of which Cash Elections were made will receive all cash consideration.

In addition, Tahoe shareholders received contingent consideration in the form of one contingent value right (""CVR"") for each Tahoe share. Each CVR will be exchanged for 0.0497 of a Pan American share upon first commercial shipment of concentrate following restart of operations at the Escobal mine. The CVRs are transferable and have a term of 10 years.

In aggregate, Pan American will pay US$275 million in cash and issue 55,990,512 Pan American shares and 313,887,490 CVRs to Tahoe shareholders under the Arrangement. Upon closing of the Arrangement, existing Pan American and former Tahoe shareholders own approximately 73% and 27% of Pan American, respectively. Upon satisfaction of the payment conditions under the terms of the CVRs, Pan American and Tahoe shareholders will own approximately 68% and 32%, respectively, of the combined company (based upon the number of Pan American shares outstanding as at today’s date).

C. Kevin McArthur and Charles A. Jeannes appointed to Pan American Board

Under the Arrangement, Tahoe was entitled to nominate two of its directors to join Pan American’s Board of Directors. Tahoe has nominated Messrs. C. Kevin McArthur and Charles A. Jeannes. Effective today, Messrs. C. Kevin McArthur and Charles A. Jeannes joined Pan American’s Board of Directors.

"" Kevin and Chuck are seasoned mining executives with deep knowledge of the precious metals industry. I warmly welcome them to Pan American's Board of Directors,"" said Mr. Ross J. Beaty, Chairman of Pan American.

Increase to, and drawdown under, Pan American’s revolving credit facility

Pan American is also pleased to announce that it has amended and extended its revolving credit facility led by The Bank of Nova Scotia and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners. The facility has been increased by US$200 million to US$500 million, and matures on February 1, 2023. At Pan American’s option, amounts can be drawn under the revolving facility and will incur interest based on the Company’s leverage ratio at either (i) LIBOR plus 1.875% to 2.750% or; (ii) The Bank of Nova Scotia’s Base Rate on U.S. dollar denominated commercial loans plus 0.875% to 1.750%. Undrawn amounts under the revolving facility are subject to a stand-by fee of 0.4219% to 0.6188% per annum, dependent on the Company’s leverage ratio.

Pan American has drawn down US$301 million under the facility under LIBOR-based interest rates to fund, in part, the cash purchase price under the Arrangement and to repay, in full, and cancel Tahoe’s second amended and restated revolving facility, under which US$125 million had been drawn.

Delisting of Tahoe shares

The shares of Tahoe are expected to be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange as of the closing of the market on February 26, 2019 and on the New York Stock Exchange effective as of the closing of the market on March 4, 2019, subject to the approval of each exchange. Pan American has applied for Tahoe to cease to be a reporting issuer under applicable Canadian securities laws and will file to suspend Tahoe’s reporting obligations under U.S. securities laws.

Former president Abdoulaye Wade called for protests against the polls after his son was banned from running.","Senegal's presidential candidates had three weeks to convince voters that they have got what it takes to be elected head of the country. Five candidates are in the race for the office of president in one of Africa's most stable democracies. Incumbent president Macky Sall is seeking his final five-year mandate after coming to power with a seven-year mandate in 2012. A 2016 referendum slashed the seven-year presidential term to five and reaffirmed the two-term limit.

Sall is up against two strong and experienced aspirants: former Prime Minister Idrissa Seck and former Foreign Affairs Minister Madicke Niang. Seck is making his third bid for the top job. The 59-year-old promised to build a modern hospital and a local university in each of the country's 45 departments, as well as a health center in each commune. 65-year-old Madicke Niang wants to reform the justice system.

Senegal's President Macky Sall is running for a second term

Specific electoral programs

El Hadji Issa Sall, an academic and lawmaker, and Ousmane Sonko, who is the youngest contestant, are the outsiders in the race. 63-year-old Sall has promised to clean up dangerous suburbs and revamp fish processing plants down the coast. 44-year-old Sonko is a rising opposition figure — he pledged to renegotiate all gas and mining contracts that have already been signed by the current regime. Another two major aspirants, Karim Wade and Khalifa Sall, were barred by the top court over corruption.

Political analyst Gilles Yabi praises the electoral programs

Dr Gilles Yabi, director of WATHI, a pan African think tank, welcomed the candidates' efforts to propose specific electoral programs – something he says is not usually associated with elections in African countries. ""I think this is something that merits praise,"" he said. ""There are many elements regarding the justice system in all the programs, such as the construction of a new prison and the setting up of reintegration program for detainees on their release."" There would also be incentives and obligations for companies to recruit handicapped people with a specific salary, with penalties to be paid if this is not respected, Yabi added. ""There is definitely an effort to present original programs.""

Ex-President Wade calls for protests

But the campaign has not been all smooth sailing. Violence broke out in Tambadounda in the south-east of the country, leaving at least two people dead and 24 arrested. Many others were injured following violent clashes between supporters of incumbent Macky Sall and those of El Hadj Issa Sall. As a result, El-Hadji Issa Sall and Ousmane Sonko's parties decided to take a break and stop their campaign caravans.

It is the first time so few candidates are running in a presidential election since 1988. Tensions are running high in the country dubbed the most stable in West Africa. Ex-president Abdoulaye Wade called on voters to burn down polling stations and their voting cards in protest that his own son is barred from running. His party, the main opposition Democratic Party of Senegal (PDS), is not fielding a candidate. Abdoulaye Wade had called for a boycott of the vote citing threats to security but the government dismissed his call.

Senegal's ex-President Abdoulaye Wade has called for protests

Content over personality

Interior Minister Aly Ngouille Ndiaye had given an assurance that the elections would be carried out transparently and said rigging was impossible. However, many Dakar residents are not convinced. Complaints about delays in the issuing of voter ID cards became loud, residents claimed that some people had been waiting for years and still had not received their voting cards. Social media users had also pushed for a first-ever televised pre-election debate with all five candidates, but the National Audiovisual Regulatory Council announced that it would not authorize national television and radio channels to broadcast such a program in the context of the current election campaign.

100 observers from the European Union as well as from Norway, Switzerland and Canada will accompany the election. International communications consultant Amy Sarr Fall thinks that once at the voting booth, people will choose content over personality. ""Citizens will ask themselves: Who will help me best to face what awaits me after the election? Who will help me keep my business efficient, who will help me keep my head above water in a difficult economy - and who will help me keep my job?""",Five presidential candidates for Senegal,Dw.com,https://www.dw.com/en/five-presidential-candidates-for-senegal/a-47629990

Outremont's polls are open from 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.,"Liberal Rachel Bendayan has won the federal riding of Outremont in Quebec after taking 40 per cent of the vote with 95 per cent of polls reporting.

""I will honour your vote by working very hard,"" she said Monday night at Liberal party headquarters in Montreal's Outremont.

She stressed that the Liberals would continue to fight climate change and promote a national housing strategy.

Mélanie Joly, the minister of official languages and La Francophonie, said that despite losing to the NDP in 2015, Bendayan was always a strong candidate who continued working in the riding in the years since.

""We hope this is the end of the Orange Wave in Quebec,"" Joly said Monday night.

The NDP, which had held the riding since 2007, trailed in second place with less than 30 per cent of the votes.

Outremont was one of three ridings where federal byelections took place Monday on a crucial day for Canada's major political parties.

Voter turnout was low, as is typical for a byelection. Less than 20 per cent of the 70,400 registered voters in Outremont cast a ballot.

Political insiders had bet that the Liberals would retake the riding — a welcome boost for the governing party's morale in the midst of the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

""Tonight, the people of Outremont and thousands of Canadians voting in these byelections have offered a strong vote of confidence in Justin Trudeau's positive plan to strengthen the middle class,"" said Suzanne Cowan, president of the Liberal Party of Canada.

Outremont resident, Claudette Dumas Bergen, says the weather was holding her back but she adds “my civic duty came to me and I said I have to go because it’s important!” <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Outremont?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Outremont</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/CBCMontreal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CBCMontreal</a> <a href=""https://t.co/H6ds1wsZZ4"">pic.twitter.com/H6ds1wsZZ4</a> —@mia_anhoury

Analysts said the Outremont race was a crucial test for the NDP.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Thomas Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 byelection: the Liberals had lost the riding only once, to the Progressive Conservatives in 1988, since 1935.

The so-called Orange Wave followed in 2011 and boosted the NDP to Official Opposition status for the first time in its history.

While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

These are the candidates who ran in Outremont and how much of the vote they took by the time 95 per cent of ballots had been counted:

40 per cent: Rachel Bendayan — Liberal Party of Canada.

29 per cent: Julia Sánchez — New Democratic Party.

13 per cent: Daniel Green — Green Party of Canada.

The news service reports:

President Donald Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law is operating on at least two tracks — the first is working with a small group studying specific ways to redistribute employment visas and the second is helping lead a series of “listening sessions” with about three dozen interest groups important to Trump to see if there is a position that Republicans can rally around before the 2020 elections.

The invited groups are mostly pro-migration, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Association of Builders and Contractors, and the George W. Bush Center, the report said, adding:

One participant described Kushner as listening a lot and encouraging others to speak. He is less interested in the finer details of immigration policy and focused on reaching a consensus, that participant said. Two people involved said Kushner asks people to talk about what they want instead of what they oppose. … Such language is concerning to conservative immigration groups. Indeed, between Kushner’s business background and the large number of guests with corporate interests, conservatives are worried that the changes Kushner is pursuing run counter to Trump’s “Hire American” priorities.

Trump’s inauguration day promise of a “Hire American” policy is capping the inflow of legal migrants and forcing companies to recruit sidelined Americans and to compete for American workers by raising wages. That low-immigration policy helped deliver wage raises of 3 percent nationally in 2018 and may deliver raises of 4 percent in 2019.

In 2018, wages rose higher in states with lower levels of legal immigration, such as swing-state Minnesota where wages rose 5.2 percent. Employees who switched jobs gained a 4.6 percent gain.

Trump's 'Hire American' policy allowed job switchers to win a 4.6% wage gain in 2018. Of course, CEOs & investors are pushing him & Congress to flood the labor market with immigrants. But how many politicians want to cut voters' wage growth by Nov. 2020? https://t.co/Sspb4N7rbS — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 14, 2019

Trump’s policies are also helping to boost productivity.

Democrats, including presidential candidate and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, are complaining that Trump’s unemployment rate is too low and are calling for a greater inflow of foreign workers.

Dem. Pres. candidate Sen. Klobuchar is worried by low unemployment & wants more foreign workers in Minnesota, where wages rose 5.2% in 2018. What is the political payoff from promising to block voters' wage raises? Why is Pres. Trump saying the same thing? https://t.co/qAKxKRLUJJ — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 13, 2019

One focus of Kushner’s group are guest worker visas, the news service said.

Those visas are critical to business because they allow CEOs and investors to reduce wages paid to middle class, college educated Americans.

Currently, there are at least 1.5 million visa workers holding white-collar jobs which are sought by new American graduates and seasoned professionals. The visa workers arrive via the H-1B, L1, OPT, CPT, O-1, TN, H4EAD, and other visa programs, and they have created a mobile, contingent workforce which reduces the marketplace pressure on companies to raise salaries paid to college educated Americans or to hire new American graduates.

But these programs also impose political costs on GOP candidates. An April 2018 study argued that white-collar immigration pushes American college graduates away from the GOP. “Our strongest and most significant finding is that an increase in high-skilled immigrants as a share of the local population is associated with a strong and significant decrease in the vote share for the Republican Party,” said the report, authored by pro-migration economist Giovanni Peri, Anna Maria Mayda, a Georgetown University professor, and Walter Steingress, an economist at the Bank of Canada.

In 2018, many suburban college graduate voters switched from GOP to back Democrats. The losing candidates included Kansas Rep. Kevin Yoder who was pushing a plan to award many more green cards to Indian visa workers.

Business groups and Democrats tout skewed polls that prod Americans to declare support for migrants and for the claim that the United States is an economy-expanding “Nation of Immigrants,” not a nation of Americans.

The alternative “priority or fairness” polls — as well as the 2016 election — show that voters put a much higher priority on helping their families, neighbors, and fellow nationals get decent jobs in a globalized, high-immigration economy.

President Trump’s tweeted support for foreign H-1B outsourcing workers is a ""betrayal,"" say college-grad supporters who lose pay & jobs to the imported workforce of 1.5 million cheap H1B/ OPT/ L-1/ etc. visa-workers. No surprise: investors are pleased. https://t.co/AZcZNIycls — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 15, 2019

Naomi Klein: It’s a sweeping plan to radically transform how we get energy, move ourselves around, live in cities, and grow our food; and it puts justice at the center—justice broadly defined, from racial and gender justice to making sure no worker is left behind, battling inequality at every level. It’s really about multitasking. It’s about understanding that we are in a time of multiple overlapping crises, and that we are on an incredibly tight deadline when it comes to lowering greenhouse-gas emissions in time to prevent truly catastrophic warming. In order to bring people along with these necessary changes, there have to be benefits in the here-and-now in terms of the kinds of jobs that are provided and the justice that comes through.

JW: The Green New Deal, you’ve said, is not a question that will be settled through elections alone. What do you mean?

NK: In terms of winning the power to introduce a package as ambitious as the resolution, the only real historical precedent is the original New Deal. And the political dynamics that produced the original New Deal were not a benevolent politician handing reforms down from on high, from the goodness of his heart. Of course it mattered to have FDR in power instead of Herbert Hoover, but it mattered even more to have an organized population which was flexing its muscles in every conceivable way in the 1930s—from sit-down strikes in auto plants, to shutting down the ports on the West Coast, to shutting down entire cities with general strikes. And it mattered also to have more radical voices who were calling for more radical policies than the New Deal was offering, like a truly cooperative economy. All of that created the context in which FDR was able to sell the New Deal to elites. They were grudging about it, but the alternative seemed to be political revolution.

So the only way that something like this happens is if it is accompanied by a huge grassroots mobilization, where every workplace, every sector, every movement is asking, “What would a Green New Deal mean for us? What would it mean in our workplace? What would it mean for the groups that we represent?” If we are going to succeed, they need to make it their own. So it’s going to take a hell of a lot of grassroots organizing, mobilizing all of these sectors to really believe that the Green New Deal is going to make their lives better, coupled with politicians running at every level of government, including for president, with a promise to enact this on day one.

JW: Building political power, you’ve said, is about changing the calculus of what is possible. That’s a big obstacle. We saw that in a column by Gail Collins in The New York Times last week: She argued the Green New Deal is too far-reaching and instead we should focus our efforts on more manageable things like creating more electric generating capacity from solar and wind. It’s not exactly opposing the Green New Deal, but it’s certainly not helping. Current Issue View our current issue

NK: There is this idea that a more incrementalist policy focused just on climate would be more sellable—something that doesn’t talk about fighting inequality, and a huge jobs program, and health care for all. But what’s actually stood in the way of strong climate policy in the past has been that, in times of real economic stress, like the ones we’ve been living in, people consistently rank climate below health care and below jobs. Often it ranks last on the list of political priorities. And that’s why politicians always feel that it can be sacrificed. Obama did that. He looked at the polls and he prioritized health care. And when that led to a huge amount of pushback, he didn’t spend any political capital trying to get a cap-and-trade policy through—even though that was totally inadequate.

And the other thing that stands in the way when politicians actually do introduce climate policies, is that, if they don’t prioritize justice, the proposals are actively unjust. For example, look to Emmanuel Macron in France, where this very neoliberal president introduced a tax cut for the very, very rich at the same time that he introduced a carbon-pricing scheme that increased the cost of living for working people. Then you had an uprising, and rioting in the streets, with the yellow vest movement—precisely because, as one of the protesters put it, “The politicians care about the end of the world when we have to care about the end of the month.” I think the brilliance of the Green New Deal framework is that it doesn’t ask people to choose. It says, “We all care about the end of the world. But we also care about the end of the month. So how do we design policies that simultaneously lower emissions and lower that economic strain?” And that’s exactly what they’re trying to do.

JW: There has been opposition to climate change legislation from the Laborers International Union and some of the building trades. But one of the unions that’s been really good on this is the Canadian Union of Postal Workers.

NK: I’ve been involved in a project in Canada called the Leap Manifesto, which is our people’s version of a Green New Deal, to get off fossil fuels in a hurry, but to put justice and labor protections at the center. After the Leap Manifesto came out, our team worked with that union, at their request, to come up with a plan to apply the principles of the Leap Manifesto to the Post Office—which, at that time, was facing a very real prospect of being privatized and radically downsized. So rather than just saying, “We want to keep things as they are, despite the fact that how we tend to send mail has been radically changed by Amazon and by courier services,” they said, “We want to change this service that has been at the center of communities for so long, and we want to now be at the center of a transition off of fossil fuels. We want to have postal banking, we want to have solar panels on the rooftops of every post office, we want a charging station outside, we want a fleet of vehicles that are all electric and all made domestically, and we want not just to be delivering the mail, but also to be delivering locally grown produce, checking in on the elderly, being part of the caring economy.” It’s a radical plan that’s being championed by an unabashedly progressive union. And coming back to where we started, that’s what it means to make the Green New Deal your own. We need people in every organized workplace to be getting together and imagining what their workplace would look like if they took rapid de-carbonization seriously.

How could it lead to a fairer economy?",Naomi Klein: The Green New Deal Is Changing the Calculus of the Possible,Thenation.com,https://www.thenation.com/article/naomi-klein-green-new-deal-climate-change/

The base isn’t stupid, and if they stay home on election day because you’ve disavowed them in the general election campaign then you aren’t going to pick up enough “moderate” voters to make a difference. That so-called strategy has looked more an more bleak for several years. Now the alleged moderates have not only decreased in number but they actually don’t represent any view on the American political landscape. These two graphs are from the Pew Research Center’s report Political Polarization in the American Public.

CREDIT: http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/section-1-growing-ideological-consistency/

Because our “first past the post” system crushes third parties like the bugs that they are, this polarization hasn’t been felt in American politics. But the same thing is happening in Europe and Australia/Oceania where parliamentary systems and you can see the effect.

Writing at the Washington Post, Harry Olsen has an intriguing piece on how centrist, “third way” politics are foundering basically everywhere after this philosophy had been declared victorious a couple of decades ago. The article is titled Don’t fool yourself. The political center won’t recover anytime soon and I don’t think the phenomenon is as surprising as some.

…Globally, the prevailing trend is rising support for anti-immigrant, nationalist populist parties — not a resurgence of the center. That trend is easy to see almost anywhere you look. Estonia holds national elections in a week, and polls show the big winner is likely to be the Conservative People’s Party of Estonia, which is set to more than double its share of the vote, becoming the third-largest party in the country. Spain’s Socialist president, Pedro Sánchez, recently called for a snap election after his government failed to pass a budget, but again, polls show an anti-immigrant, nationalist party called Vox will likely gain the most. Vox has skyrocketed in support from less than 1 percent in 2016 to an average of around 11 percent in recent polls. A three-party, center-right coalition including Vox shocked the country by winning the state elections last December in the longtime Socialist bastion of Andalusia. It now looks like that coalition will govern Spain, too. …Italy’s Lega is led by the notorious anti-immigrant and social conservative Matteo Salvini, who has garnered international attention with his opposition to admitting refugees from Muslim Northern Africa. Lega’s support has doubled within a year, from 17 percent in last March’s election to more than 35 percent today, easily making the brash populist the most popular political figure in Italy. …That’s the coalition that currently governs New Zealand, where Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, known for her environmental policies and deft use of social media, governs in coalition with the anti-immigrant and nationalist New Zealand First party. Their coalition agreement is opaque on the matter, but annual net migration has declined nearly 30 percent since the coalition took power in 2017. …Quebec elected a center-right government for the first time in decades last year, partially on its promise to reduce immigration to the province by 20 percent. A new political party, the People’s Party of Canada, formed last year with a platform of free-market economic reforms and reducing immigration. It is already receiving more than 2 percent in the polls, and could easily gain more support ahead of this fall’s national election.

What Olsen paints as anti-immigrant is, I think, much more a natural resurgence of nationalism that has been tamped down…tribalism, dontcha know…by would-be elites married to a populism abetted by the breaking of the information monopoly that has large numbers of people looking at the policies promoted by those elites and asking “WTF??” because a blind man could see they do nothing to benefit current or future generations of their nation. Immigration is a lightning rod for this effect because in so many Western nations, the elites either have or have no problem with opening the flood gates to no-skills/low-skills immigrants who either survive on the dole (paid for by the citizen taxpayer) or compete for low-end jobs with disadvantaged citizens and who, either by their own desire or the benighted policies of the host nation, show no desire to assimilate or even pretend to assimilate.

Those bemoaning the loss of a “center” are actually crying over the demise of Failure Theater and the log-rolling and deal-making that benefited only a relatively small number of people to the detriment of most everyone else. They are complaining that the rule by elites is coming to an end now that everywhere people are seeing that what was marketed as “bipartisanship” was actually just a self-serving scam.

This is “how you got Trump” in a nutshell.

As Texas Democrat and populist Jim Hightower was noted for saying, there’s nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos. The 2016 GOP primary demonstrated that in spades. The closer you were to being a “moderate” the sooner you looked like dead armadillo (Scott Walker, Jeb Bush). The closer your views were to those of the average voter the better your chance of survival. Ted Cruz understood that when he ran this commercial in 2016 highlighting the fact that illegal immigration was only supported by people whose jobs were not put at risk by it:

It will be shocking if the same dynamic doesn’t play out in the Democrat primary for 2020.

Fifty years ago, both US parties commanded a broad consensus opinion on the American Experiment. That consensus has unraveled. The two major parties now have very differing ideas about what the nation should look like and how our economic system should operate. The challenge in 2020 will be to appeal to those common values remaining with sufficient strength to bring along people who might not agree with large parts of your platform. It implies that rather than trying to appeal to moderates, the successful candidate will lock down and motivate their base and build enough common ground with some “moderate” elements to create a winning coalition. Will that common ground be reducing illegal immigration, as it is in Europe? Will it be restricting abortion and limiting the ability of the federal government to meddle in our lives? Or will it be guaranteed free day care, a $15/hour minimum wage and a stipend for those who, according to the Green New Deal, are “unwilling to work?” I really don’t know. Regardless, the unalloyed good here is that both sides are coming to see “moderates” as the feckless and uncertain allies that they are.

In October, Canada became the first industrialized country, and the second overall behind Uruguay, to legalize recreational pot. It was followed not long after by a handful of U.S. states legalizing or expanding access to cannabis in the November midterm elections, and President Trump signing the Farm Bill into law in December, giving the green light to hemp and hemp-based products.

Just how big could the legal weed industry be? While estimates are all over the place, investment firm Cowen Group offers the most robust sales prediction of $75 billion in worldwide sales by 2030. Meanwhile, a co-authored report from Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics is calling for $31.3 billion in global sales by 2022, up from $12.8 billion in 2018.

Figures like these are what has made Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: ACB) the most popular stock among millennial investors on free-trading app Robinhood. However, there's probably also no stock that's more polarizing to investors as a whole than Aurora Cannabis. You either think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread, or you find it grossly overvalued, with few if any investors taking a middle-of-the-road stance.

Three very good reasons Aurora Cannabis could make you rich

With this in mind, below you'll find three arguments in favor of buying one of the largest publicly traded pot stocks in the world. Afterwards, I'll tackle three arguments against buying Aurora Cannabis.

If there's a clear top reason to buy into the Aurora Cannabis growth story, it's the company's peak production potential. Although Aurora's management team has guided to ""in excess of 500,000 kilograms"" annually when running on all cylinders, it's hard to see the company near a figure this low. Rather, management had been calling for 570,000 kilos prior to the purchase of ICC Labs in South America for 264 million Canadian dollars late last year. With 92,000 square feet of existing production and 1.1 million square feet of under-construction greenhouse capacity, ICC Labs should help push Aurora close to 700,000 kilograms per year.

Even though production isn't everything, the company's sheer amount of annual output should help lead to ample long-term supply deals with domestic provinces and overseas countries where medical weed is legal. Also, the cannabis industry tends to benefit from economies of scale. This suggests that as production rises, Aurora's per-gram production costs should fall.

44,Empty,2019-02-21T14:08:20Z,"Israeli premier contender Benny Gantz has chided Prime Minister Netanyahu for lobbying to include the ultra-nationalist Jewish Power party in a future coalition, but in doing so, Gantz incited against the BALAD Palestinian-Israeli party which promotes democra…","“In our government there will be no Kahane and no BALAD,” said Israeli centrist contender Benny Gantz, in response to Netanyahu’s efforts to bring in the Jewish Power party (the ‘David Dukes’ of Israeli politics) to ensure a rightwing majority in parliament.

Surely, Netanyahu’s attempt is despicable – but what of Gantz’s comparison? BALAD is a predominantly Palestinian-Israeli party which seeks equality in a secular state.

BALAD responded to Gantz officially (Hebrew):

The announcement by Benny Gantz’s “Israeli Resilience” party, wherein he compares between BALAD, a democratic party which represents a large part of the Arab public, and the Kahanist mentors of Jewish terror, shows that Gantz – who not long ago glorified and boasted about the destruction he inflicted on Gaza – is no different from Netanayhu who incites against the Arabs and warns about their coming to vote in droves. Balad is a moral party which promotes the most democratic platform – a state of all its citizens. We will certainly not join a Gantz government and he is barging into an open door. A democratic party like BALAD opposes not only Netanyahu, but also Netanyahu 2 called Gantz.

That’s a great statement. Benny Gantz is supposedly a rival of Netanyahu, but is really his alter-ego inside the Zionist spectrum. Not that there aren’t shades of gray in it, but here Gantz is clearly marking what he, and Zionism, consider completely out of discussion: a democratic, secular state of all its citizens. Such a suggestion is seen as akin to fascist exclusivist Jewish terrorism, because it will supposedly destroy the state from inside.

Such a view is mainstream in the Israeli left-center. The Labor leader Avi Gabbay said as much when he was elected to lead the party in summer 2017:

The Joint List’s current composition includes anti-Zionist elements like [Haneen] Zoabi and [Jamal] Zahalka, so we can’t cooperate with this composition.

(Gabbay was referring to the two BALAD leaders who won’t be running for parliament in coming elections).

This is a sad reality, and it’s not about Benjamin Netanyahu or Benjamin Gantz, Netanyahu 1 or Netanyahu 2. It’s really like Gabbay says – it’s about Zionism. Because equality is simply anathema to Zionism, no matter how much Zionist apologists point out that there are Arab citizens in Israel.

So when the Zionist leaders compete on who is more Zionist, they are bound to incite against those few who dare to challenge the Zionist model. And that puts them in the center, serving as an insurance against claims that they are “Arab lovers” (as former Labor leader Isaac Herzog warned).

“Jewish power”

The Jewish Power (Otzma Yehudit) leaders are followers of Meir Kahane – former leader of ‘Kach’ party which was banned from running in the elections in 1988 and was designated as a terror organization in Israel, the U.S., Canada and the EU. The leader of ‘Kach’ Meir Kahane managed to get elected in 1984 and was boycotted by all the other parties in the Knesset. He tried to pass a law for stripping non-Jews from their citizenship, a law for separate beaches for Jews and Arabs and other racist laws.

These are the party leaders, as David Horovitz characterizes them in the Times of Israel:

– Former lawmaker Michael Ben-Ari. Interviewed on Army Radio on Wednesday afternoon, he was asked to disavow Kahane’s racist ideology. He ridiculed the notion. Kahane, he said, was his teacher, his rabbi.

– Itamar Ben Gvir, made headlines in Israel in 1995 when he held up the Cadillac insignia ripped from prime minister Yitzhak Rabin’s car and bragged to a TV camera, “Just as we got to this symbol, we can get to Rabin” – merely a few weeks before Rabin’s murder.

– Baruch Marzel, a former top aide to Kahane known for organizing parties in celebration of Baruch Goldstein, who massacred 29 Palestinians at prayer in Hebron’s Cave of the Patriarchs in 1994.

– Benzi Gopstein, an ex-Kahane student and Kach activist whose Lehava movement works to prevent relationships — romantic and otherwise — between Jews and Palestinians.

These are the guys that Netanyahu was so bent on having alliance with, to secure his rightwing majority. The fear was that if Jewish Power didn’t make alliance with other right religious-nationalist parties, those parties might fall below the 3.25% Knesset threshold (the so-called blocking line of four seats in the parliament) and go to waste. Jewish Home had already made alliance last week with the National Union faction, but was still resisting pressure to merge with Jewish Power – until Netanyahu spearheaded a personal campaign for them to join forces.

Netanyahu promised to give the Jewish Home party the 28th spot on Likud’s candidate list in return for election merger with Jewish Power. This move is expected to secure the needed 4 seats for this alliance.

These are the sensibilities in the Israeli elections. Netanyahu will make these deals with the Israeli David Dukes, and Gantz will chide him for it, but in doing so incite against those who seek a liberal, democratic, state of all its citizens. In the end, Gantz’s party name “Israeli Resilience” really does translate to Jewish Power. Because that’s what Zionism is about – the “strong Jew”.

For the ‘liberal-Zionists’, the only question remaining is how to make that palatable to everyone else, how to make it sound democratic, how to make it seem liberal, how to make it look moral. But when it comes down to it, Zionists view equality as their destruction.

45,Empty,2019-02-22T11:00:28Z,It's a tale of two creditors – each with distinct foreign policy goals.,"A month ago, Venezuelan National Assembly President Juan Guaidó refused to recognize the legitimacy of President Nicolás Maduro’s fraudulent May 2018 reelection. Guaidó declared himself interim president, calling for new elections — and quickly garnered the support of the United States, Canada, most of the European Union and a dozen Latin American nations.

Absent from that list are two countries with major financial interests in Venezuela: China and Russia. It has been a tale of two creditors, each with a concentrated financial exposure to Venezuela yet distinct foreign policy aims. Our research, reflected in two recently published Wilson Center reports, examines these differences in Chinese-Venezuelan and Russian-Venezuelan economic relations. Here’s what you need to know:

1. For China, oil ties mean Beijing has to be pragmatic about nonintervention.

On the eve of the global financial crisis, President Hugo Chávez and President Hu Jintao laid the foundations of the China-Venezuela state-to-state relationship when they crafted their first loans-for-oil deals in 2007. Chávez was able to court a creditor to help expand the Venezuelan state. For Beijing, Venezuela’s abundant natural resources and energy supplies could help China secure long-term access to these vital national assets.

By 2014, China’s main policy bank, the China Development Bank (CDB), had provided the Venezuelan government with more than $30 billion in new oil-backed loans. They had mainly supported investment in the energy and mining sectors, including power stations, oil refineries and pipelines. However, the initial discretionary nature of these policy bank loans also meant that Venezuela used the proceeds for infrastructure projects in a variety of other sectors, including agriculture, telecommunications, housing and forestry.

[Here are the 3 big shifts in Venezuela that you probably missed — and will change what comes next]

China’s policy banks hoped to avoid the failings of other creditors in Latin America by circumventing the need for policy conditionality with commercial conditions. Beijing used loans-for-oil deals, wagering that the production capacity of Venezuela’s state oil company (PDVSA) was a sufficient guarantee for debt repayment.

This was a miscalculation. China overestimated Venezuela’s ability to sustain oil production and, hence, economic activity, but also its ability to successfully manage several commercial projects that were spread across broad sectors of the economy. China thus paid a high cost when Venezuela fell into arrears on its oil collateral and failed to finance transportation projects in 2014 amid the country’s worsening economic crisis and historic oil sector collapse.

As Venezuela’s economy worsened, China grew cautious

With China’s loans tied to oil production, China’s policy banks were compelled to lend defensively — rolling over about $9 billion of existing bilateral funds — in the hope of boosting Venezuela crude output and recovering their oil collateral. But Beijing also grew reluctant to extend any new financial arrangements, as China became more circumspect about Maduro’s ability to manage the economy. At its peak, between 2010 and 2013, Venezuela accounted for an average of 64 percent of China’s new approved lines of credit to Latin America. But from 2014 to 2017, Venezuela represented 18 percent of China’s total new lines of credit to the region.

[Why did China stand by Maduro in Venezuela?]

China’s strategy revolves around a pragmatic commitment to “nonintervention,” protecting its considerable financial commitments by hedging politically as well as commercially. Chinese leaders courted Venezuela’s opposition leaders during the 2012 presidential and the 2015 parliamentary elections. Guaidó representatives reportedly met with Chinese officials last week to discuss Venezuela’s $20 billion outstanding debt to China.

Guaidó has sought to build on this diplomatic momentum, saying that China’s “support will be very important in boosting our country’s economy and future development.” In Beijing, a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seemed to reciprocate, saying, “No matter how the situation evolves, China-Venezuela cooperation should not be undermined.”

2. Russia is looking to boost both its geopolitical and economic capital

Beginning in 2015, as China grew more cautious and concerned about its exposure in Venezuela, Russia provided about $6.5 billion in new funds through its state-owned enterprise, Rosneft, to Venezuela’s state-owned oil company. Previously, the cornerstone of the Russia-Venezuelan relationship had been military ties, with Venezuela buying more than $4 billion in Russian arms and military equipment.

By financially backing the Maduro regime, Russia seized an opportunity to signal its return to the global and hemispheric stage with a symbolic move in Venezuela, a country in close U.S. proximity. Moscow also demonstrated to its hemispheric allies, such as Cuba and Nicaragua, that it could both exercise Latin American influence and challenge U.S. geopolitical interests.

In the wake of Guaidó’s political ascension, Russia drafted a U.N. resolution expressing “its concerns over threats to use force” against Venezuela. Russia fired a rhetorical shot across the U.S.’s foreign policy bow, warning that “the cynical, overt interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state” must stop. Venezuela’s military, an ongoing supporter of the Maduro regime, has relied on Russia for military equipment — circumventing U.S. sanctions.

Russia’s motivations were largely political

The guiding principles of Russia’s involvement in the oil and gas sectors are also mostly political rather than commercial. In a recent Wilson Center report, analyst Vladimir Rouvinski suggests that Russian political elites “sincerely believe there is an opportunity to improve the situation sometime in the future with Chavistas still in control of Venezuela.”

Russia’s state-owned enterprises emerged as key investors at a time when the Maduro government found it increasingly difficult to secure new credit from anywhere, including China. Rosneft and Gazprom, Russia’s energy giants, provided valued short-term financing to Venezuela’s crumbling oil-state company (PDVSA).

In exchange, PDVSA provided 49.9 percent of its total shares from its U.S. subsidiary, Citgo, as collateral to Rosneft to guarantee future payments. Furthermore, Rosneft has increased in equity stake in the Orinoco’s heavy oil belt joint venture and has also received access to the largest gas reserves in Venezuela.

[Will Venezuela’s military back — or abandon — Maduro? Here are the 4 things it will consider.]

But Moscow appears to be learning from China’s Venezuelan hedge by diversifying its strategic hand beyond the geopolitical card. Facing mounting financial arrears, vulnerable supply chains, U.S. court battles over Citgo shares used as loan collateral, and U.S. sanctions on the Rosneft CEO, there are limits to how far Rosneft can extend its financial exposure in Venezuela.

Rosneft is Russia’s largest oil producer and second-largest gas-producing firm — this means Russia has to protect the company’s commercial interests. Recently, Russia appears to be counterbalancing the tough geopolitical rhetoric with a softer push, saying, “The only way out of this crisis is for the government and opposition to sit down for negotiations.” Notwithstanding ongoing uncertainty regarding Venezuela’s political future, it is clear that both China and Russia plan to be a part of Venezuela’s economic future.

HR1 (text here) was, symbolically, the first bill introduced in this session of the House, and it rapidly aqquired 227 co-sponsors — of whom not one was a Republican. The bill garnered a lot of positive coverage. From the Brennan Center for Justice:

The Brennan Center has long advocated for, and in many cases helped innovate, many of the reforms outlined in H.R. 1. “Perhaps more than ever, Americans understand the problems facing our democracy,” said Weiser. “They are hungry for bold and effective solutions to those problems — like those in H.R. 1 — and real action on those solutions.” Weiser submitted written testimony in support of the Act in advance of Thursday’s hearing. In her comments on Thursday, she highlighted three of the reforms outlined in H.R. 1: Restoring the Voting Rights Act, a landmark civil rights law that was hobbled by the Supreme Court’s 2013 Shelby County decision;

a landmark civil rights law that was hobbled by the Supreme Court’s 2013 Shelby County decision; Automatic voter registration (AVR), which would streamline how Americans register to vote — and could add up to 50 million new voters to the rolls; and

which would streamline how Americans register to vote — and could add up to 50 million new voters to the rolls; and Small-donor public financing, which would amplify the voices of ordinary voters by providing public funds to match small donors. Thursday marked the latest in a series of hearings on H.R. 1, which have focused on elements of the bill ranging from presidential ethics to election security. The bill marks the first time in decades that either major political party has made comprehensive reform of the systems of democracy a central priority.

(Let me pause to compliment the Brennan Center for not using the noxious phrase “our democracy.” As the old joke goes, “What do you mean, ‘we’?”) Democrat House organ The New Yorker:

[Last week,] a hearing on H.R. 1, the For the People Act, took place in the House of Representatives. Elijah Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, the new chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, referred to the bill, in his opening remarks, as “one of the boldest reform packages to be considered in the history of this body.” He added, “This sweeping legislation will clean up corruption in government, fight secret money in politics, and make it easier for American citizens across this great country to vote.” That statement was not partisan hyperbole. The bill is a broad, imaginative, and ambitious set of responses to the most pressing challenges facing American democracy, many of which preceded the 2016 election, but almost all of which were brought into sharper focus by it. Implicit in the choice to take up an electoral-reform bill as the first act of the new Democratic majority in the House was the decision to confront not only these injustices but, more fundamentally, the forces that have allowed them to come into existence. The bill contains provisions to insure access to paper ballots, in order to verify the accuracy of voting results; to establish early voting in all states for federal elections; and to launch independent redistricting commissions, to address the problem of partisan gerrymandering.

(“Access” to paper ballots. Oh.) Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a scathing WaPo Op-Ed, dubbed it “the Democrat Politician Protection Act,” and given what we know about how the liberal Democrat establishment operates, it would be strange indeed if the bill did work in their favor, institutionally. Now, I have no doubt that there are good things in the bill; but it’s 600 pages long, and I don’t have time to go through it all to find them. I do think, however, that the bill presents four major problems: Two Easter Eggs, little hidden surprises, and two Trojan Horses, something seemingly benign that is in fact destructive (in this case, of democracy, ironically enough in a bill titled “For the People”). The two Easter Eggs are raised barriers to small parties and digital voting; the two Trojan Horses are a role for the intelligence community, and the nature of campaign contribututions.

Easter Egg: Barriers to Small Parties

Bruce Dixon comments:

HR 1 is surgically aimed to eliminate federal matching funds for Green Party candidates by raising the qualifying amount from its current level of $5,000 in each of 20 states to $25,000 in 20 states. HR 1 would cut funding for a Green presidential candidate in half, and by making ballot access for a Green presidential candidate impossible in several states it would also guarantee loss of the party’s ability to run for local offices.

From the Bill:

SEC. 5202. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR MATCHING PAYMENTS. (a) Amount Of Aggregate Contributions Per State; Disregarding Of Amounts Contributed In Excess Of $200.—Section 9033(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended— (1) by striking “$5,000” and inserting “$25,000”; and (2) by striking “20 States” and inserting the following: “20 States (disregarding any amount of contributions from any such resident to the extent that the total of the amounts contributed by such resident for the election exceeds $200)”.

Easter Egg: Digital Voting

Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!–Edsger W. Dijkstra

In other words, digital must be removed everywhere in the voting and tabulating process, because otherwise the vote is vulnerable to hacking and election fraud. That’s why hand-marked paper ballots, hand-counted in public, are the world standard. To quote another programming proverb: “The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that aren’t there” (Gordon Bell).

From the Bill; I’ve helpfully underlined and noted in square brackets the problematic portions of the text:

SEC. 1502. PAPER BALLOT AND MANUAL COUNTING REQUIREMENTS. (a) In General.—Section 301(a)(2) of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 21081(a)(2)) is amended to read as follows: “(2) PAPER BALLOT REQUIREMENT.— “(A) VOTER-VERIFIED PAPER BALLOTS.— “(i) PAPER BALLOT REQUIREMENT.— (I) The voting system shall require the use of an individual, durable, voter-verified, paper ballot of the voter’s vote that shall [A] be marked and made available for inspection and verification by the voter before the voter’s vote is cast and counted, and which shall be counted by hand [B] or read by an optical character recognition device or other counting device . For purposes of this subclause, the term ‘individual, durable, voter-verified, paper ballot’ means a paper ballot marked by the voter by hand [C] or a paper ballot marked through the use of a nontabulating ballot marking device or system , [D] so long as the voter shall have the option to mark his or her ballot by hand . “(II) The voting system shall provide the voter with an opportunity to correct any error on the paper ballot before the permanent voter-verified paper ballot is preserved in accordance with clause (ii). “(III) The voting system shall not preserve the voter-verified paper ballots in any manner that makes it possible, at any time after the ballot has been cast, to associate a voter with the record of the voter’s vote without the voter’s consent. “(ii) PRESERVATION AS OFFICIAL RECORD.—The individual, durable, voter-verified, paper ballot used in accordance with clause (i) shall constitute the official ballot and shall be preserved and [E] used as the official ballot for purposes of any recount or audit conducted with respect to any election for Federal office in which the voting system is used. “(iii) MANUAL COUNTING REQUIREMENTS FOR RECOUNTS AND AUDITS.— (I) Each paper ballot used pursuant to clause (i) shall be suitable for a manual audit, and shall be counted by hand in any recount or audit conducted with respect to any election for Federal office.

[A] “be marked” leaves the agent doing the marking unspecified (see notes [C] and [D).

[B] “or read by an optical character recognition device or other counting device” means that the count need not be by hand, and need not be public.

[C] “marked through the use of a nontabulating ballot marking device or system,” for example, hackable touch screens.

[D] “shall have the option to mark his or her ballot by hand” means that voting machine vendors can use UI/UX “dark patterns” to discourage hand-marking.

[E] “used as the official ballot for purposes of any recount” means that the paper ballot is not the official ballot (!!) until a recount is performed. But how do we know to perform a recount if an election has been successfully hacked? Why not just make the paper ballot the official ballot to begin with[1], and get rid of all the digital cruft, as they do in Canada, Germany, and the UK?[2]

Collectively, the notes show that the section title — “Subtitle F—Promoting Accuracy, Integrity, And Security Through Voter-Verified Permanent Paper Ballot” — is at best deceptive and at worse a bait-and-switch. This entire section is so sloppy and bad it might as well have been written by an e-voting lobbyist. For me, it calls the good faith of the entire bill into question. Anybody who thinks this bill advances the cause of paper ballots in any way is a fool gravely mistaken.

Vice president Mike Pence said four Venezuelan state governors allied to Mr Maduro were the target of the new sanctions, while he urged the international community to freeze assets of the nation's state-run oil company. The US also asked the United Nations Security Council to hold an urgent meeting on the crisis.

“I want to assure you, President Guaidó, that the tragic events of the past weekend have only steeled the resolve of the United States of America,” Mr Pence said at a meeting of the Lima Group in Colombia.

The meeting was attended by opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself Venezuela's president.

According to the Associated Press, Mr Pence added. “We are with you 100 per cent.”

Also in Colombia at the weekend, where he visited efforts to transport US aid across the border into Venezuela – an effort that resulted in violence and several deaths – was Republican senator Marco Rubio, who has been highly influential on Donald Trump’s Latin American policy and whom the New York Times has termed the “ouster in chief”.

On Sunday, he tweeted several messages attacking Mr Maduro’s government before then posting three images of ousted dictators – Libya’s Gaddafi, Panama’s Manuel Noriega and Romania’s Nicolae Ceausescu. The gruesome, blood-laced image of the Libyan leader was taken as he was bayoneted to death by rebels in the city of Sirte in October 2011. Nato had earlier engaged in a devastating bombing campaign against Gadafi's forces.

Mr Rubio’s tweet of the image contained no text, but quickly sparked outcry on social media. A number of commentators said he was tweeting the equivalent of stills from a “snuff movie”.

In Colombia at the meeting of nations from the Americas, Mr Pence spoke with Mr Guaido, who Washington had encouraged to declare himself the country’s “legitimate” president and who it quickly regonised as such after he did so. The UK, Canada and up to 50 other nations quickly followed, while China, Russia and Mexico still recognise Mr Maduo.

Mr Pence accused Mr Maduro’s forces of burning several trucks containing medical supplies over the weekend as the opposition tried to deliver US aid, even though it was unclear how they were set alight.

“As the world watched, the tyrant in Caracas danced as his henchmen murdered civilians and burned truckloads of food and medicine destined for the people of Venezuela,” Mr Pence claimed. “These men worked to block aid for people in need and suppress peaceful protests – and their actions will not go unpunished.

“In the days ahead, the US will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks. We will find every last dollar they have stolen and return that money to the Venezuelan people.

“As we continue to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the Maduro regime, we hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But others - including several European nations - voiced caution. Hamilton Mourão, vice president of Brazil, one of the nations that has recegnised Mr Guaido, said under no circumstances would his country allow the US to intervene militarily in Venezuela from Brazilian territory.

Mr Maduro has denied claims that he is refusing to accept aid. Indeed, the UN has stepped up distribution of humanitarian supplies in the country. His supporters point out the US has previously used shipments of aid in Latin America to smuggle weapons to rebels. Three decades ago, Elliott Abrams, currently Mr Trump’s point person on Venezuela, oversaw such an operation against the democratically elected government of Nicaragua.

Mr Maduro on Monday tweeted that the “empire and its lackey” must understand that in “Venezuela the self-determination of our people reigns. We will solve the problems in a national union, with the Bolivarian government that I preside over. Together for Venezuela!”.

Meanwhile, the US asked the UN Security Council to discuss the Venezuela situation on Tuesday. Reuters said Washington wanted the 15-member council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections in Venezuela with international observers, a move that prompted Russia to propose a rival draft resolution.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - The United States targeted Venezuela's government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of its state-owned oil company PDVSA after deadly violence blocked aid from reaching the crisis-hit country during the weekend.

The United States also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking that body to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The U.S. Treasury Department's sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of embattled President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the United States.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogota as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and opposition leader Juan Guaido met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the Venezuelan crisis.

Pence said the United States would stand by Guaido until freedom was restored to the OPEC member. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA's assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Maduro's ""henchmen"" to Guaido's government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming.

""In the days ahead ... the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks,"" Pence said. ""We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.""

Guaido, sitting next to Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the ""massacre"" of the weekend.

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during the protests and clashes on Saturday as U.S.-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

Guaido, recognised by most Western nations as Venezuela's legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider ""all options"" in ousting Maduro.

Pence repeated an earlier statement that there would be an amnesty for members of the armed forces who throw their support behind Guaido. He said he hopes Maduro and those supported by his ""corruption and his brutality"" will leave Venezuela peacefully.

""We make clear to them that we will support the interim president's call for amnesty, an inclusive government, an inclusive future for members of the armed forces, who have laid down their arms and stand with the Guaido government,"" Pence said.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the United States is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela Martinez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region's other powers in embracing Guaido as Venezuela's rightful president.

""We believe there can be no bystanders, no one on the sidelines of this, particularly in our hemisphere, and our message today very much was intended to say - to Mexico, to Uruguay, to nations across the eastern Caribbean - that they need to come off the sidelines, they need to take a stand for freedom. Stand with us and with the people of Venezuela,"" said Pence.

Washington wants the 15-member U.N. Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela's energy sector and back Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Violence escalated during the weekend when the convoy of trucks with food and medicines was blocked by soldiers and armed groups loyal to Maduro. He says the aid efforts are part of a U.S.-orchestrated coup against Venezuela.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Maduro's government last week.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighbouring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has been wracked by years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as ""trochas"" generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as ""trocheros.""

""We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,"" said Belkis Garcia, 34, walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. ""We have to pay (to cross), so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don’t know what will happen if the border continues closed.""

Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested in unrest since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said in a press conference.

The four governors sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury include the flamboyant Rafael Lacava of state of Carabobo, who in 2018 visited Washington as part of talks that led to the release of Joshua Holt, an American who was imprisoned in Venezuela for nearly two years. Lacava goes by the nickname ""Dracula"" in reference to his habit of doing late-night patrols and is known for off-the-cuff social media videos.

The opinions in this article are those of the author.

(CNN) Since the end of the World War II, Western nations have shared the belief that international trade was a virtue. While progress has too often been lethargic, in the decades since, the United States and European nations have worked together to reduce barriers to trade.

This went hand in hand with a special bond between our two continents -- culturally, militarily, as a broad alliance of free nations.

Together, progress has been achieved in the form of the institutions such as the World Trade Organization and the European Community -- the forerunner to the European Union.

Trade-based agreements between the EU and the United States multiplied. Progress was made toward a comprehensive US-EU trade deal. Perhaps under a different president, these talks could even have been concluded. By signing trade deals with Japan and Canada, the EU has shown it is capable of cutting global trade deals and furthering rules-based trade.

As US companies have invested in Europe, successful European companies -- for example, automakers -- invested in the United States.

BMW, a legendary German carmaker, employs thousands of workers at its biggest production plant in South Carolina, which builds nearly half a million vehicles a year. Many of these are exported to Europe and elsewhere.

As with so many policy areas, the election of Donald Trump -- an isolationist and protectionist -- has upended the status quo . In the capitals of Europe, the trans-Atlantic relationship is turning into a nightmare.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel rightly expressed exasperation at the Trump administration's suggestion that European cars are a threat to US national security, calling it a ""shock."" This was German understatement.

Trump believes the United States ""loses"" when it runs trade deficits with other countries. Confusingly for many Europeans, traditionally free-trading Republicans appear to go along with Trump's 16th-century view of international trade.

Following European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's negotiations with Trump in July, the EU made a number of concessions by committing to importing more liquefied natural gas, soybeans and other products from the United States.

The Trump administration told Europeans that it would not impose trade tariffs on the EU or Japan as long as it continues to make progress in trade talks. Now it seems these promises and the progress we have made are about to be torn up.

What has changed? It is unclear. Trump's personality often requires that someone else must pay the price for the President's failures. It has been the hallmark of his presidency.

As we have seen with Trump's government shutdown over his wall, foreigners are easy scapegoats for domestic economic woes, of which the President has a long list. Europe thus risks becoming the next scapegoat for Trump's failure to do anything to boost the competitiveness or sustainability of US car plants over the long term.

Creating new trade barriers in the globalized world trading system will simply lead to a leakage of jobs by car manufacturers to outside jurisdictions.

The imposition of additional tariffs on the EU would only hurt domestic jobs and investments in the United States. But there would be noneconomic effects of a damaging US-EU trade war, too, which should also be factored in by the Trump administration.

On a human level and in diplomatic circles, even the threat of a trade war against the EU is doing lasting damage to the perceptions of America in European countries, which is deeply regrettable.

Never in my lifetime have US politicians been so tone-deaf to the aspirations and hopes of Europeans. Never have I seen the trans-Atlantic alliance look so fragile. One look at the eye-wateringly awkward responses to Vice President Mike Pence's recent speeches at the Munich Security Conference and elsewhere reaffirm this.

A trade war against allies still reeling from a global financial crisis triggered by the US subprime crisis more than 10 years ago, just ahead of European parliamentary elections due in May, will not only be economically harmful.

It also would cut deeply into the trans-Atlantic alliance at the worst possible time by giving anti-American, anti-capitalist nationalists and protectionists in Europe a platform to thrive. Anti-American sentiment will grow, and Europe risks a retreat to protectionism.

The post Trump isn’t colluding with the Russians — he’s conspiring with Putin appeared first on Raw Story.,"But not enough attention has been paid to the number of times Trump and Putin have talked since the election. According to The New York Times, Trump and Putin have had at least five meetings in person, and nine conversations over the phone since Trump won the election on November 9, 2016. Trump has gone to extraordinary lengths to keep those conversations secret, including taking away his own translator’s notes after a private meeting with Putin in Hamburg, Germany at the G-20 Summit in 2017. He also had a second meeting with Putin after a dinner at the same summit, during which Trump’s own interpreter was barred from the meeting. “There is no official United States government record of what was said,” according to the Times.

It has been widely reported that Trump accepted Putin’s denials of Russian interference in the 2016 election over the opinions of his own intelligence officials. But we didn’t know until this week with the publication of former FBI deputy director, Andrew McCabe’s book, “The Threat” that Trump had taken Putin’s word over that of American intelligence agencies about the ability of North Korean ICBM’s to reach American shores. During an intelligence briefing in the White House, Trump told his intelligence chiefs, “I don’t care. I believe Putin,” according to the interview McCabe gave to “60 Minutes.”

Why would Trump accept the word of an aggressive adversary over that of his own intelligence agencies? Why would he go to such great lengths to keep secret what he and Putin have talked about in person and on the phone? I think we now have our answer. It’s part of Trump’s continuing collusion with Russian president Vladimir Putin. The collusion didn’t end with the election. It’s ongoing. It’s constant. In fact, I don’t think we really know how many times Trump has talked to Putin. McCabe was asked during an interview this week when Trump had learned from Putin about the abilities of North Korea’s missile program. “I don’t know,” McCabe replied. Neither do we.

Trump’s contacts with the Russians go beyond his conversations with Putin. Remember what happened after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May of 2017? One day later, he welcomed into the Oval Office the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and bragged about firing Comey. “I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,” Trump told the Russians.” “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.” He then added, apparently unprompted, “I’m not under investigation.”

But we didn’t learn that from a White House transcript of the Oval Office meeting with the Russians. Nor did we learn it from members of the White House press corps who were present, because none were. No, we learned it days later from leaks by the Russian media, who were present in the Oval Office.

Trump had already spoken with Putin on the phone twice. Now he was reassuring the Russians that he had taken care of the man who had announced he was investigating Russian collusion with the Trump campaign, and that he himself was not a subject of an FBI investigation.

That would not remain true for very long. We now know from McCabe’s book that he had opened a criminal and counterintelligence investigation of President Trump soon after he fired Comey. “I was very concerned that I was able to put the Russia case on absolutely solid ground in an indelible fashion that were I removed quickly or reassigned or fired that the case would not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace,” McCabe told CBS’ “Sixty Minutes” last Sunday.

McCabe was correct to be worried that the FBI investigation of Trump would either disappear or come under attack by the president. The New York Times reported yesterday that Trump has attacked the Russia investigation more than 1,100 times. “The attacks, which number nearly 1,200, are part of a strategy to beat back the investigations. They have also opened him to possible obstruction of justice charges. They include statements made on Twitter, in official speeches, at rallies and during news media interviews and other press events.”

Attacking the investigation being carried out by Robert Mueller hasn’t been enough, however. What Trump has been doing with Putin isn’t collusion, it’s a conspiracy. The foundational crime of the conspiracy was to steal the election of 2016. What’s happened since has been a continuing conspiracy to destroy the Mueller investigation and push back at Democrats who are now gearing up to hold hearings to look into Trump and his Russia contacts. That’s why we have recently seen reports of Russian action on social media against Democrats during the midterm election for the house and senate in 2018. And now we’re seeing reports that the same Russians who interfered in the elections of 2016 and 2018 are starting to go after Democratic candidates who have announced for president, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren among them.

Practically every meeting Trump has had with American allies has been hostile. He has constantly threatened the NATO alliance and been critical of close allies like Germany, France, Canada, and Mexico. But everything he’s ever said about Russia and Putin has been positive. Everything. Even after he called off a formal meeting with Putin at the latest G-20 summit in Argentina last November, he managed to have a private conversation with the Russian leader at a dinner that was closed to the press, the White House had to admit later.

The collusion between Trump and Russia didn’t stop after the election. It’s ongoing, every time Trump appears with Putin at a summit, every time they have a private meeting, every time they pick up the phone. You think they might be getting ready for the election in 2020?

Guaido set out in a convoy of vehicles to personally pick up US aid being stockpiled on the other side of the Colombian border, defying Maduro's military to stop him.

Recognized as interim president by more than 50 countries, he left the capital Caracas for the Colombian border in a convoy of several vehicles for the 900-kilometre trip.

Embattled Maduro has dismissed Guaido's humanitarian caravan as a ""cheap show"" and slammed aid as a precursor for a US military intervention in the oil-rich but crippled Latin American country.

The 35-year-old leader of the Venezuelan legislature proclaimed himself acting president Jan 23 and wants to oust Maduro, set up a transitional government and hold new elections.

A separate caravan of buses and trucks containing opposition lawmakers had earlier left eastern Caracas bound for the border.

Several of the trucks were stopped by security forces and their drivers forced to get out, but the rest of the caravan was allowed to continue, lawmakers said.

""We know that the regime is going to put all obstacles to prevent us from reaching the border, but nothing is stopping us, we are going to continue,"" said opposition lawmaker Yanet Fermin.

Signaling his growing disquiet, Maduro announced Thursday that the border with Brazil - which along with Colombia is one of the main potential avenues for aid delivery - would be ""completely and absolutely"" closed from 8:00 pm (0000 GMT) until further notice.

Maria Teresa Belandria, Guaido's designated ambassador in Brazil, said aid deliveries would go ahead nonetheless. ""The operation goes on. There's no going back,"" Belandria told AFP.

She said 100 tons of food, medicines and emergency kits were waiting to be trucked from Boa Vista to Pacaraima on the Venezuelan border.

Maduro also warned on Thursday he was considering ""a total closure of the border with Colombia"" to Venezuela's west.

He has already ordered the military to barricade a major border bridge to prevent supplies from entering the country from Cucuta, Colombia, where tons of humanitarian aid are being stockpiled, most of it from the United States.

The military announced a ban on vessels putting to sea from Venezuelan ports until Sunday to avoid actions by ""criminal"" groups.

FIGHT OVER AID

Meanwhile, Maduro - mirroring Guaido's move in an attempt to show his socialist government was able to look after its people - ordered a shipment of thousands of food boxes to be distributed to the needy along the Colombian border.

Shipments of food and medicine for the crisis-stricken population have become a key focus of the power struggle between Maduro and Guaido.

Guaido, who says 300,000 people could die without an influx of aid, says he aims to rally a million volunteers to start bringing it in by Saturday.

It remained unclear how he proposed to do so if the blockade continues, but experts have pointed to the notoriously porous 2,200 kilometre border, which is perforated by well-worn drug trafficking and contraband routes.

BATTLING BANDS

Guaido said the planned entry points for aid were the Brazilian and Colombian borders, the island of Curacao and the seaports of Puerto Cabello and La Guaira.

Venezuela's vice-president Delcy Rodriguez said the government was shutting down air and sea links between Curacao and Venezuela.

That day, a robotic-looking Trudeau told reporters “the allegations in the Globe story this morning are false.”

“Neither the current nor the previous attorney general was ever directed by me nor anyone in my office to take a decision in this matter.”

Yesterday, in testimony before the House justice committee, the clerk of the privy council, Michael Wernick, Canada’s top bureaucrat, attacked the original Globe story, saying it “contained errors, unfounded speculation and in some cases [was] simply defamatory.”

He then confirmed its central assertion, that Wilson Raybould had in fact been pressed to stop the corruption prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

He said that on Dec. 19, he spoke to her about the case. “I conveyed to her that a lot of her colleagues and the prime minister were quite anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press about the future of the company, the options that were being openly discussed in the business press about the company moving or closing.”

So the Globe was right, of course. She was pressured—by Wernick, by Trudeau and by his right hand man, Gerry Butts—to overturn the decision of the independent director of public prosecutions, who had concluded that there was no basis to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin.

Wernick said that was not “inappropriate pressure,” that all the talk was “lawful advocacy,” but he would say that, wouldn’t he? He’s the one who applied the pressure. He can hardly now say that it was inappropriate to do so.

The legislation allows for the justice minister to overturn the independent decision of the director of public prosecutions, but to do so she would have had to declare it in the Canada Gazette, publicly undercutting the prosecutor, which might have led to a high-profile resignation, throwing the administration of justice into disrepute.

One of the surprising things about this whole mess is how many well-educated, powerful, astute people thought it was appropriate to put the muscle on Wilson-Raybould to push for a result that would have made all of them look bad.

It seems like they fell prey to groupthink, influenced by the high-priced and effective lobbyists. Note that the chairman of SNC-Lavalin’s board is Kevin Lynch, who held Wernick’s job under Harper. The Laurentian elite had convinced itself that SNC-Lavalin should not be allowed to fail.

I suspect the Prime Minister’s aides did not look closely enough at the law, or were distracted by the pressure to pick up seats in Quebec, which Trudeau needs if he is to win another majority. Premier Francois Legault was pressing Trudeau to come up with a way to save the company, reasonably enough, and Trudeau would dearly like to have Legault’s help in the coming election, in which he is likely to face hostile premiers in Ontario and Alberta.

Trudeau is not a details guy, so he likely asked Wernick and Butts to make this happen. They should have said, “Sorry, boss. That dog won’t hunt. Can we give Legault something on immigration?” Instead, it looks like, they said: “Let me talk to her, see if I can convince her.”

Then, when she wouldn’t come around, they should have said, “You know what, Jody, you were right. Good call.”

Instead, they said: “We are really looking forward to you bringing your skills to play at Veterans Affairs.”

Then came the Globe story, anonymous attacks on Wilson-Raybould from a senior Liberal, the resignation of Wilson-Raybould, the resignation of senior Liberal Butts, a weird cabinet meeting where Wilson-Raybould got to tell her colleagues about the inappropriate pressure and, finally, yesterday, Wernick’s appearance, where he confirmed the original Globe story.

It was a surprising turn of events, not because of what he had to say about the arm-twisting he engaged in, but because of the vivid observations he made about many other things.

Clerks of the privy council usually stay backstage. Because the Liberals have made a hash of this whole thing, communicating excessively and ineffectively without ever confronting the heart of the matter, Wernick had to deliver a soliloquy, doing work that Trudeau should have done.

It was the performance of a lifetime—powerful, emotional and effective—warning against foreign interference in our elections, violent political rhetoric and disrespect for the wise people, like him, for instance, who are running our government.

Wernick, whose back was to the wall, succeeded in producing headlines that had nothing to do with the matter at hand, and asserted—effectively but unconvincingly—that everything he and everybody else did to pressure Wilson-Raybould was appropriate.

I don’t think most law professors would agree with him, but law professors in general prefer the Trudeau government to the alternative, and are unlikely to rally against Trudeau the way they rallied against Stephen Harper when he tangled with Beverley McLachlin.

Wernick succeeded in spinning this mess, throwing up chaff and providing an explanation that people can buy if they are inclined to do so. This will make him a polarizing figure—since he praised Liberals and attacked Conservatives—which is not ideal, but the Liberals were desperate.

Wilson-Raybould will speak next week, and she may yet deliver a damaging blow, but for the first time since the Globe dropped its story, it looks like there may be a way for the Liberals to turn this from a preoccupying crisis to one difficult file among many.

This affair raises serious questions about the competence and judgment of Trudeau’s operation, but there are no indications that anyone was acting to pursue corrupt ends, and the Liberals have time to make a proposition to voters on other matters, if they have the competence and judgment necessary.

The post H1B spouses’ H4 work permits are being walked off the cli…,"New York: The Donald Trump government’s process of slow-walking H1B spouses' H4 visa work permit off the cliff is on its last mile and anxiety is peaking across the community of H1B spouses in the United States. The proposed rule to do away with H4 work permits (which came into effect in Barack Obama's second term) was sent to the Trump administration’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review last week. Headlines like ""Game over for H4EAD"" are floating around as families are torn between decisions about work and life in the US and the endless skewering.

""The squeeze is real and it's very effective from the administration's point of view. H1B extensions are getting very hard. Our families are getting hit. Spouses are upset that they may be denied working rights and to top to all, recruiters are going cold when they hear the word H1B. It's coming at us from all sides and frankly, we can't take it any more"", an ex-H1B worker who has moved to Canada barely a month ago, told Firstpost, in a phone conversation.

The H4 EAD is a work permit for spouses of H1B workers who have been approved for green cards and are yet to get those in hand. The Trump administration first announced its intent to scrap the H4 EAD in early 2017. The pushback against these work permits predates the Trump era and takes the form of a lawsuit launched against the program within days of its announcement by the Barack Obama government in 2015.

Charts extrapolating how quickly or slowly the H4 revocation could happen speak to the many pressures working on legal immigrant spouses over a prolonged period of many years now of which the last 2 years have been the most fraught.

""Let’s do everything collectively in our power to prevent the revocation of H-4 EAD"", says Cyrus Mehta, a high name recognition immigration attorney based in New York.

In government filings, the proposed changes are listed as “economically significant” and with “international impact”. At least 45% of all pending rule changes are in the “proposed rule” stage. You can see the high level overview here. If OMB moves at top speed and wraps up comments period within 30 days, we are looking at Spring 2019 when the comments review may begin. On the same sliding scale, a slower pace could push it all out by a few months. Either way, a constant gnawing remains for H1B families.

Once OMB reviews the proposed rule, it will be published in the Federal Register and opened for comments - the typical rubric for rule changes. Those who are following this can check for DHS pending rules and look for 1615-AC15. The same link also summarises the 'official' DHS lens on the issue.

Framed against the backdrop of the wider political scene in the country, the brief history of the H4 EAD in the Trump era fits neatly within the US president’s all-base, all-the-time strategy. But, like anything else, the White House’s chief occupant is the final wild card in this game and could always (in theory) step off the gas at any time. The motivations to soften the blow could come from multiple flanks and are emergent in nature, not all of which are overt at this moment.

At this time, the biggest of the #MAGA themed decisions - Trump's emergency declaration - is also on thin ice. Nearly two dozen former Republican members of Congress are urging GOP lawmakers to reject President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Whichever way that goes, it's an anthem for shifting sands and chaos well into the 2020 campaign season and all the way till the November 2020 elections.

Anirban Das, who came to the US on an F1 student visa to study for an Engineering Master's degree and has been a leading advocate for skilled immigrants here, explains how the numbers stack up, in a tweet: “As per USCIS stats, 100k #H4EAD are issued, out of which 30k were renewals. Which means only 70K are original applicants. USCIS has no idea how many are ACTUALLY working. US labor force is approx. 155 million. And they want to pull out 70k people from the workforce?”

This is how DHS explains the upside for citizens: “DHS anticipates that there would be two primary impacts that DHS can estimate and quantify: the cost-savings accruing to forgone future filings by certain H-4 dependent spouses, and labor turnover costs that employers of H-4 workers could incur when their employees’ EADs are terminated. Some U.S. workers would benefit from this proposed rule by having a better chance at obtaining jobs that some of the population of the H-4 workers currently hold, as the proposed rule would no longer allow H-4 workers to enter the labor market early.”

Das, quoted above, refutes that idea as a “lump of labor” theory. ""USCIS claims #H4EAD takes away American jobs. If an #H4EAD takes a job, it means a corresponding job loss for a citizen. This is ""lump of labor"" fallacy. No. of jobs in US economy are not set in stone. Studies show when more people join workforce, more jobs are created"".

Prominent US politicians have been at the forefront of the pushback; now even more so. Kamala Harris, the Indian American running for 2020 has called the effort “outrageous”. She tweeted that it “will force immigrant women who are doctors, nurses, scientists & academics, among others, to abandon their professional careers. I called on DHS last year to withdraw this proposal & will continue to fight this.”

Officials are silent on the fine print. What wasn’t clear earlier remains that way. We don’t know whether the proposed rule change will have retrospective effect or not. If say, an H1B spouse has an H4 EAD that is stamped till 2021 and the rule changes this year, does it mean the H4EAD holder must stop work for pay immediately? The lion’s share of H4 EADs are held by Indians, mostly women. A small percentage of H4 visa holders are men.

The closest we have come to an official/ bureaucratic view on this are USCIS chief Francis Cissna's quotes to Bloomberg Law. Cissna said there are “very good reasons why you might want to have H-1B spouses be able to work,” and that many of those spouses are “very highly skilled.” “If the spouse can’t work, that might prevent that person from wanting to come over or stay,” but that’s something Congress should fix, he told reporter Laura D Francis.

“The reason why we’re proposing rescinding it is not because we don’t desire these people to have employment authorization...It’s because, amongst other reasons, it doesn’t appear to have been the intent of Congress to grant them work authorization,” Cissna said, in the same Bloomberg interview.

The replies on this Twitter thread below give us a good sense of how many directions the H4 or even the H1B debate can take when it goes beyond the legal framework and instead becomes a flashpoint between a dominant group and a new subculture that gains currency in an economy, like the H1B has come to be understood over three decades of its presence in the US.

The citizens of Caracas face unpleasant choices.

What’s Next for Venezuela?

Scenes of destruction and despair were on full display worldwide over the weekend as the Maduro regime used force to deny entry into Venezuela of desperately needed humanitarian assistance, leading to increasing speculation about what comes next. Or, rather, will the United States invade Venezuela to topple the despotic regime that has ruined Latin America’s once-wealthiest economy and created Latin America’s worst humanitarian crisis in many years.

The threat of invasion has increasingly been implied, with senior U.S. administration officials suggesting routinely that “all options are on the table.” Indeed, they are, as they always are in the conduct of foreign affairs. But the implication is clearly that if Maduro and his inner circle refuse to depart, then the use of force may be employed.

Maduro plainly needs to go. His mandate as president expired on January 10, 2019, at which point he re-inaugurated himself based on the results of a clearly fraudulent election in May 2018. According to Venezuela’s constitution—a document instituted under Hugo Chavez, the founder of the so-called Bolivarian Revolution and Maduro’s political godfather—in the absence of a president the head of the National Assembly becomes the interim president and is then obligated to call for new elections. Under this scenario, Juan Guaido, the newly-installed, thirty-five-year-old head of the National Assembly, became the constitutional leader of Venezuela. The United States, the Lima Group of Latin American nations and Canada, European nations, Japan, and numerous others have now recognized Guaido as the legitimate, albeit interim, leader of Venezuela.

Over the past six years of Maduro’s misrule, Venezuela has become a humanitarian disaster. Fully 10 percent of the population has fled due to lack of food and healthcare, hyperinflation, and out of control crime. National oil company PDVSA, the life-blood of the economy, has been politicized and corrupted, and production is falling rapidly. The educational system has been fully coopted by Chavismo, and every institution of the state except the National Assembly has been bent to the will of the executive. Venezuela’s sovereignty has been sold cheaply to Cuba, which has thoroughly infiltrated the security services and state functions, and sweetheart deals have been cut to provide Venezuela’s national patrimony—oil—to China, Russia, and others in exchange for short term financing and support. In short, Chavismo has mortgaged Venezuela’s future. Interim president Guiado himself has obliquely called for an armed international response.

As bad as the situation continues to get in Venezuela, however, an armed response is unlikely. First of all, there is no casus belli that would justify a U.S.-led invasion. Nor is there a mandate from the United Nations or OAS. The doctrine of Responsibility to Protect is not sufficiently developed or accepted at this point, and circumstances do not yet justify its application to Venezuela in any event. Latin American nations, including those that support strong actions against Maduro, have publicly indicated little support for armed intervention, and, despite the rhetoric, there does not appear to be much enthusiasm in Washington for such a step.

In particular, while the U.S. military would be able to decapitate the Maduro regime and install Guaido in the Miraflores Palace without significant exertion, the aftermath of such action would be messy. Venezuela is a large country, much of it rural or jungled, and numerous non-state actors occupy large portions of the nation, from regime-sponsored goon squads, to FARC and ELN guerrillas seeking safe haven from Colombia, to illegal goldminers and wildcatters, to drug traffickers and common criminals and highwaymen. Invasion would be relatively easy; pacification could be complicated. Of course, with invasion would also come the responsibility to lead recovery efforts and shoulder the blame if such efforts did not lead to desired results. Within the context of administration efforts to deal with China and North Korea and Iran, pass the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, address domestic issues including the economy, border enforcement, and the activities of the Special Counsel, an invasion of Venezuela is not necessarily high on the priorities list.",What’s Next for Venezuela?,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/next-venezuela-144400468.html

Trump announced his decision in a pair of tweets, praising Craft's credentials for the job.

""I am pleased to announce that Kelly Knight Craft, our current Ambassador to Canada, is being nominated to be United States Ambassador to the United Nations...,"" Trump wrote.

""Kelly has done an outstanding job representing our nation and I have no doubt that, under her leadership, our country will be represented at the highest level. Congratulations to Kelly and her entire family!""

Craft is the wife of billionaire coal-mining executive Joe Craft, and they are major Republican donors. She made headlines as Canada ambassador nominee when she said she believes in ""both sides"" of climate science.

""I think that both sides have their own results, from their studies, and I appreciate and I respect both sides of the science,"" Craft told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 2017.

Craft's nomination is yet to be approved by the US Senate. If selected, she will not hold a Cabinet-level position, as it has been downgraded by President Trump.

According to Reuters news agency, Craft held meetings with Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton on Friday at the Oval Office.

Secretary Pompeo described Craft as an ""outstanding advocate for America's national security and economic interests in Canada"" and ""extremely well-qualified"" for the UN ambassador job.

Challenges for Craft

Craft was not Trump's first choice for the UN post; he had planned to nominate former State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, but she withdrew her name from consideration last week, citing family reasons.

Trump had also considered US ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell and former Senate candidate from Michigan John James for the UN role.

Craft, a Republican donor from Kentucky, served as a member of the US delegation to the UN General Assembly under President George W. Bush's administration.

As US ambassador to Canada, Craft played a key role in negotiating the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal, a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

If confirmed to the new post, Craft is likely to face a number of challenges, including containing Iran's influence in the Middle East and mending ties with the European Union.

Francois DeLattre, France's UN ambassador, said she looks forward to working with Craft. ""I hope that Ms. Craft will continue, like Nikki Haley, to be a bridge between Washington and the UN at a time when we more than ever need an America that is engages with the UN in world affairs and committed to our shared values, beginning with human rights,"" she said.

Microsoft AccountGuard has been developed as part of the company’s Defending Democracy program. It is designed to provide notification of cyber threats — including attacks by known nation-state actors — across email systems run by organisations and the personal accounts of individual staff.

AccountGuard is available as a free add-on to Office 365 for political candidates and parties, as well as think-tanks, non-profits and non-governmental organisations working on issues related to democracy and electoral integrity.

When threats are detected, Microsoft will notify the affected organisations and work with them to secure their systems.

Microsoft has now extended AccountGuard to the markets of France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain. It is already available in the UK and Ireland, as well as the US and Canada.

To coincide with the expanded launch, Microsoft disclosed that it has detected recent threat activity targeting democratic institutions in Europe as part of the work of its Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Digital Crimes Unit (DCU).

These attacks are targeting both political campaigns themselves and organisations that are likely to be in contact with government officials, such as political think-tanks and non-profits.

For example, the company said it had recently detected attacks targeting employees of the German Council on Foreign Relations, The Aspen Institutes in Europe and The German Marshall Fund.

The attacks, many of which can be traced to a group Microsoft calls Strontium, used spearphishing campaigns to seek to gain access to accounts belonging to employees located in Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania and Serbia.

“Europe is regarded as the ‘birthplace of democracy’. It was here that the principles of representative democracy were laid down — principles that have since been replicated across the globe. However, as the ongoing attacks demonstrate, this idea is increasingly under threat,” Microsoft Corporate Vice President for Customer Security and Trust Tom Burt said in a blog post.

“We believe the work of organizations like The German Marshall Fund and its Alliance for Securing Democracy are an essential part of efforts to secure democracies against those who seek to undermine it. Many organizations essential to democracy do not have the resources or expertise to defend themselves against cyberattacks. That is why we believe that technology providers have a responsibility to help.”

Microsoft’s announcement came one day after Twitter announced a new policy covering the EU as well as Australia that will require all political parties and candidates advertising on the platform to complete a multi-stage verification process.

Recent reports from Microsoft revealed that the attackers are focusing specifically on electoral integrity, public policy and democracy groups.

AccountGuard cybersecurity service will enter 12 new European markets including Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Lithuania. Estonia, Slovakia, Latvia, Estonia, Spain and Portugal.

As compared to the past, now users are more aware of the domestic and international electoral malfeasance and cyber attacks that are targeting users all over the world.

The tech giant has included around 14 countries from Europe along with the US and Canada in the Defending Democracy Program as of February 20th.

AccountGuard’s main features

The tool offers a handful of important features such as training and briefings on the latest trends, detection of threats across various email addresses and accounts.

Furthermore, large enterprise and government customers can enjoy early access to the latest security features offered by Microsoft. Few of them are enabling two-factor authentication, implementing access controls and installing updates.

AccountGuard has gained huge popularity in a short span of time, following its release last year. It is available to the users in Canada, the U.S., UK, and Ireland. Office 365 users can use it free of cost.

Microsoft also revealed that the service would be available to other European countries in the next few months.

In case you want to be secure while surfing the internet, you will need to get a full-dedicated tool to secure your network. Install now Cyberghost VPN and secure yourself. It protects your PC from attacks while browsing, masks your IP address and blocks all unwanted access.

Attackers made their first move

As we all know, the 2017 French Presidential Elections were reportedly influenced by cyber attacks. Moreover, European leaders are currently fearing that history is about to repeat itself. They might manipulate video and audio recording using ‘deep fake’ techniques.

The content is manipulated in a way that makes someone says something that he/she has never said or done before.

It seems like hackers have already made their first move as they tried to access 104 accounts that belong to users from different democratic institutions. These users are mainly located in France, Belgium, Serbia, Germany, Romania, and Poland.

As a matter of fact, Microsoft is aiming to protect customers and secure their systems by notifying the organizations regarding recent attempts.

The attackers followed the same technique that was used last year during U.S. mid-terms. They spoofed legitimate looking email addresses and created malicious URLs in order to get access to employee credentials and inject malware.

However, it is just a matter of time to see the history repeat itself. Do you see that prediction turning in to reality?

America’s largest Israel advocacy organizations issued an extraordinary rebuke of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government on Friday, responding to his move to ally with an extremist party under intense political pressure ahead of the April 9 election.



On Wednesday, Netanyahu supported an agreement between Bayit Yehudi and Otzma Yehudit, an offshoot of a racist political movement that has been designated a terrorist organization abroad and banned from Knesset lists since the 1980s.

The move could see Otzma in the Knesset for the first time and, conceivably, in a governing coalition.The American Jewish Committee vacillated over whether to comment on the unusual development, but ultimately chose to speak out on Friday. “The views of Otzma Yehudit are reprehensible,” the organization said. “They do not reflect the core values that are the very foundation of the State of Israel.”Looking ahead to the elections, the group continued, “AJC reaffirms our commitment to Israel’s democratic and Jewish character, which we hope will be the ultimate winners in every election cycle.”Equally unusual was the decision by AIPAC to endorse AJC’s statement in full by retweet.“We agree with AJC,” the American Israel Public Affairs Committee stated. “AIPAC has a long-standing policy not to meet with members of this racist and reprehensible party.”The Kahanist movement, founded by the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, considers Arabs and other non-Jews in Israel to be enemies of the state, and supports replacing Israel’s democratic government with a theocratic structure.Several different groups have spawned from Kahane’s racist ideology. Some have outwardly promoted violence, while others have stopped short of publicly proclaiming policies that would get them banned from sitting in the Knesset.Otzma falls in the latter category. It has taken a similar strategic approach to the stigma of Kahanist history that neo-fascist groups have navigated in the US and Europe, rebranding as an “alt-right” political movement tonally distinct and subtler than its predecessors.Kahane served in the Knesset for only one term, but his influence has carried long after his tenure and assassination in 1990. He advocated the annexation of Gaza and the West Bank, restoring Jewish “sovereignty” over the Temple Mount, limiting the rights of non-Jews to a subclass – or even forcibly “transferring” them from the country – and violence against his political enemies.Today, Otzma Yehudit supports several of these policies, including full Israeli control from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea and cancellation of the Oslo Accords. Party leaders have shied away from calls to violence and mass deportations, but support the forced expulsion of “Arab extremists,” avoiding specifics.Kahane was personally accused of plotting various terrorist attacks throughout the 1970s, and his followers continue to face accusations of supporting domestic terrorism and incitement to racism. A massacre of 29 Palestinian Muslims praying at Hebron’s Cave of the Patriarchs in 1994, perpetrated by followers of Kahane, led Israel, the US, Canada and the EU to designate Kahane’s Kach group as a terrorist entity.Netanyahu, who will address AIPAC’s policy conference next month, made a point of not responding to criticism from American Jewish leaders. But he did respond to criticism from the Blue and White Party and other political opponents, who he accused of “a hypocritical double-standard.”“It is absurd that they rule out encouraging mergers on the Right but consider it legitimate to ensure that inciters and spies against Israel enter the Knesset,” Netanyahu said.He was referring to votes by Labor and Meretz in the Central Elections Committee to permit then-Balad leader Azmi Bishara to run for Knesset. He later became the subject of a criminal investigation for acts of alleged treason and espionage, and was suspected of supplying information to Hezbollah on strategic areas in Israel to attack with rockets. Bishara was subsequently stripped of his Knesset immunity, and fled to Qatar.Netanyahu also noted that in 1999, then-candidate for prime minister Ehud Barak participated in the same rally as Northern Islamic Movement head Sheikh Raed Salah, who was later convicted of incitement.Blue and White’s prime ministerial candidate Benny Gantz said, “The rare statement issued by AIPAC, an organization which seldom deals with internal Israeli politics, proves that Netanyahu has yet again crossed an ethical boundary in an attempt to hold on to his seat while severely damaging the Israeli spirit, Jewish morals, and our important relationship with US Jewry.”Gantz’s partner in Blue and White, Yair Lapid wrote on Twitter that “Netanyahu caused huge damage to Israel’s image in the world and is wiling to endanger our democracy.” He added that “when our closest friends feel they must condemn us, it is clear to everyone that a redline has been crossed.”Labor faction chairman Itzik Shmuli thanked AIPAC and AJC for taking a stand against Otzma Yehudi and “telling Netanyahu that he cannot get away with everything that helps his battle for political and legal survival, but harms our national interests.”Otzma Yehudi responded that AIPAC members should move to Israel and “come home before interfering in the election.”“They don’t live here, and they criticize us, as if they are on Mount Olympus,” Otzma Yehudit Knesset candidate Michael Ben-Ari told KAN, adding that there was no reason for the Jewish organizations to criticize Netanyahu, because their running with Bayit Yehudi was merely technical, and after the election, they will split into a separate faction.“I won’t be part of Netanyahu’s coalition if he continues his current path,” Ben-Ari said.

64,Empty,2019-02-25T19:27:43Z,The Trump administration says President Maduro's 'days are numbered' after Venezuelan security forces killed four protesters. But any US-led operation to oust him is likely to be extremely unpopular.,"Leer en español.

Violence erupted at the Venezuela-Colombia border over the delivery of humanitarian aid to Venezuela, killing four people and injuring 24 on Feb. 22.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro that his “days are numbered,” and Trump officials reiterated that the U.S. is considering all options, including military action, to address Venezuela’s crisis.

Almost 80 percent of Venezuelans disapprove of Maduro, who was reinaugurated for a second six-year term in January after an election widely seen as fraudulent. Since taking power in 2013, he has led Venezuela into a deep economic crisis.

In late January, opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared Maduro a “usurper” and swore himself in as the country’s rightful president. More than 50 countries – including the United States, Europe and most of Latin America – want to replace Maduro’s regime with a Guaidó-led government.

Despite near global condemnation of Maduro, any U.S. intervention in Venezuela would be controversial. The United States’ long history of interfering in Latin American politics suggests that its military operations generally usher in dictatorship and civil war – not democracy.

The Cuban-US Cold War

Cuba, the focus of my history research, is a prime example of this pattern.

U.S.-Cuban relations have never recovered from President William McKinley’s intervention in Cuba’s war for independence over a century ago.

Before waging what in the U.S. is known as the Spanish-American War in 1898, McKinley promised that “the people of the island of Cuba” would be “free and independent” from Spain and that his government had no “intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control over said Island.”

In the end, however, Cuba’s independence from Spain meant domination by the United States.

For 60 years after the Spanish-American War, the White House made repeated military and diplomatic interventions in Cuba, supporting politicians who protected U.S. economic interests in sugar, utilities, banks or tourism and who backed American foreign policy in the Caribbean.

By 1952, when the U.S.-backed Fulgencio Batista overthrew President Carlos Prío Socarrás, Cuba’s government had effectively become protectors of American businesses, according to my research. Batista had a warm relationship with both Washington, D.C. and the American organized crime groups that used to control Havana’s tourist industry.

A communist revolution led by Fidel Castro overthrew Batista’s military junta in 1959. Castro decried the “imperialist government of the United States” for turning Cuba into an “American colony.”

The Kennedy administration’s trade embargo against Cuba and the disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion – in which the U.S. military trained Cuban dissidents in an attempt to unseat Castro – only pushed Cuba further into the orbit of Soviet Russia.

For the past six decades, the U.S. and Cuba have remained locked in a Cold War, with a brief thaw under President Barack Obama.

Anti-communist coups

Fearing that communism would spread across the hemisphere, the U.S. government repeatedly interfered in the politics of Latin American nations during the Cold War.

In 1954 the CIA worked with elements of the Guatemalan military to overthrow elected President Jacobo Árbenz, whom U.S. policymakers considered dangerously left-wing. Decades of dictatorship and civil war followed, killing an estimated 200,000 people.

A peace agreement in 1996 restored democracy, but Guatemala has yet to recover economically, politically or psychologically from the bloodshed.

Then there is Chile’s U.S.-supported coup d'etat. In 1973, the U.S. government covertly assisted right-wing elements of the Chilean military in overthrowing the socialist president Salvador Allende.

General Augusto Pinochet took power with the quiet financial and political support of the United States. His dictatorship, which lasted until 1990, killed tens of thousands of Chileans.

The Dominican Republic and Panama

U.S. intervention in Latin America did not start or end with the Cold War.

During World War I, the United States was concerned that Germany could use the Dominican Republic as a base of military operations. So American troops occupied the Caribbean island from 1916 to 1924.

Though the American-led administration improved the finances and infrastructure of the Dominican Republic, it also created the national guard that helped to propel Gen. Rafael Trujillo into power. His 30-year reign was savage.

President George H. W. Bush’s 1989 invasion of Panama is the rare exception when U.S. intervention in Latin American affairs actually created stability.

Most Panamanians appear to have supported the 1989 U.S. military operation to remove the corrupt and brutal military strongman Manuel Noriega.

In the years since, Panama has enjoyed comparatively peaceful elections and transfers of power.

Anti-Americanism in Latin America

On balance, though, U.S. military operations in Latin America have rarely brought democracy.

But they have created strong anti-American sentiment in the region, which leftist leaders from Fidel Castro to Hugo Chávez have adeptly harnessed to vilify their political opponents as mere U.S. puppets.

Support for the U.S. government is lower now than it has been in decades. Just 35 percent of Argentines, 39 percent of Chileans and 45 percent of Venezuelans view the U.S. favorably, according to the Pew Research Center.

President Maduro, too, has used anti-imperialist rhetoric. He denounces U.S. sanctions and other efforts to isolate his regime as a “gringo plot.”

A safer way to restore democracy

This history explains why a U.S. intervention in Venezuela would be viewed with skepticism. Though Maduro is unpopular, 65 percent of Venezuelans oppose any foreign military operation to remove Maduro, according to recent polling.

Rather than plan yet another coup d'etat, I believe U.S. efforts in Venezuela should support the work of the Lima Group, a coalition of 12 Latin American countries, including Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil, plus Canada.

The Lima Group has ruled out military force in Venezuela. Its pressure campaign to force him out peacefully has included diplomatically isolating his regime and asking Venezuela’s soldiers to pledge loyalty to Guaidó.

A negotiated settlement leading to Maduro’s voluntary departure from office is their ultimate goal.

Regional diplomacy is much slower than foreign intervention. But it avoids further bloodshed and reduces the role of anti-Americanism in Venezuela’s crisis.

It may also open a new chapter in the history of U.S.-Latin American relations – one in which the U.S. takes its lead from the region, and not the other way around.",Venezuela crisis: Trump threats to Maduro evoke bloody history of US intervention in Latin America,Theconversation.com,http://theconversation.com/venezuela-crisis-trump-threats-to-maduro-evoke-bloody-history-of-us-intervention-in-latin-america-111169
65,Empty,2019-02-22T06:00:00Z,The aging socialist Demcratic presidential candidate got a softball MSNBC interviewer asking him about Venezuela and all he could utter was boilerplate dreck to try to deflect the questions.,"An MSNBC interviewer, captured on video by The Right Scoop, gave him just that opportunity, as you can see from this screen shot here :

Bernie Sanders, 77, who's been defending socialist Venezuela for years, and who'd now like to be our president, has some explaining to do.

Bernie blew it.

MSNBC's Chris Hayes: What is the Bernie Sanders case for why Venezuela is the way it is? What went wrong there in what was an avowedly socialist project? Bernie Sanders: Ahhh, well. I mean, that's a long story that we can't, I don't think we have the time to get into.

Bernie Sanders, continuing: But this is what I will say: And that is, that I think there must be free and fair elections, in Venezuela, the last elections were not free, second of all, we have got to do everything that we can to provide humanitarian aid along with other countries, so the people do not starve to death, and thirdly, we need to make certain that the United States does not do what it has done, time and time again in our history, and that is, get involved in overthrowing governments in Latin America. We did that in Chile, we did that in Brazil, Guatemala, other countries, we should not be doing that now. The future of Venezuela must rest with the Venezuelan people, not the Trump administration.

This didn't seem to impress even the far-left softball Hayes all that much.

Here's the problem. Venezuela's crisis is very much a crisis of socialism. When you expand the state as much as Venezuela did, as rapidly as Venezuela did in the past decade, the private sector dies. That's not even with all of the expropriations of private property; just the expansion of the state is enough to do it, as Tyler Cowen argues in this seminal essay here.

If we look at government spending as a percentage of GDP, Venezuela seems far from socialism. In recent years government spending in Venezuela has been measured at about 40 percent of GDP, with the caveat that these statistics are not fully reliable. For the U.S., the corresponding figure is about 37 percent. Yet emerging economies typically cannot afford the same government programs as wealthier countries, and they cannot run them with the same efficacy. Poorer countries that try to expand their governments to size of wealthier countries, such as Brazil and Venezuela, typically encounter sub-par economic performance. These are indeed stories of big government run amok, as some of conservatives are suggesting.

Blowing out the private sector through price controls and currency controls, all in the name of ""fairness,"" is a pretty good way to leave just oil as the only money game in town as an unintended (or, given that these are socialists at war with the ""greedy"" private sector, intended) consequence of socialism writ large.

Socialist central planning from the state, in that government-knows-best way of Bernie Sanders and all his socialist allies, is another way to Venezuelify a nation through socialism. In 2003, Venezuela's strongman Hugo Chávez, following his Cowen-described creation of conditions for the destruction of the private sector through the expansion of government, nevertheless still had the state oil industry as his money source to ensure his permanent power, which he justified as ""la revolución."" Instead of guarding the oil like Gollum's ring, which would have required free-market business practices, he fired all the oil experts and replaced them with politically connected cronies chosen for their socialism and then spent the oil company's earnings on welfare instead of operational investment, as a normal company would do.

That's a really good way to run out of other people's money.

Is Bernie Sanders saying he'd never dream of doing any such things in the name of ""fairness"" or ""ending greed"" or ""the people""?

Of course not. That's why he can't answer the question.

What's more, Sanders's last statements are a mishmash of true and false premises, which make the rest of his response inchoate.

He starts out almost sounding good by saying he wants free and fair elections in Venezuela, just as Venezuela's acting president, Juan Guaidó, fighting to boot the socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro, has called for. Fine and dandy, but Sanders forgets to mention that socialism — a monopoly of cronies, red-shirted socialist thugs forcing government workers and the slum-dwellers to vote a certain way, or else no job or ration card, and a rigged electronic voting system from an electoral board run by socialist cronies that could check who voted for whom was precisely why those elections were so unfair. Socialism takes socialists, and sure enough, it was socialists who made Venezuela's election unfair.

Then he says he wants Venezuelans to be fed, the very thing socialism always promises in its propaganda dating from the Bolsheviks. ""Peace, land, bread,"" right, Bernie? He wants them fed, but there's a problem: the socialist dictator of the place doesn't want them fed, which is why he's blocking aid convoys of massive shipments from the U.S., Brazil, Chile, Canada, and many other countries' shipments on his southern and eastern frontiers, ordering Venezuelan troops to enforce its non-entry. Sanders conveniently leaves out the sorry socialist detail that brings up the uncomfortable fact that socialism has always used food — and starvation — as a weapon to ensure socialist power. No acknowledgment of that one from Bernie. He also leaves out the uncomfortable fact that President Guaidó has asked for it from nations abroad. Sanders seems to want them fed but refuses to admit why they're not being fed.

Then we get to the worst of his drivel, which, by the way, is boilerplate repetition from one of his last strings of tweets three weeks earlier — the guy doesn't come up with many new ideas. Sanders argues that the real danger in Venezuela is U.S. intervention, not starving people. If someone has to starve so the U.S. doesn't intervene, he's obviously all in, because Trump's brandished weapon, aid, can't be allowed in if a socialist government says ""no."" His argument that the U.S. must not be overthrowing governments, which he seems to think is the problem here, not socialism itself, is incredibly insulting to the millions and millions of Venezuelans marching and protesting to take back their democracy. President Trump so far has only offered food as President Guaidó asked, and here Bernie is, yelling about U.S. intervention, same as Maduro.

Sanders's inability to explain himself on socialism, as well as his effort to thwart Trump and discredit the U.S. as the ""real"" problem in that hellhole, is nothing but a bid to deflect the question on socialism. It's dishonest, and it suggests that Bernie has a problem, promoting socialism for the U.S. at a time when socialism's result is there for all to see in the nightmare of Venezuela. One can only wonder why he's running at such a time. Some have speculated that he's running because he wants to draw in more money for goodies for himself. His inability to issue any robust defense of his socialism, his past support for Venezuela's socialist regime, or the will of the Venezuelan people pretty much supports that theory. He's in it for the dough.

“Natural born citizens are naturally citizens because they have only ONE nationality and cannot possibly be anything else.” Not exactly. It is REAL easy to understand. A “natural born citizen” means... Born in the country by TWO citizen parentS. Article II, Section 1, Clause 5: No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States. Article XII (the last sentence) “But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.” SIMPLE.

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the TC PipeLines, LP 2018 Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Rhonda Amundson. Please go ahead, Ms. Amundson.

Rhonda Amundson -- Investor Relations

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to TC PipeLines' fourth quarter 2018 conference call. I'm joined today by our President, Nathan Brown; our VP and General Manager, Janine Watson; and our Treasurer and Principal Financial Officer, Chuck Morris. Please note that a slide presentation will accompany their remarks and is available on our website at tcpipelineslp.com, where it can be found in the Investor Section under the heading Events and Presentations.

Nathan will begin today with a review of TC PipeLines' 2018 fourth quarter and annual highlights and results. Janine will provide an update on the Partnership's assets and the market environment, following which Chuck will provide a more detailed review of our financial results for the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2018. Nathan will return and wrap up our remarks with a brief discussion of our growth strategies and close with some key takeaways. Following the prepared remarks, I will ask the conference operator to coordinate your questions.

Before we begin, I would like to remind you that certain statements made during this conference call will be forward-looking regarding future events and our future financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to various risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as discussed in detail in our 2018 10-K, as well as our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

Please also note that we use the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per common unit, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and distributable cash flow during our presentation. Adjusted earnings are used to provide a more comparable earnings measure from quarter-to-quarter and exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items. EBITDA is an approximate measure of our operating cash flow during the period and reconciles directly to net income and distributable cash flow is presented to provide a measure of cash generated during the period to evaluate our cash distribution capability. These measures are provided as a supplement to GAAP financial results and we provide a reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures in our SEC filings.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nathan.

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Thanks, Rhonda. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Looking at Slide 4, I'm pleased to report that TC PipeLines has had another good quarter and solid annual results. Although, we reported a net loss of $413 million for the fourth quarter and $182 million for the year, after excluding the impact of the non-cash impairment charges for Bison and Tuscarora and provides one-time contract buyout proceeds, we generated adjusted earnings of $86 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 and $317 million on an annual basis. These represented 30% and 26% increases in our fourth quarter and annual adjusted earnings, respectively, versus the same periods in 2017.

These strong results reflect the high level of contracting across our portfolio, together with increased natural gas flows mainly out of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Similarly, our adjusted EBITDA was $140 million for the fourth quarter and $526 million for the full year in 2018, again, an 18% higher than the same periods in 2017. We generated $95 million in distributable cash flow in the fourth quarter 2018, 32% higher than during the same period of 2017. And on an annual basis, our distributable cash flow of $391 million was 26% higher year-over-year.

We paid out $47 million in distributions to our unitholders during the fourth quarter and $218 million in the full year of 2018. The Partnership also declared its fourth quarter distribution of $0.65 per common unit, consistent with the distribution paid for each of the first three quarters of 2018. Chuck will discuss our financial results in more detail a little later in the call. We also continued to progress a number of commercial activities during the fourth quarter. We are pleased to announce the progress on a new PNGTS expansion project last week, the Westbrook XPress project. This is another organic expansion opportunity in response to demand for incremental Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin natural gas supplies in the Northeast US and Atlantic Canada markets. And Phase 1 of our Portland XPress project became operational on November 1, 2018.

These two projects, Westbrook XPress and Portland XPress, will increase PNGTS capacity by approximately 70% from 210,000 dekatherms a day to approximately 350,000 dekatherms by 2021. Janine will discuss these commercial developments in more detail in a minute or two. During the fourth quarter of 2018, in response to the FERC actions earlier in the year, we finalized regulatory approaches on all of our assets and obtained FERC approvals where applicable.

Following the elimination of the tax allowance and the accumulated deferred income tax liability from rate base, recent rate settlements and related filings on all our pipelines, the estimated impact of tax related changes to our revenue and cash flow is a reduction of approximately $30 million per year on an annualized basis beginning in 2019. We believe our pipeline systems which are largely backed by long-term take-or-pay contracts will deliver consistent financial performance going forward and support our current quarterly distribution level of $0.65 per common unit for the foreseeable future.

With our cash savings related to our reduced distributions, we've repaid a portion of our indebtedness such that our leverage is now approximately 3.1 times. And our distribution coverage is very healthy at approximately 2.1 times for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. This positive performance was achieved despite a challenging year on the regulatory front and in the broader MLP space. As a result of these solid results, together with our prudent financial actions, we are entering 2019 with a healthy balance sheet, strong distribution coverage, and a reset regulatory position.

I'll now turn the call over to Janine Watson, our VP and General Manager to provide additional color on our assets in these commercial developments, together with our market outlook.

Janine Watson -- Vice President and General Manager

Thanks, Nathan, and good morning, everyone. First of all, I am pleased to note that all of our assets operated safely and reliably throughout 2018 and that due to the excellent efforts of our teams out in the field, none of our pipelines experienced a major outage or restriction to firm capacity during the polar vortex weather events that recently blanketed most of our geographic footprint.

Now moving to Slide 5, I will drill a bit further into the strong operating performance of TCP's assets in 2018. Long-term contracts continue to be the cornerstone of TCP's solid commercial fundamental, underpinning 87% of our 2018 distributable cash flow. In the West, demand is strong for transportation service on our GTN pipeline, serving the needs of -- in California and the Pacific Northwest. GTN held successful open seasons for the long-term capacity scheduled to come available over the next two years and we are effectively sold out of firm capacity in and after 2020.

North Baja outpaced its usual steady performance, selling incremental short-term services in response to increased demand for southbound transportation in 2018 and this has been the case for the past few years. Northern Border continues to experience strong demand for its capacity, operating at very high levels of throughput. Bakken (inaudible) climbed as high as 1.3 to 1.4 Bcf per day and now account for more than half of the daily receipts on this line.

Northern Border generally renews its contract for terms of five years and is now substantially contracted through to the end of 2020. Great Lakes benefited from increased levels of throughput in 2018 as well, due in part to its long-term transportation contract with TransCanada for 711,000 dekatherms per day that took effect on November 1, 2017. This asset's financials results were also enhanced by the elimination of a revenue sharing mechanism that it formally had in place with its shippers prior to its 2017 rate settlement that took effect in Q1 of 2018. In addition, Great Lakes sold substantially all of its available firm winter capacity for 2018, demonstrating the favorable shift in market dynamics for this asset over the past two years.

PNGTS benefited from a full-year revenue from its Continent-to-Coast contract and placed Phase 1 of its Portland XPress project into service on November 1. This pipeline also successfully marketed short term and interruptible transportation as various market opportunities arose throughout the year. And as we've previously press released for Bison, two of its four customers bought-out their firm transportation contracts at the end of 2018. This buyout of 60% of Bison's revenue stream was used to decrease TCP's leverage.

We remain committed to Bison, but recognize that this asset likely needs to be reconfigured to find a new role in the US energy transportation market. We are exploring two development opportunities for this pipeline. First, we are examining a potential gas reversal project that would make Bison bidirectional and connect the Bakken's gas production to third-party pipeline systems in the Rockies that link into the Cheyenne Supply Hub. And second, we are looking at the option of converting the Bison pipeline into liquids service.

Now, turning to our regulatory update, our commercial and regulatory teams worked throughout the last three quarters to develop customer outreach and regulatory actions for each of our individual pipeline and implemented these strategies in the fourth quarter. These initiatives appear to have been well received by our customers and our regulator. And we believe that, but for the finalization and filing of our settlements on Tuscarora and Iroquois, we are finished with the 501-G process. Now, for your convenience, we have detailed each of our asset's 501-G elections and outcomes in a chart in our press release and in the recent developments in our business section of our 10-K filing. We estimate that the impact of these tax related changes on our revenue and cash flow will be a decrease of about $30 million per year starting in 2019. Of the total impact, about two-thirds is attributable to GTN.

Turning to Slide 6, production of natural gas continues to grow in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Receipts onto TransCanada's NGTL system went up again in 2018, increasing by almost 1 Bcf to approximately 12.3 Bcf per day. This system is the upstream source of gas for our Western and Midwestern pipelines and about 40% of this supply is making its way to markets via our system. Thus, we are experiencing robust demand for our services, as is evidenced by strong contracting for increasing term.

TransCanada's Canadian Mainline deliveries have also increased year-over-year due to initiatives like its long-term fixed-price offering which benefited Great Lakes starting in 2017. Now, we expect this trend will continue going forward as the Mainline's recent North Bay Junction LTFP offering creates the upstream capacity for Portland's recently announced Westbrook XPress project. Westbrook XPress is a multi-phase expansion project designed to help serve markets in Northern New England and Atlantic Canada that have (ph) until recently and served by offshore gas production from Sable Island and Deep Panuke.

Still subject to various conditions precedent and approval, the Westbrook XPress project is backed by long-term fixed-price contracts with fixed shippers for terms of 15 years or more. Phase 1 of this project is to be supported by pressure agreements with our upstream affiliated pipelines, allowing Portland to bring an initial 43,000 dekatherms per day into service in November of this year, without the need for any construction.

Phase 2 requires the addition of a compressor and associated facilities at an existing station and at an estimated cost of $100 million, and will bring a further 60,000 dekatherms of firm capacity on to this system. These new facilities are intended to be in service by November 1, 2021 and will be funded using debt at the asset level. While this project is fully in service, we expect this project will generate at least 30 million in revenue for Portland on an annual basis. We are also progressing our Portland XPress project and put the first phase into service on November 1. Phases 2 and 3 of this project are well under way and are projected to be on time and on budget and fully in service by November of 2020.

Now, looking forward, TC PipeLines could continue to benefit from the continued growth in the WCSB as well as the Bakken. Because of the highly contracted nature of our pipeline assets, together with their generally strong market position, we expect they will continue to perform in a predictable manner after taking into the impact of the 2018 FERC actions into account, and thereby will produce steady results. Now, we do expect elevated levels of maintenance spending going forward due to the continued strong gas flows on our pipelines and we estimate our share of maintenance spend may be in the $97 million range this year. It should be noted that this spending does contribute to our rate base and future rate making proceeding.

Organic growth projects will be a management priority for the upcoming year as we continue to assess what other opportunities may arise to further take advantage of TCP's existing pipeline network. Great Lakes, for example, has about 1 Bcf of available capacity that we are working to market long-term on a stand-alone basis or as a combined offering with other of TransCanada's pipeline. GTN will ramp up to its full firm capacity of about 2.9 Bcf per day by 2020, as NGTL continues its upstream debottlenecking activity. Should NGTL secure shippers support to increase its West Gate export capability beyond this level in subsequent years, we have identified up to a further 0.5 Bcf of expandability on GTN. And North Baja's situation continues to be interesting, as LNG export facilities in the area continue to be developed. We are actively exploring ways that our Northern Border and Bison assets could help provide incremental takeaway capacity for producers in the Bakken.

I will now turn the call over to Chuck Morris, our Treasurer and Principal Financial Officer to discuss our fourth quarter financial results in more detail.

William Morris -- Vice President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer

Thanks, Janine, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to Slide 7, I'll now review the Partnership's fourth quarter and full year 2018 results. The Partnership recorded a net loss attributable to controlling interests in the fourth quarter of $413 million. The net loss was a result of the recognition of non-cash impairment charges of $537 million on our Bison Pipeline and $59 million on Tuscarora during the quarter, partially offset by our solid results and the $97 million cash payment by two of Bison's customers to buyout and terminate their transportation contracts.

The impairment charges are non-cash items and do not impact the Partnership's distributable cash flow. Our adjusted earnings exclude the impact of these non-cash charges as well as the one-time Bison cash payment to allow for better comparison to previous quarters. Adjusted earnings increased to $86 million for the fourth quarter from $66 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily as a result of higher revenues on GTN and PNGTS and higher equity earnings from Great Lakes during the period. We saw a similar uplift in our adjusted EBITDA year-over-year to $140 million in Q4 of 2018 from $117 million in the same quarter of 2017.

On an annual basis, we reported a net loss in 2018 of $182 million which after adjusting for non-cash and one-time items resulted in an adjusted earnings of $317 million, 26% higher than the $252 million reported in 2017, reflective of the strong revenues across our systems as well as higher equity earnings. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $526 million in 2018, up from $445 million in 2017. The Partnership paid distributions of $47 million in the fourth quarter. The $27 million decrease over Q4 2017 was primarily due to the decrease in the quarterly distribution of $0.35 per common unit paid beginning in Q1 of 2018 in response to the 2018 FERC actions.

On an annual basis, the Partnership paid $218 million in distributions in 2018, compared to $284 million in 2017 with the difference again due to the same factors that impacted the quarter. As a result of the common unit distribution reduction noted above, the Partnership did not pay any IDRs to our General Partner on distributions declared from the first to the fourth quarter of 2018. We also paid $15 million to the Class B units in 2018 related to GTN's performance in 2017. In 2018, the 30% portion of GTN associated with the Class B units generated $40 million, $20 million above the threshold level which would normally be allocated to the Class B units. However, as a result of the 35% reduction in the common unit distribution, the allocation to the Class B units is similarly reduced, resulting in a $13 million allocation to the Class B units for 2018. This amount was paid to the Class B units in February of 2019.

Distributable cash flow was $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, $23 million higher than the corresponding quarter in 2017. The increase was due to the same factors that impacted adjusted earnings together with reduced distributions allocated to our General Partner as a result of the lower declared common unit distributions. For the year ended December 31, distributable cash flow amounted to $391 million, $81 million higher than the DCF of $310 million in 2017.

Turning to Slide 8, revenues from our consolidated pipelines in Q4 of 2018 were $111 million higher than the same quarter of 2017, $97 million of which was a result of the Bison cash proceeds from the termination of the two of its four transportation contracts. The payment was recorded as revenues as the contract terminations released Bison from providing any future services. Excluding the $97 million revenue proceeds from Bison's contract buyout, our revenues increased $14 million, largely due to the net effect of higher revenue from PNGTS from its Continent-to-Coast contracts and the Portland XPress Phase 1 contracts that began in November of 2018 and Higher net revenue from GTN from incremental long-term contracts associated with the increased available upstream capacity, partially offset by lower revenues from its short-term discretionary services compared to the prior period.

Equity earnings in the fourth quarter of 2018 were $7 million higher than the same quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher income at Great Lakes as a result of the elimination of Great Lakes's revenue sharing mechanism in 2018 as part of its 2017 settlement. Additionally, Great Lakes experienced an increase in seasonal sales during the current period. As noted earlier, the Partnership recorded a non-cash asset impairment charge of $537 million for Bison. The Q4 contract buyout coupled with the persistence of market conditions which have inhibited system flows on the pipeline and the uncertainty regarding Bison's ability to generate positive cash flows after the expiry of its remaining customer contracts in January of 2021, led us to determine that the asset's current carrying value was no longer indicative of an estimatable fair value. As a result, the non-cash impairment charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018.

We continue to explore alternative transportation-related options for Bison. Additionally, in connection with Tuscarora's annual goodwill impairment analysis, we evaluated Tuscarora's future revenues as well as changes to the other valuation assumptions, including Tuscarora's regulatory outcomes. As a result, it was determined that the fair value of Tuscarora was lower than its carrying value, including goodwill. In that regard, the Partnership recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $59 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and reduced our total consolidated goodwill balance from $130 million to $71 million.

Operating, maintenance, and administrative expenses during the fourth quarter were $1 million lower than in the same quarter in 2017 and our depreciation was comparable. Financial charges were also comparable in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus the same period in 2017. On an annual basis, the significant increase in equity earnings was largely the result of the addition of distributions of Iroquois for a full 12 months in 2018, as compared to only a seven-month period in 2017.

Moving now on to our financial position on Slide 9, our investment grade credit ratings provide us with the financial flexibility as we look to organically grow the portfolio in the future. We believe our ratings reflect our solid financial condition and outlook. The Partnership's liquidity position remains strong. The Partnership has $475 million of undrawn and available borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility as of February 21, 2018.

Consistent with our self-funding model, in order to build capacity for future organic growth, we continue to execute on our deleveraging program. In that regard, we used the cash savings from our reduced distributions and the funds from the Bison buyout to repay indebtedness, including the repayment of our $170 million term loan, resulting in a bank leverage ratio of approximately 3.1 times at December 31, 2018 and our distribution coverage remains healthy at 2.1 times for the fourth quarter of 2018, reflecting the positive operating performance of our assets during the period.

That concludes my remarks on the fourth quarter financial results. I'll now turn the call back over to Nathan.

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Thanks, Chuck. I'll now turn over to Slide 10. This has been a very good quarter for our Partnership. We made lots of progress on the regulatory front and returned our focus to other parts of the business. Our assets are performing very well and we remain confident that they are well situated to benefit from solid underlying market fundamentals and will continue to generate value for our unitholders well into the future. We have continued our proactive approach to managing our financial position over the past few months and are happy to report that our leverage ratio is now just over 3 times and our distribution coverage ratio is likewise healthy.

As we move into 2019, the annual regulatory impact to our revenue and cash flow of approximately $30 million negative will take effect. That, along with the loss of revenue from the Bison contracts bought-out in December will impact both our leverage and distribution coverage ratios. As such, going forward, we are targeting to maintain our leverage ratio in the low 4 times range and our distribution coverage in the 1.5 times area.

With this solid financial position, we reiterate that we have no plans to access the equity capital markets to fund our current growth program. Our focus remains on the optimization of our asset portfolio and we are working to secure the next wave of growth opportunities on our assets. These include organic growth projects on PNGTS such as our current Portland XPress and Westbrook XPress projects, as well as other potential future opportunities. All of these will be progressed in a very disciplined manner with near-term opportunity to size and sequence so that we are in a position to be self funding. We have a history of prudently managing our Partnership and are confident that our portfolio of crucial energy infrastructure assets will continue to generate solid financial results with opportunities for organic growth in high-quality, low-risk, value-creating projects for our unitholders.

I'll now turn the call back to Rhonda.

Rhonda Amundson -- Investor Relations

Thanks, Nathan. I'd now like to open the call up for questions. Sophie, please go ahead.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instruction) Our first question is from Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Please go ahead.

Shneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst

Hi, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to start off with Bison options you are exploring. You talked about potentially (technical difficulty) bidirectional gas option to get (technical difficulty) crude option. Can you expand on what you're looking at, how long it will take to a direction (technical difficulty) and so forth?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Thanks for the question, Shneur. It's Nathan. It's early days on any of those options, so we're not going to be leading with any specifics. I'd say it's part of the accounting decision that we made to write off the carrying value of the assets at Bison where in part because we can't really estimate what that's going to look like at this time. So, in specific, I'll say not much, but there's obviously a need for gas to exit the Bakken and so our reversal path is definitely an option. And as far as there's a liquid need or a need for transportation of liquids, we're looking for that option as well. So, apologies, I don't have any more specifics at this time.

If I was to look for signposts, would I be looking for an open season or would you (technical difficulty)

Sorry, your question broke up a little bit there. I lost you after signposts.

Shneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst

Yeah. In terms of signposts to look, would we be looking toward you announcing an open season to understand which direction you're going or would you give us different color (technical difficulty)

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

I think I caught a little bit more of your question, but I'd say we will announce things when and if we get commercial terms more solid.

Shneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst

Okay. And a final question. In the crude concept that you're thinking about, I mean, what size -- what kind of capacity would be involved if you were to actually (technical difficulty) Are we talking something very small or are we talking something very sizable?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Again, in any kind of liquid solution, it's early days in discussions with players in the region, but not anything else that we'd be disclosing right now.

Shneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst

Great. All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate the color, guys.

Operator

Thank you. The next question is from TJ Schultz from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

TJ Schultz -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Hey, good morning. Just first on Westbrook XPress. What part of the cash flow is phased in in 2019 and then in Phase 2? And then you point to some approvals that are required there. Just any color on what you need to do to meet the right approvals?

Rhonda Amundson -- Investor Relations

Yeah. Both phases have the same rate attached to them, so it's pretty much 40% in Phase 1, 60% roughly in Phase 2. There will be -- necessary approvals will include obviously regulatory approvals from FERC both to import the gas to increase our firm certificated capacity and as well as to build the facilities that are planned for Westbrook. So we did file a FERC application for Phase 1 in December actually and that's going ahead. And we would anticipate that we'd be filing the facilities -- for the facilities construction toward the end of Q2 at this point. As well, of course, the shippers have various customary approvals that they will require, board approval in some cases, that sort of thing.

TJ Schultz -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay, thanks. And then on GTN, some of the, I think, expansion is subject to the West Gate export capabilities and I think you mentioned 0.5 Bcf, just any more color on timing to be able to make that decision and what costs should be or what needs to be done for that level of expansions?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Yeah. You pointed out the good constraint there. So it obviously has to be a package solution with added capacity out of the WCSB to then coordinate down GTN. I'd say our approach is a fairly new product in our design of what GTN is capable of doing, but that's going to have to go hand in glove with everything else upstream. So as that would come together, we'd be able to announce more, but it's again early days and it's highlighting the capability there.

TJ Schultz -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay, understood. Janine, I think you mentioned some benefits from some short-term services on some of your assets, I think, specifically to North Baja and PNGTS. What's the expectation there for some of those benefits to kind of continue into '19?

Janine Watson -- Vice President and General Manager

Well, I think that on North Baja the gas dynamic down there is shifting a little bit, but certainly 2018 was an unusual year for flowing gas into Southern California. So a lot of that gas was actually coming around and turning back up, flowing back into the US. That likely won't continue to the same level, but as the LNG process starts to firm up perhaps we will see further contracting in anticipation of that, as well as potentially some ability to expand the capacity of that line.

TJ Schultz -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay, understood. Go ahead.

Janine Watson -- Vice President and General Manager

Sorry, I was just reminded, you also asked about PNGTS. PNGTS has -- there is market opportunities that present themselves at various points, sometimes it's pretty seasonal and it's pretty weather driven. But it will continue to have some fair bit of interruptible capacity over the next few years, so depending on the market opportunities, if they are there, our marketing team is certainly poised to take advantage of them.

TJ Schultz -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay, great. Just last one. The bank leverage ratio at 3.1 times, can you just give me the bank debt and EBITDA that are used to calculate that?

William Morris -- Vice President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer

It's Chuck here. So, I'd have to get the details for you on that. Just hang on a sec. So certainly the bank leverage ratio is a little bit different than, I guess, the financial statement ratio just by virtue of the fact that there is some add backs associated with property tax. So, I guess, our leverage is sitting somewhere around the $2.0 billion range. And I'm just trying to find the EBITDA number for you. I might have to flip for that and get back to you.

TJ Schultz -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Then fine, I can follow up offline. Thanks, everyone.

Operator

Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Taylor from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.

Matthew Taylor -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt -- Analyst

Hey, everyone. Just one on capital allocation. So with regulatory decisions in hand now and more growth in the outer years, but with '19 cash flow expected to be a bit lower, when do you start thinking about restarting distribution growth or further delevering? Just want to know the dynamics there that you guys are thinking about.

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Yes. So we are definitely considering that and evaluating that continuously. I'd say, we look for prudent management out the curve of what we see on longer term run rates and certainly want to retain the capacity to fund these organic growth projects in real self funding manner. So we're balancing all of those going forward. I would say, as we've got more specific line of sight into cash flow spend on the near-term growth prospects we have in front of us as well as maybe a little bit finer point on other things out the curve within our pipeline assets portfolio, we will be firming that up and making that revaluation, but at this time we're fairly comfortable that the distribution ratio we've got, the distribution level we've got is sustainable for the foreseeable future.

Matthew Taylor -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt -- Analyst

Great. That's helpful context. Then just moving on to the FERC positions you've taken, I understand the 501-G filings use '17 numbers. So in some cases like Great Lakes where the LTFP wouldn't -- have been fully included, how are you guys thinking about potential for Section 5 there or longer term risks there or at least how should I be thinking about it?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Well, I think that the regular regulatory risk that you mentioned there is more back to status quo ante, if you will. So we're back to business as usual in managing that with our regulator and our customers as a normal course of thing. So to the extent we've got Section 5 risk, we always make all our efforts to mitigate those and be proactive as we go. But as that's a normal business risk that we've got, we certainly have -- our team is focused on it to go forward with the best possible result on the other side.

Matthew Taylor -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt -- Analyst

Yes, and to be fair, the $30 million then would just be on the filing positions taken to-date, correct?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Yes, it's correct based on where we are coming out at the other side of this 501-G process and as mentioned, what we'll be doing is, setting up going forward with what we really do think is a more positive position all else being equal, given there are some of the moratoriums that we have been able to negotiate and extend as we go through this process. So as part of the overall strategy, we ended up at the higher end of the range that we disclosed last quarter and part of that is a good value play that we see.

Matthew Taylor -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt -- Analyst

Yeah, that's great. And then maybe just one final one there on the $30 million impact. I would assume that would include equity earnings revisions, correct, for Northern Border and Great Lakes and actual EBITDA impact wouldn't be a bit larger?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Yes, that's correct. So that's all an impact for our share.

Matthew Taylor -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt -- Analyst

Thanks. That's it for me.

Operator

Thank you. The next question is from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Yes, hey, guys, congrats on a good quarter. Two questions for you. First of all, how should investors think about what the maximum expansion potential is for the PNGTS? I'm just trying to think about how much more incremental additions you could possibly bolt on over the next four or five years on to that system?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

I don't think we've disclosed any sort of engineering maximums that we'd put out there, but there is possibility for expansion. As PNGTS sits right now configured, it doesn't have any midpoint compression of its own. It runs off of compression that it receives north of the border and then on shared facilities at Westbrook which we're enhancing now. But along the line, there is expandability through additional compression. And in terms of absolute volumes, I wouldn't be able to give you a number.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it. And also what happens now -- just when you're thinking about Baja and the potential for LNG, what are the kind of the milestones or what are the things investors should keep their eyes on just to kind of get a view of whether this is real? I mean, is this all related to just one specific project? Are you thinking about others in the hopper?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

At this point, we're looking at more generally. As we saw here this past year, when there is disruption in the normal flow of gas in Southern California, North Baja came through and was able to fill some need down there. So as that region and that geography develops and what it's going to be doing with gas flows, we think there's an opportunity for North Baja to step in with the right of way in some fairly cheap expandability through additional compression. It's there ready to serve at a certain volume level pretty straight away and from there, we obviously have our business development minds working on a larger solution as well.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The next question is from Alex Kania from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.

Alex Kania -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Hi, good morning. Just I guess two questions. First is on the maintenance CapEx number of, I think, $97 million for 2019. Do you see that as a number that persists going forward or is that just a near-term one-time type of number where sustainably may fall back toward where it was more in 2018?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Well, unfortunately I don't want to give too much guidance on that one. Depending on what we've got on throughput on our systems that can -- that level can be higher. I wouldn't say it would be any persistent at a particular level. We've got some of our major spend particularly with compressor overhauls that are very cyclical. So those can tend to come in waves just depending on how the hours come out on our units. So that's something that's a component we may see more or less of in any one given year. We also look at what requirements we have and programs we'd put in place for pipeline integrity. It's another driver of those dollars that we spend. And those come and go as we work through those program cyclically. So unfortunately I wouldn't be able to say that's a given run rate or peg a run rate going forward, but we will continue to keep update on activities as it become material.

Alex Kania -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Great. Thanks.

""Softwood lumber wasn't something that was being discussed a lot,"" Higgs told reporters when he landed at the Fredericton airport on Monday after three days in the U.S. capital.

The winter meeting of the governors takes place with hundreds of guests, including leaders from business, non-profits and governments around the world.

Before Higgs left for the meeting, he said he would be willing to give way on the province's forestry policy to help ease some of the punishing tariffs on softwood lumber coming from New Brunswick.

New Brunswick was the only Atlantic province not exempt from softwood lumber tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

Support closer to home

While softwood lumber tariffs were not high on the radar of most people at the Washington meeting, the New England governors were more receptive to the province's plight, Higgs said.

He singled out Janet Mills, the Democratic governor of Maine, who assumed office after last year's mid-term elections.

""She recognizes the sensitivities on both sides of the border,"" said Higgs.

This is what else Premier Blaine Higgs had to say to reporters after his return from Washington on Monday. 0:59

He said the lumber industry in Maine and New Brunswick are heavily integrated and there's a lot of trade between them.

""We as Atlantic Canada, and the eastern U.S., you know kind of always had a market and a business here that needs to be protected.""

National focus needed

Higgs said he felt the issue has now been raised but he wished Canadians at the Washington meetings had come up with a more national focus for the issue.

""I think B.C. has the large portion of the business, and so it's getting more of a focus and we're being drug into it,"" said Higgs.

In Washington, Higgs planned to meet with David Wilkins, a former U.S. ambassador to Canada and now a lobbyist being paid $40,000 a month by the province to lobby the Trump administration on softwood lumber tariffs.

Higgs said he would decide after meeting with Wilkins whether the province would keep him on, but after returning didn't commit to Wilkins one way or the other.

""[Wilkins] was very helpful, he gave me good information,"" Higgs said.

""He offered obviously to continue his assistance in that regard. I said 'We'll talk more about that.'""",Higgs's softwood lumber pitch falls on indifferent ears in U.S.,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/higgs-returns-from-washington-1.5032579

The widespread hunger, sky-high inflation, rampant crime, and acute shortages that have hit the country hard over the past three years have started to poke holes in many Venezuelans’ once unbreakable faith in the government.","Valeria Palacio lives in a space dominated by former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. Her run-down apartment has a Chávez portrait painted on the living room wall and a little statue of the late socialist leader placed on a shrinelike coffee table, surrounded by his books and even a replica of his iconic red beret.

But there is no sign of the current president, Nicolás Maduro, Mr. Chávez’s handpicked successor. “Venezuela is broken. Maduro has done poorly,” says Ms. Palacio, who works as a supermarket vendor.

The widespread hunger, sky-high inflation, rampant crime, and acute shortages that have hit the country hard over the past three years have started to poke holes in many Venezuelans’ once unbreakable faith in the government. Maduro was supposed to be a “steward” safeguarding Chávez’s revolution, but instead, Palacio says, he’s “destroying” it.

Recommended: Can Canada lead on Latin America? Venezuela poses a test.

Yet she still supports him.

The former leader pulled millions of Venezuelans out of poverty and delivered government programs to some of the most ignored portions of the population, thanks to soaring oil prices. Palacio says she can’t let go of her hope that his revolutionary model will once again flourish. “If the revolution [ceases to exist] I would lose my soul,” she says. “This is about the Chavista way of life.”

Palacio isn’t alone in her struggle to square her passionate support for Chávez’s “21st Century Socialism” with a crumbling economy and bland but iron-fisted leader.

On Jan. 23, National Assembly leader Juan Guaidó declared that Maduro’s most recent election was invalid, making Mr. Guaidó himself the nation’s interim president until a fresh vote can be held. Since then, the newly invigorated opposition has gained momentum, posing the biggest challenge so far to Maduro’s increasingly authoritarian government. Amid the visible growth in suffering across Venezuela, with an estimated 3 million fleeing over the past three years, some Chavistas – as supporters of Chávez’s political project are known – are starting to question some of their political beliefs and who represents them.

It’s a key moment of reckoning for Venezuela. Support for Maduro has dipped under 20 percent, according to Caracas-based pollster Datanálisis, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that the majority of Chavistas back the opposition. If Chavistas renounce Maduro, the opposition’s chances of taking the nation in a new direction increase. But to win them over, the opposition has to appeal to those like Palacio: Venezuelans who still venerate Chávez and his plans for the revolution despite the disappointments of his successor.

“Maduro and Chavismo are two different things. Maduro’s approval rating has been around 20 percent for the last three years while the popularity of Chávez and his revolutionary legacy have been slightly over 50 percent steadily,” says Luis Vicente León, a political analyst and director of Datanálisis.

‘LOYAL ALWAYS’

Guaidó is starting to make inroads among Maduro fans and Chavistas alike. He’s also appealed to constituents who say they didn’t feel a connection to any existing leadership option – in the opposition or otherwise.

“Guaidó has now a majority of Venezuelans behind him, roughly over 50 percent,” says Mr. León.

However, Chavistas still fill up the streets of Venezuelan towns in their signature red shirts, proclaiming steadfast support for the Maduro government. People of all ages gather at rallies alongside a striking presence of uniformed soldiers. Supporters dance, sing, and call out in unison slogans like “Loyal always, traitors never!”

Pro-government demonstrators keep showing up for different reasons. Some say they support Maduro purely out of pragmatism: Despite acute shortages of basic food and medical products, the government still gives supporters handouts. Some 5.7 million people still receive food subsidies, according to government figures, and others have free housing or modest financial support. That could all disappear if Maduro falls.

“The government is the people. They care about us. The opposition is only interested in power and money,” says a Chavista who introduced himself by a pseudonym, Armandio, at a recent rally in downtown Caracas.","In Venezuela, support for Maduro is about more than the man in charge",Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/venezuela-support-maduro-more-man-charge-131800395.html

Vice presi…","The US has announced new sanctions on Caracas and insisted that all options were on the table to oust Nicolas Maduro, as a Republican senator tweeted images showing the death throes of Muammar Gaddafi in an apparent threat to the Venezuelan leader.

Vice president Mike Pence said four Venezuelan state governors allied to Mr Maduro were the target of the new sanctions, while he urged the international community to freeze assets of the nation's state-run oil company. The US also asked the United Nations Security Council to hold an urgent meeting on the crisis.

“I want to assure you, President Guaidó, that the tragic events of the past weekend have only steeled the resolve of the United States of America,” Mr Pence said at a meeting of the Lima Group in Colombia.

The meeting was attended by opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself Venezuela's president.

According to the Associated Press, Mr Pence added. “We are with you 100 per cent.”

Also in Colombia at the weekend, where he visited efforts to transport US aid across the border into Venezuela – an effort that resulted in violence and several deaths – was Republican senator Marco Rubio, who has been highly influential on Donald Trump’s Latin American policy and whom the New York Times has termed the “ouster in chief”.

On Sunday, he tweeted several messages attacking Mr Maduro’s government before then posting three images of ousted dictators – Libya’s Gaddafi, Panama’s Manuel Noriega and Romania’s Nicolae Ceausescu. The gruesome, blood-laced image of the Libyan leader was taken as he was bayoneted to death by rebels in the city of Sirte in October 2011. Nato had earlier engaged in a devastating bombing campaign against Gadafi's forces.

Mr Rubio’s tweet of the image contained no text, but quickly sparked outcry on social media. A number of commentators said he was tweeting the equivalent of stills from a “snuff movie”.

In Colombia at the meeting of nations from the Americas, Mr Pence spoke with Mr Guaido, who Washington had encouraged to declare himself the country’s “legitimate” president and who it quickly regonised as such after he did so. The UK, Canada and up to 50 other nations quickly followed, while China, Russia and Mexico still recognise Mr Maduo.

Mr Pence accused Mr Maduro’s forces of burning several trucks containing medical supplies over the weekend as the opposition tried to deliver US aid, even though it was unclear how they were set alight.

“As the world watched, the tyrant in Caracas danced as his henchmen murdered civilians and burned truckloads of food and medicine destined for the people of Venezuela,” Mr Pence claimed. “These men worked to block aid for people in need and suppress peaceful protests – and their actions will not go unpunished.

“In the days ahead, the US will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks. We will find every last dollar they have stolen and return that money to the Venezuelan people.

“As we continue to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the Maduro regime, we hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But others - including several European nations - voiced caution. Hamilton Mourão, vice president of Brazil, one of the nations that has recegnised Mr Guaido, said under no circumstances would his country allow the US to intervene militarily in Venezuela from Brazilian territory.





Mr Maduro has denied claims that he is refusing to accept aid. Indeed, the UN has stepped up distribution of humanitarian supplies in the country. His supporters point out the US has previously used shipments of aid in Latin America to smuggle weapons to rebels. Three decades ago, Elliott Abrams, currently Mr Trump’s point person on Venezuela, oversaw such an operation against the democratically elected government of Nicaragua.

Mr Maduro on Monday tweeted that the “empire and its lackey” must understand that in “Venezuela the self-determination of our people reigns. We will solve the problems in a national union, with the Bolivarian government that I preside over. Together for Venezuela!”.

Meanwhile, the US asked the UN Security Council to discuss the Venezuela situation on Tuesday. Reuters said Washington wanted the 15-member council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections in Venezuela with international observers, a move that prompted Russia to propose a rival draft resolution.",US announces new Venezuela sanctions as Rubio shares 'snuff movie' pictures of Colonel Gaddafi in threat to Maduro,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/us-announces-venezuela-sanctions-rubio-204529328.html

Assets under custody (AUC) of India’s top 10 FPIs have increased by Rs 23,000 crore to Rs 3 lakh crore so far in the ongoing financial year, data from Prime Database showed.This increase in the assets of top FPIs comes even as offshore investors on the whole have net sold equities worth Rs 48,636 crore since April — the highest outflows ever witnessed by Indian markets in a financial year. All big-ticket FPIs, including Capital Group, Canada Pension Fund, Vanguard and Government of Singapore, have seen a double-digit jump in their assets, the data showed. The benchmark Nifty has given a return of 3 per cent during the period.These FPIs are long-term investors who are staying put on their current investments despite a downturn in the markets, said experts, adding that they were also exploring value-buying options in some of the beaten-down blue-chip stocks. USbased Capital Group, India’s largest FPI , has seen its assets grow by 17 per cent to Rs 1 lakh crore during the financial year.The value of investments by the Government of Singapore has gone up by 13 per cent to Rs 51,307 crore, while those of Canada Pension Fund and Vanguard expanded by 17 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively.“We are seeing outflows on an overall basis and, at the same time, most of the top 10 FPIs have increased investments — that’s because the latter tend to have a longer-term investment horizon and their source of funds is more sticky,” said Pratik Gupta, managing director and head of Deutsche Equities India.“Many smaller funds are in a wait-and-watch mode. There are two big events to watch out for — the US-China trade talks and the political uncertainty before election in India,” said Gupta.Ayon Mukhopadhyay, director, UK and Europe, at IIFL Institutional Equities, said the developed market to emerging market trade has reversed and flows were coming, but foreign investors were fence-sitting India ahead of elections.According to analysts, India will continue to look attractive compared with other emerging markets if investors manage to ride through the current downturn. Currently, Indian equities are facing several headwinds, including political uncertainty due to the forthcoming general elections and liquidity concerns in corporate bond markets. However, analysts are expecting a sharp rebound in the markets post elections if there is a favourable verdict. On the macroeconomy front, India continues to be on a high-growth trajectory, implying better earnings prospects for companies.Markets have turned volatile in the last six months. The Nifty has dropped close to 10 per cent from its lifetime high in August 2018. The pain is more acute in smaller stocks with the midcap index seeing a 18 per cent fall. FPI favourite stocks such as HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries and Kotak Mahindra Bank have all given flat returns during the fiscal year. “The index is not reflecting the underlying sentiment of the market.

When future historians write the Internet’s history, Spring 2018 will mark the turning point when regulators stopped giving a fuck about the Internet’s potential as a dynamic, open & innovative platform #FOSTA #GDPR #CCPA 😢😢😢 — Eric Goldman (@ericgoldman) June 29, 2018



If you can’t read it:

When future historians write the Internet’s history, Spring 2018 will mark the turning point when regulators stopped giving a fuck about the Internet’s potential as a dynamic, open & innovative platform #FOSTA #GDPR #CCPA 😢😢😢

This broad dynamic in Internet law didn’t make my top 10 list explicitly (though FOSTA, GDPR and CCPA all rank highly), but it’s a sign of 2018’s historical significance.

#10: Politicians blocking constituents on social media. Politicians love the unfiltered broadcast capability of social media, but some of them hate getting unfiltered constituent feedback. So politicians keep blocking their constituents on social media, and courts keep declaring the blocks unconstitutional. If your job is to represent constituents that you don’t actually want to hear from, find a new line of work.

#9: Competitive keyword lawsuits are stupid…and possibly illegal. Each year I want to declare this topic dead, only to find it keeps cropping up again. Perhaps 2018 will drive the final nail in the coffin due to the FTC’s determination that 1-800 Contacts engaged in anti-competitive practices by systematically restricting its competitors’ ability to bid on its trademarks. Lawsuits over competitive keyword advertising have always been a bad business decision. Now, they are also legally ill-advised.

#8: Internet taxes. In the South Dakota v. Wayfair case, the Supreme Court opened up the door to states taxing online sales by non-residents. If Congress doesn’t intervene, expect a taxation tsunami.

#7: Failure of the lawsuits claiming that social media services support terrorism. Social media providers are not liable for the fact that terrorists use their tools. Nine different courts have confirmed that.

#6: EU Copyright Directive. The EU Copyright Directive has had more dramatic twists than a soap opera. You know the cliche: the good-looking but perpetually self-destructive character who consistently makes poor choices that prompts the audience to scream at the screen, “NOOOO…don’t do it!”

It’s a slight overstatement to say that the EU Copyright Directive’s mandatory filter and link tax would be the death of the Internet. More accurately, the directive would likely only cause the death of the European Internet. The mandatory filter requirement would likely eliminate most user-generated content in Europe. In its place, Europe will actualize the dystopian counterfactual vision of the Internet from the 1990s, when many people expected the Internet to replicate the 1990s cable system, with a few large content owners broadcasting paywalled content to passive viewers. The Internet has evolved into something greater than that, but can it stay that way? Has Europe already planted enough regulatory seeds that the European Internet will inevitably devolve in a cable-style collection of a few large walled gardens, even if the EU Copyright Directive is defeated?

#5: USMCA and Internet Immunity. Section 230 has always been an idiosyncratic American thing, a natural extension of our idiosyncratic First Amendment. So it was remarkable that NAFTA 2.0, the USMCA, embraced Section 230 and exported its pro-free speech policy to Mexico and Canada. Though we’re years away (at best) from Canada or Mexico actually doing anything different, it’s a small glimmer of hope that a user-powered Internet might survive a little longer, even if only in the North American region.

#4: GDPR. The passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act implicitly burnished the GDPR’s reputation as a privacy regulation. As bad as the GDPR is—and it’s bad—the GDPR sometimes looks attractive when compared to the even-more-terrible CCPA. But let’s not over-romanticize the GDPR. It is unquestionably an innovation-killer. It raises significant entry barriers and imposes significant ongoing compliance costs. It ossifies the business environment and privileges existing incumbents over stifled start-ups. I expect we’ll see a steady stream of empirical studies confirming that dynamic. The GDPR has also accelerated the splinternet phenomenon, as businesses outside the EU “opt out” of the GPDR by blocking EU-based users, creating geographically divergent Internets–and realities.

#3: FOSTA. FOSTA is heart-breaking policy because it doesn’t appear to benefit anyone. In ways that were entirely predictable—and predicted—to Congress in advance, FOSTA appears to hurt, rather than help, sex trafficking victims and commercial sex workers, and it shrunk the Internet and undermined free speech. A truly sad outcome for everyone.

#2: California Consumer Privacy Act. The CCPA is the first comprehensive privacy law in the US, but it was produced by a terrible process that resulted in a predictably terrible law that will hurt the California economy and much more. It never ceases to amaze me how many California privacy lawyers really hate the law—even though they should be the law’s natural allies because they already survived GDPR compliance, plus the CCPA will benefit them financially. The CCPA won’t be fixed because the legislature doesn’t have the capacity or appetite to give it the necessary attention, and some privacy advocates have embraced the law despite its many flaws. Instead, the only remaining way to “fix” the CCPA is with a preemptive federal law, which shouldn’t give you much optimism given Congress’ dysfunction.

#1: Perceived online service bias against “conservatives.” In a “normal” year, the GDPR, FOSTA, and CCPA all would have been strong contenders for #1 on this list. But they were upstaged this year by an even more pernicious regulatory dynamic. Many conservatives believe that Internet services are “biased” against them, and they are fighting back vigorously on multiple fronts, including the courts, legislatures, and Trump’s Twitter timeline. Lawsuits in this genre include Mezey v. Twitter, Dehen v. Doe, Prager U v. Google, Brittain v. Twitter, and Kimbrell v. Twitter. Legislation in this genre include Arkansas Bill HB1028 and a federal bill from Rep. Gohmert, plus numerous confidence-undermining legislative hearings. The perceptions of anti-conservative bias are usually based on a combination of cherry-picked anecdotes and paranoia, so they are dangerously afactual. Furthermore, the Internet services are routinely asked to make sometimes-fine distinctions between “legitimate” “conservative” views that add to the discourse from “illegitimate” discriminatory hate speech that corrode the entire community and should be squelched. Yet, the pity-me persecution complex has the capacity to destroy the Internet. Internet services are already overreacting by treading more cautiously with respect to content that conservatives might support. It’s also accelerating support for legally requiring “neutrality” or “must carry” obligations, which would take away the Internet services’ ability to manage the crazies and thereby destroy the Internet. The Internet needs curation and filtration, but those efforts inevitably lead to accusations of “bias” by someone. We can’t let those accusations win.

Honorable mentions

* The Trump Administration’s terrible information security practices. Hillary Clinton’s alleged bad infosec practices were a signature and likely dispositive issue of the 2016 presidential elections. Yet, Trump and his affiliates have consistently appalling infosec practices, including the use of insecure email servers and insecure cellphones. It’s almost like Hillary was subjected to a double standard.

* End of Net Neutrality. Net Neutrality has had nearly as many dramatic twists as the EU Copyright Directive. I’m not sure what the future holds, but I do know that telcos will act like monopolistic pigs if given the chance.

* Daniel v. Armslist. A goofy Wisconsin appellate ruling indicated that Section 230 only applied to defamation cases. The case is now pending before the Wisconsin Supreme Court. I hope they get it right.

* Spanski v TV Polska. One way of reading this case is that online publishers must use geoblocking if they want to avoid copyright liability in foreign countries. Another splinternets case.

* Fox v TVEyes. Copyright owners can shut down online archives if they don’t like being subject to critical scrutiny. A good example of how courts may underappreciate the value and complexity of content aggregation.

* ABS v. CBS. Remastering songs doesn’t reset copyright protection.

* Eichenwald v. Rivello. Perhaps the most interesting case of the year. Can software code sent over the Internet cause a battery? Maybe.

* Music Modernization Act. Most of it was inside baseball, but the law contains an interesting if limited attempt to statutorily accommodate orphan works.

* Goldman v. Breitbart. If this case stands, in-line linking may be doomed.

* Hassell v. Bird. A good Section 230 result rendered inscrutable by Justice Kruger’s swing-vote opinion.

74,Empty,2019-02-25T11:00:00Z,There’s a high level of optimism in all camps about Monday's federal byelection in which five candidates are vying to replace Peter Van Loan as the new MP for the York-Simcoe riding.,"Monday's byelection in the York-Simcoe riding will see the People's Party of Canada (PPC) and Conservatives squaring off in a Tory-held riding for the very first time.

Nine candidates are vying to replace Peter Van Loan as the new federal Member of Parliament for the riding and all eyes will be on the PPC to see how many votes they take away from the Conservatives, and whether it would be enough to tip the riding toward the Liberals or NDP.

Van Loan, a member of the Conservative Party, announced his retirement in September after 14 years as the representative of the riding — long considered a Tory stronghold.

Scot Davidson, the new Conservative Party candidate, said he's feeling confident.

""This is really a referendum on the Liberal government,"" said Davidson, a local entrepreneur from the town of Georgina.

Today, byelections will be held in ridings across the country including York–Simcoe in Ontario, Outremont in Quebec and Burnaby South in B.C. (CBC)

The York-Simcoe riding was one of three federal byelections called by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Jan. 9.

Davidson has positioned himself as a businessman looking to apply his skills in helping industries grow, with a keen interest in supporting agriculture.

""Let's face it, this riding being so close to Toronto is a place where farmers themselves want to expand and look at even food processing. It's something that I can bring to the table and help facilitate,"" Davidson said.

He says he's not worried about being new to politics but rather sees it as an asset, insisting that he has ""young legs, I'm ready to run.""

Liberal candidate Shaun Tanaka went head-to-head against Van Loan in the last federal election but fell short.

This time, the mother of two says she's back and has a better chance than ever.

""We increased the Liberal voter turnout by 400 per cent,"" she told CBC News, referring to the last federal election.

""When I asked the family whether I should take this on again because it's a big ask of the entire family, the boys said to me, 'You totally should, because this time you're going to win.'""

Shaun Tanaka is hopeful the headway she made in 2015's federal election will result in a Liberal upset this time around. (CBC)

Tanaka said she isn't worried about the SNC Lavalin scandal currently plaguing the prime minister.

""I am really focused on York-Simcoe, because that's where I'm running. And I'm not hearing it at the doors,"" she said.

""What I'm hearing at the doors [is] that it's hard to raise a family. I'm hearing at the doors that they are concerned about the health of Lake Simcoe,"" said Tanaka, adding that ""I want to be that voice in Ottawa.""

NDP candidate Jessa McLean says she can be the voice of the local working class who are struggling. (Jessa McLean)

NDP candidate Jessa McLean says she's the voice of the working class.

""We have a lot of precariously employed people,"" she said. ""Our job market is, either you're commuting [to the city] for a half decent paying job or you're staying here and earning very little.""

She's a community organizer in the region and a champion of the ""$15 and Fairness"" campaign to push the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

""Our housing rates have gone up the most in terms of Ontario,"" she said.

""Rentals are up 56 per cent while our wages are only up 11 per cent.""

People's Party of Canada debut

This byelection is also the PPC's debut at the polls, and an out-of-towner — ex-Toronto prosecutor Robert Geurts — is its candidate.

""The project right now is to get the word out. We are a national party,"" he said.

Robert Geurts of the People's Party of Canada says a lot of this campaign has to do with spreading the word of the new party's existence. (CBC News)

Ex-conservative MP Maxime Bernier founded the party after losing the federal Conservative leadership nod to Andrew Scheer.

""Scot Davidson has no plan really to change anything. He's going to stick to Mr. Scheer's plan,"" said Geurts, explaining their focus on courting millennial voters.

""That generation is so bright, and so exciting. [They] haven't been corrupted yet,"" he said.

""That's where I think Bernier has sort of said, 'Listen, our platform is unfinished because there's some really exciting things we can do if we don't burden ourselves with the old baggage of before.""'

Monday's byelection comes three months after municipal elections and six months before the federal election in October.

OTTAWA—Both the opposition Conservatives and New Democrats expressed qualified confidence in Canada’s top bureaucrat to sound the alarm about election interference after his unprecedented — and some suggest partisan — intervention in the SNC-Lavalin affair .

As the country’s top bureaucrat, the clerk of the privy council wields incredible power. They’re tasked with not only supporting the prime minister and cabinet in the day-to-day functions of government and receiving top-secret briefings, but also leading the greater public service in both its operations and its culture.

That is a serious claim that carries serious consequences.

Because his version of events matched up with the Trudeau government’s, and because he specifically called out a Conservative senator for adding to increasingly violent political rhetoric and praised a Liberal cabinet minister, some — including the Globe and Mail — have called Wernick’s testimony “partisan.”

Wernick, who has served in senior bureaucratic roles in both Conservative and Liberal administrations, has also been asked to lead a five-person committee tasked with informing Canadians if a hostile foreign power attempts to meddle in the 2019 campaign. While the committee includes the prime minister’s national security adviser, as well as senior officials in the Public Safety and Global Affairs departments, Wernick is the most senior official at the table.

But while it’s clear neither Conservative nor New Democrat MPs were pleased by Wernick’s intervention on Thursday, both parties told the Star they will accept his determination should he inform Canadians about foreign interference.

If the opposition believes him to be politically compromised, any pronouncement about foreign intervention would be immediately suspect. In other words, if the opposition parties accuse Wernick of supporting the Liberals, his sounding the alarm on election interference would be fatally compromised.

“We will accept it as legitimate, but we will be skeptical. And we will expect to be fully informed,” said Stephanie Kusie, the Conservatives’ democratic institutions critic and a former diplomat, in an interview Friday night.

“We will expect to have all of the information, insofar as it does not compromise national security, that the government had in making that decision as to it being a critical incident.

“Absolutely we will accept it as legitimate, but with great skepticism and with complete information.”

On Thursday, Wernick opened his testimony with a blunt warning to MPs.

“I’m deeply concerned about my country right now, and its politics, and where it’s headed,” Wernick said.

“I worry about foreign interference in the next election … I worry about the rising tide of incitements to violence, when people use terms like ‘treason’ and ‘traitor’ in open discourse. Those are the words that lead to assassinations. I worry that somebody is going to be shot in this country this year during the election campaign.”

Columnists and partisans were quick to point out that electoral interference, not to mention the possibility of political assassinations, was not a topic the committee was grappling with.

Instead, the committee was charged with investigating allegations, broadly untested and unconfirmed, that Trudeau’s staff attempted to interfere with Canada’s independent judicial system by pressuring Wilson-Raybould to offer SNC-Lavalin a “deferred prosecution agreement.” Such a deal would allow SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal prosecution in favour of restitution, and remain eligible to bid on federal government contracts.

Official Ottawa has been almost entirely consumed with the SNC-Lavalin affair since the Globe and Mail’s first story three weeks ago.

Wernick said Wilson-Raybould was “under pressure” to make the right decision, but denied any untoward pressure from Trudeau’s staff to cut SNC-Lavalin a deal.

“It is my conclusion and my assertion, based on all the information I have, that there was no inappropriate pressure on the minister of justice in this matter,” Wernick told the committee.

But after Wernick’s testimony, both in Ottawa and in the social media swamp, people accused the clerk of going to bat for the Liberals.

Nathan Cullen, the New Democrats’ ethics critic, said on Saturday the Liberals need to move quickly to address any suggestion the clerk is compromised when it comes to election interference. Cullen said the Liberals cannot ignore that people are raising the question of the clerk’s independence.

“I beg the Liberals: don’t ignore this, don’t pretend we’re not in a very important conversation that needs to be had,” Cullen said.

“People are having the conversation on the front page of national newspapers about the clerk’s independence. That is happening. Whether you think (columnists) are crazy, or you think this person is an anointed saint, it almost doesn’t matter now. It’s happening now, the neutrality is being discussed and questioned.

“And if that is the case, and you’ve created this new body, and the central actor is being questioned, then you need to do something about it,” Cullen said.

When the Star asked — yes or no — if Cullen and the New Democrats would accept Wernick’s determination that foreign actors were interfering with the 2019 election, Cullen said yes.

Cullen also said he believes the head of Elections Canada, Stéphane Perrault, should be involved in determining whether Canadians should be informed about electoral interference.

76,Empty,2019-02-23T17:00:00Z,"As the world’s biggest tech companies grow ever more massive and influential, there is a pressing need for the government to address the public’s concerns on issues such as privacy and taxation, without stifling innovation or turning away economic benefits.","The global tech-lash is growing. At the same time, the products and services offered by the tech giants remain incredibly popular. They have become crucial parts of our economy and increasingly integrated into all aspects of our daily lives.

Barely a week goes by without some kind of tech scandal — whether it’s Amazon’s surprise Valentine’s Day decision to pull out of its planned New York City headquarters, or last week’s scathing report on disinformation and fake news from the U.K. Parliament that accuses companies like Facebook of behaving like “digital gangsters.”

Countries around the world are grappling with how to rein in the tech giants, particularly the so-called “Big Five” of Apple, Google parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft. Here’s a look at what they’re doing, and how Canada stacks up.

As jurisdictions such as European Union pull ahead with cutting edge, if sometimes controversial, legislation to regulate the companies and protect citizens, Canada hasn’t completely caught up.

She singles out Facebook and Google as particularly being a concern.

Practically it’s about tech giants collecting and selling our data to third parties without our consent, she adds. This has been exposed in a slate of recent scandals, from the discovery of a microphone built into Google’s Nest Secure home security system, to tracking by Google services on Android devices and iPhones even when privacy settings are turned on.

“Personal control over the use of your data, when it’s disclosed, how it’s used. You should be the one in control,” says the distinguished expert-in-residence at Ryerson, who leads the school’s Privacy by Design Centre of Excellence

For Ann Cavoukian, former Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, privacy comes down to control.

Amazon is not as bad but there are still concerns, she adds, like with their controversial facial recognition technology, Amazon Rekognition. The company’s own shareholders urged Amazon not to sell it to governments , fearing potential human rights abuses.

Microsoft and Apple deserve more credit, she says, and their CEOs have both made public commitments to privacy.

That’s because companies like Apple are selling a physical product, unlike Facebook and Google, says Avner Levin, a professor at the Ted Rogers School of Management, Law and Business Department.

“The people that are using the service are the product that is actually being sold to advertisers,” he says, referring to Facebook and Google.

“We are the product that they are selling.”

Privacy is linked to wider issues like fake news, and the weakening of democratic institutions, he adds. This was illustrated in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, when Russians deployed targeted information to manipulate social media users.

What others are doing:

In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, is currently investigating to see if Facebook violated a 2011 “consent decree,” that said they would address concerns about the tracking and sharing of user data, Cavoukian says. Facebook could face a hefty fine if found to be in breach of this order.

But the “gold standard” for privacy legislation is the EU, says Levin. The EU passed the comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation, in 2016.

The legislation includes hefty fines (up to 4 per cent of a company’s global revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater). It also has strict language on consent, the concept of privacy by design, and the right to be forgotten, under which individuals can apply to have negative search results deleted.

Similar laws have been passed in Japan, Brazil and California, Cavoukian says, and there’s discussion in the U.S. about national legislation.

What Canada is doing:

Canada is in “a significantly weaker situation than the EU,” says Andrew Clement, professor emeritus in the Faculty of Information, at the University of Toronto.

The federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) was developed in 2000, before Facebook and smartphones, and lacks the “fining powers” of the EU law.

“There appears to be more willingness in the EU to use existing powers for bringing the tech giants to account,” he says.

Levin says there’s been an “absolute lack of will,” on the part of both the Trudeau and Harper governments to do anything about privacy.

In 2012 in response to complaints, the federal privacy commissioner did an investigation into Facebook. But the office doesn’t have the “power to force Facebook to do anything,” he says.

The EU, influenced heavily by the Germans, is more attuned to the dangers of a loss of privacy, given their history of totalitarian governments.

“They’re a lot more willing to regulate the companies, they’re a lot more worried about the consequences,” he says.

But Cavoukian is optimistic that Canada can catch up.

In 2018, the federal Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics issued a report entitled “Towards Privacy By Design,” which she believes shows a “clear intent” to enhance the law.

Disinformation

The issue:

In recent years, the world has rudely awakened to the proliferation of hate speech and “fake news” on social media — especially during election cycles, when online content can be used to disrupt democratic processes.

Regulators and social media companies have come under pressure to stem the flow of online hate speech and malicious “disinformation.” But these are complicated problems with no easy fixes; the sheer volume of harmful content online is overwhelming and the notion of regulating speech will always provoke free speech concerns while drawing fierce opposition.

And while some countries have legal definitions for hate speech, defining “fake news” is a tricky proposition; it can also be a dangerous one, especially in the hands of authoritarian regimes that want to censor information or crack down on the free press.

Regulators have struggled to find workable solutions. “No one’s figured it out,” says Heidi Tworek, an assistant professor of history at the University of British Columbia who studies media, democracy and the digital economy. “We continue to have to really evaluate many of these different schemes that are being proposed. These are such large and complex questions.”

What others are doing:

Several European countries are now moving toward regulating social media platforms, deploying strategies that have drawn both criticism and praise. In France, the government passed a law in November that empowers judges to order the removal of “fake news” during elections; violators face a penalty of one year in prison or a €75,000 fine.

In the United Kingdom, a new parliamentary report — released this week following an 18-month investigation — is also calling for platforms like Facebook to be brought under regulatory control. The report proposes several new regulations, including a mandatory code of ethics and independent regulator who can bring legal proceedings against social media companies.

Germany has taken a particularly bold approach to regulating hate speech on social media. In January 2018, the country passed its Net Enforcement Act — sometimes dubbed the NetzDG or “Facebook law” — which forces tech companies to remove hate speech within 24 hours of illegal content being reported. (When it’s unclear whether content is actually illegal under German law, tech companies have seven days to consult and decide.)

The penalty for breaking this law? Up to €50 million in fines. “This is probably the furthest anyone has gone in trying to get large social media companies to adopt their policies to local laws,” Tworek says.

What Canada is doing:

“Canadians, and the Canadian government, are alive and alert to the issues,” says Dwayne Winseck, a journalism professor at Carleton University and director of the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project.

He points to Canada’s recently-passed electoral reform bill, C-76, as a positive step. Online platforms like Facebook and Google must now create a registry of digital advertisements placed by political or third parties during elections and ensure they remain visible for two years. The law also bans the use of foreign money by “third party” advocacy groups during campaign periods — meaning social media companies can’t knowingly accept advertisements paid for with foreign funds.

Another provision prohibits making false statements about a candidate to influence an election. This only applies narrowly to certain types of statements, however (for example, statements about whether a candidate has broken the law or their place of birth).

In January, the federal government unveiled plans for safeguarding the upcoming election, including a $7 million initiative to improve the public’s ability to detect “online deceptive practices” and a team of five bureaucrats who will alert the public whenever they find evidence of election interference.

But where Canada could be innovating more is with social media regulation more generally, says journalist Chris Tenove, a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia who studies global governance and digital politics.

He would like to see Canada follow the lead of jurisdictions like the European Union, which worked together with social media companies to develop a code of conduct. As a result, platforms have voluntarily committed to “quickly and efficiently” addressing hate speech and early reports have shown good results, he says.

One promising spot is Canada’s involvement with an international effort called the Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News. Comprising parliamentarians from nine countries, the committee is scheduled to meet in Ottawa this May and has called for social media executives — including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai — to appear so they can explain what they’re doing to stop the spread of disinformation.

Taxation

The issue:

In the mid 1980s, when Canada’s GST was still a twinkle in then prime minister Brian Mulroney’s eye, the World Wide Web had not yet been invented and Google’s founders were still pre-teen boys. Since then, digital technologies have advanced at breakneck speeds and companies like Google — not to mention Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon — have become essential to how Canadians spend their time and money.

They have also been reaping billions in profits. Tax codes, meanwhile, have evolved more slowly and governments are now grappling with how to bring their taxation systems into the digital age.

“There is a missed opportunity for taxing these companies,” says Rosalie Wyonch, a policy analyst with the C.D. Howe Institute. “Digital technology has been outpacing our ability to regulate (and) tax.”

Traditionally, tax systems were dependent on the idea of “permanent establishment,” Wyonch explains — this assumes a company has a physical presence within a country, or relates to physical goods crossing borders. But “our tax code hasn’t been updated to deal with intangibles,” she says.

Yet as digital services become more popular, the potential losses in sales tax revenue grow bigger, says University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist, the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law. (In 2017, Wyonch wrote that if Netflix alone were to collect and remit GST/HST, this would inject $50 million per year into Canada’s tax coffers).

Meanwhile, domestic companies — which do have to collect and remit sales taxes — argue they are left at a competitive disadvantage, Geist adds.

When it comes to taxing corporate income, global discussions are now underway to figure out how this should be handled when it comes to big tech. “That is a very complex international system, that we’re waiting for consensus on,” according to Wyonch.

There are major challenges when it comes to simply defining the income of digital companies, she says. Say a foreign company does a digital marketing campaign for a Canadian company. “Did they earn that income where they’re located, or did they earn that income in Canada, if they never entered Canada (or) hosted any of its content on Canadian servers?” Wyonch asks. “We don’t have a clear way to define, in a black and white way, what would — and would not — be considered Canadian income.”

What others are doing:

The G20 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have set a 2020 deadline for fighting tax avoidance (which tech giants are frequently accused of) and developing international standards for taxing big tech. But several countries — like the U.K., France, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand — are already considering interim measures, raising concerns of creating a hodgepodge of different approaches around the world. The European Union has also unveiled plans for a digital tax of three per cent of revenues, an idea that has received blowback, including from some member states.

What Canada is doing:

Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters last October that Ottawa is studying whether a new regulatory landscape is needed for the digital economy and he is pushing the G20 to speed up its timeline for establishing new rules. But Morneau says Canada’s goal is to wait for an international consensus before taking action.

Quebec and Saskatchewan, however, have forged ahead on the sales tax issue and this year, both started applying provincial sales taxes to foreign digital companies. In Quebec, more than 80 international companies — including Amazon, Apple, Google and Netflix — were registered as of Feb. 18 to collect and remit provincial sales tax in that province.

Competition

The issue:

The rise of a short list of dominant tech companies has put reform of traditional notions of competition law at the top of the agenda for policy-makers around the globe.

Modern competition law holds that when companies control large market shares, the result is higher prices and lower quality. It does not, however, make a monopoly illegal, prohibiting only the abuse of the power that a monopoly makes possible through exclusionary practices.

Experts say practices such as a company giving its own products top ranking in its online search engine have been given a boost by so called big data — the corporate accumulation of massive data sets that are automatically processed through computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. Big data could pose competitive threats by allowing exclusive licensing deals for critical data sets, for example, says Ariane Le Strat, a U.K.-based associate with international law firm Bird & Bird, or companies could agree to price-discriminate — charge more to certain people based on their perceived ability to pay — as a result of customer data they have obtained.

The public outcry over the misuse of personal data after the Cambridge Analytica scandal early last year when it was revealed that Facebook had harvested personal information for political purposes without consent ratcheted up the pressure on regulators, Le Strat says, with the U.S. among others vowing vigorous antitrust enforcement in the area.

What others are doing:

The European Union has taken the lead in enforcing stricter laws aimed at tech companies suspected of wilfully abusing their market dominance.

Its competition directorate, for example, has imposed heavy sanctions in cases where it has alleged market abuse by technology giants, including the €2.4 billion fine levied against Google in 2017 for privileging its own products in search results. The European Union has also taken dramatic steps against Microsoft, now requiring its ubiquitous Windows operating system to enable a variety of web browsers.

Germany’s competition watchdog has ordered Facebook to curb its data collection excesses and is investigating Amazon after complaints from third-party sellers that their business was being hurt by the company’s dual role as both a retailer on its Amazon Marketplace and the platform’s owner/operator. The European Commission’s competition watchdog is probing whether Amazon gains unfair advantage from the data it collects via transactions on the an e-commerce platform.

Against this backdrop some consumer advocacy groups have called for a breakup of the big U.S. tech companies similar to the tearing asunder of the U.S. Bell system in the 1980s — or at the very least an overhaul of competition statutes to address the new threats from the tech giants’ market dominance.

What Canada is doing:

Canada has maintained that while the emergence of firms that control and exploit data can raise new challenges for competition law enforcement, “this is not in and of itself cause for concern,” according to the Competition Bureau.

In a February 2018 report, the bureau concluded that while “big data may require specific methods and tools, the bureau’s traditional enforcement framework will continue to apply.”

The report says data tools that analyze and adjust to changes in the conduct of consumers and competitors may “soften competition” but this is really just an extension of practices that companies used before information technology was developed.

Moreover, it says conscious parallelism (where firms in an oligopoly are aware that their pricing and output decisions have a significant impact upon rivals and without an explicit agreement co-ordinate their behaviour as if they were engaged in collusive behaviour) is not by itself prohibited under Canadian competition law.

“For competition law enforcement in Canada,” according to Sandy Walker, a competition law partner at Dentons in Toronto, “it’s déjà vu for now.”

Addiction

The issue: This is a newer area, and there’s no scientifically established condition of social media or smartphone addiction.

There are however “problematic behaviours” associated with the technologies that are similar to the ones found in recognized addictions to drugs, alcohol or gambling, such as not being able to cut back on use, says Centre for Addiction and Mental Health senior scientist Dr. Robert Mann.

Mann says a 2016 CAMH survey of adults found 40 per cent said yes to at least one of a number of questions such as whether screen habits had ever caused the respondent to miss school, work, or important social activities, or whether a family member had ever expressed concern.

Eight per cent of respondents said yes to three or more of the questions.

Matthew Johnson, director of education at digital literacy non-profit, MediaSmarts, wouldn’t call it an addiction either. But he has heard of serious problematic behaviours especially among young people using apps or social media sites that seem designed to keep them coming back.

Snapchat streaks, where kids keep sending Snapchats to their friends every day to keep their streak and earn a flame icon, even if it means missing sleep, are one example.

Benjamin Wong, a registered clinical counsellor in behavioural addictions in B.C., says he’s seen about a five-per-cent increase over the last five years in people with screen or tech issues. He believes “hooking” customers with colourful, engaging social media sites or apps is a “cornerstone” of the tech business.

What others are doing:

Other jurisdictions haven’t gone as far as they have on issues such as data collection, or fake news.

France recently passed a law that companies with more than 50 employees can’t email employees after business hours, giving individuals “the right to disconnect.”

The goal, said officials in that country at the time, was to prevent burnout and reduce work-related stress. But Mann says such an idea might also help with addictive behaviour.

“I think it’s interesting to consider that that kind of a law might reduce the need or the urge to continually access your devices,” he says.

In the U.K., the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport parliamentary committee launched an inquiry into the growth of “immersive and addictive technologies” in December 2018, looking into the “addictive nature of some technologies,” and how they can impact behaviour.

What Canada is doing:

“Not a whole lot has been done,” in this country, says Wong, adding even much of the advocacy around regulating tech giants has been around privacy and data.

Mann says it’s a rich area for researchers, who might start by developing guidelines for healthy use.

Copyright

The issue:

Copyright protections are evolving in the digital age as countries ramp up efforts to combat piracy and online infringement. The need for new measures has come to the forefront amid a torrent of illegal downloads of online content from providers including Netflix and YouTube and the pirating of material for commercial and personal use.

What others are doing:

Protections are being updated in jurisdictions including the U.S. and especially the European Union, which is set to vote this spring in the European Parliament on an overhaul that would block copyright-protected material, including software, films, music and books, from being uploaded or electronically shared without permission from creators.

A provision of the proposed policy would effectively mandate that companies including Facebook and Google develop and fund technology to automatically filter out infringed content on their sites and search engines on a mass scale.

In the U.S., meanwhile, momentum is building around proposals in Congress that could formalize and increase royalty payments for music creators whose work is played on digital services.

In many developing jurisdictions, the push to reform intellectual property protections has become part of a plan to boost economic competitiveness, with China for example proposing to make websites liable for promoting unlicensed works as part of a broader reform of property rights.

Australia, which was described by the country’s attorney general in 2014 as the “worst offender” of pirated content, has proposed new laws that would make if far easier for copyright owners to achieve court orders that would force search engines and internet service providers to block or delete pirated content.

What Canada is doing:

In Canada, part of the response is contained in the Copyright Modernization Act which requires that providers give notice to customers suspected of pirating content. It is left to the injured party to sue with awards capped at $5,000 for non-commercial infringement.

Provisions in Canada’s legislation also prohibit demands for payment in the infringement notices, as well as links to any other sites where payments can be made to content creators.

The notice provision has been criticized by groups including the International Intellectual Property Alliance of content creators since if “fails to provide meaningful incentives for network service providers to co-operate with copyright owners to deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital network environment.”

Another possible impediment to the notice provision stems from the new trade agreement among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico that limits internet platforms’ liability for users’ content, while the deal also stipulates that Canada eventually extend its copyright term. The liability provision could prevent Canada from adopting European-style digital copyright rules, experts note.

77,Empty,2019-02-22T17:50:21Z,The packed room erupted into applause when I introduced the by-election candidates. It was standing room only.,"The packed room erupted into applause when I introduced the by-election candidates. It was standing room only. Friends of Canadian Broadcasting had brought the four parties together on the topic: 'Can Canada survive Facebook?' But it didn't feel like that was the top thing on people's minds that night in early February.

Looking out from the podium, I saw a sea of Canadians showing up for a by-election and making their voices heard. Moments before, I'd met the four candidates in a private room at the Delta Hotel and Casino where they all sat around a banquet table nursing glasses of water as they waited for the event to begin. They greeted each other graciously. Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson is the candidate for the People's Party of Canada, a far-right populist party led by Maxime Bernier. Jagmeet Singh is the leader of the NDP contending with Conservative Jay Shin and Liberal Richard Lee. Jagmeet Singh was the last to come in and when I said hello, he corrected my pronunciation of his name — it's pronounced ""Jug-meet,"" he told me.

This is Canada, I thought as I observed them, thinking, of course, of the mania and polarization south of the border — stuff some of my Canadian friends tell me just can't happen here. I felt privileged to be shaking hands with the first person of colour to lead a federal party, the savvy, highly educated Conservative candidate, the seasoned Liberal candidate, and the People's Party of Canada candidate who smiled warmly as she said hello. It all felt very civil.

And so, I started the evening as moderator of the Burnaby South all-candidate's debate with an observation. ""It's so great to see democracy in action!"" I meant it: I love grassroots politics. I grew up working in political campaigns that brought all kinds of people from different backgrounds and values together to work for one person, one goal. I respond to the headiness of elections, the hope and potential they bring to make a better world. That better world that never seems to come, but always might this time be in reach.

Anyway, since I moved to Canada in 2001, I often insert somewhere in speeches, a little self-deprecating joke. I haven't ever been able to kick my distinct Southern accent. I figure my Tennessee twang confuses people when I am being introduced as the founder and editor in chief of Canada’s National Observer so I say, 'you may notice from my accent that I'm not a native Canadian. And since moving here in 2001, I've been learning how to be a Canadian. Learning to apologize.' Then, I apologize for something very American that I really don’t like. In the early days of being here, I apologized for George W. Bush. Then came Obama and the joke no longer worked for me. Then came Trump.

I'd just watched the State of the Union address the night before the by-election debate. So, I tried my little joke with the preamble about having learned to apologize, then: ""Trump gave the State of the Union last night… (Pause) I'd just like to say, 'I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.'""

The room erupted. Some booed at the name ""Trump"" (NDP, Liberals, Conservatives?), but many more were booing at the fact that I was joking about Trump (People's Party of Canada?). Loudly. Very loudly. A big wave of boos.

So much that I burst out laughing. Hey, I've never been booed!

And this crowd was going for it.

Standing on the stage it was like a wave coming at me.



Freshly booed. Looking at this photograph as I write this piece, I see nervousness and surprise in my laughter, but also, delight at the energy of the crowd whether they loved me or hated me. Hey, they were ENGAGED. But as the evening went on, I felt like maybe I was watching a surge of alt-right populism that wasn't very funny. Photo by Michael Ruffolo

""Well, this is going to be an interactive evening,"" I said.

After thoughts

I wish I could have taken notes on the policies and positions the candidates discussed. I remember being impressed by the reflective responses of Singh, Lee and Shin. I remember thinking Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson's answers were sometimes shocking, sometimes down to earth. At moments, she sounded a lot like Donald Trump, to her supporters' delight and cheers. She was true to her self-description: ""Tired of political correctness! Freedom is our greatest gift. TV host, author, speaker. Stand with courage or sink with cowardice."" Why am I talking more about her than the other candidates? Because she was colourful and creative. Following prepared notes, she surprised, deconstructed, and seemed determined to undermine the status quo. The other candidates provided a calm foil that absorbed the shocks, while she kept the fire burning in her supporters.

She made all the other candidates look extremely moderate. Jagmeet Singh held his own very well, never losing his cool, as the waves of populism surged and subsided through the night. The other candidates kept their cool admirably.

It was my first live experience with the People's Party's brand of populism, and I'm guessing we will see the same scenario replay in riding after riding across Canada. Last night, the final all-candidates debate took place in Burnaby South, and tensions apparently continued to climb. I wasn’t there, but according to Burnaby Now’s excellent report, audience members yelled insults at candidates and each other, yelling 'Shame on you!' over immigration and security. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh and PPC candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson clashed on immigration, with Thompson bringing up the 2017 murder of a 13-year-old girl by a Syrian refugee, while Singh denounced ""coded language"" used to smear minorities. A Liberal supporter stood up from the crowd and heatedly accused Thompson of racism, sparking a shouting match with other audience members. Some of NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s answers were cut off by aggressive jeers from the crowd, Kelvin Gawley reported. The riding has a diverse population, but the debate showed intense polarization among people from all political stripes.

The polarization and heated rhetoric from Burnaby South offers a striking warning for Canada. Canada's top civil servant commented that he fears ""someone is going to be shot"" during the upcoming federal election campaign. Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick lamented the ""vomitorium of social media"" and worried that the reputations of honourable people who have served their country were ""being besmirched and dragged through the market square."" Across Canada, nonetheless, candidates are preparing to enter this treacherous arena. At stake is which party will set the tone for Canadian values for the next 4 years.

Get ready for it. The election is coming to a riding near you.

WASHINGTONIn the yearbook photo of the 1981 graduating class at Westmount High School near Montreal, the left hand of a beaming Kamala Harris is resting on the right shoulder of Hugh Kwok.

When Kwok was asked in December for his thoughts on his old pals potential run, he answered a reporters question with a question.

Shes running for president of what? he asked in a tone that suggested he thought the answer might be the local Rotary Club.

Informed that it was the presidency of the United States, his voice rose. No way. Oh my goodness. I cant believe it, he said. Then he decided he was supportive of this idea.

We could use a good president, he said. She was a sweet, kind person. Very happy, very social. Im just very excited for her, if thats what she wants to do with her life..

This is at least the fourth consecutive presidential election in which a major candidate has had family ties to Canada. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who lost the Republican primary to Donald Trump in 2016, was born in Calgary. Former president Barack Obama has a brother-in-law from Burlington.

Eyal Dattel, a human resources director in Vancouver, said he recalls his drama classmate as always a truly nice person and now sees her as an ideal candidate for a progressive future. (snip...)

In my opinion, shed be a great president, because shes fair, he said.

John Dila, a Harris classmate who is now a Harris constituent as a businessman on the California startup scene, said the Westmount students of the day regularly discussed politics.

(Snip...)Dila, who praised Harris at length, said he thinks she understands policy issues better than American colleagues who have had narrower life experiences.

She has the Canadian Vote! Her Grandfather from India was a diplomat , Both Immigrant parents (Student visas?, 7 or 8 years spent in Canada. Spent time going back to India to visit family, etc. (I think we have seen this before.) So. Did her parents become American Citizen before she and her mother moved to Canada? Did they become Canadians after moving to Canada? Just a wondering. (Anyone know how to research the Canadian thing?

She’s another Deep State plant with sketchy origins. She’s the “anointed” one Part II, but she can’t cover up her lies as smoothly as The One. Her candidacy will eventually fail!

Its probably very attractive to the left to have someone who is not firmly based in US Culture run for president. The entire point is to break down our culture.



To: dowcaet; nascarnation; M-cubed

The article has more information.It does look diverse, but it wasn’t like it was Little Rock or Selma. The question is, how do we share with the people around us that not being educated in the U.S. is not a good foundation for the presidency, especially since she seems to share the same Anti-American feelings as B.O?



To: Pete from Shawnee Mission

It’s even more important to back up Precedent Obama with another violation of the Constitution to render it meaningless.

To: Pete from Shawnee Mission

It’s okay, they catch them upstream from the sewage outflow and the current is strong. Just don’t order fish the next time you’re in Sorel, Trois-Rivieres etc. So more generally, I had a quick look at her bio, she spent her high school years in Canada after her parents divorced, and returned to the USA for university. To be honest, it probably wouldn’t make any difference, most of the Democratic politicians educated at big city U.S. high schools were probably exposed to ritual lib-left views on American politics, whereas in Montreal, Kamala Harris would have been exposed to almost no views on American politics, such courses as she might have taken would have concentrated mostly on Canadian politics and history. Our kids in Canada are not taught very much about America at all, they might know the basic facts about the division of powers and large-scale U.S. history but I only got into that sort of reading in university, those were subjects never really mentioned in high school. So what I’m saying is, she won’t be any weaker than the field as a result, it’s probably a net positive to have avoided the liberal spin of American high school teachers. She doesn’t sound like the worst candidate either, I would prefer her to Bernie or Beto if there had to be one who won. However, I suppose the more important question is, who would be easiest for Trump to beat? There again, would prefer Bernie or Beto. As to the high school being diverse, hmm, maybe they put all the “students of color” on one page? Montreal in the 1980s was not as multicultural as it is nowadays, a lot of Haitians moved there after the 2010 disaster, but it is a largely francophone city with European immigrant groups like Greeks and Italians more than what you might expect to find in Toronto or Vancouver which have large Asian communities (meaning Chinese and Indo, mostly). Westmount is a ritzy inside-the-city enclave (a separate municipality from Montreal) which is also the original home of Pierre Trudeau. Kamala Harris’s mother went there to work at some medical research place associated with the university and big hospitals. Montreal is a leading health research centre. I doubt that much of the outside-Westmount Canadian culture rubbed off on them, it tends to be one of those places where people believe the sun shines from their derrieres and all should bow down and worship. For evidence, take our current glorious leader up here.

79,Empty,2019-02-22T17:50:21Z,I'm sad to say I see the waves of Trumpism spreading across the border. But I do. Get ready for it. I wasn't.…,"The packed room erupted into applause when I introduced the by-election candidates. It was standing room only. Friends of Canadian Broadcasting had brought the four parties together on the topic: 'Can Canada survive Facebook?' But it didn't feel like that was the top thing on people's minds that night in early February.

Looking out from the podium, I saw a sea of Canadians showing up for a by-election and making their voices heard. Moments before, I'd met the four candidates in a private room at the Delta Hotel and Casino where they all sat around a banquet table nursing glasses of water as they waited for the event to begin. They greeted each other graciously. Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson is the candidate for the People's Party of Canada, a far-right populist party led by Maxime Bernier. Jagmeet Singh is the leader of the NDP contending with Conservative Jay Shin and Liberal Richard Lee. Jagmeet Singh was the last to come in and when I said hello, he corrected my pronunciation of his name — it's pronounced ""Jug-meet,"" he told me.

This is Canada, I thought as I observed them, thinking, of course, of the mania and polarization south of the border — stuff some of my Canadian friends tell me just can't happen here. I felt privileged to be shaking hands with the first person of colour to lead a federal party, the savvy, highly educated Conservative candidate, the seasoned Liberal candidate, and the People's Party of Canada candidate who smiled warmly as she said hello. It all felt very civil.

And so, I started the evening as moderator of the Burnaby South all-candidate's debate with an observation. ""It's so great to see democracy in action!"" I meant it: I love grassroots politics. I grew up working in political campaigns that brought all kinds of people from different backgrounds and values together to work for one person, one goal. I respond to the headiness of elections, the hope and potential they bring to make a better world. That better world that never seems to come, but always might this time be in reach.

Anyway, since I moved to Canada in 2001, I often insert somewhere in speeches, a little self-deprecating joke. I haven't ever been able to kick my distinct Southern accent. I figure my Tennessee twang confuses people when I am being introduced as the founder and editor in chief of Canada’s National Observer so I say, 'you may notice from my accent that I'm not a native Canadian. And since moving here in 2001, I've been learning how to be a Canadian. Learning to apologize.' Then, I apologize for something very American that I really don’t like. In the early days of being here, I apologized for George W. Bush. Then came Obama and the joke no longer worked for me. Then came Trump.

I'd just watched the State of the Union address the night before the by-election debate. So, I tried my little joke with the preamble about having learned to apologize, then: ""Trump gave the State of the Union last night… (Pause) I'd just like to say, 'I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.'""

The room erupted. Some booed at the name ""Trump"" (NDP, Liberals, Conservatives?), but many more were booing at the fact that I was joking about Trump (People's Party of Canada?). Loudly. Very loudly. A big wave of boos.

So much that I burst out laughing. Hey, I've never been booed!

And this crowd was going for it.

Standing on the stage it was like a wave coming at me.



Freshly booed. Looking at this photograph as I write this piece, I see nervousness and surprise in my laughter, but also, delight at the energy of the crowd whether they loved me or hated me. Hey, they were ENGAGED. But as the evening went on, I felt like maybe I was watching a surge of alt-right populism that wasn't very funny. Photo by Michael Ruffolo

""Well, this is going to be an interactive evening,"" I said.

After thoughts

I wish I could have taken notes on the policies and positions the candidates discussed. I remember being impressed by the reflective responses of Singh, Lee and Shin. I remember thinking Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson's answers were sometimes shocking, sometimes down to earth. At moments, she sounded a lot like Donald Trump, to her supporters' delight and cheers. She was true to her self-description: ""Tired of political correctness! Freedom is our greatest gift. TV host, author, speaker. Stand with courage or sink with cowardice."" Why am I talking more about her than the other candidates? Because she was colourful and creative. Following prepared notes, she surprised, deconstructed, and seemed determined to undermine the status quo. The other candidates provided a calm foil that absorbed the shocks, while she kept the fire burning in her supporters.

She made all the other candidates look extremely moderate. Jagmeet Singh held his own very well, never losing his cool, as the waves of populism surged and subsided through the night. The other candidates kept their cool admirably.

It was my first live experience with the People's Party's brand of populism, and I'm guessing we will see the same scenario replay in riding after riding across Canada. Last night, the final all-candidates debate took place in Burnaby South, and tensions apparently continued to climb. I wasn’t there, but according to Burnaby Now’s excellent report, audience members yelled insults at candidates and each other, yelling 'Shame on you!' over immigration and security. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh and PPC candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson clashed on immigration, with Thompson bringing up the 2017 murder of a 13-year-old girl by a Syrian refugee, while Singh denounced ""coded language"" used to smear minorities. A Liberal supporter stood up from the crowd and heatedly accused Thompson of racism, sparking a shouting match with other audience members. Some of NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s answers were cut off by aggressive jeers from the crowd, Kelvin Gawley reported. The riding has a diverse population, but the debate showed intense polarization among people from all political stripes.

The polarization and heated rhetoric from Burnaby South offers a striking warning for Canada. Canada's top civil servant commented that he fears ""someone is going to be shot"" during the upcoming federal election campaign. Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick lamented the ""vomitorium of social media"" and worried that the reputations of honourable people who have served their country were ""being besmirched and dragged through the market square."" Across Canada, nonetheless, candidates are preparing to enter this treacherous arena. At stake is which party will set the tone for Canadian values for the next 4 years.

Get ready for it. The election is coming to a riding near you.

80,Empty,2019-02-22T14:10:21Z,Socialists take it for granted that socialist ideas can be adopted without changing the quality of freedom in a society. Many Democrats believe they can be socialists as well as democrats,"In 1976 the sage Irving Kristol wrote that “The most important political event of the twentieth century is not the crisis of capitalism but the death of socialism.” He was one of the most brilliant thinkers in America, but he was quite wrong. It was communism that seemed to be breathing its last in the 1970s, not socialism.

The Soviet Union was dying, and with it all the puppet states the Soviets established in their vast empire. But in many places socialism remained alive, from Sweden to British Columbia. The Swedish Social Democratic Party has won most elections there since 1932, but never declared other forms of politics illegal — as a communist party would naturally (and happily) have done. In B.C. the provincial government administered the universal health-care system established by Canada, and the people sometimes voted for the socialist NDP. But few Canadians or British Columbians yearned for a communist system. The one thing is not like the other. Gulags, mass executions and rigid censorship come with communism. Socialism, though it might be a little self-righteous, manages to avoid the horrors.

The Economist magazine appeared this week with a coverline trumpeting “The Rise of Millennial Socialism.” (The word “millennial” was justified by a U.S. poll showing that young people thought socialism an agreeable idea.) Considering applied socialist ideas, the Economist notes off-handedly that the U.S. lacks a system of universal health care, which is “Normal elsewhere in the rich world.” Well, the U.S. is indeed rich but, weirdly, has never got around to universal medicare.

Many Americans are afraid of the idea. It sounds foreign enough to make them nervous. Socialists take it for granted that socialist ideas can be adopted without changing the quality of freedom in a society. Many Democrats believe they can be socialists as well as democrats. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the most talked-about new member of congress, is also a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. Bernie Sanders, the 77-year-old Vermont senator and candidate for the presidency in 2020, comes equipped with a full socialist agenda: he’s for lower prescription prices, free tuition in public colleges, a $15 minimum wage and of course universal health care.

A few prominent Democrats clearly avoid being marked as socialists. Sen. Kamala Harris of California, perhaps unwilling to join an expanding club, says “I am not a democratic socialist.” On other hand, Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s “wealth tax,” is just the thing Republicans watch for and hate.

Despite everyone’s attempt to explain it, a universal health system will sound to conservatives like the first step on the road to the gulag. Perhaps we might withdraw the word “socialist” and substitute the word “co-operative.” Americans accept one enormously complicated national system, far more impressive than the country’s health system in its present condition — the roads.

They are beautiful to behold, great endless stripes of construction that reach every city and town in the country, planned and built to a standard of high excellence. They are maintained, for the most part, superbly. They are a mutual community project for all of the country, and absolutely necessary for maintaining American civilization. Many businesses, large and small, have profited from their construction and upkeep, but the roads are paid for co-operatively from everyone’s taxes, just as a universal health service would be — and no one ever said that the road system was socialist.

Microsoft revealed today that a Russian nation-station hacking group targeted political organizations engaged in the upcoming the upcoming 2019 European Parliament election --scheduled for the end of May.



""We've seen recent activity targeting democratic institutions in Europe as part of the work our Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) carry out every day to protect all of our customers,"" said Tom Burt, Corporate Vice President, Customer Security & Trust at Microsoft.



""These attacks are not limited to campaigns themselves but often extend to think tanks and non-profit organizations working on topics related to democracy, electoral integrity, and public policy and that are often in contact with government officials,"" Burt added. ""For example, Microsoft has recently detected attacks targeting employees of the German Council on Foreign Relations and European offices of The Aspen Institute and The German Marshall Fund.""



Microsoft said it detected attacks between September and December 2018 targeting 104 accounts belonging to employees at various of these political organizations, employees located in Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, and Serbia.



The OS maker attributed the attacks to APT28, a group also known as Fancy Bear and which Microsoft calls Strontium internally. This is one of the two Russian hacker groups known to have breached the Democratic National Committee servers in 2016, ahead of the US Presidential election.



The attacks Microsoft detected were basic spear-phishing email campaigns, the go-to weapon of APT28 hackers. The emails aimed to collect login credentials or infect victims with malware.



With today's blog post revealing these attacks, Microsoft said it was also expanding its AccountGuard service to 12 new EU countries: France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia, and Spain.



Microsoft launched AccountGuard in August 2018 as part of its Defending Democracy Program, which includes a suite of security tools and services to help US political campaigns and electoral organizations safeguard their IT networks from hackers.



AccountGuard lets political campaigns and organizations sign up the Office 365, Hotmail, or Outlook.com accounts of their staff into a program with improved protection and threat detection.



Microsoft will watch over these accounts for cyber-attacks from known nation-state groups and alert administrators and victims in the case of any detected threat.



In addition, AccountGuard also provides access to a large number of cybersecurity webinars and workshops so IT teams can improve their security posture, but also advice from Microsoft engineers in the case of confirmed intrusions.



Previously, AccountGuard had been made available first in the US, and then the UK, Ireland, and in Canada. Microsoft launched the service in 2018 after it detected similar APT28 attacks against US political entities ahead of the 2018 US Midterm elections.



""While AccountGuard is currently available for the campaign accounts of elected officials, we hope in the near future to offer it for government-run accounts, like official accounts of the European Parliament,"" Burt said in a blog post today.



The move to expand AccountGuard into Europe comes after Microsoft expanded the same service to Canada at the start of the month to help local political entities ahead of the country's 43rd Canadian federal election, scheduled for October 2019, when Canadians will be choosing a new Parliament.

His position on the Collegium of the University of St. Michael’s College was one vehicle through which Rosica exerted a deep influence on Catholic public life in Canada.

Rosica has been one of the church’s key communicator to the country at large, especially on papal affairs like elections and visits, and recently helped the Vatican communicate to media at its summit on youth protection. He is also founding CEO of the religious television channel Salt and Light.

Neither the Vatican Dicastery for Communications nor Salt and Light have replied to invitations to comment on his admission to the National Post that he presented other people’s words as his own in various newspapers and publications, including the Salt and Light website and the Post itself.

He admitted this kind of behaviour is dishonest, and said in an interview that it was wrong, but in the absence of a fuller public explanation, he has been criticized on Twitter for appearing to blame interns and other subordinates who helped with his writing.

In a written statement to the Post last week, he said: “If there was an error on my part, it is that I have often relied on others who have generously helped me in my preparation of various texts and I did not do the necessary checking into sources, etc. I regret that. It was never willfully done.”

He said he failed to thoroughly review his writings and cite sources because of “urgent media requests.”

Rev. Donald McLeod, chair of the Collegium, said Rosica made “significant contributions” to the school, which has an undergraduate program and a graduate theology faculty.

“Over the weekend, I received and have respectfully accepted his resignation from the Collegium,” he said.

We embrace our brother despite this failing for which he has taken full responsibility

In a statement, Kevin Storey, Superior General of the Basilian Fathers, which founded the school, said: “Plagiarism of any kind is wrong. When it is committed knowingly it rises to the level of a moral offense. As a community of Catholic educators we condemn it, without qualification.”

“At the same time, we embrace our brother despite this failing for which he has taken full responsibility. With him, we apologize to those who have been offended by the misuse of their literary gifts,” he said.

The Jesuits of Canada also announced Monday they had withdrawn an invitation for Rosica ro receive their Magis Award at an upcoming gala.

“Plagiarism is a grave offense against intellectual honesty and the community of scholarship,” the congregation said in a statement.

The most immense and dangerous public scandal in American history is finally cracking open like a ripe pomegranate. The broad swath of the Trump-hating media that has participated in what has amounted to an unconstitutional attempt to overthrow the government are reduced to reporting the events and revelations of the scandal in which they have been complicit, in a po-faced ho-hum manner to impart to the misinformed public that this is as routine as stock market fluctuations or the burning of an American flag in Tehran.

For more than two years, the United States and the world have had two competing narratives: that an elected president of the United States was a Russian agent whom the Kremlin helped elect; and its rival narrative that senior officials of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and other national intelligence organizations had repeatedly lied under oath, misinformed federal officials, and meddled in partisan political matters illegally and unconstitutionally and had effectively tried to influence the outcome of a presidential election, and then undo its result by falsely propagating the first narrative. It is now obvious and indisputable that the second narrative is the correct one.

The authors, accomplices, and dupes of this attempted overthrow of constitutional government are now well along in reciting their misconduct without embarrassment or remorse because—in fired FBI Director James Comey’s formulation—a “higher duty” than the oath they swore to uphold the Constitution compelled them. Or—in fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe’s words—“the threat” was too great. Nevermind that the nature of “the threat” was that the people might elect someone he and Comey disapproved of as president, and that that person might actually serve his term, as elected.

A Long List of Offenders—and OffensesThe extent of the criminal misconduct of the former law enforcement and intelligence chiefs is now notorious, but to make the right point here, it has to be summarized. The fact that the officially preferred candidate lied to federal officials about her emails and acted in outright contempt of Congress and the legal process in the destruction of evidence, was simply ignored by the FBI director, who announced that she would not be prosecuted, though he had no authority to make that determination.

The dossier of salacious gossip and defamatory falsehoods amassed by a retired British spy from the lowest grade of intelligence sources in Russia, commissioned and paid for by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, was circulated to the media by high public officials and cited in illegal and dishonest applications to authorize surveillance of the campaign of the other presidential candidate. A special counsel was empowered on the false pretext of the necessity to get to the bottom of Trump-Russian collusion in the election, of which there was and remains no evidence, because it did not occur and was a complete partisan fabrication.

The special counsel then packed his staff with militant Clinton partisans, and acted very late and only when his hand was forced by the media to remove two officials who referred in texts to each other to the Bureau’s ability to smear and provoke the impeachment of the winning candidate as “an insurance policy” against his filling the office to which he was elected.

Large sections of the media colluded with the Democratic campaign and produced the doctrine that anything was justifiable, no matter how dishonest, to destroy the incoming president’s reputation and damage him in public opinion polls to legitimize attempts to remove him from office. Large sections of the media deliberately deluged the public with stories they knew to be false about the new president and referred to him in terms of unprecedented vituperation in what purported to be reportage and not comment.

The Canadian peer blamed the Justice Department and the FBI, then led by James Comey (pictured) of interfering in the election

This unorganized but widespread campaign of defamation was taken up by a great number of ordinarily newsworthy celebrities and was accompanied by false, unresearched stories denigrating President Trump’s supporters, such as the false claims about Catholic school students’ treatment of an elderly native American and the false claim that actor Jussie Smollett had been beaten up and reviled by Trump supporters. The former intelligence chiefs of the nation under President Obama repeatedly have accused this president of treason, the most heinous of all crimes, and have asserted with the authority of their former positions that the Russians determined the result of the 2016 presidential election. They knew this to be entirely false.

Distracting Public AttentionThe special counsel has failed to find any evidence of the collusion and electoral interference that was the justification for establishing his inquiry, and the Democrats are already expressing disappointment in his failure to produce such evidence when the leading Democratic members of congressional investigative committees still robotically claim to have at least prima facie evidence of such collusion.

The dishonest attempt of much of the opposition and what even left-leaning media-monitoring organizations record as 90 percent of the national media, continued for more than two years to try to condition the country to believe that the president had committed the “high crimes and misdemeanors” required by the Constitution for impeachment and removal from office.

The special counsel, apart from smearing the president, distracted public attention from or tended to justify the ever more evident misconduct of the president’s enemies. And we now know that Comey, despite his “higher duty,” lied to the president about his not being a target of an FBI investigation, illegally leaked to the New York Times the contents of a self-serving memo he purloined from the government, and lied to Congress by claiming 245 times in one sitting to be ignorant of recent matters that no one of sound mind could have forgotten.

This unorganized but widespread campaign of defamation was taken up by a great number of ordinarily newsworthy celebrities and was accompanied by false, unresearched stories denigrating President Trump’s (pictured) supporters, Black wrote

And now we have Andrew McCabe’s proud confirmation that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein not only continued the illegal counterintelligence investigation of President Trump, but actively discussed methods of securing his removal from office by deliberate misuse of a variety of laws, including the Emoluments Clause, the 25th Amendment to deal with mental incompetence, and the Logan Act of 1799, which has never been used successfully and has not been tested in 150 years.

Make Those Responsible Pay at the PollsThis entire monstrous travesty is finally coming apart without even waiting for the horrible disappointment of the special counsel’s inability to adduce a scrap of evidence to justify his replication of Torquemada as an inquisitor and of the Gestapo and KGB at rounding up and accusing unarmed individuals who were not flight risks. The collapse of this grotesque putsch, under the irresistible pressure of a functioning attorney general and Senate committees that are not hamstrung by NeverTrumpers, will cause a revulsion against the Democratic Party that will be seismic and prolonged.

The disgrace of their misconduct is profound and shocking. Richard Nixon, against whom there is no conclusive evidence that he broke any laws (although a number of people in his entourage did) never did anything like this. J. Edgar Hoover in 47 years at the head of the FBI and its predecessor organization, never tried to meddle in a presidential election. Those responsible will pay for this, including at the polls.

Without realizing the proportions of the emergency, America has survived the greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War. All those who legitimately oppose or dislike the president, including traditional high-brow Republicans who find him distasteful, should join in the condemnation of this largely criminal assault on democracy, and then, if they wish, go out and try to beat him fair and square, the good old-fashioned way, in a free election. But they must abide by the election’s result.

85,Empty,2019-02-22T01:56:20Z,"The most logical version was that either Trudeau or Butts, tried to persuade Wilson-Raybould to grant SNC a remediation agreement at meetings in September and December","OTTAWA — Michael Wernick wandered into the justice committee like a sun-struck madman and gave real answers to the questions he was asked by MPs not used to such transparency.

After two weeks of politicians citing “solicitor-client privilege” in the SNC Lavalin case, we finally got somewhere.

The public service generally operates on the principle that if there is nothing to be gained by saying something, it is generally better to say nothing than anything.

But the country’s top bureaucrat was provocative and unapologetic — perhaps because he is the likely source of any pressure, undue or otherwise, said to have been put on Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney general, over the prospect of a deferred prosecution agreement that would curtail the criminal prosecution of engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

From his opening statement, it was clear the clerk of the Privy Council was in feisty mood. He said he is worried about his country, about foreign interference in elections, about rising tides of incitement to violence (“I’m worried someone is going to get shot in this country this year during the political campaign”) and about people losing faith in the institutions of governance in the country.

The SNC story plays into that, he said.

The public service generally operates on the principle that if there is nothing to be gained by saying something, it is generally better to say nothing than anything

Despite the publicity around SNC, Canadians should have faith because the independence of the investigation and prosecution of the company have never been compromised. He pointed to laws that are “demonstrably working” when it comes to prosecutorial independence, lobbying and government ethics. “The shields held — the software protecting our democracy is working,” he said.

“Is there two-tier justice in Canada? No, demonstrably not. Despite the most extensive government relations effort in modern times, the company (SNC) didn’t get what it wanted.”

He defended the concept of deferred prosecution agreements as an attempt to balance public policy concerns, amid “legitimate” concerns by governments that workers, suppliers and pensioners of a company suffer from the misdeeds of corporate officials. “They are not an acquittal, an amnesty, an exoneration, a get-out-of-jail card or a slap on the wrist,” he said.

That was the background against which MPs set out on an expedition to get some answers.

Justin Trudeau has evolved into a politician so well versed in the art of denial, he can’t say yes.

Hence the confusion over who said what to whom. The most logical version of events to this point was that either Trudeau or his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, tried to persuade Wilson-Raybould to grant SNC a remediation agreement at meetings in September and December.

Is there two-tier justice in Canada? No, demonstrably not. Despite the most extensive government relations effort in modern times, the company (SNC) didn’t get what it wanted

But Wernick was at the meeting between the former justice minister and the prime minister on Sept. 17 and said that Trudeau was clear the final decision on SNC was hers alone. “The prime minister said verbally and in writing that she was the decider.”

He said in his experience, Trudeau and his staff “always, always conducted themselves to the highest level of integrity. You may not like their policies, or their politics or their tweets but they have always been guided by trying to do the right thing.”

Having exonerated Trudeau and Butts, Wernick revealed that he himself is the likely source of any disquiet Wilson-Raybould may have over SNC.

He predicted that when the former attorney general appears before the committee next week, she will express concerns about a phone call he had with her on Dec. 19.

He said he called her that afternoon to discuss the SNC file and whether a deferred prosecution agreement was still an option, even though she had ruled out intervening during her conversation with the prime minister in September.

Wernick revived the issue, saying her colleagues and the prime minister were “quite anxious” about the future of the company, which was being discussed openly in the business press.

You may not like their policies, or their politics or their tweets but they have always been guided by trying to do the right thing.

“I can tell you with complete assurance that my view of the conversation is that it was within the boundaries of what is lawful and appropriate. I was informing the minister of context,” he said, while acknowledging she may have her own views on the issue. “But that is for the ethics commissioner to sort out,” he said. “My conclusion and my assertion is that there was no inappropriate pressure on the minister of justice in this matter.”

Murray Rankin, the NDP justice critic, pointed out that Wilson-Raybould was fired, “sorry removed,” for not offering a remediation deal.

Wernick refuted the suggestion, saying she was not fired, but was offered another position in cabinet that she accepted. At no time, he said, did she raise any concerns with the prime minister or the ethics commissioner.

He was vocal in his opinion that Wilson-Raybould should not be muzzled by solicitor-client privilege when she appears at committee next week. “I do not see where the former attorney general was a solicitor. The matter was never discussed at cabinet, never. She was not advising the prime minister,” he said.

What to make of it all? It bore the hallmarks of a man unconstrained by the need to get re-elected, with nothing to lose in terms of self-advancement (Wernick has worked in the public service for 37 years and has reached its apex).

The odds on him continuing in his current job should the Conservatives win in October were not improved by his staunch defence of Trudeau and his advisers. Wernick declared himself “neutral” and pointed out he has served as a public servant under seven prime ministers. One academic suggested some of his comments sounded like “cheer-leading” for the current government. He certainly came close to crossing lines.

But no clerk is a wallflower at the orgy — he or she has to be invested in the success or failure of the government, if the relationship is going to work.

By his testimony at the committee, Wernick showed he is heavily invested.

He expressed himself frustrated by media coverage, taking issue with the Globe and Mail story that started this affair. He stated clearly he does not believe there is a case to answer. And he obviously relishes the prospect of Wilson-Raybould giving her version of events next week, unfettered by privilege.

In light of his testimony, Wernick is suggesting the SNC affair boils down to whether there is an objective standard when it comes to defining what is “lawful and appropriate” in conversations between the attorney general and others.

Legal precedent in the U.K. suggests those conversations are more likely to be judged by a subjective standard, said Nathalie Drouin, the deputy minister of justice, who was also a witness at the committee.

No thanks to anyone in this government, its case is now on firmer ground.

Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call

, 11:00 a.m. ET

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the TC PipeLines, LP 2018 Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Rhonda Amundson. Please go ahead, Ms. Amundson.

Rhonda Amundson -- Investor Relations

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to TC PipeLines' fourth quarter 2018 conference call. I'm joined today by our President, Nathan Brown; our VP and General Manager, Janine Watson; and our Treasurer and Principal Financial Officer, Chuck Morris. Please note that a slide presentation will accompany their remarks and is available on our website at tcpipelineslp.com, where it can be found in the Investor Section under the heading Events and Presentations.

Nathan will begin today with a review of TC PipeLines' 2018 fourth quarter and annual highlights and results. Janine will provide an update on the Partnership's assets and the market environment, following which Chuck will provide a more detailed review of our financial results for the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2018. Nathan will return and wrap up our remarks with a brief discussion of our growth strategies and close with some key takeaways. Following the prepared remarks, I will ask the conference operator to coordinate your questions.

Before we begin, I would like to remind you that certain statements made during this conference call will be forward-looking regarding future events and our future financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to various risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as discussed in detail in our 2018 10-K, as well as our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

Please also note that we use the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per common unit, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and distributable cash flow during our presentation. Adjusted earnings are used to provide a more comparable earnings measure from quarter-to-quarter and exclude the impact of certain non-recurring items. EBITDA is an approximate measure of our operating cash flow during the period and reconciles directly to net income and distributable cash flow is presented to provide a measure of cash generated during the period to evaluate our cash distribution capability. These measures are provided as a supplement to GAAP financial results and we provide a reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures in our SEC filings.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nathan.

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Thanks, Rhonda. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Looking at Slide 4, I'm pleased to report that TC PipeLines has had another good quarter and solid annual results. Although, we reported a net loss of $413 million for the fourth quarter and $182 million for the year, after excluding the impact of the non-cash impairment charges for Bison and Tuscarora and provides one-time contract buyout proceeds, we generated adjusted earnings of $86 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 and $317 million on an annual basis. These represented 30% and 26% increases in our fourth quarter and annual adjusted earnings, respectively, versus the same periods in 2017.

These strong results reflect the high level of contracting across our portfolio, together with increased natural gas flows mainly out of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Similarly, our adjusted EBITDA was $140 million for the fourth quarter and $526 million for the full year in 2018, again, an 18% higher than the same periods in 2017. We generated $95 million in distributable cash flow in the fourth quarter 2018, 32% higher than during the same period of 2017. And on an annual basis, our distributable cash flow of $391 million was 26% higher year-over-year.

Story continues

We paid out $47 million in distributions to our unitholders during the fourth quarter and $218 million in the full year of 2018. The Partnership also declared its fourth quarter distribution of $0.65 per common unit, consistent with the distribution paid for each of the first three quarters of 2018. Chuck will discuss our financial results in more detail a little later in the call. We also continued to progress a number of commercial activities during the fourth quarter. We are pleased to announce the progress on a new PNGTS expansion project last week, the Westbrook XPress project. This is another organic expansion opportunity in response to demand for incremental Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin natural gas supplies in the Northeast US and Atlantic Canada markets. And Phase 1 of our Portland XPress project became operational on November 1, 2018.

These two projects, Westbrook XPress and Portland XPress, will increase PNGTS capacity by approximately 70% from 210,000 dekatherms a day to approximately 350,000 dekatherms by 2021. Janine will discuss these commercial developments in more detail in a minute or two. During the fourth quarter of 2018, in response to the FERC actions earlier in the year, we finalized regulatory approaches on all of our assets and obtained FERC approvals where applicable.

Following the elimination of the tax allowance and the accumulated deferred income tax liability from rate base, recent rate settlements and related filings on all our pipelines, the estimated impact of tax related changes to our revenue and cash flow is a reduction of approximately $30 million per year on an annualized basis beginning in 2019. We believe our pipeline systems which are largely backed by long-term take-or-pay contracts will deliver consistent financial performance going forward and support our current quarterly distribution level of $0.65 per common unit for the foreseeable future.

With our cash savings related to our reduced distributions, we've repaid a portion of our indebtedness such that our leverage is now approximately 3.1 times. And our distribution coverage is very healthy at approximately 2.1 times for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. This positive performance was achieved despite a challenging year on the regulatory front and in the broader MLP space. As a result of these solid results, together with our prudent financial actions, we are entering 2019 with a healthy balance sheet, strong distribution coverage, and a reset regulatory position.

I'll now turn the call over to Janine Watson, our VP and General Manager to provide additional color on our assets in these commercial developments, together with our market outlook.

Janine Watson -- Vice President and General Manager

Thanks, Nathan, and good morning, everyone. First of all, I am pleased to note that all of our assets operated safely and reliably throughout 2018 and that due to the excellent efforts of our teams out in the field, none of our pipelines experienced a major outage or restriction to firm capacity during the polar vortex weather events that recently blanketed most of our geographic footprint.

Now moving to Slide 5, I will drill a bit further into the strong operating performance of TCP's assets in 2018. Long-term contracts continue to be the cornerstone of TCP's solid commercial fundamental, underpinning 87% of our 2018 distributable cash flow. In the West, demand is strong for transportation service on our GTN pipeline, serving the needs of -- in California and the Pacific Northwest. GTN held successful open seasons for the long-term capacity scheduled to come available over the next two years and we are effectively sold out of firm capacity in and after 2020.

North Baja outpaced its usual steady performance, selling incremental short-term services in response to increased demand for southbound transportation in 2018 and this has been the case for the past few years. Northern Border continues to experience strong demand for its capacity, operating at very high levels of throughput. Bakken (inaudible) climbed as high as 1.3 to 1.4 Bcf per day and now account for more than half of the daily receipts on this line.

Northern Border generally renews its contract for terms of five years and is now substantially contracted through to the end of 2020. Great Lakes benefited from increased levels of throughput in 2018 as well, due in part to its long-term transportation contract with TransCanada for 711,000 dekatherms per day that took effect on November 1, 2017. This asset's financials results were also enhanced by the elimination of a revenue sharing mechanism that it formally had in place with its shippers prior to its 2017 rate settlement that took effect in Q1 of 2018. In addition, Great Lakes sold substantially all of its available firm winter capacity for 2018, demonstrating the favorable shift in market dynamics for this asset over the past two years.

PNGTS benefited from a full-year revenue from its Continent-to-Coast contract and placed Phase 1 of its Portland XPress project into service on November 1. This pipeline also successfully marketed short term and interruptible transportation as various market opportunities arose throughout the year. And as we've previously press released for Bison, two of its four customers bought-out their firm transportation contracts at the end of 2018. This buyout of 60% of Bison's revenue stream was used to decrease TCP's leverage.

We remain committed to Bison, but recognize that this asset likely needs to be reconfigured to find a new role in the US energy transportation market. We are exploring two development opportunities for this pipeline. First, we are examining a potential gas reversal project that would make Bison bidirectional and connect the Bakken's gas production to third-party pipeline systems in the Rockies that link into the Cheyenne Supply Hub. And second, we are looking at the option of converting the Bison pipeline into liquids service.

Now, turning to our regulatory update, our commercial and regulatory teams worked throughout the last three quarters to develop customer outreach and regulatory actions for each of our individual pipeline and implemented these strategies in the fourth quarter. These initiatives appear to have been well received by our customers and our regulator. And we believe that, but for the finalization and filing of our settlements on Tuscarora and Iroquois, we are finished with the 501-G process. Now, for your convenience, we have detailed each of our asset's 501-G elections and outcomes in a chart in our press release and in the recent developments in our business section of our 10-K filing. We estimate that the impact of these tax related changes on our revenue and cash flow will be a decrease of about $30 million per year starting in 2019. Of the total impact, about two-thirds is attributable to GTN.

Turning to Slide 6, production of natural gas continues to grow in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Receipts onto TransCanada's NGTL system went up again in 2018, increasing by almost 1 Bcf to approximately 12.3 Bcf per day. This system is the upstream source of gas for our Western and Midwestern pipelines and about 40% of this supply is making its way to markets via our system. Thus, we are experiencing robust demand for our services, as is evidenced by strong contracting for increasing term.

TransCanada's Canadian Mainline deliveries have also increased year-over-year due to initiatives like its long-term fixed-price offering which benefited Great Lakes starting in 2017. Now, we expect this trend will continue going forward as the Mainline's recent North Bay Junction LTFP offering creates the upstream capacity for Portland's recently announced Westbrook XPress project. Westbrook XPress is a multi-phase expansion project designed to help serve markets in Northern New England and Atlantic Canada that have (ph) until recently and served by offshore gas production from Sable Island and Deep Panuke.

Still subject to various conditions precedent and approval, the Westbrook XPress project is backed by long-term fixed-price contracts with fixed shippers for terms of 15 years or more. Phase 1 of this project is to be supported by pressure agreements with our upstream affiliated pipelines, allowing Portland to bring an initial 43,000 dekatherms per day into service in November of this year, without the need for any construction.

Phase 2 requires the addition of a compressor and associated facilities at an existing station and at an estimated cost of $100 million, and will bring a further 60,000 dekatherms of firm capacity on to this system. These new facilities are intended to be in service by November 1, 2021 and will be funded using debt at the asset level. While this project is fully in service, we expect this project will generate at least 30 million in revenue for Portland on an annual basis. We are also progressing our Portland XPress project and put the first phase into service on November 1. Phases 2 and 3 of this project are well under way and are projected to be on time and on budget and fully in service by November of 2020.

Now, looking forward, TC PipeLines could continue to benefit from the continued growth in the WCSB as well as the Bakken. Because of the highly contracted nature of our pipeline assets, together with their generally strong market position, we expect they will continue to perform in a predictable manner after taking into the impact of the 2018 FERC actions into account, and thereby will produce steady results. Now, we do expect elevated levels of maintenance spending going forward due to the continued strong gas flows on our pipelines and we estimate our share of maintenance spend may be in the $97 million range this year. It should be noted that this spending does contribute to our rate base and future rate making proceeding.

Organic growth projects will be a management priority for the upcoming year as we continue to assess what other opportunities may arise to further take advantage of TCP's existing pipeline network. Great Lakes, for example, has about 1 Bcf of available capacity that we are working to market long-term on a stand-alone basis or as a combined offering with other of TransCanada's pipeline. GTN will ramp up to its full firm capacity of about 2.9 Bcf per day by 2020, as NGTL continues its upstream debottlenecking activity. Should NGTL secure shippers support to increase its West Gate export capability beyond this level in subsequent years, we have identified up to a further 0.5 Bcf of expandability on GTN. And North Baja's situation continues to be interesting, as LNG export facilities in the area continue to be developed. We are actively exploring ways that our Northern Border and Bison assets could help provide incremental takeaway capacity for producers in the Bakken.

I will now turn the call over to Chuck Morris, our Treasurer and Principal Financial Officer to discuss our fourth quarter financial results in more detail.

William Morris -- Vice President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer

Thanks, Janine, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to Slide 7, I'll now review the Partnership's fourth quarter and full year 2018 results. The Partnership recorded a net loss attributable to controlling interests in the fourth quarter of $413 million. The net loss was a result of the recognition of non-cash impairment charges of $537 million on our Bison Pipeline and $59 million on Tuscarora during the quarter, partially offset by our solid results and the $97 million cash payment by two of Bison's customers to buyout and terminate their transportation contracts.

The impairment charges are non-cash items and do not impact the Partnership's distributable cash flow. Our adjusted earnings exclude the impact of these non-cash charges as well as the one-time Bison cash payment to allow for better comparison to previous quarters. Adjusted earnings increased to $86 million for the fourth quarter from $66 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily as a result of higher revenues on GTN and PNGTS and higher equity earnings from Great Lakes during the period. We saw a similar uplift in our adjusted EBITDA year-over-year to $140 million in Q4 of 2018 from $117 million in the same quarter of 2017.

On an annual basis, we reported a net loss in 2018 of $182 million which after adjusting for non-cash and one-time items resulted in an adjusted earnings of $317 million, 26% higher than the $252 million reported in 2017, reflective of the strong revenues across our systems as well as higher equity earnings. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $526 million in 2018, up from $445 million in 2017. The Partnership paid distributions of $47 million in the fourth quarter. The $27 million decrease over Q4 2017 was primarily due to the decrease in the quarterly distribution of $0.35 per common unit paid beginning in Q1 of 2018 in response to the 2018 FERC actions.

On an annual basis, the Partnership paid $218 million in distributions in 2018, compared to $284 million in 2017 with the difference again due to the same factors that impacted the quarter. As a result of the common unit distribution reduction noted above, the Partnership did not pay any IDRs to our General Partner on distributions declared from the first to the fourth quarter of 2018. We also paid $15 million to the Class B units in 2018 related to GTN's performance in 2017. In 2018, the 30% portion of GTN associated with the Class B units generated $40 million, $20 million above the threshold level which would normally be allocated to the Class B units. However, as a result of the 35% reduction in the common unit distribution, the allocation to the Class B units is similarly reduced, resulting in a $13 million allocation to the Class B units for 2018. This amount was paid to the Class B units in February of 2019.

Distributable cash flow was $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, $23 million higher than the corresponding quarter in 2017. The increase was due to the same factors that impacted adjusted earnings together with reduced distributions allocated to our General Partner as a result of the lower declared common unit distributions. For the year ended December 31, distributable cash flow amounted to $391 million, $81 million higher than the DCF of $310 million in 2017.

Turning to Slide 8, revenues from our consolidated pipelines in Q4 of 2018 were $111 million higher than the same quarter of 2017, $97 million of which was a result of the Bison cash proceeds from the termination of the two of its four transportation contracts. The payment was recorded as revenues as the contract terminations released Bison from providing any future services. Excluding the $97 million revenue proceeds from Bison's contract buyout, our revenues increased $14 million, largely due to the net effect of higher revenue from PNGTS from its Continent-to-Coast contracts and the Portland XPress Phase 1 contracts that began in November of 2018 and Higher net revenue from GTN from incremental long-term contracts associated with the increased available upstream capacity, partially offset by lower revenues from its short-term discretionary services compared to the prior period.

Equity earnings in the fourth quarter of 2018 were $7 million higher than the same quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher income at Great Lakes as a result of the elimination of Great Lakes's revenue sharing mechanism in 2018 as part of its 2017 settlement. Additionally, Great Lakes experienced an increase in seasonal sales during the current period. As noted earlier, the Partnership recorded a non-cash asset impairment charge of $537 million for Bison. The Q4 contract buyout coupled with the persistence of market conditions which have inhibited system flows on the pipeline and the uncertainty regarding Bison's ability to generate positive cash flows after the expiry of its remaining customer contracts in January of 2021, led us to determine that the asset's current carrying value was no longer indicative of an estimatable fair value. As a result, the non-cash impairment charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018.

We continue to explore alternative transportation-related options for Bison. Additionally, in connection with Tuscarora's annual goodwill impairment analysis, we evaluated Tuscarora's future revenues as well as changes to the other valuation assumptions, including Tuscarora's regulatory outcomes. As a result, it was determined that the fair value of Tuscarora was lower than its carrying value, including goodwill. In that regard, the Partnership recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $59 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and reduced our total consolidated goodwill balance from $130 million to $71 million.

Operating, maintenance, and administrative expenses during the fourth quarter were $1 million lower than in the same quarter in 2017 and our depreciation was comparable. Financial charges were also comparable in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus the same period in 2017. On an annual basis, the significant increase in equity earnings was largely the result of the addition of distributions of Iroquois for a full 12 months in 2018, as compared to only a seven-month period in 2017.

Moving now on to our financial position on Slide 9, our investment grade credit ratings provide us with the financial flexibility as we look to organically grow the portfolio in the future. We believe our ratings reflect our solid financial condition and outlook. The Partnership's liquidity position remains strong. The Partnership has $475 million of undrawn and available borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility as of February 21, 2018.

Consistent with our self-funding model, in order to build capacity for future organic growth, we continue to execute on our deleveraging program. In that regard, we used the cash savings from our reduced distributions and the funds from the Bison buyout to repay indebtedness, including the repayment of our $170 million term loan, resulting in a bank leverage ratio of approximately 3.1 times at December 31, 2018 and our distribution coverage remains healthy at 2.1 times for the fourth quarter of 2018, reflecting the positive operating performance of our assets during the period.

That concludes my remarks on the fourth quarter financial results. I'll now turn the call back over to Nathan.

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Thanks, Chuck. I'll now turn over to Slide 10. This has been a very good quarter for our Partnership. We made lots of progress on the regulatory front and returned our focus to other parts of the business. Our assets are performing very well and we remain confident that they are well situated to benefit from solid underlying market fundamentals and will continue to generate value for our unitholders well into the future. We have continued our proactive approach to managing our financial position over the past few months and are happy to report that our leverage ratio is now just over 3 times and our distribution coverage ratio is likewise healthy.

As we move into 2019, the annual regulatory impact to our revenue and cash flow of approximately $30 million negative will take effect. That, along with the loss of revenue from the Bison contracts bought-out in December will impact both our leverage and distribution coverage ratios. As such, going forward, we are targeting to maintain our leverage ratio in the low 4 times range and our distribution coverage in the 1.5 times area.

With this solid financial position, we reiterate that we have no plans to access the equity capital markets to fund our current growth program. Our focus remains on the optimization of our asset portfolio and we are working to secure the next wave of growth opportunities on our assets. These include organic growth projects on PNGTS such as our current Portland XPress and Westbrook XPress projects, as well as other potential future opportunities. All of these will be progressed in a very disciplined manner with near-term opportunity to size and sequence so that we are in a position to be self funding. We have a history of prudently managing our Partnership and are confident that our portfolio of crucial energy infrastructure assets will continue to generate solid financial results with opportunities for organic growth in high-quality, low-risk, value-creating projects for our unitholders.

I'll now turn the call back to Rhonda.

Rhonda Amundson -- Investor Relations

Thanks, Nathan. I'd now like to open the call up for questions. Sophie, please go ahead.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instruction) Our first question is from Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Please go ahead.

Shneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst

Hi, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to start off with Bison options you are exploring. You talked about potentially (technical difficulty) bidirectional gas option to get (technical difficulty) crude option. Can you expand on what you're looking at, how long it will take to a direction (technical difficulty) and so forth?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Thanks for the question, Shneur. It's Nathan. It's early days on any of those options, so we're not going to be leading with any specifics. I'd say it's part of the accounting decision that we made to write off the carrying value of the assets at Bison where in part because we can't really estimate what that's going to look like at this time. So, in specific, I'll say not much, but there's obviously a need for gas to exit the Bakken and so our reversal path is definitely an option. And as far as there's a liquid need or a need for transportation of liquids, we're looking for that option as well. So, apologies, I don't have any more specifics at this time.

If I was to look for signposts, would I be looking for an open season or would you (technical difficulty)

Sorry, your question broke up a little bit there. I lost you after signposts.

Shneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst

Yeah. In terms of signposts to look, would we be looking toward you announcing an open season to understand which direction you're going or would you give us different color (technical difficulty)

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

I think I caught a little bit more of your question, but I'd say we will announce things when and if we get commercial terms more solid.

Shneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst

Okay. And a final question. In the crude concept that you're thinking about, I mean, what size -- what kind of capacity would be involved if you were to actually (technical difficulty) Are we talking something very small or are we talking something very sizable?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Again, in any kind of liquid solution, it's early days in discussions with players in the region, but not anything else that we'd be disclosing right now.

Shneur Gershuni -- UBS -- Analyst

Great. All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate the color, guys.

Operator

Thank you. The next question is from TJ Schultz from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

TJ Schultz -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Hey, good morning. Just first on Westbrook XPress. What part of the cash flow is phased in in 2019 and then in Phase 2? And then you point to some approvals that are required there. Just any color on what you need to do to meet the right approvals?

Rhonda Amundson -- Investor Relations

Yeah. Both phases have the same rate attached to them, so it's pretty much 40% in Phase 1, 60% roughly in Phase 2. There will be -- necessary approvals will include obviously regulatory approvals from FERC both to import the gas to increase our firm certificated capacity and as well as to build the facilities that are planned for Westbrook. So we did file a FERC application for Phase 1 in December actually and that's going ahead. And we would anticipate that we'd be filing the facilities -- for the facilities construction toward the end of Q2 at this point. As well, of course, the shippers have various customary approvals that they will require, board approval in some cases, that sort of thing.

TJ Schultz -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay, thanks. And then on GTN, some of the, I think, expansion is subject to the West Gate export capabilities and I think you mentioned 0.5 Bcf, just any more color on timing to be able to make that decision and what costs should be or what needs to be done for that level of expansions?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Yeah. You pointed out the good constraint there. So it obviously has to be a package solution with added capacity out of the WCSB to then coordinate down GTN. I'd say our approach is a fairly new product in our design of what GTN is capable of doing, but that's going to have to go hand in glove with everything else upstream. So as that would come together, we'd be able to announce more, but it's again early days and it's highlighting the capability there.

TJ Schultz -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay, understood. Janine, I think you mentioned some benefits from some short-term services on some of your assets, I think, specifically to North Baja and PNGTS. What's the expectation there for some of those benefits to kind of continue into '19?

Janine Watson -- Vice President and General Manager

Well, I think that on North Baja the gas dynamic down there is shifting a little bit, but certainly 2018 was an unusual year for flowing gas into Southern California. So a lot of that gas was actually coming around and turning back up, flowing back into the US. That likely won't continue to the same level, but as the LNG process starts to firm up perhaps we will see further contracting in anticipation of that, as well as potentially some ability to expand the capacity of that line.

TJ Schultz -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay, understood. Go ahead.

Janine Watson -- Vice President and General Manager

Sorry, I was just reminded, you also asked about PNGTS. PNGTS has -- there is market opportunities that present themselves at various points, sometimes it's pretty seasonal and it's pretty weather driven. But it will continue to have some fair bit of interruptible capacity over the next few years, so depending on the market opportunities, if they are there, our marketing team is certainly poised to take advantage of them.

TJ Schultz -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay, great. Just last one. The bank leverage ratio at 3.1 times, can you just give me the bank debt and EBITDA that are used to calculate that?

William Morris -- Vice President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer

It's Chuck here. So, I'd have to get the details for you on that. Just hang on a sec. So certainly the bank leverage ratio is a little bit different than, I guess, the financial statement ratio just by virtue of the fact that there is some add backs associated with property tax. So, I guess, our leverage is sitting somewhere around the $2.0 billion range. And I'm just trying to find the EBITDA number for you. I might have to flip for that and get back to you.

TJ Schultz -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Then fine, I can follow up offline. Thanks, everyone.

Operator

Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Taylor from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.

Matthew Taylor -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt -- Analyst

Hey, everyone. Just one on capital allocation. So with regulatory decisions in hand now and more growth in the outer years, but with '19 cash flow expected to be a bit lower, when do you start thinking about restarting distribution growth or further delevering? Just want to know the dynamics there that you guys are thinking about.

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Yes. So we are definitely considering that and evaluating that continuously. I'd say, we look for prudent management out the curve of what we see on longer term run rates and certainly want to retain the capacity to fund these organic growth projects in real self funding manner. So we're balancing all of those going forward. I would say, as we've got more specific line of sight into cash flow spend on the near-term growth prospects we have in front of us as well as maybe a little bit finer point on other things out the curve within our pipeline assets portfolio, we will be firming that up and making that revaluation, but at this time we're fairly comfortable that the distribution ratio we've got, the distribution level we've got is sustainable for the foreseeable future.

Matthew Taylor -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt -- Analyst

Great. That's helpful context. Then just moving on to the FERC positions you've taken, I understand the 501-G filings use '17 numbers. So in some cases like Great Lakes where the LTFP wouldn't -- have been fully included, how are you guys thinking about potential for Section 5 there or longer term risks there or at least how should I be thinking about it?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Well, I think that the regular regulatory risk that you mentioned there is more back to status quo ante, if you will. So we're back to business as usual in managing that with our regulator and our customers as a normal course of thing. So to the extent we've got Section 5 risk, we always make all our efforts to mitigate those and be proactive as we go. But as that's a normal business risk that we've got, we certainly have -- our team is focused on it to go forward with the best possible result on the other side.

Matthew Taylor -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt -- Analyst

Yes, and to be fair, the $30 million then would just be on the filing positions taken to-date, correct?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Yes, it's correct based on where we are coming out at the other side of this 501-G process and as mentioned, what we'll be doing is, setting up going forward with what we really do think is a more positive position all else being equal, given there are some of the moratoriums that we have been able to negotiate and extend as we go through this process. So as part of the overall strategy, we ended up at the higher end of the range that we disclosed last quarter and part of that is a good value play that we see.

Matthew Taylor -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt -- Analyst

Yeah, that's great. And then maybe just one final one there on the $30 million impact. I would assume that would include equity earnings revisions, correct, for Northern Border and Great Lakes and actual EBITDA impact wouldn't be a bit larger?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Yes, that's correct. So that's all an impact for our share.

Matthew Taylor -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt -- Analyst

Thanks. That's it for me.

Operator

Thank you. The next question is from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Yes, hey, guys, congrats on a good quarter. Two questions for you. First of all, how should investors think about what the maximum expansion potential is for the PNGTS? I'm just trying to think about how much more incremental additions you could possibly bolt on over the next four or five years on to that system?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

I don't think we've disclosed any sort of engineering maximums that we'd put out there, but there is possibility for expansion. As PNGTS sits right now configured, it doesn't have any midpoint compression of its own. It runs off of compression that it receives north of the border and then on shared facilities at Westbrook which we're enhancing now. But along the line, there is expandability through additional compression. And in terms of absolute volumes, I wouldn't be able to give you a number.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it. And also what happens now -- just when you're thinking about Baja and the potential for LNG, what are the kind of the milestones or what are the things investors should keep their eyes on just to kind of get a view of whether this is real? I mean, is this all related to just one specific project? Are you thinking about others in the hopper?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

At this point, we're looking at more generally. As we saw here this past year, when there is disruption in the normal flow of gas in Southern California, North Baja came through and was able to fill some need down there. So as that region and that geography develops and what it's going to be doing with gas flows, we think there's an opportunity for North Baja to step in with the right of way in some fairly cheap expandability through additional compression. It's there ready to serve at a certain volume level pretty straight away and from there, we obviously have our business development minds working on a larger solution as well.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The next question is from Alex Kania from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.

Alex Kania -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Hi, good morning. Just I guess two questions. First is on the maintenance CapEx number of, I think, $97 million for 2019. Do you see that as a number that persists going forward or is that just a near-term one-time type of number where sustainably may fall back toward where it was more in 2018?

Nathan Brown -- President and Director

Well, unfortunately I don't want to give too much guidance on that one. Depending on what we've got on throughput on our systems that can -- that level can be higher. I wouldn't say it would be any persistent at a particular level. We've got some of our major spend particularly with compressor overhauls that are very cyclical. So those can tend to come in waves just depending on how the hours come out on our units. So that's something that's a component we may see more or less of in any one given year. We also look at what requirements we have and programs we'd put in place for pipeline integrity. It's another driver of those dollars that we spend. And those come and go as we work through those program cyclically. So unfortunately I wouldn't be able to say that's a given run rate or peg a run rate going forward, but we will continue to keep update on activities as it become material.

Alex Kania -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Great. Thanks.

Fuelled by social media, the protests have revealed the depth of anger over the rising cost of living and the alleged disappearance of billions of dollars from PetroCaribe — an oil subsidy program intended to help the impoverished Haitian people.

Gilbert Mibrambeau Jr. is seen in this undated handout photo. Mirambeau Jr. is holding up a handwritten cardboard sign written in Creole that reads: ""Where is the PetroCaribe money?"" ( Gilbert Mibrambeau Jr. / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

Mirambeau, a Haitian-Canadian filmmaker who divides his time between the two countries, said he was in Canada last summer when he became fascinated by the debate on social media over the alleged mismanagement of the PetroCaribe fund, a 2005 pact under which Venezuela provided oil to Caribbean nations with long-term, low-interest financing. The savings on oil were supposed to be used to fund economic and social programs, but Mirambeau and many Haitians say it disappeared into the pockets of government officials, who spent it on extravagant luxuries such as mansions, casinos, and cars. “I was witnessing this, and the whole night I couldn’t sleep,” said Mirambeau, who donned a blindfold in the picture to symbolize justice. “I had to play my part, in a sense.”

Mirambeau, 35, said his message was posted about a month after government fuel hikes in July 2018 spurred riots among a population struggling to pay for basic staples. It was retweeted by a popular rapper and actor, and other Haitians quickly joined in, using the hashtag #petrocaribechallenge. Mirambeau became part of a loose coalition of leaders and activists involved in organizing a series of protests, each designed to take place on a significant date in Haiti’s history. Since last year, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest corruption and demand the resignation of the country’s president, Jovenel Moise. “Social media played a big part because we could point fingers at the senators, deputies, state members, and it was in their face,” he said. The most recent uprisings, which began Feb. 7, led to the Canadian government issuing a travel warning for Haiti. More than 100 Canadians had to be airlifted to the airport last week to avoid blockades along the country’s highways, where armed protesters threw rocks, fired weapons and set fire to burning tires during sometimes violent protests. Mirambeau blamed the violence on gang members infiltrating what is a peaceful movement. “The movement is not violent,” he said. “You had a million people in the street, and they could have destroyed everything, but they were not violent.”

He said Haitians are fed up after years of alleged corruption by authorities, whom he says have largely mismanaged the PetroCaribe money and the billions of dollars designed to help the country recover from a 2010 earthquake that decimated the country’s infrastructure. “What we feel is more than rage,” he said. “It’s social apartheid. You have the government on the side making money with our taxes and money.”

A Haitian Senate investigation has alleged embezzlement by at least 14 former officials in ex-president Michel Martelly’s administration, but no one has been charged. Late last week, Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Henry Ceant vowed to deepen the probe into spending of the estimated $3.8 billion Haiti received as part of the oil program — one of a raft of measures aimed at quelling the protests. Jean-Claude Icart, a researcher with the Quebec-based aid partnership Concertation pour Haiti, said Mirambeau’s tweet played a role in sparking the protests, which appear to have eased since the prime minister’s speech. Icart said that for the protests to stop, the government will have to take concrete steps to improve living conditions and reduce food insecurity. “The misery is becoming unbearable, and people who are hopeless, you don’t know what they’re going to do,” he said in a phone interview. Pascal Paradis, the executive director of Lawyers Without Borders Canada, said he sees reason for hope in the protest movement’s demand for justice, led by young people such as Mirambeau. “The fight against impunity needs to start with civil society,” he said. Mirambeau, meanwhile, says the protests will continue until those responsible for the missing PetroCaribe funds are tried and convicted. He rules out running for office himself, but he hopes his generation will produce leaders to run in the next elections and eventually reform Haiti’s government, including the constitution. “It needs to start with us,” he said. “We are the change.”",How a Haitian-Canadian’s message helped fuel an uprising,Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/02/22/how-a-haitian-canadians-message-helped-fuel-an-uprising.html
89,Empty,2019-02-24T11:00:00Z,"Negative campaigns have had success, but a vision of something bigger and better is proving difficult to defeat.","It has become a basic truth among a generation of campaigners who grew up with social media that the only campaign strategy and tactics that deliver votes are nasty. Starting with the Harris government, continuing through the Harper years, to their several provincial cousins today — some of different parties — campaign planning today is devoted more to wrecking strategies directed at the personal reputations of opponents, than to how they would improve Canadians lives.

The federal leaders of Canada’s three major parties, from left: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “Many voters, young and old, choose their horse based on shrewd observation of who seems authentic and which leader they believe has the ability to defend their interests best. Other than hard partisans, many fewer choose who delivers the best insults,” writes Robin V. Sears. ( Norma Zminkowska )

Sadly, it often works, as its champions often brag. We appear to be on the verge of sliding into yet one more election campaign marked by anger, vituperation and insult. But examining political history paints a somewhat less gloomy alternative approach. The biggest, boldest, most optimistic vision has often overcome the venomous. Mulroney trounced Turner, Layton romped through Quebec, and Justin Trudeau crushed his opponents. In each case their messages where of a bigger and better Canada, against a gloomier, dystopic vision buttressed by nasty sound bites and, these days, sensational clickbait tweets. Even in the U.S. it’s useful to consider how campaigns of animus did against those of other more visionary leaders. Not to give the Trump aberration more credit than it is due, we might recall that Reagan/Carter, Clinton/Dole, Obama/McCain were all matchups that went to the sunnier visions. A Biden/Trump matchup might have turned out differently, too.

Article Continued Below

Justin Trudeau can hardly campaign on sunny ways again, without being laughed at. But he can still articulate a confident progressive agenda, and not mud-wrestle with Scheer in the political ditch each day. Despite his unhappy few months, when Jagmeet Singh enters the House of Commons next month he should be able to convey his message of inclusion, optimism and a bold vision for Canada, and still be tough in Question Period. Those were the messages that won him the leadership, in part echoing the Layton’s “love over fear” mission, and partly referencing his own life story as proof of what is possible in a Canada that dreams big. Unless they have a change of heart over the summer, it seems clear that the Scheer campaign strategy will be grounded first in sneering at the Trudeau failures — most clearly now SNC-Lavalin. He will be challenged from the right by the nasty identitarian politics of Max Bernier. Even including a subtheme of the old-time American conservative fairy tale — lower taxes, better service and smaller government, all funded by the “billions and billions” of dollars of waste and corruption in Ottawa — he will be pushed to attack first and always. With two articulate progressive visions opposing him, he might be wiser to return to Conservative “big message” politics. Liberal failure to deliver is obviously fair game, but how will Scheer make Canadians’ lives better? Singh’s vulnerability will be in the numbers — polling, funds raised and strong new candidates recruited. But voters across the Western world have confounded pundits time and again in recent years, swinging from one pole to a widely distant one in a single leap, not always in response to incitement politics.

Macron smashed the left and right with a “new France” vision. However delusionary you may believe his program, Jeremy Corbyn almost defeated British Conservatives with a big change agenda. Democrats are rolling out very bold — perhaps, overly so — visions for America. Many voters, young and old, choose their horse based on shrewd observation of who seems authentic and which leader they believe has the ability to defend their interests best. Other than hard partisans, many fewer choose who delivers the best insults.

Thirtysomethings have shown their faith in a bigger, fairer, greener Canada in the past two federal elections. That does not seem to have ebbed. The twentysomethings are always harder to read because of turnout, but we know that when they do vote, it is less often a response to attack politics than to a bigger vision for their futures. So, to each of the party strategists: Don’t put all your money on how mean and tough you can look. Canadians respect and do vote for leaders with bolder visions too. Robin V.

Security, Americas

America Shouldn't Invade Venezuela

Venezuela has been in crisis for years. Now President Donald Trump has made Venezuela’s problems America’s problems.

Two decades ago Hugo Chávez successfully challenged a collectivist, kleptocratic political system which enriched the country’s elite. But he created a quasi-dictatorship staffed by Cuban security agents and wrecked the economy by imposing real socialism and handing control to corrupt apparatchiks. Chávez even destroyed the state petroleum company by turning it into a lucrative source of patronage.

The situation deteriorated further under Chávez’s successor, President Nicolás Maduro. Today both food and medicine are increasingly difficult to find. Even Venezuela’s poor, who propelled Chávez into power, have given up on his bungling, charisma-challenged successor.

Last year President Trump threatened to invade Venezuela. He backed down, but recently launched a vigorous campaign for regime change through diplomatic and economic pressure. America’s great hope is in opposition leader Juan Guaidó, President of the National Assembly, who declared himself to be Venezuela’s legitimate president. If Guaidó’s campaign fails, war remains “an option,” declared the president.

That might be a bluff, intended to intimidate Maduro and his supporters. However, if President Trump is serious, the consequences could be disastrous for both Venezuela and the United States.

The former is a tragedy on multiple levels. Like many Latin American political systems, it long enshrined great economic injustice. In 1992 Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chávez staged a coup. Despite some popular support it failed and he was imprisoned. But he was soon pardoned and in 1998 was elected president, serving until his death in 2013.

His “Bolivarian Revolution” was authoritarian and socialist, with predictable results. Mass nationalization, uncontrolled spending, and political interference ensured long-term economic disaster. For a time oil revenue funded social programs, sustaining popular support. He also shared his regime’s largesse overseas—providing subsidized petroleum shipments to Cuba’s Castro dictatorship, for instance. However, oil revenue declined as his maladministration hobbled PDVSA, the state-run energy company, and petroleum prices dropped.

Vice President Maduro replaced Chávez, but the Maduro lacked any hint of charisma or competence. The economy was cut by half over his six years in power and is expected to shrink another quarter this year alone. The latest annual inflation estimate—the regime stopped releasing economic statistics—is an incredible 1.7 million percent. Nine out of ten people fall below the poverty line. Stores are empty. Every day 80,000 people cross into Colombia seeking provisions. An expectant mother turned border street vendor explained: “in Venezuela there is nothing.” Yet President Maduro rejected offers of humanitarian aid, insisting that there is no crisis and “we are not beggars.” So far some three million people, a tenth of the population, have fled, and more are leaving every day.

Four out of five Venezuelans, including even many “Chavistas” and working-class supporters of Chávez’s “Bolivarian Revolution,” want him gone. Maduro maintains control through increasing repression and electoral manipulation. His last lines of defense are his core allies (who in recent years have looted the economy to the tune of $350 billion), his puppets in the National Assembly, and a thousand-plus Cuban operatives, long embedded in his government.

Maduro should go. Actually, straight to jail. But the Trump administration-led campaign seems designed to fail.

Even successful regime change won’t necessarily turn out well. By one count, Washington pursued sixty-eight attempts at regime change in different countries since 1945. Most failed, and even successful operations often yielded dubious results.

But getting rid of Maduro won’t be easy. Washington lacks credibility as a disinterested actor dedicated to the good of the Venezuelan people. Alas, Americans well-earned their reputation for “Yankee imperialism” through more than a century of military intervention in Latin America. Skeptics of Washington’s purported humanitarian intentions point to Venezuela’s 301 billion barrel oil reserves as a rich prize for American companies. Even many critics of Maduro do not back the U.S. campaign to oust the incumbent regime: a poll last month found 78 percent of Venezuelans opposed international intervention.

Threats of war have intensified regional skepticism. James Stavridis, the former North Atlantic Treaty Organization Supreme Allied Commander, said, “everywhere I went as a four-star Admiral in [Latin America] while commanding U.S Southern Command, I would be reminded of America’s history of intervention.” Even Brazil and Colombia were “deeply suspicious” of the creation of the Fourth Fleet in 2008, which was seen not as a tool for use in such tasks as drug interdiction and humanitarian relief, but as “a return to gunboat diplomacy and a prelude to military action in Venezuela.”

By taking the lead, the Trump administration has become an issue. Rallying people against outside pressure is a time-honored international tactic, especially by populist Latin American regimes. Some Venezuelans will choose local thugs over foreign meddlers. Moreover, Washington’s high-profile effort has encouraged Russia and China to rally to Maduro’s side. Their support will be limited but could help the regime survive.

Indeed, the administration will undermine attempts to employ the rule of international law in other cases. The U.S. claim that it is justified in breaking international rules, argued Representative Ro Khanna (D-Cal.), “is the same argument that led to U.S. blunders in Iraq, Honduras, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. Again and again, there is no respect for the United Nations Charter that makes it illegal under international law to seek regime change.”

Washington hopes to starve the Venezuelan people. The Trump administration sanctioned PDVSA to dry up oil revenues keeping the government and country afloat. (Petroleum sales provide more than 95 percent of Venezuela’s export earnings.) The Trump administration also turned Venezuelan state property over to the nascent Guaidó “government.”

Unfortunately, tougher economic controls are unlikely to force the regime to yield. Reducing the Maduro regime’s money will hurt it, but probably not enough to cripple it. Sanctions also will reduce funds available for the Venezuelan public, since the government controls most trade. However, Maduro and his allies will take care of themselves first. Complained Jose Bodas, an anti-Maduro union leader: “The rich will not stop getting richer, it’s the workers who will shoulder the cost of these measures.”

Starving the already suffering, whose vigorous opposition so far has failed to budge the regime, in hopes of fomenting a more effective uprising is a dubious strategy on both practical and moral grounds. Luis Vicente Leon, who heads the political consulting firm Datanalisis, said: “If this strategy isn’t successful quickly, the effect on the people will be devastating.” Unsurprisingly, eight of ten Venezuelans oppose U.S. sanctions.

Washington hopes that Maduro’s backers will end his reign, but their survival is tied to his. Most importantly, the military leadership, which Chávez transformed after the short-lived coup against him in 2002, has prospered along with the regime. Even if the Chavista elite decided to send Maduro packing, there is no reason to believe it would hand the keys to the kingdom to Guaidó or organize free elections.

Regime fractures might lead to civil war, with multiple contending factions. The outcome is impossible to predict. Although Guaidó unexpectedly unified the highly fractious opposition, he leans toward the socialist end of the economic spectrum. Some groups on the right complain that his Popular Will party is a member of the Socialist International. A bloody collapse might satisfy the Trump administration but could intensify the suffering of the Venezuelan population.

If the administration fails to oust Maduro through diplomacy and sanctions, it will suffer a major public relations embarrassment. Warned Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and former Obama administration official Ben Rhodes: “Chest-thumping declarations that melt away over time weaken American power and credibility.” But Washington has no apparent alternative if the Maduro regime doesn’t fold. Worried Michael Shifter of the Inter-American Dialogue: “My concern is whether they’ve boxed themselves in.” An impasse would encourage the president to act militarily.

Yet nothing justifies war. Vice President Mike Pence recently declared that “For the sake of our vital interests, and for the sake of the Venezuelan people, America will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.” However, what vital American interest can he identify? There is none.

Admiral Craig Faller, head of the United State Southern Command, announced that “We are prepared to protect U.S. lives and protect the diplomatic facility in Venezuela.” However, Washington is keeping American diplomats on station as an explicit provocation. The Maduro government ordered U.S. personnel home, but the administration refused to comply. Washington may hope for an incident to justify military action. There also has been talk of using American military forces to move humanitarian aid into Venezuela, daring the Maduro government to block the effort. This would constitute the foreign policy equivalent of entrapment, enticing Caracas to take a step providing a casus belli.

Moreover, Fernando Cutz, who formerly served on the staff of the National Security Council, argued: “I don’t think you can underestimate the threat of a failed state very close to our borders.” Venezuela’s crisis certainly is bad for the country’s South American neighbors. However, the United States would hardly notice. Would millions of refugees swim the Caribbean and overrun Florida? Would al-Qaeda set up shop in anarchic Caracas? War-happy American officials routinely claim “vital interests” where none exist.

The Venezuelan people are suffering, but so are the peoples of Eritrea, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea, Egypt, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Yemen, Myanmar, Zimbabwe, and many more nations. Ironically, Washington supports, aids, and comforts the oppressor in several of these cases. In others, the Trump administration simply ignores friends acting badly. Nothing occurring in Venezuela justifies America embarking upon another war of choice.

Fear that the administration is inclined toward war caused Senate Democrats to insist that any resolution backing Guaidó include explicit disapproval of U.S. military action. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fl.) refused the accept the measure with such a prohibition. “The U.S. always reserves the right on use force and protect its own national security interest and the interest of its personnel. So anything that would run counter to that would be problematic.” But he is being disingenuous since he routinely treats military action as a first resort.

Venezuela’s Guaidó suggested that he might come to welcome, even “authorize,” U.S. military action, though that “is not the form we hope for and believe in.” He also suggested that all options are on the table, the standard mantra of American officials who threaten war, and later argued that if the Maduro government blocked delivery of outside aid, that military intervention would be warranted under the UN “responsibility to protect” doctrine. However, as Representative Ro Khanna (D-Ca.) responded: “Mr. Guaidó, you can proclaim yourself leader of Venezuela but you don’t get to authorize U.S. military interventions. Only the U.S. Congress can do that. We will not.” And it should not.

Initiating another war of choice simply because the United States could do so would further unbalance American foreign policy. These days policymakers find it difficult to resist the temptation to use America’s overwhelming military power even though consequences are routinely ill. War should be a genuine last resort.

Secretary of State and later President John Quincy Adams appeared to foresee our world when he warned Americans not to go “abroad, in search of monsters to destroy” lest they risk their nation’s soul. The U.S. “might become the dictatress of the world” and “be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.” Which would be too high a price to pay.

The president appears to believe that an invasion would be easy, last year arguing that “It’s a regime that frankly could be toppled very quickly by the military, if the military decides to do that.” But believing the next war to be a cakewalk is a far too common mistake made by overly-optimistic political leaders. Most wars turn out far different and more costly than expected. For instance, in 1812 House Speaker Henry Clay declared that conquering Canada would be “a mere matter of marching.” More than two centuries later, of course, America’s northern neighbor remains free.

The only recent Latin American precedent was the 1989 invasion of Panama. However, circumstances were significantly different: a much smaller nation, ruled by a dictator with little popular backing, containing the U.S.-constructed canal long controlled by Washington. American troops already were stationed there, and the local government had killed several U.S. civilians.

The Maduro regime obviously would lose any conflict. Its armed services have suffered from years of economic crisis. Chávez purged potentially dissident officers in order to coup-proof the military, meaning trustworthiness trumped competence. Moreover, the army became a source of patronage and bulges with useless generals.

Nevertheless, there are capable units—special forces, airborne, and counter-insurgency, for instance. Admiral Faller told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Venezuelan military, though a “degraded force,” nevertheless “remains loyal to Maduro—and that makes it dangerous.” Moreover, the civil militia has an official membership of 1.6 million. Just last month 86 percent of Venezuelans said they opposed foreign military action. Invaders might not find themselves hailed as liberators even by those hoping for an end to Maduro’s misrule.

Urban resistance could prove difficult to quell, especially by soldiers dispersed into guerrilla units. Resistance also could turn into a civil war, further inflaming social divisions which would make fixing Venezuela even tougher. Having broken Venezuela with an invasion, America would feel great pressure to occupy and rebuild it.

Through this process, the Chavistas might shift blame for their misrule onto their new occupiers. Washington would own the results of its war. American support would undermine the new government’s legitimacy. And ousting Maduro would not resolve the underlying political conflicts which triggered Chávez’s rise. Overall, the costs of exercising the military option are obvious; the benefits less so.

Unfortunately, as time passes Washington appears to have another potential foreign policy debacle in the making. Guaidó’s announcement led to expectations of a speedy denouement: sanctions would crush the regime, military elites would defect and defenestrate Maduro, Chavista elites would accept the offer of amnesty and depart, and a new regime would emerge, fulfilling American objectives. Increasingly a peaceful U.S. victory appears unlikely.

Alas, no one, it seems, has an alternative approach. Reported Bloomberg: “U.S. policymakers and those around Guaidó—as well as leaders in Brazil and Colombia—are eying one another and worrying about failure. Officials in each camp have said privately they assumed the others had a more developed strategy.”

Evidently not. The situation would have the makings of comedy sitcom if the stakes weren’t so high. So now what?

Washington should lower its expectations and step back, leaving regime transformation to Venezuelans and their neighbors. Most important, President Trump should keep the troops at home. Simón Bolívar, the heroic revolutionary who liberated Venezuela from Spain, long ago intoned: “when tyranny becomes law, rebellion is a right.” But in this case, that right should be exercised by Venezuelans, not Americans.

Now President Donald Trump has made Venezuela’s problems America’s problems.

Two decades ago Hugo Chávez successfully challenged a collectivist, kleptocratic political system which enriched the country’s elite. But he created a quasi-dictatorship staffed by Cuban security agents and wrecked the economy by imposing real socialism and handing control to corrupt apparatchiks. Chávez even destroyed the state petroleum company by turning it into a lucrative source of patronage.

The situation deteriorated further under Chávez’s successor, President Nicolás Maduro. Today both food and medicine are increasingly difficult to find. Even Venezuela’s poor, who propelled Chávez into power, have given up on his bungling, charisma-challenged successor.

Last year President Trump threatened to invade Venezuela. He backed down, but recently launched a vigorous campaign for regime change through diplomatic and economic pressure. America’s great hope is in opposition leader Juan Guaidó, President of the National Assembly, who declared himself to be Venezuela’s legitimate president. If Guaidó’s campaign fails, war remains “an option,” declared the president.

That might be a bluff, intended to intimidate Maduro and his supporters. However, if President Trump is serious, the consequences could be disastrous for both Venezuela and the United States.

Washington should lower its expectations and step back, leaving regime transformation to Venezuelans and their neighbors.

The former is a tragedy on multiple levels. Like many Latin American political systems, it long enshrined great economic injustice. In 1992 Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chávez staged a coup. Despite some popular support it failed and he was imprisoned. But he was soon pardoned and in 1998 was elected president, serving until his death in 2013.

His “Bolivarian Revolution” was authoritarian and socialist, with predictable results. Mass nationalization, uncontrolled spending, and political interference ensured long-term economic disaster. For a time oil revenue funded social programs, sustaining popular support. He also shared his regime’s largesse overseas—providing subsidized petroleum shipments to Cuba’s Castro dictatorship, for instance. However, oil revenue declined as his maladministration hobbled PDVSA, the state-run energy company, and petroleum prices dropped.

Vice President Maduro replaced Chávez, but the Maduro lacked any hint of charisma or competence. The economy was cut by half over his six years in power and is expected to shrink another quarter this year alone. The latest annual inflation estimate—the regime stopped releasing economic statistics—is an incredible 1.7 million percent. Nine out of ten people fall below the poverty line. Stores are empty. Every day 80,000 people cross into Colombia seeking provisions. An expectant mother turned border street vendor explained: “in Venezuela there is nothing.” Yet President Maduro rejected offers of humanitarian aid, insisting that there is no crisis and “we are not beggars.” So far some three million people, a tenth of the population, have fled, and more are leaving every day.

Four out of five Venezuelans, including even many “Chavistas” and working-class supporters of Chávez’s “Bolivarian Revolution,” want him gone. Maduro maintains control through increasing repression and electoral manipulation. His last lines of defense are his core allies (who in recent years have looted the economy to the tune of $350 billion), his puppets in the National Assembly, and a thousand-plus Cuban operatives, long embedded in his government.

Maduro should go. Actually, straight to jail. But the Trump administration-led campaign seems designed to fail.

Even successful regime change won’t necessarily turn out well. By one count, Washington pursued sixty-eight attempts at regime change in different countries since 1945. Most failed, and even successful operations often yielded dubious results.

But getting rid of Maduro won’t be easy. Washington lacks credibility as a disinterested actor dedicated to the good of the Venezuelan people. Alas, Americans well-earned their reputation for “Yankee imperialism” through more than a century of military intervention in Latin America. Skeptics of Washington’s purported humanitarian intentions point to Venezuela’s 301 billion barrel oil reserves as a rich prize for American companies. Even many critics of Maduro do not back the U.S. campaign to oust the incumbent regime: a poll last month found 78 percent of Venezuelans opposed international intervention.

Threats of war have intensified regional skepticism. James Stavridis, the former North Atlantic Treaty Organization Supreme Allied Commander, said, “everywhere I went as a four-star Admiral in [Latin America] while commanding U.S Southern Command, I would be reminded of America’s history of intervention.” Even Brazil and Colombia were “deeply suspicious” of the creation of the Fourth Fleet in 2008, which was seen not as a tool for use in such tasks as drug interdiction and humanitarian relief, but as “a return to gunboat diplomacy and a prelude to military action in Venezuela.”

By taking the lead, the Trump administration has become an issue. Rallying people against outside pressure is a time-honored international tactic, especially by populist Latin American regimes. Some Venezuelans will choose local thugs over foreign meddlers. Moreover, Washington’s high-profile effort has encouraged Russia and China to rally to Maduro’s side. Their support will be limited but could help the regime survive.

Indeed, the administration will undermine attempts to employ the rule of international law in other cases. The U.S. claim that it is justified in breaking international rules, argued Representative Ro Khanna (D-Cal.), “is the same argument that led to U.S. blunders in Iraq, Honduras, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. Again and again, there is no respect for the United Nations Charter that makes it illegal under international law to seek regime change.”

Washington hopes to starve the Venezuelan people. The Trump administration sanctioned PDVSA to dry up oil revenues keeping the government and country afloat. (Petroleum sales provide more than 95 percent of Venezuela’s export earnings.) The Trump administration also turned Venezuelan state property over to the nascent Guaidó “government.”

Unfortunately, tougher economic controls are unlikely to force the regime to yield. Reducing the Maduro regime’s money will hurt it, but probably not enough to cripple it. Sanctions also will reduce funds available for the Venezuelan public, since the government controls most trade. However, Maduro and his allies will take care of themselves first. Complained Jose Bodas, an anti-Maduro union leader: “The rich will not stop getting richer, it’s the workers who will shoulder the cost of these measures.”

Starving the already suffering, whose vigorous opposition so far has failed to budge the regime, in hopes of fomenting a more effective uprising is a dubious strategy on both practical and moral grounds. Luis Vicente Leon, who heads the political consulting firm Datanalisis, said: “If this strategy isn’t successful quickly, the effect on the people will be devastating.” Unsurprisingly, eight of ten Venezuelans oppose U.S. sanctions.

Washington hopes that Maduro’s backers will end his reign, but their survival is tied to his. Most importantly, the military leadership, which Chávez transformed after the short-lived coup against him in 2002, has prospered along with the regime. Even if the Chavista elite decided to send Maduro packing, there is no reason to believe it would hand the keys to the kingdom to Guaidó or organize free elections.

Regime fractures might lead to civil war, with multiple contending factions. The outcome is impossible to predict. Although Guaidó unexpectedly unified the highly fractious opposition, he leans toward the socialist end of the economic spectrum. Some groups on the right complain that his Popular Will party is a member of the Socialist International. A bloody collapse might satisfy the Trump administration but could intensify the suffering of the Venezuelan population.

If the administration fails to oust Maduro through diplomacy and sanctions, it will suffer a major public relations embarrassment. Warned Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and former Obama administration official Ben Rhodes: “Chest-thumping declarations that melt away over time weaken American power and credibility.” But Washington has no apparent alternative if the Maduro regime doesn’t fold. Worried Michael Shifter of the Inter-American Dialogue: “My concern is whether they’ve boxed themselves in.” An impasse would encourage the president to act militarily.

Yet nothing justifies war. Vice President Mike Pence recently declared that “For the sake of our vital interests, and for the sake of the Venezuelan people, America will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.” However, what vital American interest can he identify? There is none.

Admiral Craig Faller, head of the United State Southern Command, announced that “We are prepared to protect U.S. lives and protect the diplomatic facility in Venezuela.” However, Washington is keeping American diplomats on station as an explicit provocation. The Maduro government ordered U.S. personnel home, but the administration refused to comply. Washington may hope for an incident to justify military action. There also has been talk of using American military forces to move humanitarian aid into Venezuela, daring the Maduro government to block the effort. This would constitute the foreign policy equivalent of entrapment, enticing Caracas to take a step providing a casus belli.

Moreover, Fernando Cutz, who formerly served on the staff of the National Security Council, argued: “I don’t think you can underestimate the threat of a failed state very close to our borders.” Venezuela’s crisis certainly is bad for the country’s South American neighbors. However, the United States would hardly notice. Would millions of refugees swim the Caribbean and overrun Florida? Would al-Qaeda set up shop in anarchic Caracas? War-happy American officials routinely claim “vital interests” where none exist.

The Venezuelan people are suffering, but so are the peoples of Eritrea, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea, Egypt, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Yemen, Myanmar, Zimbabwe, and many more nations. Ironically, Washington supports, aids, and comforts the oppressor in several of these cases. In others, the Trump administration simply ignores friends acting badly. Nothing occurring in Venezuela justifies America embarking upon another war of choice.

Fear that the administration is inclined toward war caused Senate Democrats to insist that any resolution backing Guaidó include explicit disapproval of U.S. military action. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fl.) refused the accept the measure with such a prohibition. “The U.S. always reserves the right on use force and protect its own national security interest and the interest of its personnel.

As Nigerians go to the polls today to elect their next president and representatives in the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has assured them that the votes they cast will determine the outcome of the elections.

The chairman of the commission, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, gave the assurance while speaking at the fifth and final briefing of the media and observers since the postponement of the elections last Saturday.

Yakubu had earlier noted that recommendations by international observers in the previous elections were being implemented, saying the adoption of Simultaneous Accreditation and Voting System for today's election is part of them.

He stated that the commission would continue with the system of simultaneous accreditation and voting which it used in the conduct of the 194 off-season elections, adding that it is now part of the election guidelines.

While calling on Nigerians to conduct themselves peacefully, Yakubu said the commission had no favourite candidates in the elections, adding that only people with Permanent Voter's Cards (PVCs) will vote.

... It's D-Day For PMB, Atiku, Others

... Battleground states identified

Today is the long awaited day that both Nigerians and the international community have been looking forward to for the country to choose its next political leaders at the federal level.

Millions of Nigerians will vote today to elect a president, 109 senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives.

In effect, it is D-Day for President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the two main contenders for the nation's top job.

Political analysts are of the view that today's elections will be the most keenly contested in the history of the country.

There is heightened anxiety following the one-week postponement of the general elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) last week. As a result the presidential and the National Assembly elections hold today while governorship, State Assembly and FCT Area Council elections come up on March 9.

A call election by this newspaper a fortnight ago had tipped President Buhari to win the election handily with 60 per cent of the vote, with a five per cent margin of error in the prediction.

In the just concluded presidential campaigns, the two major candidates campaigned vigorously across the country. The president exceeded all expectations, campaigning across the 36 states of the federation, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), despite concerns raised about his health.

The opposition had earlier called on the president to resign because of his of purported Ill-health.

Hinged on the slogan, 'Next Level', President Buhari's campaign was premised on his 2015 promises - fighting corruption, reviving the economy and addressing security matters.

On the other hand, Atiku Abubakar released a policy document with a focus on 'getting Nigeria working again', which is his official slogan.

It is worthy of note that, unlike in 2015, the political temperature is mild and the reasons are not far-fetched. In 2015, the presidential poll was seen as a contest between the North and the South, but in today's election, both Buhari and Atiku are Northerners, Muslims and Fulanis. Both candidates are also septuagenarians.

Tension caused by religion and ethnicity, the country's fault lines usually exacerbated by politicians for selfish gains, is missing in the election, translating to fewer cases of violence, threats and counter threats by the major actors now unlike in 2015.

The strengths of President Buhari are integrity and character, popularity among the Northern masses, frugality with state resources, infrastructural achievements and trustworthiness.

On the other hand, Buhari's weaknesses are allegations of allowing a cabal hijack his government, poor handling of the economy, allegations of cronyism and nepotism, poor handling of the farmers/herdsmen clashes and allegations of one-sided anti-corruption fight.

The strong points to Atiku candidacy are his supposed knowledge of the economy; that he is successful businessman; that he has the ability to assembly a crack team, and that he is a known restructuring advocate, which resonates with a large number of Nigerians.

However, he is seen as weak on corruption, will run an elitist government, has trust issues, and that he carries PDP baggage of looting the economy into recession.

A total of 72,775,502 million Nigerians have collected their PCVs in the 36 states and the FCT. With 774 local government areas and 2,642 political wards in the country where voting will take place, the 2019 general elections in Nigeria will be the largest election on the African continent.

Before last Saturday's postponement of the election, INEC chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, had announced that 73 presidential candidates would be in the ballot, but two days ago 12 of them withdrew from the race and gave their support to the incumbent, President Buhari.

In terms of voting population based on the number of PVCs collected, LEADERSHIP Weekend reports that among the six geo-political zones of the country, North-West leads, followed by South-West, North-Central, South-South, North-East and South-East in that order.

Checks show that Buhari and Atiku will have a keen battle in Lagos, Kano, Kaduna, Katsina, Oyo, Ogun, Bauchi, Delta, Rivers and Plateau states, which are the states with the highest number of voters.

In Yobe State, it was gathered that some may not vote because of threats of attacks by the Boko Haram terrorists.

A report released by the Election Analysis Centre of the Centre for Democracy Development said attacks by armed bandits might threaten the conduct of the elections in Kaduna State, even though the state governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, has said that the state is safe for election to take place.

In Kwara State, the activities of thugs and hoodlums which have led to the killing of people in recent times have been identified as a major threat to the election in certain areas while in Ondo, Ekiti and Osun states, vote buying could pose a serious setback to the process.

It was gathered that there will be serious battle for votes especially in Lagos State which has the highest number of PVCs collected.

Observers said Lagos, which has been a state for keen contests in both in the gubernatorial and the presidential elections since 1999, would witness a similar incident in the 2019 general elections. While many believe it will be a smooth ride for the APC, others argue that the factionalisation of the APC in the state, coupled with the fact that the incumbent governor was denied a return ticket might tell on APC votes.

Kano State has always been a nest of bulk support for President Muhammadu Buhari, with the status of second largest voting population in the country. However, with former Kano State governor Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso moving to the PDP with his multitude of supporters in the Kwakwansiya Movement, it may not be plain sailing for President Buhari this time around.

It is believed that Buhari who won Kaduna and Katsina states last time is likely to retain the states even thought there might be an incursion by the PDP candidate, especially some groups in the two states that were not happy with the federal appointments made by the present administration.

In Oyo State, the APC is likely to take the day by some fractions while Plateau State is likely to go according to the yearnings of the Northern minorities.

But after thorough deliberations lasting several hours, analysts at the Centre of Democracy and Development's Election Analysis Centre (EAC) have suggested 10 key states which will play a significant role in shaping who becomes Nigeria's next president.

These states are Lagos, Kano, Kaduna, Katsina, Oyo, Ogun, Bauchi, Delta, Rivers and Plateau.

These battleground states were chosen because they have historically turned out high number of voters and they currently have large numbers of registered voters for this year's elections.

To decide which state fits into the pool for consideration, the analysts deployed factors like the total number of registered voters, voter turnout in the last general elections in 2015, established voting patterns and the current political situation in the state, relying on factors such as internal crisis, unresolved grievances and show of power between political heavyweights in the state.

Meanwhile, the analysts also pointed out that there are few hidden factors that are likely influence the outcome of the presidential elections.

They said areas experiencing insecurity might witness low voter turnout and this might affect candidates who have such areas as their strongholds.

Additionally, they cautioned that even though the South East has the least number of registered voters, the combined votes of people from the Igbo ethnic group across the country could overshadow some states put together since Igbos are highly dispersed across several states in the country.

They argued that other candidates like Prof. Kingsley Moghalu of the Young People's Party (YPP) and Omoyele Sowere of the African Action Congress (AAC) might influence the outcome of the elections since they would certainly secure some votes at the expense of either Atiku or Buhari.

IGP Orders Watertight Security, Says Offenders Will Be Prosecuted

As part of the security cover for today's presidential and National Assembly elections, the acting Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has ordered robust security arrangements in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).

He also reiterated his earlier stand that those who engage in electoral malpractice would be arrested and prosecuted.

Force spokesman, Frank Mba, said that the Assistant Inspectors-General of Police (AIGs) in the 12 zonal commands and the commissioners of police (CPs) in the 36 state commands and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) had also been directed by the IGP to beef up security in their respective areas and to work closely with the senior police officers deployed on election duty to the three senatorial districts and form part of security management base for each state.

The IGP has also directed the Election Intelligence Monitoring Team (EIMT) to intensify constant surveillance, intelligence gathering and monitoring of security personnel deployed nationwide while the Special Election Investigation Team (SEIT) should ensure discrete investigation of electoral cases and diligent prosecution of all electoral offenders.

While charging all security personnel on election duty to ensure they remain patriotic, professional, unbiased and apolitical in the discharge of their duties, the IGP however warned that he would not tolerate any form of impunity or unethical conduct on the part of any officer.

He further reiterated that on no account should any policeman or woman attached to VIPs be seen escorting their principal to the polling unit or moving around with them on the day of election, saying any police officer caught would be arrested and dealt with accordingly.

The IGP advised politicians to prevail on their supporters to be orderly, law abiding and shun all forms of violence and electoral malpractices before, during and after the polls.

The IGP, who had earlier banned voters from wearing party logos and shouting party slogans at polling units in today's presidential and the National Assembly elections, added that there is maximum security in place to protect voters, INEC officials, observers, journalists and other stakeholders that would be engaged in the elections.

The police has also said it would arrest unaccredited security operative and VIPs moving from one place to another during voting hours, adding that the Force had made provisions for three security personnel per polling unit.

According Adamu, no VIP is allowed to move from one polling unit to another with security personnel without tags during the voting hours.

While promising that his officers will abide by the provisions of the Electoral Act and the code of conduct for the election, the acting IGP said they should always seek clearance from INEC before taking actions during the election.

""We have done a threat analysis of the whole country. Flash points have been mapped out. Individuals or groups that may likely cause mayhem have already been identified and will be monitored,"" he said.

The police boss has also directed the deputy inspectors general of police (DIGs) already deployed to the six geo-political zones of the country to ensure adequate security presence, coordination, supervision and implementation of security strategies for the election in all polling units, Registration Area Centres (RACs), super RACs, collation centres, INEC offices, government and critical national infrastructure, and flashpoints across the states of the federation.

U.S., Canada, ECOWAS urge Nigerians to make Saturday's elections peaceful, credible

U.S. President Donald Trump's top foreign policy adviser, Ambassador John Bolton, has urged Nigerians to ensure that today's elections are peaceful.

Bolton said this in a tweet by the U.S. Embassy in its twitter account @USEmbassyAbuja accessed by the News Agency of Nigeria yesterday in Abuja.

The National Security Adviser of the United States also called on all the candidates in the election to accept the results.

""To all Nigerians working to ensure elections on Saturday are peaceful, free, fair, and credible, we wish you success.

""We urge every voter to participate and every candidate to peacefully accept the election results,"" Bolton said.

In the same vein, Canadian High Commission in Nigeria also advised all Nigerians to go out on Saturday and vote.

The High Commission, in its twitter account @CanHCNigeria, said Nigerians would decide their future through free, fair and credible polls.

""Remember! We encourage all Nigerians to exercise their democratic rights to go out and vote tomorrow.

""You will decide Nigeria's future and deserve a free, fair, credible and peaceful chance to do it.""

Also, the ECOWAS Election Observer Mission has commended Nigerians for their patience and calm following the postponement of the general elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on February 16.

The head of the mission, former Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirfleaf, at a news briefing in Abuja yesterday, said the international community had watched the progress INEC had made to address the challenges it faced.

Johnson-Sirleaf said the progress made by the commission signalled a ""deepening and building of confidence in the electoral processes"".

""We extend thanks, admiration and gratitude to the Nigerian people for their patience in the face of the last-minute interruptions to their lives with the postponement of the 2019 general elections.

Bernie Sanders announced his second shot at the presidency of the United States last Tuesday. In 2016, he lost to the then-candidate Hillary Clinton in a close contest that pitted ‘big money’ against ‘big people’. Later it was discovered that the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the organisation that oversees the nomination of the Democratic party, had heavily favoured Clinton when they were supposed to stay neutral.

This left a sense of unfinished business for Sanders’ supporters who felt cheated by the DNC. Big money won that time, but this time it’s different. After announcing his run for presidency, Sanders has been able to collect over $4 million in 10 hours from small donations sent by the people. There is a new sense of optimism in his campaign and Sanders is hoping to get a million volunteers to create the largest grassroots political movement in the US.

I'm running for president. I am asking you to join me today as part of an unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign that will begin with at least 1 million people from across the country. Say you're in: https://t.co/KOTx0WZqRf pic.twitter.com/T1TLH0rm26 — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 19, 2019

The politics in Pakistan are different from the US but we can definitely learn a thing or three from the 77-year-old, self-proclaimed democratic socialist. Below are some of the things that Sanders supports which should be followed by Pakistani politicians (looking at you, PM IK):

Campaign finance reform

Sanders believes that a politician can never work for the people if he accepts money from big businesses and large interest groups. For example, pharmaceutical companies. The United States has one of the most expensive medical drugs in the world. Comparing it to their neighbour Canada, the US charges three times more for the same drugs. This is because of the lobbying done by pharmaceutical companies that donate to politicians and keep the drug prices high.

Our campaign is about creating a vibrant democracy with the highest voter turnout of any major country. We must restore the Voting Rights Act, overturn Citizens United, end voter suppression and gerrymandering, make Election Day a holiday and move to public funding of elections. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 23, 2019

In Pakistan, political parties do not publicly disclose their donations entirely. The money that is funding our politicians can come from anywhere and there’s no transparency. It could come from the tobacco industry that wants to lower regulation and it could come from large corporations who want lower taxes for their incomes. Pakistan needs campaign finance reform that shows the people who exactly is funding our politicians. Otherwise, we may unknowingly be helping out big corporations and voting for their hidden agendas that we may not support.

Free college and universities

Under Sanders’ policy, the United States would have free public colleges and universities that teach students without the pressure of student loan debts.

The public education system in Pakistan is not the greatest. Brilliant students may never get to shine because of our lack of sufficient education policies or opportunities. As we know the state of public schools in Pakistan, one can only imagine the state of public universities in our country. One solution would be subsidising the fee of low-income students for existing universities in our country. That way we will have the benefits of private universities without the burden of it being run by the government.

I’m running for president because we must extend the concept of public education beyond the 12th grade and make public colleges and universities tuition-free. Every young person, regardless of the income of his or her family, should have the opportunity to attend college. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 24, 2019

Higher taxation on the rich

I believe this may be the most important policy that helps the country combat income inequality. With Sanders’ proposal to increase taxes on wealthy individuals and large corporations, countries can fight for 99% of the people, instead of just the top 1%. For example, the largest company, Amazon, pays $0 in federal tax. This will hopefully change greatly under Sanders.

$25,149. That's how much the Walton family of Walmart makes in a single MINUTE—more than the average Walmart worker makes in an entire year. Instead of austerity for working families and the poor, we need austerity for billionaires and massive corporations. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 24, 2019

In Pakistan, we are reducing the taxes for corporations and big businesses but are still increasing sales tax which affects the common people of Pakistan. The corporate tax is being reduced to 29% (2019) as compared to 35% (2012). The sales tax has increased by 1% during the same time (17% in 2019). This means the rich are paying less and the poor are increasingly paying a higher proportion of taxes in their income.

These basic changes can help transform Pakistan and bring transparency to our elections, to our politics and help the people of this country. More policies such as free healthcare would reduce inequality and remove the burden off the poor who are being hit by sudden health costs. Focusing on climate change and renewable energy would reduce our reliance on oil and gas that has tormented this country for decades. Increasing the minimum wage could help transform the lives of the low-wage worker and help stimulate the economy. Low-income families spend more money on necessities, while the rich save their money in banks that only accumulate interest. Giving money to the poor through economic policies will help stimulate the economy and make it work for every Pakistani.

For too long the power shift in Pakistan has been disproportionately in favour of the rich. Following Sander’s policies could help bring change to Pakistan and make it a country not just for the top 1% but for the rest of the 99%.

However, when looking at the current political field that Pakistan has, it’s hard to personally distinguish between politicians, political parties and individuals who are running for government. If you watch closely and pay attention to the current political climate of Pakistani politicians, you will not see a battle of ideas or policies. Instead you will see a battle of personalities, and our choice (unfortunately) lies on who is the least corrupt politician. It might take time for Pakistan to find a real democratic socialist like Sanders but with the introduction of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in the government breaking the two-party system, we can hope for new ideas and more options in policies in the future.",3 lessons Pakistani politicians can learn from Bernie Sanders,Tribune.com.pk,https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/79216/3-lessons-pakistani-politicians-can-learn-from-bernie-sanders/

Thanks for waking up with us.

The Investigations

""BY THE BOOK BOB”: As Washington preps for what looks like the imminent release next week of Robert Mueller's report, prosecutors we talked to yesterday say some things are already pretty clear about the special prosecutor's two-year long probe into Russia interference in the 2016 election and ties to the Trump campaign.

These lawyers, many of whom have experience in sprawling investigations like this one, however, said that whatever happens, Mueller is likely to hew tightly to the letter of the law: “He is by-the-book-Bob. So you want to start with the presumption that he will look at these regulations and follow them very literally and closely,” said one former Justice Department prosecutor.

Lawyers we talked to have a couple of reminders for breathless lawmakers, readers and us journalists: the whole report may not be released publicly, and Mueller is unlikely to recommend charges against President Trump, regardless of what evidence he does or does not uncover. But the prosecutors told Power Up to expect a slew of subpoenas and potentially charged litigation that could make its way to the Supreme Court.

Important: Trump and his allies have spent months calling the probe a “witch hunt” and trying to undermine the special counsel's work. But the investigation has so far led to criminal charges against 34 people (many of them Russians unlikely to be extradited) and six advisers and Trump associates have pleaded guilty.

Here's what the prosecutors told me to expect:

1. The Barr Factor: It's up to new Attorney General William Barr to decide whether to release all, some or none of the Mueller report.

Trump said as much on Wednesday in the Oval Office: “That'll be totally up to the new attorney general,” Trump told reporters during a meeting with Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. “He's a tremendous man, a tremendous person who really respects this country and respects the Justice Department.”

“That'll be totally up to the new attorney general,” Trump told reporters during a meeting with Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. “He's a tremendous man, a tremendous person who really respects this country and respects the Justice Department.” Public?: “Lawmakers have demanded that Mueller’s report be made public, but Barr has been noncommittal on that point, saying that he intends to be as forthcoming as the regulations and department practice allow,” report The Post's Devlin Barrett, Josh Dawsey and Matt Zapotosky. “He has pointed, however, to Justice Department practices that insist on saying little or nothing about conduct that does not lead to criminal charges.”

“Lawmakers have demanded that Mueller’s report be made public, but Barr has been noncommittal on that point, saying that he intends to be as forthcoming as the regulations and department practice allow,” report The Post's Devlin Barrett, Josh Dawsey and Matt Zapotosky. The process: Regulations require Mueller to “provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.” The regulations then call for Barr to report to Congress about the investigation. It's unclear, though, how detailed Barr's summary will be though due to “legitimate investigative” or “privacy concerns” that require confidentiality.

2. Expect a tug of war with Congress and Justice — and potentially the courts — regarding full access to the report.

How tough a line will DOJ take? Republicans set the standard last year for obtaining access to information that the FBI or the DOJ wouldn't normally provide during ongoing cases after House Republicans' intense lobbying and threats to impeach top FBI and DOJ officials over the information flow.

Republicans set the standard last year for obtaining access to information that the FBI or the DOJ wouldn't normally provide during ongoing cases after House Republicans' intense lobbying and threats to impeach top FBI and DOJ officials over the information flow. Supreme Court : The former prosecutors said if Barr declines to send the whole report to Congress, the House Judiciary Committee could subpoena it, leading to a possible chain of litigation all the way up the Supreme Court.

: The former prosecutors said if Barr declines to send the whole report to Congress, the House Judiciary Committee could subpoena it, leading to a possible chain of litigation all the way up the Supreme Court. “I think it’ll come down to what the House Judiciary is willing to accept and how fulsome Barr chooses to be in including material within the scope of the report in whatever summary that he transmits to Congress,” another former DOJ prosecutor told us.

Worst-case scenario: Mueller is subpoenaed to testify before Congress. Yes, this could actually happen.

How? “What if Mueller finishes what he does and is not an employee of the government anymore — just a private citizen -- and doesn't want to be held in contempt by Congress so he agrees to honor their subpoena? It would be quite the circus,"" said another former DOJ prosecutor.

“What if Mueller finishes what he does and is not an employee of the government anymore — just a private citizen -- and doesn't want to be held in contempt by Congress so he agrees to honor their subpoena? It would be quite the circus,"" said another former DOJ prosecutor. That prosecutor pointed to the ""gold standard"" of accommodation and cooperation outlined in something we might all need to get to know: the Linder letter. The letter sent by DOJ to then-Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.) in 2000 cites examples of confidential information that might not be available to Congress and outlines ""the Department's longstanding positions and practices on responding to congressional oversight requests."" The letter is especially stringent when it comes to ongoing investigations.

3. Mueller is not likely to recommend criminal charges against Trump.

The special prosecutor's report is likely to contain what prosecutors described as a “kitchen sink” of relevant investigative information.

If (and it's a big if) Mueller has amassed sufficient evidence regarding Trump himself, it might describe such evidence but not recommend any kind of criminal charges because of DOJ guidelines that block a sitting president from being indicted.

“Whether it’s a crime or not is beside the point because they’re not going to prosecute him anyway,” a former prosecutor at the DOJ told us of Trump.

Mueller “is a rules follower and he’d be careful to refrain from doing or saying anything than operating outside of the prescribed legal scope of his authority,” another former DOJ prosecutor us.

“According to people familiar with the special counsel’s work, Mueller has envisioned it as an investigative assignment, not necessarily a prosecutorial one, and for that reason does not plan to keep the office running to see to the end all of the indictments it has filed,” Devlin, Josh and Matt report.

4. There will be a lot of loose ends. And ""the end of the special counsel’s probe would not mean the end of criminal investigations connected to the president,"" my colleagues report. In other words: ""It means the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end,"" former acting solicitor general Neal Katyal tweeted.

“Federal prosecutors in New York, for instance, are exploring whether corrupt payments were made in connection with Trump’s inaugural committee funding. If Mueller does close up shop, government lawyers on his team would likely return to their original posts, but would be able to continue to work on the prosecution of cases initiated by the special counsel’s office,” per my colleagues. ""If Mueller does close up shop, government lawyers on his team would likely return to their original posts, but would be able to continue to work on the prosecution of cases initiated by the special counsel’s office.”

IN OTHER NEWS, A COHEN UPDATE: Michael Cohen, Trump's former fixer and longtime lawyer, will testify publicly before the House Oversight Committee on Feb. 27 in a blockbuster showdown featuring his long-term relationship with the president. According to a memo released by Chair Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Cohen is expected to address a number of issues related to Trump's debts, business practices, compliance with campaign finance laws, etc. (See below for the full scope).

Key: “Mr. Cohen won’t answer questions that touch on [Mueller’s] investigation into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. election, according to a person close to Mr. Cohen,” per the Wall Street Journal's Rebecca Ballhaus.

“Mr. Cohen won’t answer questions that touch on [Mueller’s] investigation into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. election, according to a person close to Mr. Cohen,” per the Wall Street Journal's Rebecca Ballhaus. Top Republicans on Oversight, Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), wrote a letter to Cummings Tuesday, accusing him of being “out to attack the president for partisan gain,” noting that Cohen had previously lied to Congress. ""They said they intended to question Mr. Cohen about his 'conduct throughout his professional life and any other financial dealings he has had, including with his father-in-law,'"" Ballhaus reports.

Cohen was also granted a two-month extension to begin his prison sentence reached after pleading guilty to lying to Congress, following a shoulder surgery and is now set to start his three-year jail stint on May 6.

""SUBSTANTIAL GAPS”: When Mueller is issuing his report next week and Cohen is testifying before Congress, President Trump is slated to be in Vietnam for his second nuclear summit with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un. My colleagues John Hudson and David Nakamura report that Trump's special envoy to North Korea Stephen Biegun, a former Ford lobbyist and one-time foreign policy adviser to Sarah Palin, arrived in Hanoi late last night in order to ""close substantial gaps"" ahead of Trump and Kim's meeting.

“The challenge for Biegun in meeting his counterpart, Kim Hyok Chol, will be to try to clinch a detailed agreement that can satisfy Trump’s desire for a historic deal but one that can withstand the scrutiny of detractors, including national security adviser John Bolton and others, who warn that Pyongyang is not to be trusted,” Hudson and Nakamura report.

However, Biegun has faced internal resistance from hawkish members of the administration like Bolton who has “fiercely opposed this 'step-by-step' process in favor of maintaining maximum pressure through economic sanctions that would in theory force a better deal by eroding North Korea's resolve.""

Shot: “Bolton has fretted privately that Biegun’s team is too eager for a deal and he continues to believe the negotiations will fail, according to people familiar with the deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the tensions within the administration,” per Hudson and Nakamura.

Chaser: “If you don’t like this approach, then I don’t think you’re in favor of diplomacy — period. And it may be that Bolton isn’t,” said Tod Lindberg, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute. “This is what good diplomacy looks like.”

Trump, for his part, sounded optimistic about the summit, telling reporters: “Chairman Kim and I have a very good relationship. I wouldn’t be surprised to see something work out."" He said on Tuesday that he's in “no rush whatsoever” on North Korean denuclearization.

Earlier yesterday, Trump spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. A Japanese official told us that Abe asked Trump to “extend support to the Prime Minister in resolving the abduction issue just like at the first summit meeting in Singapore by sending Abe's intention to Kim Jong Un.” The two will speak again after the Vietnam summit.

Presumably in response to reports that Trump is considering firing Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats (after he publicly contradicted Trump on the prospects of reaching a disarmament agreement with North Korea), Sen. Susan Collins (R-Ma.) tweeted the below:

DNI Dan Coats is a good friend, former Senate colleague, and leader of integrity who has always served our country well. We are fortunate to have a person of his ability and candor to lead our intelligence community. — Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) February 20, 2019

When asked about replacing Coats in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump told reporters, ""I haven't even thought about it.""

ISRAEL: “EQUIVALENT TO A U.S. PRESIDENT CUTTING A POLITICAL DEAL WITH DAVID DUKE”: Barak Ravid of Israel's Channel 13 news/ Axios reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu successfully formed an “ultra right-wing party that will run in the April 9 elections, paving the way for Jewish supremacists from the 'Jewish Power' party to make it into the next Knesset.”

Ravid called the move “an unprecedented development in Israel's history and is equivalent to a U.S. president cutting a political deal with David Duke, the former KKK leader.”

“The prime minister and the ruling Likud Party are legitimizing a racist, xenophobic and homophobic fringe party in hopes of bolstering a right-wing bloc after the elections,” Ravid added.

“Jewish Power” was formed by the followers of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the former leader of the Kach party, which was banned from running in Israel's 1988 elections and designated a terror organization by the Israeli government in 1994. Kach was also blacklisted as a terrorist organization in the U.S., Canada and the EU.”

VENEZUELA: The standoff continues between President Nicolás Maduro and Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader who declared himself Venezuela’s legitimate leader last month, as the crisis in the country deepens.

The New York Times's Nicholas Casey reports that ahead of a Saturday deadline by the Trump administration and the opposition to “end a blockade and allow the delivery of humanitarian aid that has been piling up at the country’s borders for more than a week,” the government closed its borders “to air and sea traffic from three caribbean islands in an effort to block aid shipments to the country organized by the Venezuelan opposition.”

Maduro continues to deny there is a humanitarian crisis and is staging a dueling concert after billionaire Richard Branson announced he’d be throwing “an aid concert in Colombia on Friday to benefit Venezuelans suffering food and medicine shortages amid their country’s economic crisis,” per the Associated Press’s Luis Andres Henao.

“Branson told [the AP] that the concert he’s throwing on Friday will save lives by raising money for 'much-needed medical help' and other aid for crisis-torn Venezuela. Minutes later, Maduro’s government announced what it called a “massive” concert for Friday and Saturday on the Venezuelan side of the border,” Henao reports.

SYRIA: My colleagues Karen DeYoung and Missy Ryan report that our European allies are refusing to replace American forces with their own troops in Syria and won't stay there unless Trump reverses his hastily announced withdrawal order with which senior Pentagon officials have publicly disagreed.

“As the deadline approaches for the withdrawal of U.S. forces fighting the Islamic State in Syria, America’s closest European allies have turned down a Trump administration request to fill the gap with their own troops, according to U.S. and foreign officials.”

“Allies have 'unanimously' told the United States that they 'won’t stay if you pull out,' a senior administration official said. France and Britain are the only other countries with troops on the ground in the U.S.-led coalition battling the Islamic State,” per DeYoung and Ryan.

Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat who won office in the U.S. mid-term elections in November, said Maine would get $258 million in benefits over 40 years in exchange for a permit to send the power from Canada to Massachusetts, the New England state's Press Herald reported this week.

""Excellent news for Quebec! Hydro-Québec will be able to export more electricity to Massachusetts via Maine,"" Premier François Legault wrote on Twitter in response to the report.

Excellente nouvelle pour le Québec!

Hydro-Québec pourra exporter davantage d'électricité au Massachusetts en passant par le Maine. https://t.co/kB1CyDHm0E — François Legault (@francoislegault) February 21, 2019

Quebec gets most of the electricity for its own use from hydroelectric sources and seeks to increase exports of excess capacity. Quebec has said it would provide Maine with $40 million financing for the proposed project.

Hydro-Québec is an energy giant that is wholly-owned by the province and already sends 40 per cent of its exports to New England.

In June, Hydro-Québec reached agreement with three utility companies to supply Massachusetts with 9.45 terawatt hours of electricity for 20 years beginning in 2022.

But the deal depends on getting the New England Clean Energy Connect (NECEC) transmission line approved, after New Hampshire energy regulators last April quashed the Northern Pass project, which would have transported power from Quebec through to Massachusetts.

As part of the deal, the operator of the planned transmission line, Central Maine Power Company (CMP), said it would provide $258 million to Maine over 40 years to help lower electricity bills, advance clean-energy efforts, and fund other public and community benefits, according to a filing dated Feb. 21 and published by the Maine Public Utilities Commission.

Decision due in early March

Central Maine Power joined a string of public and community groups to file a pledge to the commission that the project addresses a ""public need"" and is in the public interest and therefore should be allowed to proceed.

It argues that the project will lower electricity bills in Maine, protect against price volatility related to natural gas markets, replace retiring baseload capacity, and help boost electric vehicle expansion in the state.

The parties to the hearing may respond until March 1, with a hearing scheduled March 7, when a decision from the commission on whether to allow the project to proceed is expected.

The filing can be accessed via search on the Maine Public Utilities Commission site and is permanently housed here.

Critics of the NECEC argue that construction of the transmission line will not benefit Maine citizens, as they are not the recipients of the hydroelectricity and the construction of the line may damage the local landscape.

The proposed path of the transmission line means that a 150-foot-wide clear-cut path must pass through about 84 kilometres of the North Woods to connect to the Central Maine Power Company’s existing corridors.

Construction of the 230-km high-voltage NECEC line is expected to cost $1.2 billion, Central Maine Power says, and would provide 1,200 megawatts of hydroelectric capacity from Quebec through Maine to Massachusetts.

While hydroelectric power -- which is created from the downhill flow of water -- is renewable and does not emit greenhouse gases it often requires the construction of dams and reservoirs that disrupt water flows and damage populations.

CMP said it would ultimately transfer ownership of the line to NECEC Transmission LLC, another company owned by Avangrid Networks, CMP's parent company, and that the operating entity would in turn pay it $60 million in equal annual payments for 40 years starting when the project is operational.",Hydro-Québec expansion edges closer as Maine governor signs on,Nationalobserver.com,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/02/22/news/hydro-quebec-expansion-edges-closer-maine-governor-signs

As our information environment continues to be poisoned by Kremlin bots and trolls, it turns out that they’re also making us sick, literally. A recent report by CBC News states that foreign influence campaigns by Russia (alongside Venezuela and Iran) on Twitter have targeted Canadian debates about pipelines and immigration policy, among other issues, including antivaccination messaging. Hundreds of deleted accounts targeted environmental issues connected to pipelines in an effort to influence politically left-leaning Canadians, while immigration issues and conspiracy theories have targeted those on the right.

European Commissioner Mariya Gabriel holds a press conference on the code of practice signed by online platforms to fight disinformation at the European Commission in Brussels on Jan. 29. The EU urged advertising trade associations and U.S. internet giants to intensify the fight against disinformation campaigns from suspects such as Russia, ahead of European elections in May. The European Commission said Google, Facebook, Twitter, Mozilla and trade groups have made ""some progress"" toward meeting their pledges to fight fake news by removing fake accounts and checking suspect sites. ( EMMANUEL DUNAND / AFP/GETTY IMAGES )

Among the tweets highlighted in the report is one about a family of Syrian refugees, who lost their 3-year-old son, who drowned when his family was attempting to flee Turkey for Greece in September 2015. The image of the child dominated the front pages of newspapers around the world and helped spur an outpouring of emotion and support for Syrian refugees. It also became a major issue in the 2015 election campaign, and newly released Twitter data indicate that banned foreign Twitter accounts attempted to put the story to their own malign use. A chart published by CBC News, based on the analysis of 9.6 million deleted tweets released by Twitter, shows a large spike around early September 2015 when the story was breaking. The released data show that at least 100 fake accounts tweeted a story about the drowning that was critical of the government’s handling of the situation, perhaps with the aim of hurting the Tories in the election.

While it’s unlikely that these Tweets had any significant effect on the outcome of the election, it does demonstrate that foreign propagandists track important national issues and are prepared to amplify them in order to exaggerate the corrosive effect they have on our social cohesion. Of the 2,617 suspended Twitter accounts, 245 tweeted or retweeted reports about environmental issues related to pipelines and grassroots anti-pipeline messages, further provoking and entrenching environmentalists and pipeline critics. One tweet, sent out by an account connected to the Kremlin’s internet Research Agency, commonly known as the St. Petersburg Troll Farm, was clearly intended to stoke environmental concerns, “#TransCanada shuts down #Keystone after oil seeps to surface News of the oil seeping to the….” while hundreds of other tweets further amplified news of leaks, “#politics Keystone pipeline leak worse than believed” and ""Crescent Point Energy pipeline leaks oil in Saskatchewan field #environment.” Right-leaning Twitter users were reportedly targeted by fake accounts with tweets aimed to provoke fears about immigration and other wild conspiracy theories. The Twitter data clearly demonstrates that foreign regimes are using social media to agitate pre-existing social prejudices and biases in order to manipulate national debates and divide our society. Election outcomes are just one of the targets of foreign disinformation and malign influence campaigns, while subversion of our democracy remains the primary goal.

Even more worrisome is the fact that Kremlin-controlled social media bots and trolls are also using disinformation to make us physically sick, which represents a threat to our public health and safety. The same Twitter data demonstrates that thousands of anti-vaccinations tweets were also among the fake deleted Twitter accounts. Since 2014, the Kremlin has developed, distributed and amplified antivaccination conspiracy theories, urging parents not to allow their children to be vaccinated against life threatening illnesses, including measles. This has created a global health crisis.

Article Continued Below

The World Health Organization has reported a steep rise in the number of measles cases over the past year, with some estimates suggesting a 50 per cent rise. In Europe, it’s estimated that 72 people have died as a result of the failure to vaccinate. The situation facilitated by Russian social media propagandists has become so acute that the World Health Organization has listed “vaccine hesitancy” as a top 10 global health risk for 2019. Just as Kremlin trolls inject themselves into social media debates to promote political polarization on other issues, so too have they with the antivaccination debate, legitimizing conspiracy theories and promoting vaccine complacency in the west, including Canada. Infectious disease specialists in this country have warned about the rise of preventable infectious diseases due to vaccination misinformation, where cases of measles are on the rise. Such threats posed by Russian social media information warfare require the Canadian government to engage and regulate social media platforms to help protect our elections, democracy and now, our public health.

University of Glasgow researchers report development of solar-powered flexible supercapacitors suitable to function as power sources for advanced wearable devices. The team alternated layers of graphene and polyurethane to create a low-cost, flexible supercapacitor that passes solar power from the top layer to underlying storage surfaces. This supercapacitor design can provide 2.5 volts of power output, significantly greater than the 1 volt or lower output with previous supercapacitors.

Cybersecurity

A hacking group associated with Russian intelligence services attacked a number of civil society organizations in Europe, ahead of elections in May for the European Parliament and national elections in European countries, according to Microsoft. Among the groups attacked were the German Council on Foreign Relations, the German Marshall Fund of the United States, and the European offices of the Aspen Institute. Microsoft blamed the attacks on the group known as Fancy Bear, which was involved in the 2016 cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee, according to the party and security researchers. “Today we’re announcing the expansion of Microsoft AccountGuard to twelve new markets across Europe, providing comprehensive threat detection and notification to eligible organizations at no additional cost and customized help to secure their systems,” Microsoft’s Tom Burt, corporate vice president, customer security and trust, wrote Wednesday in a blog post.

CrowdStrike reports that Russian hackers are eight times faster than their counterparts in China, Iran, and North Korea, and even among cybercriminals. Meanwhile, the National Security Agency and FireEye say Chinese and Iranian hackers are targeting American businesses and government agencies in the wake of the U.S. pulling out of the Iran nuclear agreement in 2018 and the Trump administration’s trade war with China. Boeing, General Electric Aviation, and T-Mobile have seen Chinese industrial-espionage efforts aimed at their operations, according to a U.S. intelligence briefing. The renewed cyberespionage comes after the Obama administration was able in 2015 to get the Chinese to scale back their probing for trade secrets among American companies.

This week in Huawei – British cybersecurity officials do not support a full and total ban of telecommunications equipment provided by the Chinese company, Reuters reports, citing people with knowledge of the matter. Allowing Huawei to supply next-generation networking systems, especially for 5G cellular communications, to the United Kingdom could have an impact on the working relations of the “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing group of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the United States, since the U.S. has urged other countries to boycott Huawei products made in China. The Wall Street Journal reports that Germany may allow Huawei to continue doing business there. Meanwhile, Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei told the BBC that the U.S. stance on alleged cybersnooping by China and Huawei is “politically motivated” and led to the Dec. 1 arrest of his daughter, Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer, who is detained in Canada; the U.S. has formally requested her extradition to the States. The U.S. Department of Justice denies that there are any political considerations in the detention of Meng.

For all the attention Huawei Technologies is getting in the media, Cisco Systems CEO Chuck Robbins says his company is competitive with Huawei in Asian and European markets. “We haven’t seen any material impact from all of the noise in the system around this topic,” he said in an interview with CNBC. “If you look at the numbers and you look at our service provider business in both Europe and Asia, where we compete with them, they were both positive. So, we were able to compete.”

Tony Bradley, Alert Logic’s senior manager of content marketing and editor-in-chief of TechSpective, writes about Armorblox, a new company that incorporates natural language processing in its cybersecurity platform. The startup touts its platform’s natural language understanding capabilities to inspect the text context of everything, rather than just detecting file attachments or links to malware.

Nest Labs is requiring owners of its security cameras to change their passwords, claiming there are too many insecure passwords that could lead to data breaches. Nest users are locked out of their accounts until they complete the password change. The Google subsidiary says the move is motivated by recent hacks of the security cameras, not Nest’s security protocols.

More than 70 companies have entered the AI chip market in recent years, and about 100 AI chip startups have formed. That’s not including all those in full stealth mode. Many of these companies are aiming their efforts at advanced computing for autonomous vehicles. “A specialized AI chip market has emerged to create platforms that can perform these complex computations almost instantaneously, while using as little power as possible,” writes Bibhrajit Halder, CEO of an early-stage AV startup. Nvidia, Google, and Graphcore are leading contenders in this field, he notes. “Roughly 12–15 companies are pulling ahead with their next-generation AI chips, but solidifying a lead will require producing and scaling them as well, which could favor established players or motivate smaller companies to merge with larger ones, as Nervana Systems and Intel did,” Halder concludes.

Honda Motor this week said it plans to shut down its plant in Swindon, England, by 2021, putting 3,500 workers in jeopardy of losing their jobs. “In light of the unprecedented changes that are affecting our industry, it is vital that we accelerate our electrification strategy and restructure our global operations accordingly,” Katsushi Inoue, the chief officer for European operations, said in a statement. The British government expressed its disappointment with the decision, which is apparently unrelated to the Brexit tribulations. “The U.K. is one of the leaders in the development of these technologies and so it is deeply disappointing that this decision has been taken now,” Business Secretary Greg Clark said. Swindon has Honda’s only plant in the European Union, and the Japanese manufacturer is also planning to shutter its production facility in Turkey within two years. “Honda’s move doesn’t speak well of global growth and at the very least, raises a yellow flag about the automotive market over the next few years,” Bret Kenwell writes in this analysis. While Honda and other mass-market manufacturers may be headed for the exits as the Brexit deadline looms, many of England’s luxury automotive manufacturers, such as Aston Martin, Bentley Motors (part of the Volkswagen Group), McLaren Automotive, and Rolls-Royce, are nonchalant at the prospect of leaving the EU. Their vehicles command six-figure prices, and they are unlikely to feel much financial pain over the breakup, although Jaguar Land Rover, now owned by Tata Motors of India, is eliminating 5,000 jobs in its workforce of 40,000.

Amazon’s investments in Rivian Automotive and Aurora Innovation show the e-commerce giant’s embrace of automated driving technology, which potentially could help the company deliver its ever-growing stream of packages, without relying upon FedEx, UPS, or the U.S. Postal Service. In 2018, Amazon ordered 20,000 Mercedes-Benz vans to bolster its own delivery fleet. Those vans run on diesel fuel, however. “For Amazon, this small investment is a good way to enlarge their bet on the E.V. automotive market without having to tool up a plant to find out if it will fly,” said Matt DeLorenzo, senior managing editor of Kelley Blue Book. “Over time, the Rivian investment could give Amazon a starting point to own and operate an in-house package delivery business.”

Nauto, a mobility startup backed by SoftBank and other investors, has acquired Newton Technologies of Pasadena, Calif.; financial terms weren’t revealed. Both companies have developed driver assistance products. Pear Ventures was an investor in Newton.

Arm this week brought out the Arm Neoverse N1 platform, optimized for 7-nanometer process technology and aimed at use in cloud workloads, and the Arm Neoverse E1 platform, described by the company as a high-efficiency throughput platform. “We are moving from an Internet model that distributes video (Netflix and YouTube) to one that consumes, manages, and processes information produced at the edge. When you consider these factors, and the end of Moore’s Law, the days of one-size-fits-all computing are over. We are entering a new era driven by a greater diversity of specialized compute and the need for flexible architectures tailored to meet application-specific needs,” Drew Henry, senior vice president and general manager, Infrastructure Line of Business, wrote in a blog post.

Rambus announced the availability of its 32G Multi-protocol SerDes PHY intellectual property on the 22-nanometer fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (22FDX) platform of GlobalFoundries.

It is meant for high-speed applications in data centers, wireless 5G infrastructure, and wireline communications.

Synopsys says its automotive Grade 1 temperature DesignWare Foundation, Analog, and Interface IP is being developed for the GF 22FDX platform. Avi Bauer, vice president of R&D at Arbe, said in a statement, “We need to work with leading companies who can support our technology innovation. GF’s 22FDX technology, with Synopsys automotive-grade DesignWare IP, will help us meet automotive reliability and operation requirements and is critical to our success.” Meanwhile, Synopsys stated that its Fusion Design Platform was used by Samsung Foundry to tape out its gate-all-around system-on-a-chip test chip, comprising several high-performance, multi-core subsystems. “Samsung Foundry has achieved many industry firsts in our drive to deliver differentiated process technology offerings to our comprehensive customer base. The latest tape-out, our GAA test chip, provides further validation of our continued commitment,” Jaehong Park, executive vice president of Design Platform Development at Samsung Electronics, said in a statement.

Lyft reportedly may float its initial public offering in early April, getting out ahead of Uber’s IPO, The New York Times reports, citing two people familiar with the company’s plans. The company’s roadshow, making presentations to prospective investors, may commence during the week of March 18th.

Meanwhile, the Uber IPO is seen taking longer for the Securities and Exchange Commission to review, given the variety of businesses it is in, aside from ride-hailing services, such as development of autonomous vehicle technology. The company’s unprofitability may give pause to some investors. Uber reported its net revenue for 2018 came to $11.3 billion, a 43% gain from 2017. In the fourth quarter of last year, the company posted net revenue of $3 billion and a net loss of $865 million. It had $6.4 billion in cash at the end of 2018.

The 40-year-old former Ontario legislator has lacked a voice in Parliament since becoming party leader in the fall of 2017. Now he finally has his chance in Burnaby South as voters in the riding cast their ballots on Monday after a six-week race.

READ MORE: NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, fellow B.C. byelection candidates face fiery debate

The Liberals got off to a rocky start when their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh’s ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Singh said he’s not taking anything for granted but he’s confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off.

“I think people are very disappointed with what’s going on with the Liberal government,” he said.

“Canadians expect our government works in our interest. It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation.”

WATCH: NDP leader Jagmeet Singh makes statement on SNC Lavalin controversy

Trudeau has denied he or his office directed Wilson-Raybould on the matter. Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, recently said Trudeau repeatedly assured Wilson-Raybould a decision on the prosecution was hers alone to make.

Richard T. Lee, the Liberal candidate who replaced Wang in Burnaby South, said few people are raising the issue on the doorstep.

“I understand some people are concerned about that, but the office of the prime minister and the prime minister himself have made a statement already,” he said.

Byelections typically have low turnouts, but there is evidence the results of them are driven by the popularity of the government and its leader, said Richard Johnston, a University of British Columbia political science professor.

“(Singh) may have been handed the gift of some voters as a result of all this,” he said. “Although it’s just one thing amongst many, boy, he could use a win right now.”

READ MORE: NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh faces potentially career-defining byelection

Singh has faced criticism for poor fundraising and low poll numbers. Burnaby South occupies historically strong NDP territory, so if Singh can’t win in the riding, it adds to the interpretation that he hasn’t secured the support of party loyalists, said Johnston.

The NDP beat the Liberals by just over 500 votes in the riding in 2015, but Johnston said he never expected the Liberals to do as well this time in Burnaby South.

“That was kind of a high point and their support might drop even further,” he said.

Lee said local issues, especially affordable housing, are more important to Burnaby South voters than the situation in Ottawa.

He has touted the Liberal government’s national housing strategy, which promises $40 billion over 10 years, while Conservative candidate Jay Shin has called for lower taxes and job-creation measures to help residents earn and save more money.

WATCH: NDP leader Jagmeet Singh on his parties housing plan

Singh has unveiled a plan to build 500,000 affordable homes across Canada. He challenged Trudeau to eliminate the GST for developers building affordable homes, subsidize low-income renters and double the first-time homebuyers’ tax credit.

Byelections will also take place in York-Simcoe in Ontario and Outremont in Montreal on Monday. The results might provide insight into whether Quebec MP Maxime Bernier’s new right-wing People’s Party of Canada can snatch votes from the Conservatives.

A recent debate in Burnaby South became heated when People’s Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson discussed immigration.

An online video of the debate shows Singh urging audience members to recognize they are all immigrants, unless they are Indigenous.

When Tyler Thompson raises the murder of Burnaby teen Marrisa Shen, in which a Syrian national has been charged, to argue for more careful vetting of refugees, an audience member yells: “That is racist! Shame on you!”

“It’s not racist to have safety,” replies Tyler Thompson.

Shin, the Conservative candidate, recently distributed flyers taking aim at Tyler Thompson, accusing her of supporting supervised injection sites and the legalization of marijuana, which she described as a “smear campaign” based on “Lies.”

However, Shin said he isn’t worried about Tyler Thompson and doesn’t think her message is resonating.

“`When I speak with voters at the doors, I don’t get a sense of that at all,” he said.

Tyler Thompson, a former Christian TV show host who opposes abortion and has protested teaching resources that educate kids about gay and transgender identities, said she believes the Conservatives are threatened by the People’s Party.

“My message is resonating with Canadians because they like my strong stance for family.”

BURNABY, B.C. -- The stakes are high for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh in a Metro Vancouver byelection race, but an expert says recent Liberal turmoil has been a ""gift"" to his campaign.

The 40-year-old former Ontario legislator has lacked a voice in Parliament since becoming party leader in the fall of 2017. Now he finally has his chance in Burnaby South as voters in the riding cast their ballots on Monday after a six-week race.

MONTREAL -- Julia Sanchez, the NDP's candidate in Monday's Outremont byelection, says people in the riding talk to her about climate change, wealth inequality -- and sometimes what the leader of her party wears on his head.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is Sikh and wears a turban, making him conspicuously religious in front of a heavily secular province. His French is also weaker than the two previous party leaders, complicating the job of appealing to Quebec voters.

Even in multicultural Outremont, located in the geographic centre of the island of Montreal with one of the largest ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in North America, Singh's religious clothing is on some voters' minds.

""Some people are concerned about (the turban),"" Sanchez said during a recent interview following a candidate debate in the riding. She said when she knocks on doors, ""It's definitely not the main thing people bring up .... It does come up.""

Kathryn Furlong, 43, who attended the debate, said she voted for Sanchez, an economist with experience in humanitarian work and climate activism, at an advance poll. She has voted Liberal in the past ""but never by conviction. Sometimes to keep the out the Conservatives.""

She said ""it's a sad notion and a sad question,"" referring to anyone who would have an issue with the NDP leader's expression of faith. ""And I think political parties in Quebec try to exploit that issue.""

Outremont has been represented by the NDP since former party leader Tom Mulcair won a 2007 federal byelection in what had long been a Liberal stronghold. Through the rise and fall of NDP popularity in Quebec, voters elected Mulcair another three times.

Mulcair stepped down last August and is now a visiting professor at Universite de Montreal and a political commentator. The NDP is currently polling fourth in Quebec, far from its highs when Jack Layton helped the party win the majority of the province's seats in 2011.

McGill University philosopher Charles Taylor, a longtime NDP supporter who campaigned with Sanchez ahead of the byelection, said the cool reception Singh has so far received in Quebec is due to the fact he doesn't yet have a seat in Parliament. Singh is his party's candidate in one of the other two byelections Monday, in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

Once he gets inside the House of Commons and is regularly in front of the cameras, Taylor predicted, ""Quebecers will learn to like him. He's very engaging, but he's just not on television all the time.""

The Coalition Avenir Quebec won last fall's provincial election with a promise to prohibit some public servants, including teachers, from wearing religious symbols on the job. But Taylor said Singh is ""going to make a case for: 'You can wear this kind of thing and be a perfectly reasonable person.' And that's something that Quebecers are able to listen to.""

While an NDP loss Monday would further hurt the party in the province, Justin Trudeau's Liberals arguably have more at stake.

The party has 39 seats in Quebec leading into Monday's vote and 179 nationally. Polling indicates Liberal support has declined across the country since the 2015 vote, and Trudeau is looking to pick up seats in Quebec to maintain his party's majority in next fall's general election.

Outremont -- where 36 per cent of residents are immigrants and 66 per cent are bilingual -- is the kind of riding the Liberals must connect with in order to maintain their success in Quebec.

Rachel Bendayan, a lawyer and former political aide, finished second to Mulcair in 2015. Her party has consistently led polls in the province since the last election. But in recent weeks it has been embroiled in controversy over allegations that the Prime Minister's Office improperly pressured former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to help engineering giant SNC-Lavalin escape criminal prosecution.

The Montreal-based company is charged with bribery and fraud over its dealings in Libya, and it has said a conviction could lead to job losses and make it vulnerable to foreign takeover.

Bendayan said it is journalists, not the people she meets when knocking on doors in the riding, who are asking about SNC-Lavalin. ""No, people are not raising it,"" she said in a recent interview recently at her campaign office. ""People here are concerned with issues that affect their day-to-day lives. You'd be surprised how many people talk to me about the ice on the sidewalks.""

Tom Boushel, 72, a Liberal volunteer who will be driving seniors to vote on Monday, said he doesn't think the SNC-Lavalin issue will have as much of an impact in Quebec as elsewhere. ""Quebecers are sensitive to the risk of job losses,"" Boushel said, adding that Montrealers appreciate the prestige of having a global firm headquartered in their city.

Boushel said ""every elected official of every party ... every government has to fight to keep SNC going. I think in Quebec, I think they understand a little better.""

The byelection is the first test for the Bloc Quebecois under its new leader, Yves-Francois Blanchet, who was acclaimed in January. The Bloc is hoping its candidate, author Michel Duchesne, will help the party become competitive once again in the riding.

A jury has found a Montreal man guilty of manslaughter in the killing of his ailing wife.

Michel Cadotte was on trial for second-degree murder in the suffocation death of Jocelyne Lizotte, who was in the last stages of Alzheimer's disease.

The Crown had argued that Cadotte had intended to kill his wife of 19 years, who was unable to care for herself.

Defence lawyers argued their client was in a disturbed state of mind and acted impulsively on Feb. 20, 2017, seeking to end his wife's suffering.

Jurors had only two verdicts open to them: second-degree murder or manslaughter.

The crime had been framed in the media as a compassion killing — an offence that doesn't exist in the Criminal Code. The trial, which began Jan. 14, heard that Cadotte had inquired about a medically assisted death for Lizotte a year before she was killed.

Justice Helene Di Salvo told jurors their deliberations would not consider the laws around medically assisted death or the quality of care provided in long-term care centres like the one in which Lizotte lived, even if those issues inevitably surfaced in the case.

""Your functions are limited to whether the prosecution proved the culpability of Mr. Cadotte beyond a reasonable doubt on either second-degree murder or manslaughter,"" Di Salvo said.

Cadotte's lawyers had argued, without the jury present, that an acquittal should be possible, but the judge ruled it wasn't an option.

The accused had admitted to killing Lizotte and the legal criteria had not been met for acquittal, Di Salvo ruled. In her final instructions, she told the jurors they should not take into account the potential sentence, because sentencing is the judge's responsibility.

Second-degree murder carries a life sentence without possibility of parole for at least 10 years while there is no minimum sentence for a manslaughter conviction, unless a firearm was used in the crime.

The Crown had argued Cadotte was in full control and intended to take Lizotte's life.

A physician from the Emilie-Gamelin long-term care facility testified that although Lizotte had late-stage Alzheimer's and was detached from reality, she was not deemed to be at the end of her life. She was receiving care to keep her comfortable but wasn't at a point where palliative care was necessary.

Cadotte had spent years caring for his wife, even after her she was placed in care. He did her laundry because Lizotte's immune system was weak, and he didn't want her clothes washed with other patients'. He had a hairdresser visit every month and had a television installed in her room so she could listen to music. He also made sure she had better quality lotions, soaps and shampoos. He gave her chocolate — her one luxury — whenever he could.

The court heard Lizotte's family was largely unable to cope with her illness and Cadotte was left to handle her care.

Cadotte testified that he felt tremendous guilt when he decided in March 2013 that he could no longer care for Lizotte at home, because she had often told him she didn't want to end up in care like her own mother — who'd also suffered from Alzheimer's.

He testified that other relatives had distanced themselves, but he couldn't follow suit.

""She was my wife. I loved her,"" Cadotte told the court. ""I wasn't able to (leave her).""",Guilty in ailing wife's death - Canada News - Castanet.net,Castanet.net,https://www.castanet.net/news/Canada/249975/Guilty-in-ailing-wife-s-death

Mourners will descend upon a large Halifax hall today for the funeral of seven children who died in a fast-moving house fire.

The service for the Barho children will begin at 1:30 p.m. at the Cunard Centre on the city's waterfront.

Imam Abdallah Yousri says funeral proceedings will follow in the Islamic traditions, but is open to people of all faiths and members of the public.

He says he hopes that by opening the ceremony up to all who wish to attend, the children's mother — Syrian refugee Kawthar Barho — will see the widespread support and sympathy from the community.

Yousri says the traditional portion of the service will be followed by words from community members, including Halifax MP Andy Fillmore, who is trying to help some of the mother's overseas relatives come to Canada.

Following the funeral service, there will be a burial at a Muslim cemetery in Hammonds Plains.

""(Kawthar Barho) doesn't have family over here in Canada. She does not have friends as well here in Halifax because she moved here five months ago,"" said Yousri on Friday.

""That's why we are trying to invite her to come see the support and let everybody gather.""

Shuttles will be organized to and from the Cunard Centre to accommodate those who wish to attend, and ample parking is available at the centre.

The children's father — Ebraheim Barho — remained in hospital Friday recovering from extensive burns. He was in critical, but stable condition.

Early Tuesday, the Quartz Drive house fire killed all of the Barho children: Ahmad, 14; Rola, 12; Mohamad, 9; Ola, 8; Hala, 3; Rana, 2 and Abdullah, who was born in Canada on Nov. 9.

The cause of the fire remains unclear.

The scale of the tragedy for the young family who arrived in Nova Scotia in September 2017 as refugees has struck a chord with Canadians.

A GoFundMe campaign had raised more than $523,846 by late Friday afternoon, with a $1-million goal.

The Barho family lived in Elmsdale, a 30-minute drive north of Halifax, when they first arrived in Nova Scotia and were embraced by residents there.

They had moved to the Halifax suburb of Spryfield to take advantage of language training and other immigrant services, and had planned to return to Elmsdale next month.

The family was among 1,795 Syrian refugees who have come to Nova Scotia in recent years. The Trudeau government granted asylum to 40,000 Syrian refugees in 2015-16.

UPDATE: 5:20 p.m.

Two new cases of measles were reported in British Columbia on Sunday, as officials in Alberta and the Northwest Territories warned that someone may have exposed others to the infection as they travelled.

A spokesman with the Vancouver International Airport said the first case arrived on a Philippine Airlines flight from Manila on Feb. 11, and another person with measles departed Vancouver on an Air Canada flight to Edmonton the following day.

Chris Devauld did not know whether the passenger on the Philippine Airlines flight left Vancouver on another flight or stayed, nor did he know whether the Edmonton-bound passenger had arrived in Vancouver from another destination.

""Frankly, people shouldn't be getting measles in the 21st century in British Columbia and we have the means to deal with that,"" B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said at a news conference Sunday where he stressed the need for people to be immunized.

""I don't think, in my view anyway, enough people are immunized in B.C.""

Health officials in both Alberta and the Northwest Territories advised people who aren't vaccinated for measles and who may have been on board flights, in shuttles, at stores or hotels where the affected person was present to monitor themselves for symptoms.

Measles at first presents with flu-like symptoms, but then a fever develops followed by the distinctive rash.

""Measles is an extremely contagious disease, spread easily through the air. There is no treatment for measles; however, it can be prevented through immunization,"" the AHS news release said.

UPDATE: 2:20 p.m.

Two more people in Vancouver have become infected with measles after a contagious person travelled through Vancouver International Airport.

Damien Healy, a spokesman for N.W.T. Health and Social Services, confirms that a person with measles who passed through Vancouver and Edmonton before flying to other destinations in the North is the same person.

There was no immediate word on where the person had been before Vancouver.

Health officials in B.C. have been investigating nearly a dozen measles cases in the Vancouver area.

Many of them have been at two French-language schools in Vancouver, a cluster that began after an unvaccinated B.C. child contracted the disease during a family trip to Vietnam.

Vancouver Coastal Health announced Sunday in a tweet there are two new cases of people who were infected while travelling.

ORIGINAL: 1:50 p.m.

Two new measles cases have been diagnosed in Vancouver, bringing the number to 12 people with measles.

Vancouver Coastal Health announced on Sunday afternoon that the two new cases are not related to the outbreak involving the schools.

“The two people got the infection while traveling,” says a spokesperson.

Vancouver International Airport tweeted that if you were at the airport on Feb. 11 or 12 and are experiencing symptoms to please contact 811 and speak with a nurse.

More information about the two cases is expected to be released on Sunday afternoon.

Alberta Health Services announced Sunday that an infected person travelled from Vancouver International Airport, stopped in Edmonton and flew to Inuvik.

Anyone who visited the same locations on the same day may have been exposed to measles.

On Friday, Vancouver Coastal medical health officer Dr. Althea Hayden said nine of the cases were clearly associated with schools that were at the centre of the original outbreak this month, but they don't know where the other person contracted the disease.

A number of specific public venues near Vancouver where people could have been exposed to measles have now been identified and listed here.

Measles at first presents with flu-like symptoms, coughing, a runny nose and red eyes, but then a fever develops, followed by the distinctive rash.

People who think they have measles are advised to stay home and call Health Link at 811 before visiting any health care facility or provider.

In its 700-page report, the energy regulator said the expansion of the crude oil pipeline would be in the public interest by creating a diverse market for Western Canadian oil producers; spurring job creation and economic development for local and Indigenous communities, and enhancing revenues for governments. While the benefits would be largely national and regional in scope, the environmental risks will largely be borne by local communities, including First Nations, the board noted.

The federal government will continue its consultations with First Nations to determine what precise concerns affected communities have about the project, and how their views can be accommodated. Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Ottawa will aim to conclude its consultations and make a decision by June.

Despite negative impacts, “the NEB recommends that the government of Canada finds that they can be justified in the circumstances in light of the considerable benefits of the projects and measures to mitigate the effects,” the board’s chief environment officer, Robert Steedman, told a Friday news conference in Calgary. The board set out 156 conditions the pipeline proponent – now the federal government – would have to meet, while making 16 recommendations to Ottawa for measures that would limit the impact of increased ship traffic in the Salish Sea and help restore the already-polluted, heavily travelled waterway.

The pipeline expansion plan has provoked inter-provincial feuding, oil-industry rage and fears among activists and some First Nations communities over threats to the environment and marine species. The government of Alberta and the oil industry maintain the Trans Mountain project is a crucial economic lifeline to expand crude exports and relieve the frequent price pressure on Western Canadian crude that results from insufficient pipeline capacity. Environmental activists decried the NEB’s conclusion, saying it is clear the pipeline will cause further damage to the orcas in the Salish Sea and would increase greenhouse gas emissions from the oil industry.

Ottawa’s 2016 approval of the pipeline expansion was quashed last August when a Federal Court of Appeal judge found the government’s First Nations consultations had been inadequate and that the NEB did not properly consider the impacts of increased marine traffic.

However, the project was in trouble even before the court decision. Faced with opposition from the government of British Columbia, Indigenous leaders, and environmental groups, former owner Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd., announced last April that it was halting construction.

In late May, the Liberal government announced it would purchase the existing Trans Mountain pipeline and terminal for $4.5-billion and finance the expansion project until it could eliminate much of the political and legal risk and resell it to the private sector. Some First Nations leaders in Alberta and B.C. have expressed an interest in purchasing a stake in the pipeline project, a notion the Liberal government supports.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said the NEB’s revised conditions and additional recommendations were sound, though she cautioned that Friday’s report isn’t the end of the process. Specifically, she acknowledged that the project could still face more court challenges and protests.

“Many obstacles have been put in our way, and quite clearly we are not done yet,” she told reporters in Calgary.

Story continues below advertisement

Ms. Notley said that once the federal cabinet makes its decision, which she expects before the federal election, construction would likely resume very quickly. In the meantime, she said she’ll be pressing the federal government to ensure consultations with First Nations are adequate so a new federal approval won’t be derailed by another court challenge.

British Columbia’s Environment Minister, George Heyman, said he was disappointed at the NEB’s ruling. “They found there would be significant impacts on southern resident killer whales, [and] that there would be a catastrophic impact if there was a spill,"" he said. ""And they reached the conclusion, astoundingly, that no new conditions were needed.” He vowed B.C. will continue with legal reference case that will test the constitutional limits of the province’s authority to restrict the flow of oil crossing its borders.

Indigenous leaders opposed to the pipeline project said Friday the board’s report does nothing to allay their concerns about risks to the salmon and killer whales. And they vow to pursue further legal challenges if Ottawa approves it again.

“We have a reciprocal and loving and spiritual relationship with the lands and the water and the things on it like the salmon and the whales,” said Rueben George, of the Tsleil Waututh First Nation, which was part of the legal challenge that quashed the first permit. “We’ll do whatever it takes to protect the things that we love, because no price can be put on the sacred.”

107,Empty,2019-02-21T19:26:47Z,A newly-proposed bill could become the first legislation to ensure individuals and independent shops can repair brand-name devices in North America.,"Image: Shutterstock

Canada is the newest frontier in the fight for the “right to repair” after an Ontario politician introduced a bill on Thursday that would ensure individuals and independent professionals can repair brand-name computers and phones cheaply and easily.

Manufacturers make it incredibly difficult to repair our broken devices ourselves. Instead of taking a smashed phone to a local repair professional for an affordable fix, a complex matrix of trade secrets and government intervention often means consumers have to make a pricey trip to the Genius Bar or buy a new device entirely. This is bad for your wallet, but also bad for the planet.

Ontario Liberal Party MPP Michael Coteau ran into this issue head-first after his daughter dropped his Samsung smartphone. An official repair job from the manufacturer was more expensive than just getting a new phone from his carrier, he told me over the phone.

“It’s a shame,” Coteau said, “because the Samsung S8 was very good for me. Everything was perfect. I would’ve kept using it. But now I’ve replaced it.”

On Thursday, Coteau introduced a private member’s bill in provincial parliament that, if passed, would be the first “right to repair” law for electronic devices in North America. More than a dozen US states are currently considering similar bills, but nothing is on the books yet in the US or in Canada.

The legislation proposes that tech companies make diagnostic tools, repair manuals, and official parts available to consumers at their request. The legislation would also require that any new products ship with a repair manual. Documents provided to consumers must be free unless they request paper copies, and parts, tools, and software must be provided at a fair price.

“The intention of the legislation is to force a company like Apple to ensure the parts they create for their phones and tablets are available to be purchased,” Coteau said, adding that the legislative process would look for ways to ensure companies’ copyright and intellectual property is respected.

If the bill becomes law, US-based companies like Apple will be forced to change how they operate to sell their wares in Canada’s most populous province. This could lead to a ripple effect not just across Canada, but across the US and potentially the world.

“If Ontario decided, 'We're going to pass the right to repair legislation,' that could actually pass right to repair for the world, because manufacturers aren't going to provide products differently to people in one jurisdiction,” Kyle Wiens, who runs DIY repair site iFixit, told the CBC last year.

The Ontario Liberal Party was decimated in the last provincial election, losing so many seats that it no longer has party status. This likely will make pushing a bill through difficult, especially with a conservative government in power. But Coteau said he believes the fight for the right to repair extends beyond party lines, and the bill is “flexible” and open to amendments.

“This is about making sure technology stays in the hands of the people, and it’s about making sure people have access to a fair and equitable approach to their products when it comes to their repair,” he said.

According to Thompson, the populist party has mobilized the socially conservative Chinese-Canadian vote.","BURNABY—When Ivan Pak went to Maxime Bernier’s first rally in Vancouver last November, he says he was “inspired” by the new party leader’s clear platform and policy commitments. That’s the kind of leader Canada needs, he told Star Vancouver.

Maxime Bernier, leader of the new People’s Party of Canada, meets supporters on Thursday at an event prior to Monday’s federal byelection in Burnaby, B.C. ( Jesse Winter / Star Metro )

Bernier announced the “death of political correctness” via a Tweet last fall to his then 65,000 followers and launched the People’s Party of Canada, which has been gaining rapid traction. Widely viewed as aiming further right of the Conservative party, the PPC has been criticized for being anti-immigrant and espousing anti-globalist values and rhetoric. But Pak, a first-generation immigrant from China, dispels those critiques as myths. “Some people accuse the PPC of being a white people’s party of Canada, but for myself ... I learned to speak English here. I’ve been here 22 years,” he said on Thursday, holding up PPC signs waiting for Bernier to make his first appearance in Burnaby South since Monday’s byelection was called in the riding.

“PPC welcomes people like me to be part of their party as long as we share the same Canadian values.” But experts say core Canadian values are now divided and there’s very little common ground. Michael Valpy is a senior fellow in public policy at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy and a former Globe and Mail journalist who has been tracking the rise of ordered populism in Canada — or what economists refer to as “drawbridge-up” thinking.

Nathaniel Allen, who supports the People's Party of Canada, drove from Mission, B.C., to attend a campaign event in Burnaby on Thursday. Allen, a former member of the BC Liberals, says he was disillusioned with politics for years until Maxime Bernier's party came along. ( Jesse Winter / Star Vancouver )

Its proponents are often hostile toward immigration, deeply pessimistic about their economic future, mostly male and mainly white, he said. At Bernier’s event on Thursday in Burnaby South, this demographic was also present. Nathaniel Allen, 30, told the Star he was a BC Liberal — the provincial party widely known to embrace conservative policies — 12 years ago until he lost interest. It wasn’t until the PPC came along that he found himself civically engaged.

“It just felt like the most pragmatic decision I could make,” he explained. Read more:

How Canadian populism is playing out in the Burnaby South byelection Burnaby South People’s Party of Canada candidate alleges Conservative Party is ‘smearing’ her Liberal candidate’s WeChat post draws criticism for singling out race of byelection opponent Jagmeet Singh A Star investigation found that far-right supporters have called on their members to infiltrate the PPC, whether the party is willing or not. As the extreme right has done elsewhere, they hope to move on a new party, bit by bit, to bring the political extreme toward the mainstream. Meanwhile, the yellow vest faction — which started as a labour movement in France but has expanded in Canada beyond economic concerns, delving into anti-globalism, nationalism, anti-government sentiment and xenophobia — looks like it’s here to stay. Bernier was there to greet the United We Roll convoy when it arrived in Ottawa last Tuesday. The former federal Conservative cabinet minister, standing beside a man in a yellow vest, told the crowd he was there to promote Canadian unity. Canadians are increasingly opposed to more immigration — and it remains to be seen how that will play out in October’s federal election, Valpy said. Anti-immigrant sentiments often depend on the makeup of neighbourhoods, he added, pointing to the suburban area surrounding Toronto, known as the 905 because of its area code, which is “quite strongly” anti-immigrant despite not being a white majority community. That’s because if communities are homogenous — for instance, predominantly white, brown or Asian — anti-immigrant views can emerge. However, Valpy said, if neighbourhoods are mixed, anti-immigrant views are unlikely. “Ethnic attachment is declining and has declined quite rapidly,” he explained in an interview, citing data from Ottawa-based pollster EKOS Research Associates. “It’s no longer important to us that all our friends are all white, or we live in a brown community.” Valpy said unless there is some shift in inequality or people’s sense that progress is lost, ordered populism is here for the long haul. According to Ivan Pak and the PPC, the principles guiding Canadian values are freedom, personal responsibility, respect and fairness. Pak was a vocal opponent of the provincial education inclusion program for sexual identity and gender fluidity. He ran unsuccessfully on that platform for school trustee in Richmond in last fall’s municipal election. As president of the PPC Richmond Centre EDA, he isn’t eligible to vote in Monday’s byelection. The PPC has promised to lower taxes, abolish corporate welfare and stop supply management. On Thursday, Bernier also said he would privatize Canada Post and abolish the CRTC. The party has formed electoral district associations in all of Canada’s 338 ridings and Bernier has said he will run a full slate of candidates in October’s general election.

Pak said he was no longer keen on the Conservatives because the party has a “lack of leadership ability” (referring to its leader, Andrew Scheer) and “no clean platform.” He also slammed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “When you ask a question in the House of Commons, he never answers it. Is the question period just a joke? It looks like drama,” he said. “Our country is in debt and that debt has to be paid somehow. It will be my children and grandchildren suffering.” Pak was one of many other Chinese-Canadians greeting Bernier when he visited his Burnaby South byelection candidate — and one of his first picks under the new PPC banner — Laura-Lynn Thompson. She is a former Christian radio host, anti-abortion activist and a vocal opponent of B.C.’s student education plan on sexual orientation and gender fluidity, with ties to several community churches. Thompson told the Star last week she’s been able to mobilize the socially conservative Chinese-Canadian vote — and those ties may explain why. During each byelection debate, Thompson directly appealed to prevalent anxieties in the riding about public safety as she repeatedly brought up the case of Marrisa Shen, a 13-year-old girl killed in a Burnaby South park in July 2017. A Syrian refugee has been charged with murder in her death.

Meanwhile, several PPC supporters at the event on Thursday told the Star they were “sick” of identity politics at play in Canada. Sherolinnah Eang said she became a full-fledged PPC supporter after hearing the messaging about “family values and free speech.” “This is the first time I’ve come out for something like this, and I’ve lived in Canada for 45 years,” she said. Burnaby has four distinct town “centres,” a long working-class history and a population density triple that of the region. Its demographics are increasingly young and non-white, according to the 2016 census, and the average age is several years below B.C.’s average, while 64 per cent of its population identifies as a visible minority. On Thursday, Bernier argued diversity is not Canada’s strength — it’s unity. Asked how that message would land in such an ethnically diverse riding, he responded: “Yes, but they are Canadians first.” The response prompted cheers from PPC supporters, with several shouting: “I’m an immigrant.” Thompson, who uttered “Canadians first” at every byelection debate, will face off against federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh — vying for his first seat in the House of Commons — Liberal Richard Lee, Conservative Jay Shin and independents Valentine Wu and Terry Grimwood on Monday in Burnaby South. Byelections will also be held that day in York—Simcoe, Ont. and in Outremont, Que. David Moscrop, author of the new book Too Dumb for Democracy? Why We Make Bad Political Decisions and How We Can Make Better Ones, and a post-doctoral fellow in the University of Ottawa’s communications department, told the Star that while feelings of anti-globalism and xenophobia have always existed, they haven’t always had an electoral home. Moscrop said this is the perfect time for the PPC to do well because it can focus on locking down a smaller segment of the electorate. And there’s enough disaffection, which could express itself as support for the right-wing party. “This party didn’t even exist 15 minutes ago, so if (Laura-Lynn Thompson) can nab even 10 per cent, Bernier will be crowing for months,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there are more likely PPC voters than would self-report ... because sometimes people won’t admit something to a pollster. But behind the privacy of the voting screen? Many may mark an X for that candidate.” Melanie Green is a Vancouver-based reporter covering food, culture and policy.

109,Empty,2019-02-22T09:00:00Z,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's former principal secretary Gerald Butts was rarely quoted in news articles,speaking to journalists only on background. But he was particularly outspoken on one public forum: Twitter.","Key aides to a prime minister generally prefer to stay in the shadows, perhaps providing background information to Parliament Hill journalists, but rarely giving interviews or generating much of a public persona.

In some ways, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's former principal secretary Gerald Butts carried on that tradition, rarely quoted, speaking to journalists only on background.

But he was particularly outspoken on the social media site Twitter.

Butts, who resigned Monday in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin affair, garnered a reputation of being a prolific tweeter, never shy to express his opinions, or ""personal views"" as he referred to them.

He would promote and champion the Liberal Party and the prime minister's policy initiatives. But he would also defend the prime minister, sometimes lash out at critics, take partisan swipes at the Conservatives and engage in Twitter spats with politicians and journalists.

Even before Trudeau became prime minister in 2015, Butts was a presence on Twitter. In that year's election campaign, Butts went after one of his favourite targets, news media company Postmedia, over their articles about Trudeau's insistence that all new Liberal candidates must be pro-choice on abortion.

And just before the election.

Postmedia has done to Canadian journalism what Harper's party has done to Canadian politics. Discuss. —@gmbutts

But after Trudeau became prime minister, Butts's criticism about the media company continued: Sometimes in a more cheeky manner:

Your country is red.<br>Postmedia is blue.<br>They can't figure out what happened. <br>So they blame you.<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoliValentines?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#cdnpoliValentines</a> —@gmbutts

Butts would also tangle with journalists, as he did over a Vogue photo shoot of Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire-Trudeau.

Did Mandela's wife borrow a $5,600 dress for the photo shoot? <a href=""https://t.co/lDufnQdN6t"">https://t.co/lDufnQdN6t</a> —@glen_mcgregor

Or critiques of Trudeau's availability to the media:

In 2018, when the Liberals announced tax incentives for the news industry, some journalists expressed concerns about what they might mean for journalistic independence.

He certainly wasn't above scolding the media.

The (Stadler &) Waldorf school of journalism. <a href=""https://t.co/ROE5GIq0mM"">https://t.co/ROE5GIq0mM</a> —@gmbutts

Here, he made a veiled critique of Canadian media for following stories on Russian websites raising questions about the grandfather of Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland and his ties to the Nazis.

Keep this for reference the next time a Russian foreign officer pitches you a story, Canadian journos. <br> <a href=""https://t.co/3KjTowWLJX"">https://t.co/3KjTowWLJX</a> —@gmbutts

He also went after the Globe and Mail in 2016 over an editorial about questions surrounding the birthplace of Liberal cabinet minister Maryam Monsef, comparing the article to the birther movement that falsely claimed former U.S. president Barack Obama was not born in the U.S.

Butts would also get involved in Twitter skirmishes with policy analysts. In February 2016, he debated with experts over the Liberals' ant-ISIS plan.

Twitter was also a tool to launch defences of his boss. He slammed critics who ridiculed Trudeau for using the term peoplekind instead of mankind during a town hall in Edmonton.

Although Trudeau later brushed it off as a ""dumb joke,"" Butts would take a step further, suggesting those who were so offended by the term were alt-right Nazi sympathizers.

Premier Doug Ford insists lobbyists have no influence on him — even though they are selling $1,250 tickets for his Progressive Conservative fundraiser next week.

But Ford emphasized Friday that lobbyists have no sway in his administration, whether they sell Tory tickets or not.

“We’ve put fundraisers together that are $25 spaghetti dinners as you know, so we have the freebies, we have the $25 fundraisers, and then we have the big fundraiser,” the premier said of the Toronto Congress Centre event Wednesday that should clear $2 million for the governing party.

“I can tell you one thing: no one can influence Doug Ford, no one can influence my ministers or my caucus,” he said.

As first disclosed by the Star on Thursday, the Tories asked lobbyists for help due to the tightened rules around political fundraising introduced in 2016 by the previous Liberal government — including a ban on corporate and union donations — that make it challenging to sell tickets.

“So they can come, they can support us, it’s no different. Lobbyists are here, the lobbyists are in Canada, they want to get their point through, good luck to them. But we’re going to do the right thing for the people.”

Companies could once purchase entire tables for such dinners and then give the tickets to employees, associates or clients. Now, each ticket must be paid for by an individual.

In an email appeal to clients obtained by the Star, Chris Benedetti, a principal at Sussex Strategy Group, a prominent firm run by Conservative and Liberal lobbyists, said the company “has been asked to help with the event.”

“The event is $12,500 for a table of 10 ($1,250/person). To reserve a table please let us know and we can assist you in assembling individual registrations to then be sent in as a package,” he wrote.

Benedetti, who is registered to lobby for 60 different companies at Queen’s Park, said he was contacted by the PC Ontario Fund last month.

“I have not spoken to anyone in the premier’s office about this event, and no one in the office or any other government office has been in touch with me to encourage sales or otherwise,” he said.

Another lobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was “tremendous pressure” put on his firm to sell tickets.

“You’re really made to feel that you’re not pulling your weight if you don’t sell a table or two,” he said.

NDP MPP Taras Natyshak (Essex) said “Doug Ford’s threat-based racket looks like cash-for-access on steroids.”

“This scheme is laced with threats about who will be allowed into Doug Ford’s back rooms, and who will be locked out,” said Natyshak.

“People were clear that they wanted to get rid of cash-for-access schemes when they got rid of Kathleen Wynne and the Liberals. But Doug Ford is making things much worse for them,” he said.

Green Leader Mike Schreiner noted that “when big money gets its hands on our politics, it eats away at democracy.”

“I will not stand quietly by while money, power and influence flow freely between government and lobbyists,” said Schreiner, who considering asking Elections Ontario’s chief electoral officer Greg Essensa to look into the allegations.

“Last year, the premier quietly raised donation limits and ushered in the return of cash-for-access events, burying these rule changes in the fall economic statement and now we have allegations the PC party is pressuring lobbyists to sell fundraising tickets at the risk of losing the ear of cabinet,” he said.

Marcus Mattinson, the PC party’s director of communications, said “dozens of individuals have been assisting the party with fundraising for decades, and this event is no exception.”

Last fall, the Tories quietly opened a loophole in the electoral finance reform bill by repealing a section that forced donors to “certify, in a form approved by the chief electoral officer, that the person has not acted contrary” to the ban on unions or corporations making donations in the name of members or employees.

The change means that a company or union could theoretically make a political contribution in someone else’s name.

But the government said it only made the amendment because the disclosure form was a nuisance to contributors.

Ford noted Friday that his government’s rules “match” the federal campaign finance laws.

The previous Liberal government was forced to reform the law after a Star investigation three years ago.

Tru…","By David Ljunggren

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday said he was still puzzled by the decision of former veterans affairs minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to quit last week, even after she addressed the Cabinet on Tuesday.

Trudeau is battling allegations that his officials last year pressured Wilson-Raybould, then justice minister, to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption and bribery trial.

Trudeau insists there was no wrongdoing and said Wilson-Raybould has not made clear her reasons for leaving. In an unusual move, she was allowed to address her Cabinet colleagues on Tuesday, even though she was no longer a minister.

""I continue to be surprised by Jody Wilson-Raybould's decision ... This is not a decision that remains clear to me,"" he told a televised news conference in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.

Trudeau's version of events was backed up by Michael Wernick, the head of the federal civil service, who was present for several top-level meetings with Wilson-Raybould last year and said nothing untoward had happened.

""There was no inappropriate pressure put on the minister at any time,"" Wernick told the House of Commons justice committee on Thursday, saying Wilson-Raybould had had plenty of opportunities to complain had she felt the need to.

Wilson-Raybould, who on Wednesday said ""I hope that I have the opportunity to speak my truth"", is consulting lawyers to determine how much she is able to say. She is due to address the justice committee next week.

The Globe and Mail on Thursday said Wilson-Raybould told the Cabinet she had come under improper pressure from officials.

""How she interprets and perceives those conversations she can tell you next week. I can tell you my view very firmly is they were entirely appropriate, lawful, legal,"" said Wernick, a civil servant who is not a member of Parliament.

The issue could threaten the ruling Liberals' election chances this October. Opposition politicians have accused the Liberals of a cover-up and want a full public inquiry.

SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in the province of Quebec province, where the Liberals say they need to capture more seats in the October election to have a chance of holding on to power.

""We believe in the independence of the judiciary and we believe in fighting for good jobs,"" said Trudeau.

The prime minister on Wednesday sought to calm restless parliamentarians at a meeting to discuss the resignations of Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau aide Gerald Butts, a major architect of the Liberals' surprise victory in October 2015, who quit on Monday while insisting he had done nothing wrong.

Trudeau sidestepped questions about how he planned to handle the crisis, party sources said.

Signs of stress remain. Two Liberal legislators voted with the opposition on Wednesday in a failed bid to launch a public inquiry, while a female Liberal member of parliament tweeted her support for Wilson-Raybould, adding the hash tag #IStandWithHer.

The former minister, who the Globe and Mail said had ignored the pressure to go easy on SNC-Lavalin, was demoted from the justice ministry last month.

This is our weekly newsletter on all things environmental, where we highlight trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world.

It's called OOM, and it could change the way we generate power

Did Trump help inspire the Green New Deal?

Meet OOM: Could this off-the-grid technology be the future of electricity?

(OOM Energy)

In August 2003, a sagging high-voltage power line in northern Ohio brushed up against some tree branches. Before long, three transmission lines had short-circuited and 45 million people in the northeastern U.S., as well as 10 million in Ontario, were in the dark — for hours, days, in some cases even a week.

It was a tough lesson for power companies, who implemented recommendations from the investigation that followed (such as keeping power lines away from trees). But the fact is, most of us still rely on the grid to provide electricity to our homes and businesses.

If Craig Clydesdale has his way, however, that will all change. He's the founder and CEO of OOM Energy, an Oakville, Ont.-based company that has developed a new way of providing electricity to customers.

""You're looking at the next big thing,"" Clydesdale said. What he's referring to is his company's Integrated Energy Platform (IEP), an on-site power system that aims to take buildings off the sometimes unstable electrical grid while also reducing their carbon footprint. Oh, and it's portable.

OOM's unit shouldn't be confused with a generator, which creates mechanical energy and delivers it only as a backup, when existing systems fail. What Clydesdale's company provides is private, continuous electricity with no upfront cost for the unit. The customer just pays a regular bill directly to OOM each month.

So what's in the unit? The current version uses natural gas, a battery and an inverter. While it's not a zero-emissions solution, Clydesdale said the system can be modified to include greener energy as it develops and becomes more affordable — such as solar panels or hydrogen, which he believes to be the future.

The unit only generates power when it has to. That's unlike power lines that deliver electricity to your home, which have to be constantly running just in case. OOM uses artificial intelligence to calculate a building's power requirements, so its customers only get ""what they need,"" Clydesdale said.

At the moment, OOM units are being sold to organizations and businesses with large demands, such as ones in agriculture and industrial manufacturing. But they've also been used in high-rise apartments and multi-residential units.

Last month, Stoneridge Ice Centre in Burlington, Ont., became the first arena in North America to adopt OOM's new technology. The estimate is that their annual electricity costs will drop from $180,000 to $145,000 — a savings of 20 per cent.

Although Clydesdale has a unit for his home, right now, OOM's main focus is on commercial and multi-residential buildings.

Clydesdale doesn't know of anything like OOM on the market, but he said he'd be happy to see others rise to the challenge of a green, off-grid solution. At a time when more ice storms are predicted for parts of Canada with climate change, Clydesdale said this type of technology could be the security people are looking for.

He said it's potentially ""a multitrillion-dollar industry. There's lots of room for all of us.""

Given Trump's climate inaction, Green New Deal could be a political winner

(Saul Loeb/Getty Images)

CBC business columnist Don Pittis weighs in on the Green New Deal, the sweeping plan put forth by left-leaning members of the Democratic Party in the U.S. to address climate change.

To conservatives who understand the science of climate change and its potentially dire economic effects, it may seem strange that the decision on whether to halt it has become a left-right issue.

With the announcement of a major climate action initiative in the U.S., that polarization has become even more pronounced.

The idea of a transformational project to boost the economy using green technology has been around for decades. But now, an emerging left-leaning faction of the Democratic Party has offered up the Green New Deal, where fighting climate change is firmly anchored in a platform of wider social change, including items such as eliminating poverty and increasing income equality.

""I think [the Green New Deal] does mix a lot of things that are not necessarily compatible, and subordinates the goal of reducing carbon emissions to a lot of other things on the liberal social democratic wish list,"" Mark Cameron, executive director of Canadians for Clean Prosperity, told me on the phone last week.

A firm supporter of carbon pricing as a business-friendly way of cutting CO2 without distorting the economy, Cameron was director of policy and research for former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper.

But as others told me, the hostility of U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters to the whole idea of fighting climate change has surrendered that political turf to the Democrats.

As the name implies, the Green New Deal is unabashedly a social project, harking back to the original New Deal introduced by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to combat the inequality, unemployment and hunger of the Great Depression.

While critics insist it was actually the massive stimulation from spending on the Second World War that rebooted the U.S. economy, the original New Deal set the tone for a more egalitarian social and economic system that formed the basis of the postwar shared prosperity.

Without a climate change plan of its own, the Trump Republicans have given their Democratic opponents lots of flexibility to formulate a final green policy they think will appeal to voters.

With U.S. unemployment at record lows, massive public sector stimulus on green projects would likely be hard to justify. But if the rich keep on getting richer as the economy goes into recession, and if public worries over the effects of climate change continue to grow, a Green New Deal may catch the voters' imagination as a way to kill two birds with one stone.

The Big Picture: Traffic congestion

Sitting in traffic is no fun, but getting around in some cities is clearly worse than in others. According to research by traffic-analysis firm Inrix, the worst traffic is in Bogota, Colombia — drivers there lost 272 hours to congestion in 2018. As you'll see from the chart below, notoriously bad Canadian cities like Toronto and Montreal come off looking almost manageable in comparison.

What's on your mind?

Last week's story on household waste elicited some interesting emails. One reader pointed out that black plastic, which we cited as something that can't be recycled, is actually recycled in some communities across Canada. The reader helpfully clarified that ""municipalities have different rules because they've invested in different technologies. That makes it tough for consumers and businesses.""

We'll be returning to the topic of zero waste in the coming weeks and months, but if you have comments or suggestions on this topic, we'd be happy to hear them.

Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web

For anyone with a bird feeder, putting out food for our winged friends during the scarcity of the winter months seems like a small act of mercy. But an ecologist at the University of Alberta points out that it also puts birds at risk of accidentally colliding with windows or coming face to face with urban predators.

As Emily Chung wrote in a story last year, online shopping is a significant generator of carbon emissions. Given Amazon's outsize influence in this space, there's reason to be encouraged by the company's announcement this week that it's aiming to make all its shipments ""net zero carbon."" The first target: Making 50 per cent of its shipments net zero by 2030.

A shining example for other sun-drenched cities? A second-year engineering student at the University of Calgary has done research that suggests the city could generate nearly a quarter of its annual power demand if residential rooftops were outfitted with solar panels.

Snow problem: Electric cars in Winterpeg

(Bryce Hoye/CBC)

The coldest days in Canadian winters wreak havoc on vehicle batteries, and so you'd think the problem would be especially acute for electric vehicles (EVs). But many EV owners say that impact isn't a big deal once the rubber hits the snow.

A recent cold snap that swept through Canada provided an interesting case study for Winnipeg, where temperatures were in the -35 C range. On days like that, Jordan Loewen said his Tesla Model 3 was losing as much as 40 per cent of its battery range. Heating the cabin of the car was the main culprit, as it is for many EV owners.

This is the first Winnipeg winter for Loewen's black Tesla, which cost him a cool $75,000.

In ideal conditions, Loewen said his car can do 500 kilometres on a full charge. On the cold days of winter, however, he's getting more like 300 kilometres. On paper, that may look like a problem, but Loewen is a city commuter, and is only logging 60 kilometres a day on average.

Tesla advises against exposing its vehicles to extreme conditions — colder than -25 C, warmer than 60 C — for more than than 24 hours, but Loewen said he hasn't seen any issues.

""It performs and handles well in our winters, exceptionally so,"" said the 32-year-old Loewen.

Ross Redman paid $26,000 for his Mitsubishi i-MiEV seven years ago, and said it has stood the test of time (and temperatures) in Winnipeg.

""I've been told by several people that an electric car will never work in the winter time, and I use it every day,"" said Redman.

Like Loewen, Redman loses range in the winter — about 50 kilometres of the 100 kilometres he would get in the summer. But also like Loewen, he's a city driver, and isn't driving enough for that loss to change his habits.

Both say the loss in winter range is a small price to pay for vehicles that cost less than a few hundred dollars in fuel annually. Redman said he pays about $7 a month in the summer and $10 in the winter months on electricity bills to charge his little hatchback in his garage.

Redman acknowledges one big roadblock to owning an electric car in Manitoba is that he can't hop into his Mitsubishi and cover the province's vast distances without getting what is called ""range anxiety.""

That's because Manitoba, like some other provinces, is a patchwork of charging stations and lacks a supercharger network in particular. Those stations charge most electric vehicle batteries in less than an hour.

The Manitoba Electric Vehicle Association estimates a $4-million investment could establish enough supercharger stations around the province to make long road trips possible for EVs like Redman's, which lack the extended range of Loewen's fancy ride.

More specifically, he's facing criticsm for tapping what The Toronto Star calls ""high-powered lobbying firms"" to help sell tickets.

The 2019 Toronto Leaders' Dinner, as the event is called, will take place this Wednesday at The Toronto Congress Centre in Etobicoke from 5:30 p.m. until 9 p.m. It includes a welcome reception, a dinner program, a dessert reception and, at some point, a keynote speech from Ford featuring members of the PC Caucus.

If you missed Premier Doug Ford's $25-per-plate fundraiser in Kitchener last week, you can head to the PC party's $1,250-per-ticket fundraiser dinner in Etobicoke next month. No word yet if spaghetti is on the menu: https://t.co/ax3P33h4iG — James D.E. Jackson (@JamesDEJ) January 14, 2019

""Doug Ford and our Ontario PC Caucus accomplished a great deal in 2018, working to make life better and more affordable for Ontarians,"" reads a description of the event, which The Star says should net about $2 million for the Progressive Conservatives.

""There is much more to achieve in 2019, and to continue getting things done for the people, we need your help to build up our Party’s financial resources as quickly as possible.""

Some critics are taking the event's promotion as evidence that Ford and his colleagues are ""for sale,"" so to speak.

The premier told reporters in Washington on Friday that this is not the case.

""I can tell you one thing: no one can influence Doug Ford, no one can influence my ministers or my caucus,"" he said, per The Star.

""Lobbyists are here, the lobbyists are in Canada, they want to get their point through, good luck to them,"" he continued. ""But we're going to do the right thing for the people.""

""It is wrong for ⁦[Ford]⁩ to bring back the same old cash for access events that got the Wynne Liberals in hot water,"" said Ontario Green Party leader Mike Schreiner on Twitter Thursday morning.

""Big money has no place in [Ontario politics]. I call on the Premier to remove the for sale sign on his door.""

""Who can pay for Doug Ford's $1250/plate fundraiser?"" said the Liberal advocacy group Progress Canada on Twitter similarly.

""The nurse working nights? No. The factory worker? No. The restaurant chef? No. Working people? No. Only the rich who work for the rich and against working Ontarians.""

Adding more fuel to the fire are allegations published this week by the Globe and Mail that members of Ford's caucus are pressuring lobbyists to sell tickets under the threat of losing future meetings with government officials.

""Several people helping sell tickets, both in the lobbying and industry worlds, said they are under heavy pressure — including through repeated phone calls and reminders of sales targets by party fundraisers — to fill the room amid concerns about their continued ability to get meetings with key decision-makers,"" reads the Globe piece.

Many are pointing out that the PC party's actions seem a little too similar to what got Kathleen Wynne's Liberal Party into hot water during their time in power.

The Burnaby race is centre stage because federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh hopes to win his first seat in Parliament here.

Singh — who has lived his entire adult life in Ontario — has parachuted into Burnaby South, which he believes is a safe NDP seat. Despite being party leader, a win for Singh isn’t guaranteed. He’s up against strong candidates from the other established federal parties. And while the NDP often wins in the area, in the 2015 election the NDP’s Kennedy Stewart only edged out the Liberal runner-up by one percentage point (35 per cent of the votes compared to 34).

The Liberal candidate this time is Richard Lee, a longtime Burnaby North MLA, who replaced Karen Wang mid-campaign when she resigned after making a racial social-media comment. Jay Shin, a rookie politician, lawyer and professor who grew up in Burnaby, is hoping to take the seat for the Conservatives — traditionally the runner-up party for area voters. Rounding out the field are People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler-Thompson and independents Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu.

This byelection offers Burnaby South voters a real opportunity to help set the agenda for Canada.

Under Singh’s leadership, the NDP has struggled, with just 14-per-cent support across the country, according to an aggregation of recent polls compiled by the CBC. A Leger poll this week found that just six per cent of Canadians believe Singh would make the best prime minister of the party leaders.

What is clear from national election results and polling is that Canadians don’t believe the NDP and its policies are best for Canada. Singh is poised to continue the party’s long tradition of failure, and it’s no surprise.

He strongly opposes the Trans Mountain pipeline, a project that is clearly in the national interest and essential to economic development in Western Canada. Meanwhile, he favours the $40-billion LNG Canada project, although he faces pressure to oppose that project by NDP members with impractical climate change views.

With the NDP’s frequent opposition to major economic developments that provide jobs and prosperity, combined with its support for higher taxes and endless growth to government programs, it’s understandable that the vast majority of federal voters don’t view the NDP as a viable party to lead the country.

Singh has also never fully explained his views on terrorism, specifically as it relates to calls for the creation of an independent Sikh state, Khalistan, in India. While he has condemned terrorism, he has appeared at events with Khalistan separatists who endorse violence and he also failed in a CBC interview to denounce Talwinder Singh Parmar, thought to be the organizer of the 1985 Air India bombing.

Lee also faces strong headwinds, especially with the turmoil in Ottawa surrounding the resignations of former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould and Gerald Butts, the prime minister’s principal secretary, after reports that Wilson-Raybould was pressured to interfere with the prosecution of Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Trudeau’s fumbling attempts to initially deny the improper attempts to influence what must be independent prosecutors and his subsequent refusal to be transparent should be a grave concern to voters. Lee, an outspoken critic of China as a young man, recently has been criticized for being too close to the Chinese Communist Party, having been photographed dozens of times with Chinese officials.

Conservative candidate Jay Shin is new to politics but has a backstory that the diverse community of Burnaby South can embrace. He immigrated with his family, who ran a grocery store in Burnaby, where he grew up. He has two undergraduate degrees, a master of business administration and a law degree. Shin practises business law, has taught at two Korean universities and teaches at the University of B.C.’s law school.

Shin says the top priority for voters he speaks with in the riding is to rein in excessive spending by the current Liberal government and return to balanced budgets. That’s a worthy goal if we are going to maintain the services Canadians rely on without further taxing middle-class families already stretched to the limit, particularly in Metro Vancouver.

With the Conservatives climbing above the Liberals in the polls and possibly forming the next federal government, Burnaby South voters should do themselves a favour by supporting a successful, accomplished local candidate who likely will be at the centre of power.

Most participants were wearing yellow vests - a sign of affiliation with the country's own newly-formed grass-roots protest movement.

Sputnik sat down with Cody Payant — a Yellow Vests activist from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, who's been following the convoy and organized similar protests of smaller scale in his home region. Payant is also a political figure, aiming for People's Party of Canada candidacy in the upcoming 43rd federal election.

Sputnik: You've been following the ""United We Roll for Canada"" convoy going from Red Deer, Alberta, to Ottawa. What are their demands? Is it only about the ""pipeline"", or are there other topics at play?

Cody Payant: The ""pipeline"" is definitely the main one. Justin Trudeau is our prime minister and his father, Pierre Trudeau, used to be our prime minister, and he started what is called ""the National Energy Programme"", which kind of tried to nationalize pipelines, to implement state ownership on energy infrastructure projects. And now, with Justin Trudeau, with the purchase of the pipeline for 4.5 billion dollars of taxpayer money — there is a big problem, because they spent all that taxpayer money on that pipeline, but they can't build it. So, they more or less extorted Canadian taxpayers to pay for this ""imaginary pipeline"", that they can't build. And Canadians are really upset; that has become a big issue for Yellow Vests.

Here' s what may eventually turn into Canada's own grass-roots mass protest movement. A truck convoy moved all the way across the country from Red Deer, Alberta, to Ottawa to protest against federal govt policies. https://t.co/F84fkA5YGu — Denis Bolotsky (@BolotskySputnik) February 21, 2019

Canadians want pipelines because we have some of the cleanest oil and energy practices and industry anywhere in the world. And right now, compared to the United States, the United States is the only country where we can export our oil to, we are locked to them as one customer right now. Our oil is discounted big time right now, so we want a pipeline to Tidewater, so we can access world markets, whether it be Southeast Asia, or Asia.

The Transmountain pipeline will increase the value of Canadian oil by unlocking access to world markets. The carbon tax, over regulation, and state control of our energy sector is only delaying the commercial viability of large scale renewables as a replacement. Vote PPC. pic.twitter.com/HcCZSF4HRX — 🇨🇦 Cody Payant 🌾 (@PayantCody) January 22, 2019

So, that was a huge issue, but also, some other issues with Yellow Vests are the United Nations — that's huge. The United Nations and the General Assembly — all of the people that sit in the General Assembly and on the councils — they are all unelected, and sometimes they are unelected in their own countries — the member states that comprise the UN. So, it's been a gradual ""creep"" — it kind of started after the World War [II]. So, the UN-2030 Agenda lays on all of these items that they are suggesting that the member states comply with. So, what the Yellow Vests sees is that Canada is a sovereign country, with sovereign borders; we need to protect our sovereignty as a sovereign nation, respect our ability to legislate ourselves, respect our representative democracy and our constitution. The Yellow Vests, basically, are patriotic, they want to preserve our sovereignty, they want to protect our sovereignty from supranational legislation of the UN trying to supersede Canadian law.

Sputnik: Both Canadian MPs speaking at the rally in Ottawa's Parliament Hill, and Canadian mainstream media seemed to have been avoiding the topics of the UN migrant compact, border policy and similar ""patriotic subjects"". Why is that?

Cody Payant: Part of the reason could be that pipelines are such a big issue right now, and there is a kind of ""competition"", I guess, between two ""pro-pipeline"" parties — the People's Party of Canada — and I'm a candidate with that party, and the Conservative Party of Canada, which also supports pipelines… I think both parties are trying to spread the message, so that could be a partisan thing.

And listening to Canadians is always the right thing for Canada. — 🇨🇦 Cody Payant 🌾 (@PayantCody) February 21, 2019

But, also, immigration is a more contentious issue. The pipeline is a contentious issue, but immigration, all over the world, in a lot of places has become a very contentious issue. So, that's why it could be risky from a political perspective to talk about it. The migration pact is something that a lot of countries signed on to, and a lot of countries didn't. And there is a whole list of countries that refused to do so — the Czech Republic, Hungary, Japan, and the list goes on. Essentially, the issue that the Yellow Vests have with the Migration Pact is that — it's not pro- or against immigration, it's more of wanting Canada to be able to have the autonomy to legislate its own laws on immigration. We want Canada to make laws, not the UN.

Sputnik: You're planning to run for public office, and once you announced that you're joining the Yellow Vests movement and then media started speculating about the link between your membership in the People's Party and your Yellow Vests activism being seen as something rather controversial. Do you feel that there is a bias in the media or some kind of pressure?

Cody Payant: It is hard. I got involved in the Yellow Vests because it made its way to Canada from France after I had announced in September that I want to run for the nomination. So, it's kind of aligned. The Yellow Vests issues that they are advocating for are that they want, in terms of being patriotic Canadians who want to protect our sovereignty as a country, [to] protect our ability to legislate ourselves and remove the government from overregulating our industries and pipelines. As you said, the biased media is state-owned here in Canada. CBC gets 1.6 billion dollars per year in tax money, so it's basically a partisan tool for the liberal government right now. And it goes like that not only for Liberals — also for Conservatives — any party that's at power. It's state broadcasting.

Even though protesters have different political views, many wear yellow vests and most of them oppose the policies of Justin Trudeau’s government.

If you watch the coverage of Canada's #UnitedWeRoll protest one of the things that may spring to mind is how similar it looks to the 1978 Sam Peckinpah's movie ""The Convoy"", with dozens of trucks driving through the vast North American landscape, with people in small towns and big cities along the way cheering drivers, who turned against corrupt authorities.

​However, unlike the iconic movie with Kris Kristofferson, where the main character is on a mission against an abusive sheriff, the reality of modern-day Canadian protest is much more complicated. Canadian mainstream media almost unequivocally brand the protest as ""pro-pipeline"", saying that it's mainly directed against federal energy and environmental policies.

However, there are also other slogans at play, which the media prefers to either ignore or portray negatively, such as the opposition to the UN Migrant compact and calls to secure the country's borders. Politicians also seem to avoid these ""hot topics"".

​Faith Goldy, a Canadian right-wing journalist, who previously worked as a commentator and reporter for several media outlets and who is a strong opponent of Justin Trudeau's immigration policy, told Sputnik that #UnitedWeRoll is the first cross-country grassroots movement of its kind and its message is being often misread by both the mainstream media and MPs in Ottawa.

""I've talked to many of these protesters, and they've been explicit in their signage and their messaging that they want an end to the UN migrant compact,"" Goldy said. ""And yet, not a single elected official who presented their remarks had included any on the topic of the UN migrant compact. So, the question becomes 'well, why?' when this is what the people are demanding.""

The truckers were met with counter-protests in Ottawa for being ""racist"" and ""white supremacists"" — something they strongly deny. Their objections and explanations, however, mostly got through via alternative media platforms and social networks, rather than public TV and radio.

​Although #UnitedWeRoll is the largest, it's not the first convoy of its kind in Canada. Despite wearing yellow vests, not all protesters identify themselves with the broader ""Yellow Vests"" ideology. Some people, including the organisers, even try to distance themselves from the ""aggressive"" Yellow Vests' profile, which originated in France. But in reality, truckers from Alberta and the ""Yellow Vests"" seem to share many goals.

Cody Payant, an accountant from the city of Saskatoon in Saskatchewan Province, is a ""Yellow Vests"" member. He took part in similar convoys of a smaller scale in his home region earlier this year. Payant says that the movement's ideology is purely patriotic.

​He is also an active member of Canada's People's Party and is planning to run as a candidate in the 43rd federal election scheduled for 21 October. The mainstream media recently speculated about his membership in the ""controversial Yellow Vests Canada"".

""The biased media is state-owned here in Canada,"" Payant told Sputnik. ""CBC gets 1.6 billion dollars per year in tax money, so it's basically a partisan tool for liberal government right now. And it goes like that not only for liberals — also for conservatives — any party that's at power. It's state broadcasting. So, they tried to paint me, and others too, in the party, as somehow being 'risky'.""

Nevertheless, Payant is optimistic about the future of Canada's grassroots protest movement:

""I know that there have been extremist groups trying to get involved in the Yellow Vests, trying to hi-jack it, to make it into something that it's not, whether it's 'Soldiers of Odin' or 'Antifa' or other groups like that. But, as a whole, I have faith in Canadians. Canadians will keep it on the tracks and overcome the hate, overcome the division and really keep it on the tracks. And I think that rally in Ottawa was really an evidence of that.""

The #UnitedWeRoll for Canada convoy, consisting of around 200 semi-trailers, pickup trucks and buses, departed from Red Deer, Alberta, and travelled all the way across Canada to the capital Ottawa, where activists held a two-day rally on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The protesters are campaigning in favour of the country's energy sector, which suffers from a lack of export capacity, thy opposed to the federal carbon tax, and have expressed criticism of Justin Trudeau's immigration policy and voiced their disapproval of Canada's participation in the UN migrant compact.

First issued by the United States in 1823, it warned European powers against renewed colonization of the Western Hemisphere. Presented as anti-imperialist, the Monroe Doctrine was later used to justify US interference in regional affairs.

We may be seeing the development of a Canadian equivalent. The ‘Trudeau Doctrine’ claims to support a “rules-based order”, the “constitution” and regional diplomacy independent of the US. But, history is likely to judge the rhetoric of the Trudeau Doctrine as little more than a mask for aggressive interference in the affairs of a sovereign nation.

For two years Canada’s Prime Minister has been conspiring with Juan Guaidó’s hardline Voluntad Popular party to oust the government of Nicolas Maduro. In May 2017 Trudeau met Lilian Tintori, wife of Voluntad Popular leader Leopoldo López. The Guardian recently reported on Tintori’s role in building international support for the slow-motion coup attempt currently underway in Venezuela. Tintori acted as an emissary for Lopez who couldn’t travel to Ottawa because he was convicted of inciting violence during the “guarimbas” protests in 2014. According to a series of reports, Lopez is the key Venezuelan organizer of the plan to anoint Guaidó interim president. Canadian diplomats spent “months”, reports the Canadian Press, coordinating the plan with the hard-line opposition. In a story titled “Anti-Maduro coalition grew from secret talks”, the Associated Press reported on Canada’s “key role” in building international diplomatic support for claiming the head of the national assembly was president. This included Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland speaking to Guaidó “the night before Maduro’s swearing-in ceremony to offer her government’s support should he confront the socialist leader.”

Just before the recent Lima Group meeting in Ottawa Trudeau spoke with Guaidó and at the meeting of countries opposed to Venezuela’s president he announced that Canada officially recognized Guaido’s representative to Canada, Orlando Viera Blanco, as ambassador. The PM has called the leaders of France, Spain, Paraguay, Ireland, Colombia and Italy as well as the International Monetary Fund and European Union to convince them to join Canada’s campaign against Venezuela.

“The international community must immediately unite behind the interim president”, Trudeau declared at the opening of the Lima Group meeting in Ottawa.

At the UN General Assembly in September Canada announced it (with five South American nations) would ask the International Criminal Court to investigate the Venezuelan government, which is the first time a government has been formally brought before the tribunal by another member. Trudeau portrayed this move as a challenge to the Trump administration’s hostility to the court and described the ICC as a “useful and important way of promoting an international rules-based order.” In other words, Trudeau would challenge Washington by showing Trump how the “international rules-based” ICC could undermine a government the US was seeking to overthrow through unilateral sanctions, support for the opposition and threatening an invasion, which all contravene the UN Charter.

While Trudeau claims to support an “international rules-based order”, his government has adopted three rounds of illegal sanctions against Venezuela. It has also openly interfered in the country’s affairs, which violates the UN and OAS charters.

The Trudeau Doctrine emphasizes its interpretation of Venezuela’s constitution. On a whole series of platforms the Prime Minister has cited “the need to respect the Venezuelan Constitution”, even responding to someone who yelled “hands off Venezuela” at a town hall by lecturing the audience on article 233 of the Venezuelan constitution, which he claims makes the head of the National Assembly president. It doesn’t.

More fundamental to the Trudeau Doctrine is the mirage of a regional coalition independent of the regional hegemon – the United States.

Ottawa founded the anti-Maduro Lima Group coalition with Peru. Amidst discussions between the two countries foreign ministers in Spring 2017, Trudeau called his Peruvian counterpart, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, to “‎stress the need for dialogue and respect for the democratic rights of Venezuelan citizens, as enshrined in the charter of the Organization of American States and the Inter-American Democratic Charter.” But the Lima Group was established as a structure outside of the OAS largely because that organization’s members refused to back Washington and Ottawa’s bid to interfere in Venezuelan affairs, which they believe defy the OAS’ charter.

While many liberal Canadian commentators promote the idea that the Lima Group operates independently of Washington, their US counterparts are not deceived. In a story titled “Intervening Against Venezuela’s Strongman, Trump Belies ‘America First’” the New York Times described US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s influence over the Lima Group declaration of January 4 that rejected Maduro’s presidency. The paper reported that Pompeo is in “close contact with” Freeland “who has played a leading role in rallying global criticism of Mr. Maduro.”

The claim the Lima Group is independent of Washington conjures up a story Jean Chrétien recounts telling US President Bill Clinton in My Years as Prime Minister:

“Keeping some distance will be good for both of us. If we look as though we’re the fifty-first state of the United States, there’s nothing we can do for you internationally, just as the governor of a state can’t do anything for you internationally. But if we look independent enough, we can do things for you that even the CIA cannot do.”

While currently focused on Venezuela, the nascent Trudeau Doctrine has wider regional implications. Freeland has justified Canada’s aggressive interference in Venezuela’s affairs by saying “this is our neighbourhood” while Trudeau’s personal representative for the G7 Summits and recent appointee to the Senate, Peter Boehm told CBC, “this is our backyard, the Western hemisphere. We have a role here.”

Describing Latin America as “our backyard” is the language favoured by so-called Ugly American politicians seeking to assert the Monroe Doctrine. Latin Americans should beware of the emergence of Ugly Canadians promoting the Trudeau Doctrine.

On February 23 protests are planned in Canada and around the world calling for “No War on Venezuela!”

As with the other two debates, emotions ran high when the subject came to immigration and refugee resettlement. The debate, hosted by the Ismaili Centre on Canada Way, was interrupted by hecklers who shouted at candidates and each other several times.

The emotionally charged debate came just six days before the byelection that could see Singh gain his first seat in the House of Commons since becoming the leader of the NDP in 2017.

NDP and PPC clash on immigration

The most heated moment came as NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson exchanged pointed remarks about Canada’s immigration policies.

“I want everyone to look around this room,” Singh said. “Every single person in this room – except for the first people of this land – the rest of you are all immigrants or from a family of immigrants.”

The NDP leader said Canada “fundamentally” needs immigration. Canada needs to make its immigration system more transparent and must recognize the foreign credentials of skilled immigrants, he said.

Thompson followed Singh by saying most Canadians don’t want an increase in immigration and that the NDP and Liberals are “extreme in this regard.”

The PPC candidate then brought up the 2017 murder of Burnaby teen Marrisa Shen. The man accused in her death, Ibrahim Ali, was a refugee from Syria. There is no publicly known evidence to suggest Ali had a criminal record or other red flags that were missed by Canadian officials. He has yet to stand trial.

Thompson said Shen’s murder “demands that we be careful in vetting the refugees that come to our land.”

This prompted loud cheers and applause from a group of PPC supporters in the crowd, followed by a man wearing a Liberal button who stood and pointed at Thompson, yelling “That is racist! Shame on you!”

Audience shouting match breaks out

Thompson’s remarks cause the room to BLOW UP with screams of “Racist!” #cdnpoli pic.twitter.com/4teM1rDCc2 — Kelvin🐶Gawley (@KelvinGawley) February 20, 2019

The debate ground to a halt as audience members shouted at one another before moderator Jason D’Souza, a CBC broadcaster, got things back under control.

“Let’s acknowledge the emotions in the room,” D’Souza said, adding the exchange of ideas should remain on stage between candidates.

Liberal Richard Lee fought back tears as he tried to answer the immigration question. He said he has met with Shen’s family, who told him they don’t want their daughter’s death politicized.

“All I want to say is let the courts decide,” Lee said.

Most candidates favour immigration

Earlier in the debate, Lee said immigration must continue and be supported. He said he came to Canada in 1971 with his family under a family reunification program initiated by the Liberal government of the time. “Canada is a very compassionate country and we welcome immigrants, including refugees, to come to Canada and to contribute to our economy,” Lee said.

Conservative Jay Shin said he too welcomes more immigrants to Canada.

“I’m an immigrant, so obviously Canada is built on immigration,” he said. “So immigration is something we need to have, but what I support is legal immigration to Canada. “

Shin said the current Liberal government set arbitrary targets for welcoming Syrian refugees without the adequate resources to support them.

The Conservative also said Canadians shouldn’t let the emotions associated with Shen’s murder dictate policymaking.

Independent Terry Grimwood said Canada’s immigration system needs to be more fair. He said he’s met young people in the country on temporary work visas who want to stay longer but can’t.

“I’m all for immigration, and I just would like to see people being able to come here from all parts of the world,” Grimwood said. “It has to be balanced.”

Singh calls out ‘coded language’

A followup question about Shen’s murder and immigration policies brought another round of barbs between Singh and Thompson.

“We’ve got to call out the coded language,” Singh said.

He said people are treating the Shen case differently due to the race of the accused killer.

Singh said people are not using Bruce McArthur, a white man convicted of killing eight men in Toronto, to disparage white people.

“To use a horrible incident to incite violence or hatred against an entire community is wrong; It’s not something we should do as a society,” Singh said. “When people use a horrible incident to incite violence, they’re effectively saying that refugees are murderers.”

The room once again erupted following Singh’s comment, with loud boos and one man yelling “Stupid!” and “Idiot!” repeatedly.

Thompson said she was not being racist.

“I want to go on record as saying that if it was a white person who was coming into our country that was not properly vetted, I would be against that,” she said. “This actually has nothing to do with the colour of anyone’s skin.”

Candidates chart differing political visions

The debate also touched on housing, job creation and climate change.

Shin’s solution to several issues was tax cuts. He said the best way to make housing more affordable would be to grow the economy, which would in turn increase wages.

The Conservative also criticized the Liberal government’s purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline, saying that money could have been better spent on social programs.

Lee touted the Liberal record on a host of issues.

He said the Trudeau government is investing billions in its national housing strategy, as well as job skills training to strengthen the Canadian workforce.

The Liberal repeatedly mentioned he has lived in Burnaby for 32 years and represented the community as a B.C. Liberal MLA for 16 years.

As the debate wrapped up, hecklers once again interrupted as Singh answered a question about his connections to the riding. Two men, including former Burnaby First Coalition council candidate Alain Deng, said the New Democrat was lying when he said he lives in the riding.

The NDP leader is running for a seat in the House of Commons in Burnaby South, one of three federal ridings holding byelections today.

Many New Democrats believe it’s a do-or-die contest – that Singh cannot lead his party in this fall’s general election if he can’t get himself a seat in Parliament.

Singh is hoping a victory tonight will give him much-needed visibility in the Commons in the run-up to the national vote in October, and put to rest grumbling within the NDP about his underwhelming performance since being chosen leader almost 18 months ago.

But Singh’s problems go well beyond his lack of visibility on the main stage of federal politics. The former Ontario provincial politician has faced criticism about his seeming unfamiliarity with federal issues and his handling of internal caucus matters – particularly his decision to kick Saskatchewan MP Erin Weir out of caucus for alleged misconduct, which has infuriated many NDP stalwarts in the province seen as the cradle of the party.

Under his leadership, the NDP has plunged to its lowest standings in public opinion polls since 2000, when it won just 13 seats. The party is mired in debt and its fundraising is sluggish. At least 11 of the 44 MPs who won seats for the party in 2015 have announced they won’t seek re-election this fall.

While many NDP eyes will be glued to Burnaby South tonight, an arguably better gauge of the party’s election-year viability will be going on in Outremont – the Montreal riding vacated last summer by Singh’s predecessor, Tom Mulcair.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 byelection. His victory turned Outremont into a beachhead for the NDP, which helped to launch the so-called orange wave that swept the province in 2011 and boosted the party to official Opposition status for the first time in its history. While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

The betting among political insiders is that the Liberals will retake Outremont, which would be a welcome boost for the governing party’s morale in the midst of the SNC-Lavalin controversy – and a particularly bitter loss for the NDP. The symbolism of losing their erstwhile beachhead would only reinforce polls suggesting New Democrats are in danger of being wiped out altogether in Quebec this fall.

But the blow would be softened, at least, if Singh is able to capture Burnaby South.

It’s no sure thing. The B.C. riding is not a natural home for Singh, who formerly represented Brampton in the Ontario legislature. Nor is it a safe NDP riding: New Democrat Kennedy Stewart, who resigned to become mayor of Vancouver, took the riding in 2015 with just over 600 votes more than his Liberal opponent, with the Conservative candidate not far behind.

While the byelection is thought to be a three-way race, being a party leader should give Singh an edge. The fact that the Green party has chosen not to run a candidate should also help.

Moreover, the Liberals did themselves no favours by dumping their original candidate amid controversy over her suggestion that Singh being of “Indian descent” could help her win. The current Liberal contender, Richard T. Lee, could face headwinds of a different kind, created by the ongoing furor over allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould – who represents a nearby Vancouver riding – to halt a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

WATCH: Unpacking the politics of the SNC-Lavalin affair

The third byelection is being held in the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe, left vacant by the retirement of Peter Van Loan, who had held the seat for the Conservatives since 2004. He won with a healthy 50 per cent of the votes in 2015, and the Tories are expected to easily hang on tonight.

All three contests will give the Conservatives a glimpse of what, if any damage, they might sustain from the advent of the breakaway People’s Party of Canada, formed by one-time Tory leadership contender Maxime Bernier.

The company's lawyers acted so quickly to position their client for a so-called remediation agreement that they contacted prosecutors weeks before lawmakers, even Liberals, were even aware the Trudeau government had tucked the legislation into its 582-page omnibus budget bill.

The Montreal-based engineering and construction firm is at the centre of a controversy that has enveloped the Prime Minister's Office. Since last week, the government has seen the high-profile resignations of one cabinet member — former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, who became the minister of veterans affairs in January — and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's principal secretary, Gerald Butts.

SNC-Lavalin worked hard to avoid criminal proceedings by proposing a remediation agreement, but in September the prosecutor's office declined to invite the company to negotiate. A guilty verdict on bribery and corruption charges has been characterized as an existential threat for SNC-Lavalin and its employees because the company would be barred from bidding on government contracts in Canada for 10 years. Much of its work is in designing, building and operating public infrastructure.

The company lobbied federal officials, including in the Prime Minister's Office, to put remediation agreements into the law in the first place. The tools, known as deferred prosecution agreements in other jurisdictions, had already been enacted in the United States and the United Kingdom.

The Globe and Mail newspaper has reported that Wilson-Raybould came under pressure from staff in the Prime Minister's Office to step in and help SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution related to contracts in Libya.

Early in 2018, SNC-Lavalin wasted little time making its case for a remediation agreement with prosecutors.

Court documents filed last month by the firm's lawyers say they contacted the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ""in or about the month of April 2018, shortly after the Government of Canada introduced the proposed legislative changes to implement a remediation agreement regime.""

This would have been weeks before many lawmakers — including at least one Liberal — tasked with studying the amendment were even aware of its existence.

Seeking remediation

Last May, members of the all-party parliamentary committee examining the large budget bill said they only learned about the remediation-regime proposal after it was brought to their attention during testimony of a Justice Department official. Those included Greg Fergus, the Liberal MP for Hull-Aylmer in Quebec, who said at the time that he hadn't noticed the provision when trying to grasp the document.

While the company's effort began months before the amendment came into force last September, the documents say federal prosecutors declined to ""undertake formal steps towards a remediation agreement regarding this matter (or any other) prior to the enactment of the legislation.""

""The purpose of this contact, and of the discussions which followed, was to ensure that the (Director of Public Prosecutions) possessed all relevant information the applicants could provide in relation to the eventual issuance of an invitation to negotiate a remediation agreement, once the enabling legislation was in force,"" SNC-Lavalin's legal team wrote in the court documents, which were obtained by The Canadian Press.

From there, over the next three months, the documents say federal prosecutors engaged with SNC-Lavalin's lawyers and requested they provide detailed information. The company's legal team argued in the documents that it believed SNC-Lavalin easily met the criteria to receive an invitation to negotiate a remediation agreement — and it made ""repeated submissions to this effect"" to prosecutors.

A letter contained in the court filings shows that Trudeau met with Wilson-Raybould almost two weeks after federal prosecutors informed SNC-Lavalin it would not be invited to negotiate a settlement.

The letter shows the director of public prosecutions told SNC-Lavalin last Sept. 4 about its decision. Trudeau has said that he spoke with Wilson-Raybould about the SNC-Lavalin case 13 days later, on Sept. 17.

The Sept. 4 decision date adds new information to the timeline of events. Until now, it had appeared that Trudeau spoke with Wilson-Raybould before the prosecutor's decision not to proceed with the settlement negotiation. SNC-Lavalin publicly announced it had been refused a negotiation Oct. 10.

122,Empty,2019-02-23T09:00:00Z,"It is fitting that the Orange Wave's last stand will begin Monday, with a byelection in the Quebec riding where it all started, Outremont.","In 2007, Tom Mulcair — then in self-imposed exile from Quebec politics — pulled off an unlikely win in a federal byelection, taking the Liberal stronghold of Outremont for the NDP.

It was only the second time the NDP had won a seat in Quebec. But from this narrow beachhead, Mulcair and then leader Jack Layton dramatically grew their support in the province.

Their effort, of course, culminated in the Orange Wave, when the party won 59 of Quebec's 75 seats in the 2011 general election and stormed into Opposition.

Since then, though, NDP support in Quebec has slowly frittered away.

Under Mulcair's leadership, it was cut down to 16 seats in the 2015 election. Early predictions ahead of this fall's contest suggest the party won't win more than a handful of seats, if that.

It is fitting, then, that the Orange Wave's last stand seems to have begun with a byelection Monday in the riding where it all started: Outremont.

Mulcair's shadow

The seat became open when Mulcair quit federal politics last summer, after carrying much of the blame for the party's disappointing performance in 2015.

Julia Sanchez, a former international development executive who lived in Ottawa for many years before recently moving back to Outremont, is now carrying the NDP banner.

She acknowledged the former leader's shadow still looms large in the riding. His name, she said, ""comes up all the time. People were proud of Thomas Mulcair.""

One name that doesn't come up much in the riding, or elsewhere in Quebec, is the NDP's current leader, Jagmeet Singh.

His profile is particularly low in the province, and he was last spotted in Outremont in December.

Singh has been spending most of his time on his own byelection race in Burnaby South, where a loss Monday could be fatal to his leadership.

Sanchez, meanwhile, has been counting on support from the remaining local NDP heavyweights.

Montreal MPs Hélène Laverdière and Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet — two Orange Wavers who won't run in the next election — have been stumping for her. So too has Charles Taylor, the 87-year-old philosopher who has run for the party several times.

""If we can get our people, our base, out to vote … then we will win,"" Sanchez said during a recent interview at a cafe in the riding.

But the party's sympathizers are tempering their expectations ahead of Monday's vote.

""In this byelection the NDP is actually the underdog,"" said Karl Bélanger, a former NDP strategist who worked closely with Layton and Mulcair.

""If the NDP finishes with a strong second place, that would already be a win for the party.""

The most likely scenario on Monday, in his view, is for Outremont to return to the Liberal fold. Before Mulcair's win in 2007, the Grits had held the riding almost continuously since the 1935 election.

The Liberal candidate, Rachel Bendayan, a lawyer and former party staffer, ran against Mulcair in the last election, finishing second by more than 10 points.

This time, she said, she benefits not only from a bit of name recognition, but also the record of the Trudeau government, pointing to investments in public transit, social housing and the Canada Child Benefit.

The Liberals, though, are heading into Monday's three byelections weighed down by the controversy surrounding the government's alleged interference in the prosecution of Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin, which is accused of bribing Libyan officials.

Several recent polls suggest Liberal support has suffered in the wake of the scandal, and they are now in a dead heat nationally with the Conservatives.

Bendayan, though, doesn't believe the scandal is registering with voters in Outremont. ""I haven't heard much about it at the doors,"" she said.

A test of progressive bona fides

Outremont, in many ways, is an atypical riding in Quebec, so the results of Monday's vote may offer little foresight of what will happen in October's federal election.

French-speakers make up less than 50 per cent of Outremont's population, according to 2011 census figures. There are large communities of immigrants in one part of the riding; affluent francophones and progressive-leaning students in another.

Though the Conservatives, the Bloc Québécois, the Greens and Maxime Bernier's upstart People's Party of Canada are all running candidates, none of them is expected to be a factor.

It is, for all intents and purposes, a two-way race between the NDP and the Liberals.

With candidates for both parties indicating the environment is a major concern of voters, the Outremont byelection is providing a test of their progressive bona fides.

""People would like to see action on the environment, and they are very happy to have the leadership of the current Liberal government, particularly when we introduced the price on pollution,"" Bendayan said.

Sanchez, the NDP candidate, countered that the Liberals sacrificed their claim to climate leadership when the government bought the Trans Mountain pipeline.

""It really triggers disbelief, confusion and disillusionment,"" she said. ""How is it possible we spent all this money to buy an old pipeline?""

But the import of these policy differences may be offset by the low voter turnout that tends to characterize byelections, especially those in the dead of winter.

""That's when the machines come into play,"" said Bélanger, the former NDP strategist, referring to the organizational resources parties can mobilize on election day.

123,Empty,2019-02-24T16:50:21Z,Trump’s nationalism is jeopardizing the rights and safety of Chinese students. The post The Bitter Fruit of Trump’s China Bashing: Anti-Asian Racism appeared first on Truthout.,"Donald Trump’s New Cold War with Beijing has caught Chinese foreign students at U.S. universities in its crosshairs.

The Trump administration has tightened restrictions on their visas, accused them of spying for the Chinese state and its high tech giants, and in the process whipped up a climate of anti-Asian racism.

Trump’s policies yielded bitter fruit most recently at Duke University. The chair of the graduate program in biostatics, Megan Neely, in the wake of complaints from a faculty members about Chinese grad students “speaking Chinese (in their words VERY LOUDLY)” in the student lounge and study areas, wrote an email scolding students for speaking their native language.

She told students to “commit to using English 100 percent of the time” while in department buildings or “any other professional setting.” Even worse she warned them that if they didn’t it might impact their ability to get internships and jobs: “PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE keep these unintended consequences in mind when you choose to speak Chinese.”

This was not the first time that Neely had criticized students for speaking a language besides English in their private time. Last year she sent a message to all the biostatistics students saying, “I don’t like being the language police [but] … speaking in your native language in the department may give faculty the impression that you are not trying to improve your English skills and that you are not taking this opportunity seriously.”

She also warned of “potential downstream effects” that might compromise their professional advancement in the biostatics program and their employability.

These were no idle threats. The two professors whose complaints prompted her most recent email asked for and received photographs of the Chinese students from Neely with the expressed intent of discriminating against them.

Chinese students were shocked by this blatant racism. One PhD student in Chemistry, Chi Liu, said, “All of us are angry. We feel offended. You have this email to the Chinese students saying … if you speak Chinese you will be remembered and identified, and that will affect your performance. That is very serious.”

Duke’s Asian American Student Organization and International Association issued a joint statement that pointed out, “For international students, speaking in their mother tongue is a means of comfort and familiarity with a home and culture that is oftentimes suppressed within the United States. … Within the bounds of one’s personal conversations, people should wholeheartedly be able to speak any language they wish — to strip away this agency is demeaning, disrespectful, and wholly discriminatory.”

Neely’s shocking email provoked a wave of criticism at the university. A group of “concerned students” created a petition, which demanded the school investigate Neely and the two professors collected over 2,000 signatures from the campus community.

The uproar even spread to China. On the country’s equivalent of Twitter, Weibo, the hashtag “Duke University Bans Speaking Chinese” was viewed over 6.7 million times.

Caught in a spiraling scandal, Duke demoted Neely from her chair position and issued an apology. The dean of the medical school, Dr. Mary Klotman wrote, “To be clear: there is absolutely no restriction or limitation on the language you use to converse and communicate with each other. Your career opportunities and recommendations will not in any way be influenced by the language you use outside the classroom. And your privacy will always be protected.”

Duke may have resolved this crisis for now, but Trump’s New Cold War will only provoke more attacks on Chinese students. He has raised tariffs on China’s exports to the US, targeted its companies with sanctions and has begun a military buildup to confront Beijing.

Trump is extending his economic nationalist program against China into the higher education system.

Universities and colleges are directly integrated into the American state through funding as well ties to the military-industrial complex. As a result, the higher education system is linked to the interests of American capitalist class and its imperial domination of the world. Universities and colleges are what Hal Draper called knowledge factories that reproduce the ideas of the dominant class, generate scientific innovations for corporations, and also train different classes for their roles in ruling, managing and working in American capitalism.

During the period of neoliberal globalization, however, the US higher education has undergone a transformation both in function and student composition. First, it became increasingly internationalized, creating connections with higher education systems of other countries.

Second, the increasing privatization of public universities has opened them to a growing number of foreign students, especially ones from China. States across the country have cut funding, universities have dramatically raised tuition, and students have gone into massive debt—now over $1.3 trillion—to afford a degree.

In the wake of the Great Recession, both public and private universities have suffered declining enrollment as American students balk at the enormous debt entailed in getting a degree. Higher education bosses have made up for that drop by luring foreign students who pay full tuition, room and board to attend their undergraduate and graduate programs.

This isn’t simply lucrative for some universities, it’s essential at a time when many, including prestigious institutions like Hampshire College, are struggling to keep their doors open.

As a result, the total foreign students in universities has doubled in the last two decades to over 1 million today. Chinese students have grown the fastest increasing by five fold since 2000 to over 360,000, about 35% of the total.

The overall value of this trade in students is estimated at $42.4 billion for the American economy, a sum greater than the $21.6 billion exports in soybeans and rivalling exports of $51 billion in pharmaceuticals and $53 billion in automobiles.

Duke is an example of the overall pattern. In their master’s program in biostatics heretofore overseen by Neely, Chinese students account for 36 out of a total of 55, and, in the whole graduate program, 1,300 out of 8,500.

Unsurprisingly, the Chinese ruling class and state have used this opening to advance their interests. The Chinese elite are now sending students to undergraduate and graduate programs.

These students overwhelmingly enter undergraduate and graduate programs in sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (the so-called STEM disciplines) as well business administration.

After graduation, some stay and staff key sectors of American big business particularly in high tech while others return to China to bolster the competitiveness of the country’s corporations.

The Chinese state has encouraged their high tech national champions like Huawei to establish contracts with U.S. research institutions to bolster their standing as world leaders in research and development.

At the same time, the Beijing is worried that their students might be influenced by liberal and radical ideas that might encourage them to challenge the Communist Party’s autocratic rule back home.

Therefore, Beijing has established about 150 chapters of the Chinese Students and Scholar Associations on campuses throughout the US. These both organize social activities for students as well as keep tabs on them.

China has established Confucian Institutes on over 100 campuses to promote Chinese language and culture, provide services for Chinese nationals teaching in the US, and facilitate cultural exchanges. They also use the institutes to influence American the universities, registering protest against speakers the state considers anti-Chinese like the exiled religious leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama.

The Communist Party also attempts to influence American academics portrayals of China by threatening to deny them visas to visit and conduct research in the country. For example, Andrew Nathan and Perry Link, editors of The Tiananmen Papers about the Communist Party’s massacre student and workers to quell the uprising in 1989, have been denied visas ever since the publication of their book.

In response, Trump has initiated a campaign against the Chinese state and its corporations influence over universities as well as against Chinese foreign students, their rights and their organizations. Trump aims to discipline the nation’s higher education system to serve “America First.”

Trump’s lapdog Mike Pence’s announced this offensive against “the enemy within” American universities in his speech at the Hudson Institute. Pence warned, “The Chinese Communist Party is rewarding or coercing American businesses, movie studios, universities, think tanks, scholars, journalists, and local, state, and federal officials.”

Pence charged China with creating a “culture of censorship” in universities. He complained that “Beijing provides generous funding to universities, think tanks, and scholars, with the understanding that they will avoid ideas that the Communist Party finds dangerous or offensive. China experts in particular know that their visas will be delayed or denied if their research contradicts Beijing’s talking points.”

Then — in formulations worthy of the poster “Is Your Washroom’s Breeding Bolsheviks?” — he denounced “the Chinese Students and Scholars Association” for alerting “Chinese consulates and embassies when Chinese students, and American schools, stray from the Communist Party line.”

Of course, all of this reeks of hypocrisy. Trump and the right are enemies of academic freedom and scientific thought. They are conducting McCarthyite attacks against progressive academics as advocates of “cultural Marxism,” policing students and academics who are advocates of Palestinian liberation, waging war on the humanities, and are aiming to reduce the function of every level of education to the narrow interests of the American state and corporations in dominating the world system.

Double talk aside, Trump has already begun implementing his plan. He has issued an order instructing public universities to terminate all contracts with Huawei or federal funding would be cut.

And the schools have all obeyed. For example, the University of California at Berkeley has banned any further research projects with Huawei, which has donated $7.8 million to the school over the last two years.

Trump has extended the attack on corporation to Chinese students. The US intelligence agencies are warning universities that they are spying for Beijing and stealing intellectual property for its state corporations and national champions.

To put a stop to this supposed threat, he has denied and delayed issuing visas to Chinese students and threatened to reduce visas for those studying robotics, aviation, and high tech.

Trump’s racist advisor, Stephen Miller, almost convinced the administration to impose a total ban on Chinese nationals studying in the US.

Far from standing up against Trump’s China bashing and protectionism, the Democratic Party, including its progressive and even socialist wing, has joined his chorus. Elizabeth Warren, for example, has denounced against the neoliberal establishment for promising that open markets would bring about democracy in China.

She wrote, “Policymakers promised that open markets would lead to open societies. Instead, efforts to bring capitalism to the global stage unwittingly helped create the conditions for competitors to rise up and lash out. Russia became belligerent and resurgent. China weaponized its economy without ever loosening its domestic political constraints.”

Similarly, Bernie Sanders, who has become a spokesperson for progressive internationalism, has in fact long advocated an economic nationalist program against China.

In 2011, for example, he denounced the Smithsonian Museum for selling busts of American presidents made in China. He complained “that a museum owned by the people of the United States, celebrating the history of the United States, cannot find companies in this country employing American workers that are able to manufacture statues of our founding fathers, or our current president.”

More recently he supported Trump’s tariff war with China, writing, “I strongly support imposing stiff penalties on countries like China, Russia, South Korea and Vietnam to prevent them from illegally dumping steel and aluminum into the U.S. and throughout the world.”

Such nationalism can only breed anti-Chinese and more generally anti-Asian racism. Barbara Ehrenreich plumbed the depths of such bigotry recently when she tweeted, “I will be convinced that America is not in decline only when our de-cluttering Marie Kondo learns to speak English.”

This xenophobia is only the latest expression of the toxic history of anti-Asian prejudices and laws that began with the Chinese Exclusion Act and continued through the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the racist demonization of the Vietnamese during the US war on their country, and the recent bigoted caricatures of Koreans during Trump’s stand-off with Kim Jung-un.

Unsurprisingly, the American political class’s China bashing has triggered a sharp increase in anti-Asian hate crimes and discrimination. NPR reports that “hate crimes against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders are rising exponentially. A report from the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations found that crimes targeting Asian-Americans tripled in that county between 2014 and 2015.”

And since the Trump administration’s rise to power, they increased ever more. There was a 20 percent increase in hate crimes against Asian-Pacific Americans in 2017.

Trump’s Islamophobia, immigrant bashing, and hostility to foreign students and specifically Chinese students drove down international enrollment by 3.3 percent in 2016 and by 6.6 percent in 2017.

Indian graduate school applications dropped by 12% in 2017. While Chinese student enrollment is still increasing it has begun to slow from an increase of 8.1 percent in 2014-15 to 6.8 percent in 2015-16 and 3.1 in 2017-2018.

Those that remain have soured on the US. One study by Purdue University found that the percentage of foreign students holding negative views of the US jumped from 29 percent in 2016 to 42 percent in 2018.

One anonymous student told the South China Post, “More students, including myself, have even considered returning to China as a plan B if we can’t find a job in the US, and some of them are searching for jobs in China simultaneously.”

But, as the Post notes, “the job market for new graduates on the other side of the globe is not much better, as Trump’s trade war begins to cause sweeping lay-offs and hiring freezes in China’s tech industry.” These students are thus caught between two powers struggling for dominance in a crisis-ridden system.

With Trump tearing at the internationalized structure of American higher education and trying to push out Chinese students, some universities and high tech businesses have begun to worry about a possible drop in the pool of Chinese students they can recruit from.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign went so far as take out a $60 million insurance policy to protect against any sudden drop in Chinese enrollment.

The conflict between the US and China is also spilling into other countries with educational systems with large Chinese student populations. For example, when Trump forced Canada to detain Huawei’s the chief financial officer, Meng Whanzhou, on charges that the company violated sanctions on Iran, China responded by threatening to withdraw all its 77,000 students if Ottawa sent Meng to the US to stand trial.

Chinese students account for a large share of the 40 percent increase in foreign students since 2013. These pay an average of $27, 159 a year in tuition—4 times what Canadian residents pay—and spend over $15 billion a year in Canada. Thus, they are an important part not just of the country’s big business in higher education but also the broader economy.

Moody’s Investors Services went so far as to warn “that the intensification of political tensions between the Government of Canada and the government of China poses credit risks for Canadian universities.”

Back in the US, university presidents became so concerned that 65 of them penned a letter supporting a legal challenge to Trump’s threat to ban international students for overstaying their visas.

Some high tech bosses have similarly protested about the loss of access to foreign students in American universities. They point to the fact that about a quarter of new companies worth a billion dollars were started by moguls who first came to the US as students.

Thomas Harnisch from the American Association of State Colleges and Universities said, “International graduate students are pivotal to our economic system, these students go on, many of them earn master’s degrees and PhDs in many highly-needed fields. They’re incredibly important not only to our universities, but our economy as well.”

But the logic of the spiraling inter-imperial rivalry between the US and China will likely continue to pry apart the inter-penetration of their educational systems. The US is already trying to retool its own education system to yield more American talent in the STEM fields and China may redirect its students to its own rapidly improving higher education institutions and those of countries less hostile to it.

Amidst this intensifying conflict, socialists must take a clear stand against China bashing no matter whether it comes from right-wing Republicans like Trump or progressives like Warren and Sanders; it is rank American nationalism that binds workers to their exploiters against their fellow workers in China.

Instead we must unite just like the Duke students did against the racist attacks on Chinese students, defend their right to speak their language of choice, agitate against any restrictions on their visas, and build a movement among both native and foreign students and workers for our common interests against the university bosses, their capitalist masters, and their state overseers.

Such organizing will also open up opportunities to build the international workers movement. Some of these students are part of the developing new left on universities in China that has suffered government repression for organizing solidarity with workers on strike. They should be considered part of our emerging new socialist movement.

We should build this common struggle without in any way supporting the Chinese state, which is a rising imperialist power in the world system that oversees the exploitation of its own population, the oppression of subject nations like Tibet and national minorities like the Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang, and increasingly exploits third world countries in pursuit of raw materials and outlets for its surplus capital.

The slogan for our solidarity movement must therefore be: “Neither Washington, Nor Beijing, But International Socialism.”

But the still-developing SNC-Lavalin story and resignation of Jody Wilson-Raybould from cabinet is bewildering and does not fit traditional patterns of Canadian politics.

Three things stand out: The complex nature of the “scandal,” the puzzling resignation of Gerald Butts and the actions of Wilson-Raybould.

First is the nature of the “scandal.” A typical political scandal involves a person who did something wrong out of negligence or motivations of money, personal ambition, sex, etc.

But this is a much more complicated and abstract affair. No one is suggesting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his principal secretary Butts or anyone else in the Liberal Party did anything to line their own pockets, unlike the sponsorship scandal in the early 2000s in which the PMO turned a blind eye as many Liberals benefited handsomely.

Instead, Trudeau and Butts saw political advantage for the government to lighten up on SNC-Lavalin. There are political and economic interests that still clearly carry some weight in Québec.

In public affairs, what is legally wrong is not necessarily unacceptable politically, and vice versa. (For example, despite his outrageous spending practices, Sen. Mike Duffy was acquitted in 2016 of actually breaking the law.)

Alleged pressure

From a legal viewpoint, the issue here is the alleged undue pressure on the attorney-general — which, politically, is an internal matter no different from any other time the PMO throws its weight around. Indeed, this is how Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick recently characterized the entire matter.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld

From a political viewpoint, the more serious matter is the apparent demotion of Wilson-Raybould for not doing what the prime minister asked her to do, which, incidentally, is completely legal from a constitutional viewpoint. The economic dimension and the importance of SNC-Lavalin to Québec complicates matters even further, making this a unique multidimensional “scandal.”

The narrative is complicated and it’s not clear the story has caught fire with the general population. For example, one poll found that while 41 per cent of Canadians felt Trudeau had done something wrong in the affair, another 41 per cent said they weren’t sure.

Given the above muddled narrative, conventional wisdom suggested that the story might just drag out and diminish over time. But then came the bombshell resignation of Butts, which really defies past practice.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick

While other PMO staff have also had great power, they have ultimately been hired help; none have claimed such a deep personal friendship with the prime minister (Brian Mulroney hired many friends, but they generally did not rise to or stay at the top tier).

Nor have any of them played such a public role, like Butts’ independent activity on Twitter. In contrast, Harper’s four chiefs of staff avoided publicity so much that the media was forced to constantly run the same grainy photos of them over and over again.

Political triple play

It’s this triple play of power, friendship ties and public profile that made Butts so exceptional, and thus made it so startling to see him become the first to go in what had seemed a serious but not catastrophic matter.

As the Liberal Party learned to its sorrow after calling the Gomery inquiry into the sponsorship controversy, scandals are best smothered through equivocation and greyness rather than fanning the flames with dramatic action.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld

Butts’ resignation was pretty much the most dramatic action possible and fits no pattern, provoking expectations that there is another shoe waiting to drop.

Finally, Wilson-Raybould’s actions do not fit the pattern of a ministerial resignation. When a minister resigns, they usually either disappear from view to sulk or do everything they can to own the story at the expense of the sitting government — in extreme cases setting up a virtual government-in-exile, like John Turner in relation to Pierre Trudeau or Paul Martin and Jean Chrétien.

Wilson-Raybould has done neither. While complicated by solicitor-client confidentiality (and we do not know who the anonymous sources are that have fed the story to the media), Wilson-Raybould has not adopted the usual techniques of non-stop interviews and op-eds to tell her side of the story, or even a non-story of: “There is so much I wish I could tell you but I can’t say anything.”

Wilson-Raybould’s strategy unclear

Instead, Wilson-Raybould has generally taken the high road. It’s hard to think of another ex-minister asking to come back and speak to the cabinet she just left or appearing in Parliament and then, quite reasonably, abstaining on a vote about herself.

Her intentions and strategy — if there is one — are unclear. It is worth noting that Canada’s first Indigenous woman attorney general and justice minister is doing politics differently and not following the well-worn playbook of dozens of male ex-ministers whose actions have been highly predictable and easily explained by sheer ego and pride.

The SNC-Lavalin story is still developing.

As more information and new developments emerge, we may be able to better fit it into typical patterns of Canadian political history. But for the moment, the SNC-Lavalin affair stands on its own as a complex, multi-dimensional story and not a typical political “scandal.”

The motivations of the key players remain unclear, and its long-term implications, especially for the coming election, are unknown.",Is the SNC-Lavalin controversy truly a scandal?,Theconversation.com,http://theconversation.com/is-the-snc-lavalin-controversy-truly-a-scandal-112208

Most recently, we’ve seen attempts to silence dissent in Canada and Sweden.

At Canada’s McMaster University, Chinese students found out that Uighur activist Rukiye Turdush planned to give a talk on campus earlier this month about the detention of Uighurs in Chinese re-education camps. They contacted the Chinese Embassy to ask what they should do, according to The Washington Post. The embassy officials told them to see if any university officials attended the event, find out whether any Chinese nationals organized it, and send them photos and videos of the talk.

At the event on Feb. 11, a Chinese student filmed Turdush before shouting at her and storming out. A few days later, a bulletin signed by five Chinese student groups complained that the school hosted a “separatist” speaker critical of the Chinese government and demanded the university uphold its “duty of supervision.” Turdush is now concerned about the safety of her son, who attends McMaster. One Chinese student wrote in a WeChat group chat, “We should figure out who her son is.”

“The Chinese consulate, using these students, infiltrated [the] academic field in Canada,” Turdush told Radio Free Asia. “This is a war between atrocity and liberal democracy.”

Meanwhile, more than 10,000 people signed a petition protesting the election of Chemi Lhamo, a Tibetan student at the University of Toronto Scarborough, as student president. Chinese students berated her activism promoting Tibetan independence and left hostile messages on her social media accounts. Lhamo said she wouldn’t step down and hoped “this incident will make more people aware of freedom and democracy.”

China’s nationalistic Global Times newspaper applauded the “patriotic action of Chinese students” at both universities.

Over in Sweden, Angela Gui, the daughter of an imprisoned Chinese bookseller, faced a different type of silencing. The Chinese government kidnapped Gui’s father, bookseller and Swedish national Gui Minhai, in Thailand more than three years ago for selling politically sensitive books about top Chinese leaders. He remains in Chinese custody today.

Angela Gui wrote in a recent blog post that in January the Swedish ambassador to China, Anna Lindstedt, contacted her about a “new approach” to her father’s case. She invited Gui to Stockholm to meet with two businessmen she believed could help. For two days, Gui was told to stay in a members-only lounge in a hotel where “there was a lot of wine, a lot of people, and a lot of increasingly strange questions,” she wrote. The “businessmen” asked many personal questions without mentioning how they could help her father. But because Lindstedt was present, Gui assumed the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs had initiated the meeting.

The businessmen said they were negotiating her father’s case and that the bookseller might be released after a trial and short prison sentence. In exchange, Angela Gui needed to agree to stay quiet and stop speaking to the media about the case. According to Gui’s account, Lindstedt agreed to the plan and explained that “if activism and media coverage was to continue, China might ‘punish Sweden.’”

After returning to Britain, where she is studying for a Ph.D., Gui called officials at the Swedish Foreign Ministry and found they did not know this meeting took place or that the ambassador was even in the country. Once she told the businessmen she was declining their plan, they reneged on their promise to reimburse the cost of her trip.

After Gui went public about the incident, the Swedish authorities recalled Lindstedt to Stockholm and placed her under investigation. “We take these reports and other information about contexts where freedom of expression is not fully respected very seriously,” Rasmus Eljanskog, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, told The Washington Post. “The Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs always—and in all contexts—stands up for the fundamental right to freely express oneself, without the threats or reprisals.”",Silence campaigns,Wng.org,https://world.wng.org/2019/02/silence_campaigns

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is Sikh and wears a turban, making him conspicuously religious in front of a heavily secular province. His French is also weaker than the two previous party leaders, complicating the job of appealing to Quebec voters.

Even in multicultural Outremont, located in the geographic centre of the island of Montreal with one of the largest ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in North America, Singh’s religious clothing is on some voters’ minds. “Some people are concerned about (the turban),” Sanchez said during a recent interview following a candidate debate in the riding. She said when she knocks on doors, “It’s definitely not the main thing people bring up .... It does come up.” Kathryn Furlong, 43, who attended the debate, said she voted for Sanchez, an economist with experience in humanitarian work and climate activism, at an advance poll. She has voted Liberal in the past “but never by conviction. Sometimes to keep the out the Conservatives.”

She said “it’s a sad notion and a sad question,” referring to anyone who would have an issue with the NDP leader’s expression of faith. “And I think political parties in Quebec try to exploit that issue.” Read more: Liberals hoping Outremont byelection win will lead to big gains in Quebec come October Maxime Bernier names People’s Party candidate for Montreal-area byelection Outremont has been represented by the NDP since former party leader Tom Mulcair won a 2007 federal byelection in what had long been a Liberal stronghold. Through the rise and fall of NDP popularity in Quebec, voters elected Mulcair another three times.

Mulcair stepped down last August and is now a visiting professor at Universite de Montreal and a political commentator. The NDP is currently polling fourth in Quebec, far from its highs when Jack Layton helped the party win the majority of the province’s seats in 2011. McGill University philosopher Charles Taylor, a longtime NDP supporter who campaigned with Sanchez ahead of the byelection, said the cool reception Singh has so far received in Quebec is due to the fact he doesn’t yet have a seat in Parliament. Singh is his party’s candidate in one of the other two byelections Monday, in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

Once he gets inside the House of Commons and is regularly in front of the cameras, Taylor predicted, “Quebecers will learn to like him. He’s very engaging, but he’s just not on television all the time.” The Coalition Avenir Quebec won last fall’s provincial election with a promise to prohibit some public servants, including teachers, from wearing religious symbols on the job. But Taylor said Singh is “going to make a case for: ‘You can wear this kind of thing and be a perfectly reasonable person.’ And that’s something that Quebecers are able to listen to.” While an NDP loss Monday would further hurt the party in the province, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals arguably have more at stake. The party has 39 seats in Quebec leading into Monday’s vote and 179 nationally. Polling indicates Liberal support has declined across the country since the 2015 vote, and Trudeau is looking to pick up seats in Quebec to maintain his party’s majority in next fall’s general election. Outremont — where 36 per cent of residents are immigrants and 66 per cent are bilingual — is the kind of riding the Liberals must connect with in order to maintain their success in Quebec. Rachel Bendayan, a lawyer and former political aide, finished second to Mulcair in 2015. Her party has consistently led polls in the province since the last election. But in recent weeks it has been embroiled in controversy over allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office improperly pressured former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to help engineering giant SNC-Lavalin escape criminal prosecution. The Montreal-based company is charged with bribery and fraud over its dealings in Libya, and it has said a conviction could lead to job losses and make it vulnerable to foreign takeover. Bendayan said it is journalists, not the people she meets when knocking on doors in the riding, who are asking about SNC-Lavalin. “No, people are not raising it,” she said in a recent interview recently at her campaign office. “People here are concerned with issues that affect their day-to-day lives. You’d be surprised how many people talk to me about the ice on the sidewalks.” Tom Boushel, 72, a Liberal volunteer who will be driving seniors to vote on Monday, said he doesn’t think the SNC-Lavalin issue will have as much of an impact in Quebec as elsewhere. “Quebecers are sensitive to the risk of job losses,” Boushel said, adding that Montrealers appreciate the prestige of having a global firm headquartered in their city. Boushel said “every elected official of every party ... every government has to fight to keep SNC going. I think in Quebec, I think they understand a little better.” The byelection is the first test for the Bloc Québécois under its new leader, Yves-Francois Blanchet, who was acclaimed in January. The Bloc is hoping its candidate, author Michel Duchesne, will help the party become competitive once again in the riding. Jasmine Louras, a University of Ottawa law student, is representing the Conservatives, while James Seale, a veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces, is running for the People’s Party of Canada, the party Maxime Bernier started after he quit the Conservatives last summer.

They also discussed efforts to end the Syrian conflict.","Syrian President Bashar Assad has visited Iran, his closest regional ally, for the first time since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, state media reported Monday.



Assad met with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani, as well as other top officials in Tehran. It was a rare foreign trip for Assad, who has visited Russia twice since the outbreak of the conflict eight years ago.

Khamenei praised Assad for strengthening the alliance between Iran, Syria and Hezbollah against US and Western plans for the region.

""The Islamic Republic of Iran sees helping Syria's government and nation as support for the resistance movement and is deeply proud of doing it,"" Khamenei said.

""The creation of the buffer that the Americans are seeking to create in Syria is an example of these dangerous conspiracies which must be strongly denounced and resisted,"" Khamenei added.

Syrian state TV reported that Assad ""thanked the Islamic Republic's leadership and people for what they have given to Syria during the war."" The presidency said ""both sides expressed their satisfaction with the strategic levels reached between the two countries in all fields.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on 'I feel nothing' On February 1, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran from exile in France. When a reporter asked him how he felt upon his return to Iran, Khomeini replied: ""Nothing — I feel nothing."" Some analysts interpreted his remarks as the Shiite leader's idea about embarking on a ""divine mission"" where emotions hardly mattered.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on The Shah ran out of time Two months before Khomeini's return to Iran, an estimated six to nine million people took to the streets in the country's major cities. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, compared to the violent September 8, 1978, protests. The Shah regime, headed by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, had realized that its time in power was over and that they could not stop Khomeini's return.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Even women rooted for Khomeini The revolutionary mood was so intense in Tehran that even many women celebrated Khomeini's return, ignoring the fact that Khomeini had slammed Shah's measures for women's emancipation in exile. In 1963, the Shah of Iran granted women the right to vote.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on A spectacle of exuberance In 1971, the Shah and his wife Farah Diba (seen in the picture) staged a lavish spectacle on the ancient site of Persepolis to mark the ""2,500th anniversary of the Iranian monarchy."" Many heads of state attended the event. Khomeini, in his message from exile, condemned the monarchy as ""cruel, evil and un-Islamic.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Exile and death Under pressure from the Islamic Revolution, the Shah (left) had left Iran on January 16, 1979. After spending time in several countries, he succumbed to cancer on July 27, 1980 in Cairo, Egypt.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Consolidating power In the beginning, women's rights were not a major issue for the Islamic revolutionaries. They only imposed hardline Islam after consolidating their victory.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Soldiers join the revolution Upon Khomeini's return to Iran in 1979, the military did not confront the protesters. On February 11, the army declared itself neutral. Despite that, the revolutionaries executed several generals in February and April.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on New government Soon after his return, Khomeini declared the monarchy, the previous government and parliament illegal, and said he would appoint a government ""because of the fact that this nation believes in me."" According to Iran experts, it was not self-deception but reality.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on The liberal face of the revolution Mehdi Bazargan, a scholar and pro-democracy activist, had campaigned against the Pahlavi dynasty, for which he had been incarcerated for several years. Khomeini appointed him as his first prime minister, although Bazargan was critical of him as well. Bazargan had called Khomeini a ""turbaned Shah"" after a meeting with the Ayatollah in Paris. He remained in office for only nine months.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Occupation of the US Embassy In November 1979, radical Iranian students seized the US Embassy in Tehran and took the embassy staff hostage. The students were fearful of Shah's return to power with US help. Khomeini took advantage of the situation. He dismissed his opponents as ""US allies.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Ali Khamenei – guardian of the revolution In 1989, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was elected by the expert council to succeed Khomeini. Khamenei, to this date, has the ultimate power over all state institutions. Although the 79-year-old does not have the same charisma as his predecessor, he represents the policies of Iranian hardliners who refuse to reform the system and continue to persecute dissidents.

Assad takes victory lap

Assad has retaken major cities and largely defeated rebels seeking to oust him with the support of Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah.

The regime now controls most of the population and about two-thirds of the country, excluding a jihadi-controlled enclave in Idlib, Turkish zones in the north and a part of the country controlled by US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces. Assad has vowed to bring all territory under the state's sovereignty.

Sitting in the room during Assad's meeting with Khamenei was General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force — the overseas arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) which has provided the Syrian regime with military and financial support.

During their meeting, Rouhani assured Assad that ""Tehran will be alongside Damascus in the stabilization, return of refugees and internal political process.""

The two presidents also discussed efforts by Russia, Iran and Turkey to end the Syrian conflict.

Iranian-backed Shiite militias have carved out a major role in Syria's security apparatus, and Tehran and Damascus have in recent months signed a string of economic deals that are likely to further increase Iran's long-term presence in the country.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Rise of Hezbollah Hezbollah, or Party of God, was conceived by Muslim clerics in the 1980s in response to the Israeli invasion of South Lebanon in 1982. The Shiite group has a political and military wing.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization National support against Israel Hezbollah emerged in the 1980s as an amalgamation of Shiite militias and played a major role in the Lebanese civil war. It used guerrilla warfare to drive Israeli forces out of South Lebanon — Israel withdrew in 2000. Israel and Hezbollah fought another war in 2006. Its defense of Lebanon against Israel had won it cross-sectarian support and acceptance in Lebanese society.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Backed by Iran Since its creation, Hezbollah has received military, financial and political support from Iran and Syria. Today, Hezbollah's military wing is more powerful than Lebanon's own army and has become a major regional paramilitary force.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Political apparatus Hezbollah turned its focus to politics following the end of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. It represents a large section of the Lebanese Shiite population and is allied with other sectarian groups, including Christians. Their political development has mostly come under Hassan Nasrallah (pictured), who became the group's leader in 1992.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Armed wing Unlike other parties in Lebanon's multi-sided 1975-1990 civil war, Hezbollah did not disband its armed wing. Some Lebanese political groups, such as Prime Minister Saad Hariri's Future Movement, want Hezbollah to put down its arms. Hezbollah argues its militant wing is necessary to defend against Israel and other external threats.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Terror group? A number of countries and bodies, including the United States, Israel, Canada and the Arab League, consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization. However, Australia and the European Union differentiate between its legitimate political activities and its militant wing.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Hezbollah enters Syria's civil war Hezbollah has been one of the main backers of Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country's civil war. Its entrance into the war helped save Assad, one of its chief patrons; secured weapons supply routes from Syria and formed a buffer zone around Lebanon against Sunni militant groups it feared would take over Syria. As a result it has won considerable support from Shiite communities in Lebanon.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Sectarianism Lebanon has long been at the center of regional power struggles, particularly between Saudi Arabia and Iran. However, Hezbollah's military and political ascendancy, as well as its intervention in Syria, have also helped stoke Sunni-Shiite sectarian tensions in Lebanon and across the region.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Renewed conflict with Israel? Iran and Hezbollah have increased their political and military strength through the war in Syria. Israel views this as a threat and has carried out dozens of airstrikes on Iran/Hezbollah targets in Syria. Israel has vowed to not let Iran and Hezbollah create a permanent presence in Syria. There is growing concern of another war between Hezbollah and Israel that could draw in Iran. Author: Chase Winter

Tensions with Israel, US

Iran's growing influence in Syria has increased the prospect of a conflict with Israel, which has carried out dozens of attacks on Iranian forces, Shiite militia and Hezbollah.

US President Donald Trump announced in December that all American forces would leave Syria, but US officials recently said between 200-400 troops would remain in the country to support US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces and prevent a resurgence of the ""Islamic State."" The US also has a base at al-Tanf, near the Iraqi border, where troops are expected to stay.

The decision to maintain a US troop presence is intended to prevent clashes between US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces and NATO ally Turkey. It is also viewed as an attempt to stop the Assad regime and Iran-backed militia from widening their grip over more of Syria's territory.

• We are surprised that no one has hit upon the obvious solution to the Jussie Smollett mystery: Brett Kavanaugh did it.

• Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar is running for the Demo­cratic nomination for president. She is a relative moderate — relative, that is, to the very recent trend in her party, which means that she would have counted as a down-the-line liberal only a few years ago. She does not favor free four-year college for all, she explained regretfully a few days after her campaign began, because the money has to come from somewhere. Reporters have been unearthing stories of her abusive treatment of her aides. If she continues to dismiss left-wing pipe dreams, a lot of Democratic primary voters may start yelling back.

• Elizabeth Warren plans to make it cheaper for American parents to use “high quality” child care, with taxpayers picking up the tab. It would be a mistake to believe that her plan would expand parents’ options. What the senator proposes would in­stead stack the deck, encouraging parents to choose the child-care arrangement, commercial day care, that they currently favor least, and penalizing parents who choose differently. The latter group includes families with stay-at-home moms, families that hire nannies, and families that rely on informal arrangements, often involving relatives. The Warren-for-president campaign is shaping up to be an expensive way for Americans to get something they don’t want.

• William Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts and Libertarian nominee for vice president, said he will run against President Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. Many of the voters who selected Trump in November 2016 had to overcome serious reservations to do it. Republicans who remain anti-Trump would also have to overcome serious reservations to vote for Weld. They would have to stomach a Republican who favors abortion, is unconcerned about threats to religious liberty, approves regulations on guns even when they cannot possibly have a significant effect on homicide rates, and endorsed Barack Obama. The future of the Republican party may be unclear at the moment, but surely this isn’t it.

• Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor of Virginia, continues to insist that he will serve out his term after first admitting and then denying that he appeared in a photo of a white man in blackface and a man in a KKK costume that graced his medical-school-yearbook page. He will devote his remaining time to racial reconciliation, he says. He has reportedly been reading left-wing tracts on race, and says his controversy highlights “ongoing inequities to access to things like education, health care, mortgages, capital, entre­pre­neur­ship.” It doesn’t, of course, but the meaning is clear enough: Most Virginians have never worn blackface, but they can all pay higher taxes to expiate Ralph Northam’s sins.

• Representative Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, wants to be perfectly clear about something: She doesn’t hate Jews on a case-by-case basis but only despises Jews corporately in the form of the Jewish state. On the matter of Israel, she checks each of Natan Sharansky’s 3-D boxes: delegitimization, demonization, and double standards. She also has a penchant for engaging in Protocols of the Elders of Zion–style libel and conspiracy theories regarding Jews and in particular Jewish Americans, whom she accuses of bribing Congress to act in Israel’s interests. Nefarious Jews, she has claimed in the past, have “hypnotized” the world in order to further the Jewish state’s wicked agenda. To which she added: “May Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” Like fellow freshman Representative Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.), who accuses Jewish Americans of having dual loyalties, she apparently falls naturally into the darkly conspiratorial Jew-hating mode of political thought, though she finds herself obliged to apologize for it from time to time. Anti-Semitism is ascendant on the left: Repre­sentative Tlaib recently was discovered to have written a column for Final Call, the newspaper published by Jew-hating weirdo par excellence Louis Farrakhan. He remains a favorite among such progressive leaders as Women’s March organizer Linda Sarsour. But Sarsour is not a member of the House of Representatives, although if she were she would fit right in with the Democratic caucus.

• Omar had a nutty first month in Congress. One of the things she did was tear into Elliott Abrams as a war criminal. Abrams is the State Department’s special representative for Venezuela. During the Reagan administration, he held foreign-policy posts concerning human rights and Latin America. Omar peddled the old leftist line — remember the Christic Institute? remember CISPES? — that the Reagan administration enabled right-wing death squads in Central America. In truth, the Reaganites steered Central America toward a democratic path and away from both right-wing militias and left-wing totalitarians. In 1988, Reagan was able to say, “The growth of democracy has become one of the most powerful political movements of our age. In Latin America in the 1970s, only a third of the population lived under democratic government; today over 90 percent does.” Ilhan Omar should learn this, and much else.

• If you would like to see the Green New Deal in miniature, turn your eyes to California, where ill-advised plans for a high-speed train connecting Los Angeles with San Francisco have been abandoned after tens of billions of dollars were wasted. A round-trip flight between the cities takes 90 minutes and can be had for as little as $149, so the importance of a bullet train as a means of conveyance was always mysterious. But it was never about travel: It was to be a symbol of high-tech, green progressivism instantiated through big, expensive infrastructure projects. And so it is. Newly elected Democratic governor Gavin Newsom, noting that the project had never been on schedule and already had doubled in price to $77 billion and rising, announced that the plan was to be abandoned. Hilariously, he says he intends to finish the first stage of the project, meaning that California will have spent billions of dollars on a high-speed train connecting Bakersfield to Merced — by 2027, in the unlikely event this happens on schedule.

• The Senate is set to vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill that would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive in the course of attempted abortions. Republicans in the House and Senate are pushing the legislation in the wake of Virginia governor Ralph Northam’s apparent endorsement of letting infants die, at least in some circumstances. Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.), the bill’s sponsor, asked for unanimous consent on the measure in early February but was blocked by Senate Democrats, who say the legislation is anti-abortion and, given existing homicide laws, redundant. Neither of these claims is accurate. Federal law does not do much to protect infants born alive in abortions, and Democrats are worried that if it did it would undermine the logic of unlimited abortion rights. So it would. In voting on this legislation, Democrats must choose between incoherence and infanticide.

• Numerous media outlets lit up in February with stories about taxpayers’ receiving smaller refunds than they did last year, the ludicrous implication being that the recent tax reform had hurt them. Think tanks across the political spectrum are unanimous in finding that the overwhelming majority of Americans will see a tax cut. As for the refunds, it is not clear that they will be smaller, on average, when tax season ends. If they are, it will mean only that tax withholding has become more accurate. A large refund means that a taxpayer has been sending too much money to Washington over the course of a year. Smaller refunds would be a cause for celebration in a financially literate country, something that much of our press is helping ensure we do not become.

• American birth rates hit a 30-year low. While popular explanations for the trend often posit that Americans want fewer children than in the past, surveys of women have suggested for five decades that they want more children than they have. As economist Lyman Stone points out in a recent paper for the American Enterprise Institute, what’s really behind the collapse is that Americans spend a lower and lower proportion of their fertile years married. Children and marriage are not as tightly connected as they used to be, and more’s the pity, but the link is still there. A society that ignores it is undermining its future.

• Amazon canceled its plans to site a new co-headquarters in Queens after local politicians objected to its wages and to the tax breaks the city and state were planning to give the company. Huge, successful companies such as Amazon increasingly want to be located in places with a lot of ambitious and highly schooled potential workers. But as the Queens debacle showed, those places need and therefore want those companies less. Amazon erred. So did the politicians. Targeted tax breaks have a poor track record at spurring development for cities and states, which are better off creating a welcoming climate for business across the board. As with the breaking off of many engagements, this one was probably for the best.

• Ryan Morgan is a quiet 17-year-old from West Bend, Wis., who likes the Green Bay Packers and hanging out with his girlfriend and aspires to work at the local water-utility plant after he graduates. Esquire featured him on the cover of its March issue under the cover line “An American Boy: What it’s like to grow up white, middle class, and male in the era of social media, school shootings, toxic masculinity, #MeToo, and a divided country.” The cover story shed some interesting light on this question. So too did the reaction to it. Outrage erupted on Twitter and spilled over onto editorial pages. Critics (who by and large had not read the piece) complained that it was published during black-history month, an obvious affront to blacks; that it presented a member of a privileged class as a victim; that it gave an undeserved “platform” to a white male, a breed from which we’ve heard enough. Ryan Morgan no doubt got the message: Sit down and shut up, because of who you are.

• In November, President Trump was asked who should be held accountable for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist. He answered, “Maybe the world should be held accountable, because the world is a vicious place.” But the world did not kill Khashoggi, individuals did — and someone ordered them to do it. In October, a bipartisan group of senators triggered the Global Magnitsky Act, giving the president 120 days to investigate who killed Khashoggi and what the consequences should be. The deadline has expired, with no credible response. There’s a line between being realistic about the Saudis and participating in a cover-up, and the administration doesn’t seem to be mindful of it.

• The U.S. is trying to deliver humanitarian aid to Venezuela. Nicolás Maduro is blocking it. C-17s carrying hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of food and supplies have landed in Cúcuta, a Colombian city on the border, but Maduro had the military close the road between the two countries. Millions of Venezuelans have fled the country thanks to the lack of food, while those who remain struggle to fend off starvation. What stands in the way of relief are a few shipping containers, and Maduro’s stubborn grip on power.

• U.S. officials have been warning European countries that allowing Huawei, the Chinese telecom company, to do business uninhibited could mean a downgrade in relations. A U.K. intelligence agency found, however, that it poses only a “manageable” national-security risk, according to a report in the Financial Times. The U.S. has it right: Last month a Huawei employee in Poland was arrested for espionage, and any data gathered by Huawei could easily become the property of Beijing thanks to a suite of recently passed Chinese laws. New Zealand and Australia have already banned Huawei from building their 5G networks, and Canada is seriously considering it. Time to listen to the former colonies.

• Raise a glass to Igor Lipsits. He is an economics professor in Moscow. His textbook was recently banned from Russian schools. A panel asked him to add lines that would “promote love for the Motherland.” Lipsits declined. “I’ve become unused to writing such things” since the fall of the Soviet Union, he said, “and I’m not keen to revive my skills at windbaggery.” He also said, “My conception of patriotism was formed way back in my youth. And it assumes work toward the development of the country and its people, and not praise toward those who are ruling it at the present moment. . . . I can’t change myself — I’m too old now for such ideological somersaults.” An honorable man is a valuable thing in any country.

• In December, Time magazine named a group of journalists its collective “Person of the Year.” Some of these journalists had been murdered; some had been imprisoned; and one was still at large, so to speak. That journalist was Maria Ressa, a Filipina who co-founded a news website called “Rappler.” It has been a thorn in the side of Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines’ strongman, and a boastful killer of journalists. His government has not killed Ressa, but it has arrested her, on trumped-up charges of cyber libel and tax evasion. Fame — in the form of Time-magazine covers, for example — is not a guarantee against murder. But it does help. May Ressa and her brave colleagues keep up their important work.

• The actor Jussie Smollett’s description of his alleged assault in the small hours of January 29 in Chicago was what P. G. Wodehouse would have called a rummy affair. Smollett, a gay black actor-singer who appears on the television show Empire, said two men suddenly jumped him shouting racist and anti-gay slurs, beat him (lightly, it seemed), and put a rope around his neck, then ran away as suddenly as they had appeared. In his initial account to police, Smollett left out a crucial detail that he or his representatives later supplied to the celebrity-gossip site TMZ: The men had shouted, “This is MAGA country!” as they carried out their fell scheme. Reasonable people had many questions about this supposed attack, which Smollett later attributed to his outspoken opposition to President Trump. Why didn’t he call the police on the cell phone he had in his possession? Why did he keep the rope around his neck for 40 minutes? Why did two men bother to attack him if they weren’t going to inflict serious injury or rob him? How did the two Trump-loving attackers know that their ideological foe would be in that place at that time, anyway? Sensible observers were anything but shocked when, on February 16, after an exhaustive investigation, police sources told CNN and several other news outlets they believed the attack had been staged with the aid of two brothers from Nigeria who were friends of Smollett and had accepted some $3,500 in advance payment. The same sources said they could prove that the brothers had purchased the rope. The previously voluble Smollett lawyered up and declined repeated police invitations to clarify matters in a follow-up interview. Hate-crime hoaxes do considerable damage to America’s social and cultural fabric and tie up police resources better spent on other matters. Should Smollett be found guilty of perpetrating a hoax, may he receive punishment in keeping with a serious offense.

• “Mr. McCarrick” is how the New York Times refers to him now. Pope Francis has laicized, or defrocked, Theodore McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C. After the Arch­diocese of New York deemed credible an allegation that McCarrick had sexually abused a minor in the 1970s, the Vatican removed him from public ministry last summer, and he resigned from the College of Cardinals a few weeks later. McCarrick’s reputation for sexually harassing seminarians was longstanding in the hierarchy. His case is a dreary illustration of separate but related concerns — sexual crimes under the law, and a range of sexual sins under Church teaching — that weigh on the faithful as bishops from around the world convene in Rome to discuss sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. Although by all accounts the incidence of abuse has plummeted since the turn of the century, the business of coming clean about past scandals remains unfinished. McCarrick has become an emblem of the crisis. Expect more examples to emerge in the years ahead.

• The Southern Baptist Convention has now had its Me Too moment. A comprehensive Houston Chronicle and San Antonio Express-News investigation found that hundreds of Baptist leaders and volunteers committed acts of sexual misconduct against roughly 700 victims. Misconduct included heinous acts of rape and child molestation. The allegations are deeply disturbing but, sadly, not surprising. There was never any reason to believe that sex scandals would be predominantly confined to the Catholic Church, and there was never any reason to believe that any church is free of evil people. It’s the church’s responsibility, however, to understand that fact and respond with alacrity to allegations of abuse. On that count, all too many Baptist churches failed. In response to the report, Baptist leaders showed entirely appropriate sadness and humility. Actions matter more than words, however, and every church must take very seriously the possibility that even trusted leaders and congregants can commit terrible acts of abuse.

• At long last, the Mars rover known as Opportunity has sent its final report back to Earth. After 15 years, it succumbed to a dust storm that kept it from charging its batteries with the sun’s rays. Since landing in 2003, it had roamed the red planet’s surface, sending home data; most notably, along with its partner, Spirit (d. 2010), it had conclusively established the onetime presence of water, which raises the tantalizing possibility of life on Mars. In the half century since Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon, space travel has come to seem routine, but the fact that Opportunity survived 15 years (more than 50 times its expected lifespan) in the harsh and unforgiving Martian environment, without even an oil change, shows that the can-do spirit of the lunar-landing program is still going strong.

• A Florida couple (we can tell you’re interested already) locked their keys inside their SUV at a shopping center. Their baby was also locked inside, which left the couple frantic but at a loss for what to do. Then a crew of work-release convicts, laboring nearby in their striped uniforms, noticed what was happening and offered to lend their expertise at breaking into locked cars to help the worried pair. A wire coat-hanger was procured, the convicts set to work, and in a few minutes the parents and child were reunited. A happy ending for all — except the convicts, who had to go back to prison at the end of the day. We’re not sure whether demonstrating that you’ve kept up your car-theft skills while incarcerated is something that will impress the parole board, but in this case we think it should.

• What should you do when confronted by a mountain lion who seems ready to pounce like a Republican on a Democratic gaffe? You probably can’t outrun it, but the other options are not much better: One source unhelpfully advises you to “stand firm and make an effort to look larger,” and when that doesn’t work, “fight back using any weapon at hand.” A man named Travis Kauffman, running on a trail near Fort Collins, Colo., took this last bit of advice literally when he was attacked by a mountain lion (admittedly a juvenile one, but still) and strangled it with his bare hands. He suffered serious wounds to his face, limbs, and torso, requiring 16 stitches, but as the saying goes: You should have seen the other guy. Oh, and after polishing off the mountain lion, he ran three more miles before someone gave him a ride to the hospital. Parks officials emphasize that attacks by mountain lions are exceedingly rare, and with badass opponents like Kauffman, perhaps it’s no wonder.

• When we put our colleague Reihan Salam on the cover of National Review a couple of months ago, a few outcomes seemed likely: 1) he’d take up modeling on the side; 2) he’d go into seclusion to escape the attention of his adoring fans; 3) he’d become the president of a major think tank. We are de­lighted that — so far! — it’s option 3. We are absolutely thrilled that he’s becoming the president of the Manhattan Institute. This is a perfect match: Reihan cares deeply about public policy in general and urban policy in particular. Anyone who encounters him knows he’s brilliant and creative, with a matchless knack for identifying talent and a passion for developing it. He has been an immensely productive colleague and dear friend, and we look forward to fruitful collaborations to come.

• “I’m not paid to be a nice guy,” John Dingell said. “I’m paid to look after the public interest.” From his perch on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, he subpoenaed federal officials, investigated government fraud, and exposed it, although his critics complained that in his zeal he sometimes misfired and defamed the innocent. An old-school northern Democrat, Dingell represented a swathe of southeast Michigan, where the automotive industry appreciated his allergy to over-regulation. Labor unions counted him a reliable ally. On social issues he was moderately conservative earlier on. He tacked leftward later but in any case never showed much relish for culture wars. When he arrived in Congress in 1955, taking the seat his father had held for more than 20 years, he picked up Dingell Sr.’s baton and began making the case for national health insurance, decades ahead of his time. His wife, Debbie, has held the seat since his retirement in 2015. No one has served in the House longer than he did, just months shy of 60 years. A senior senior statesman, dead at 92. R.I.P.

• Lyndon LaRouche began crazy and died redundant. The perennial presidential candidate — he didn’t miss an election from 1976 to 2004, even when he was in prison — began his political career as a member of the Socialist Workers party but also ran for office as a Democrat and an independent. Early in his career he authored a book of socialist political theory (Dialectical Economics: An Introduction to Marxist Political Economy) and remained throughout his life committed to the notion of an impending “crisis of capitalism,” which he proposed to address with policies ranging from the familiar (he was a Glass-Steagall man to the end) to the eccentric. He believed that British interests were at the heart of most of America’s problems, and the world’s, too. He was a trafficker in conspiracy theories ranging from the vile (he was a Holocaust denier and lifelong anti-Semite) to the absurd (that the Queen of England is a kingpin in the global narcotics trade). He was a figure of fun and a target of derision, as were his cult-like followers distributing his pamphlets in airport terminals and other public places. But his life’s great themes are ascendant in left-wing politics in 2019: socialism, anti-Semitism, paranoia directed at international financial institutions, and, of course, the conspiratorial view of worldwide political and economic affairs. Dead at 96. R.I.P.

• Pleading with his manager to write him into the lineup, journeyman Duane Kuiper needled him: And what about that brawl you lost to Eddie Mathews in 1960? The manager smiled. “You had to deal with Frank that way,” Kuiper later re­marked. “He could not tolerate guys that weren’t tough.” No one disputed Frank Robinson’s toughness: After Mathews punched him out, Robinson came back in game two of the doubleheader and, ignoring his swollen eye, hit a home run and a double. He made a diving catch in the outfield to rob Mathews of a base hit. Robinson broke through with the Cincinnati Reds in 1956 and led the Baltimore Orioles to the world championship in 1966. When he hung up his spikes in 1976, he had amassed more awards than we can list here. In 1975 he became the first black manager in Major League Baseball, for the Cleveland Indians. A managerial and coaching career of decades followed, interspersed with stints in the Orioles’ front office and capped by service in various positions with MLB. No man in the history of the game had greater range. Number 20, dead at 83. R.I.P.

• The outsider theme loomed large for Patrick Caddell, the burly, unvarnished, often grumpy political guru and pollster whose wisdom was central to electing a one-term southern governor president in 1976. Years of consulting Democratic presidential hopefuls followed, but the party man came to believe his party — increasingly ruled by coastal elites, fixated on green extremism, intolerant of its former base — had hollowed out. He was also confident a populist volcano was set to erupt, and sought to prove it: His extensive 2015 “Candidate Smith” survey exposed enormous disaffection with both major parties and overwhelming support for independent political leadership. Few believed his analysis. Events quickly proved him right. Pat Caddell will be remembered by many for his analyzing on Fox: abrupt, a temper ever on the verge, but relentlessly perceptive. His passions were not limited to politics: He deeply loved his daughter and grandchildren, America, Americans. The patriot was felled by a massive stroke. Dead at 68. R.I.P.

• When the Giants left the Polo Grounds for San Francisco in the late 1950s, the passions of many New Yorkers followed them west, and so soon did a fan. Local boy Peter Magowan grew up in Manhattan, where he rooted for Willie Mays and his teammates. As a young executive, he found himself eventually near the Golden Gate (helping run Safeway Corporation — he was its CEO for 14 years), where he could once again root, root, root for the old/new home team. And then, in 1992, the Giants’ owners hinted of moving to Florida. Once being enough, Magowan assembled a posse of investors and bought the storied franchise to keep it in the City by the Bay (he served as managing general partner until 2008). Then he orchestrated the construction of a new stadium, one of Major League Baseball’s finest, built without any public funds, to replace windswept and rundown Candlestick Park. Recent years found the welcoming supporter of this magazine and National Review Institute, and other conservative causes, in a relentless battle with cancer. Of that he never complained. In January, Peter Magowan succumbed, age 76, his final missives to us still showing all the signs of a most happy warrior. R.I.P.

• When he was in college, Ray Price helped WFB research God and Man at Yale. Naturally, we like to think that this was the high point of Price’s career. In any event, he graduated from Yale in 1951, the year the book came out. Price was a moderate Republican, going so far as to choose Johnson over Goldwater in 1964. In the next presidential cycle, Nixon asked him to write speeches for him — which he did. In the White House, Price was part of a famous, formidable triumvirate of speechwriters: Price, Safire, and Buchanan. Price was known for the graceful, high-minded stuff. He was a Nixon loyalist, perhaps to a fault. In Nixon’s post-presidential years, Price helped him with several books. Ray Price was a thoughtful gent, and a patriotic one, caring deeply about the United States, democracy, and a free world. Dead at 88. R.I.P.

CLIMATE

The Same Old Deal

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was supposed to be the Democratic party’s fresh new face but has chosen to launch her congressional career with some of the worst ideas from the 1930s.

Her “Green New Deal” is less a substantive legislative agenda than a marketing campaign for a utopian enviro-socialist sensibility that already was outmoded back when Barack Obama was pushing it years ago, and when Thomas Friedman was pushing it before him, and when the Communist Party USA was pushing it before him. Van Jones, quondam Maoist adviser to President Obama, wrote a book on the subject, The Green Collar Economy, in which he made the case for conjoining “our two biggest problems,” which we are to take to be climate change and the fact that some people make a lot more money than others. His program, which is now Ocasio-Cortez’s, will be familiar to any student of the history of socialism: a takeover of the “commanding heights” of the economy in the service of a romantic political agenda.

True to the socialist creed she professes, Representative Ocasio-Cortez calls for a series of ten-year plans aimed at putting the entirety of the U.S. economy under political discipline: The government will decide how goods are produced and how they will get to market, how automobiles and airplanes function, how agriculture is conducted. The 29-year-old congresswoman, who has no relevant experience, presumes to tell farmers and autoworkers how to do their jobs while in a state of pristine ignorance about what that work actually involves.

Setting aside the unpleasant history of socialist attempts to forcibly reorganize agriculture, there is much that is familiar — and wrongheaded — in this iteration of the Green New Deal, though we do appreciate its honesty in promising to look after the financial interests of “those unwilling to work.” That phrase appeared in a support document released by Ocasio-Cortez’s office — by mistake, she now says. But she may as well tell the truth about her program: It contains promises that no serious environmentalist believes to be practical (or likely even possible), such as cutting carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2030; giving every American a government-guaranteed job “with a family-sustaining wage, family and medical leave, vacations, and retirement security”; ending the use of fossil fuels in electricity generation while simultaneously eliminating nuclear energy, the most environmentally friendly source of such power; overhauling all manufacturing; retrofitting every building in the United States with . . . something; building a new electrical grid; replacing all the cars and trucks on the road; and much more.

Paying for that? A question for lesser minds, apparently.

One of the great weaknesses of progressive thought at the moment is the philosophy of “everything is everything,” the inane insistence that, e.g., climate change and abortion rights are intrinsically linked, that carbon dioxide emissions are a racial-justice question, etc. It is an affectation that reveals deficient thinking. There are things that need to be done to protect the environment, and there are things that need to be done in the interests of the poor and the marginally employed. Reforming the welfare system is a project probably best undertaken independently of any ten-year plans involving fine-tuning the methane-producing digestive systems of America’s livestock.

IMMIGRATION

Trump’s End Run

President Trump may be right in his legal analysis of his declaration of emergency — lose, lose, then win, maybe.

He’ll certainly be blocked by the lower courts and then have some chance to prevail in the Supreme Court, which may well be reluctant to adjudicate a conflict between the two branches of government or to second-guess the commander-in-chief’s determination about what constitutes an emergency or spending for a military purpose. (He will also access other pots of money that don’t require a declaration of emergency, and here he may be on much firmer ground legally.)

We oppose the president’s decision to declare an emergency and repurpose billions of dollars of defense spending to the border, purportedly to support the military, not because we are confident it will be ultimately blocked by the courts, but regardless of whether it will ultimately be blocked by the courts. Even if the president technically has this authority, using it explicitly to bypass the congressional spending power is an abuse of it.

The laws that the president will use were clearly written with some dire national-security event in mind that would make it impossible for the president to go to Congress with the necessary dispatch. We believe there is a crisis at the border, but obviously nothing of this nature, as witnessed by the years-long attempt by the president to get Congress to fund his border wall, including the latest drawn-out political confrontation and negotiation. The president isn’t acting unilaterally because he can’t go to Congress, but because he has done so and he did not fully get what he wanted.

There is much angst about the precedent that Trump is creating. We share it, even if it is rich coming from Democrats who didn’t raise any objection to Barack Obama’s “pen and phone” governance. Obama rewrote our immigration laws on his own to impose his unilateral amnesties. At least Trump has colorable statutory authority for his move; Obama had none.

Ultimately, if Congress wants to reassert its prerogatives, it can’t leave statutes on the table that can easily be exploited by the executive, and it must object to executive overreach even when that overreach suits its partisan purposes. Harry Reid didn’t care when Obama went around Congress, and it pains us to say that Mitch McConnell, ordinarily the Senate’s most rigorous institutionalist, is now publicly following Reid’s example.

This is no way to run a railroad, or to preserve what are supposed to be the guardrails around our constitutional structure.

OBITUARY

Jeffrey Hart, R.I.P.

Was there a better teacher? Most of Jeff Hart’s colleagues had not matriculated at Dartmouth, where he taught 18th-century English and his beloved moderns, Fitzgerald and Hemingway. But we all learned from him, about these subjects and so much else, via his articles, his reviews, and the flow of his casual talk. Learned, witty, spiced at times with an eyewitness touch (his story of W. H. Auden dropping his three-by-five cards before a lecture at Dartmouth, and being too many sheets to the wind to reorder them, was priceless: Auden made some interesting points, Jeff’s colleagues said, but wasn’t he a bit — disjointed?). Jeff also knew everything about tennis — he had played Don Budge — and college sports.

Like all great teachers, he was a great encourager of others. The conservative movement is filled with his protégés — Paul Gigot, Peter Robinson, James Panero, Laura Ingraham, Dinesh D’Souza. But he took an interest in all who came through NR’s doors, however fleetingly. We were always welcome speaking guests at Dartmouth, and houseguests of his.

At NR he was WFB’s indispensable right hand, ready to put together a magazine or run an editorial conference on the not-infrequent occasions when No. 1 had some other unbreakable engagement. Sparks could fly — Jeff was a bonny fighter, and his editorial prose showed it — but he guaranteed that the wheels would spin.

Ideologically, Jeff was a fan of Richard Nixon and his attempts to broaden the Republican and conservative coalitions along what Nixon called “new majority lines.” Watergate derailed that strategy, but Jeff was always alert for opportunities to resurrect it. Checking the boxes on intellectual litmus tests was never his thing.

It is only fair to him to say that he became disaffected from many of his former commitments during the tenure of George W. Bush. Part of it was cultural: Old Ivy League loyalties die hard, and though W. went to Yale, his Texas-Evangelical manners turned Jeff off. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars also struck him as costly debacles.

Jeff would no doubt have recalled a witticism of one of his favorite Tories, Dr. Johnson: When a butcher tells you that his heart bleeds for his country, he has in fact no uneasy feeling. Cynical? Perhaps — but also realistic, about men, politics, and the vanity of presuming that one can figure everything out.

What Jeff’s friends may remember most is his laugh. He laughed at your jokes, and he laughed at his own — in such a way, always, that you were welcomed to join in. Our thoughts go to his family, and his many, many former students. Dead at 88, R.I.P.",The Week,National Review,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/03/11/the-week-24/
130,Empty,2019-02-21T20:43:19Z,"No stranger to Vancouver, Shad spent several years on the West Coast earning a masters degree from SFU. He returns for a show on Thursday, Feb. 21 at Fortune Sound Club as part of his current tour. The post Shad brings new war stories to Vancouver for a night…","With Hip-Hop Evolution, Shad and his documentary crew circle back to the origins of rap. First screened as part of the 2016 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival and then picked up by HBO Canada and Netflix, the award-winning series traces the underground roots of hip-hop and its expansion into mainstream culture.

The first episode explores the birth of hip-hop on Aug. 11, 1973 at 1520 Sedgwick Ave., in the Bronx, New York City, where Clive Campbell (soon-to-be DJ Kool Herc) provided the music and MC’ed a back-to-school birthday party for his little sister Cindy. Girls got in for 25 cents. It cost the guys double. The party started at 9 p.m. Goofing around, Coke La Rock (who wasn’t yet Coke La Rock) picked up a mic and started “rapping” over his friend Clive’s funky, endless breaks.

From there everything fans out in the documentary series and other rap pioneers are brought into the story including Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five, Fab Five Freddy, Marley Marl, Afrika Bambaataa, Kool Moe Dee, Kurtis Blow, Doug E. Fresh, Whodini, Warp 9, DJ Hollywood, Spoonie Gee, The Sugarhill Gang and Russell Simmons.

Some of the interviewees became rich through their involvement with hip-hop while others never left the hood.

The second instalment in the series (which dropped Oct. 18, 2018 on Netflix) expands on the foundation story adding interviews with the likes of Public Enemy, Beastie Boys, N.W.A, Ice-T, Rakim, Big Daddy Kane and LL Cool J.

While Shad’s been working on Hip-Hop Evolution off and on for several years he’s not been neglecting his own music. A Short Story About A War, an ambitious concept album, came out in October of last year on Secret City Records.

No stranger to Vancouver, the Canadian rapper, whose full name is Shadrach Kabango, spent several years on the West Coast earning a masters degree in liberal studies from Simon Fraser University. He returns for a show on Thursday, Feb. 21 at Fortune Sound Club as part of his current tour.

He spoke to the North Shore News from the road (somewhere in Wisconsin) about working on Hip-Hop Evolution and the conceptual framework behind his new album.

North Shore News: In your Peabody Award acceptance speech you thanked HBO Canada and Netflix for supporting your ‘insanely inefficient process’ of putting everything together for the Hip-Hop Evolution series. What does the process involve?

Shad: It’s a challenging series to make because really the pioneers are the ones that tell the story. I’m there sitting with them but it’s them telling their story. It depends on the schedules of our guests but it’s worked out. Especially that first season. We got the most important pioneers: Herc and Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash and others.

What kind of research was done for the series?

We had a research team and probably the hardest part was the writing, by Rodrigo Bascunan, because it’s a difficult story to tell. Once hip-hop expanded beyond the Bronx and New York City it spread pretty quickly so to try and find a coherent way of talking about that expansion and growth and evolution of hip hop without being reductive or getting into myth-making too much is a challenging task. It required a lot of research and then really good writing (to bring it all together).

Herc was ground zero – he and others were inventing hip-hop music. They were pulling in influences from everywhere. It didn’t exist before them.

Exactly. Herc gave hip-hop the esthetic and the fundamental features like looping sections of music. He played a lot of James Brown, Latin percussion and a lot of flavours – that’s the essential element but then people like Grandmaster Flash very quickly perfected some of his techniques and expanded on them. Once you get outside New York you see hip-hop combining with different local flavours and really starting to grow into what we recognize now.

There were local scenes and then at some point mainstream players saw what was happening and got involved. Who were some of those people?

Most famously, Sylvia Robinson and Sugarhill Records. “Rappers Delight” is really the song that introduced most people to hip-hop. I think it sold something like 20 million copies, one of the biggest selling 12-inch records of all time. That’s 1979. After that you probably want to talk about Def Jam – Russell Simmons, Rick Rubin – they signed Run DMC, they signed Public Enemy, they signed the Beastie Boys. LL Cool J. That’s the first great hip-hop label, even to this day it’s hip-hop royalty.

When do you come into the picture? Who were your influences growing up?

In high school I was listening to Common, Lauryn Hill, Outkast – artists like that. That’s mid to late ’90s. Those are my biggest influences. They took music to another level for me at that time, as a 15, 16-year-old I didn’t know there were artists that were that soulful and that personal. They had that kind of depth.

In your new album there’s a strong jazz component.

My introduction to jazz was through those artists. Hearing artists like Nas, or Common, sample jazz. A Tribe Called Quest, as well. My introduction to jazz was through hip-hop.

Your new album wraps the tracks into a conceptual framework. What’s the basis for the storyline?

It started in Vancouver, actually. Something between a story and an image just occurred to me, I guess, as I was thinking through a lot of the tensions that I was seeing while living in Vancouver. This was in 2014, and as you know Vancouver is very unequal, and I think that’s where the story came into my mind. This picture of a desert world and this war, and the different factions fighting and their different rationales for participating in violence. There is one character I call The Fool that didn’t seem to believe in any of it.

I didn’t think at that time to make an album based on that story, it was just something that occurred to me and something that I was seeing everywhere in kind of a lens through which I was seeing the world. A year or two ago when it was time to work on a new album I thought, ‘let me try and make this story come to life,’ because it was just something that stayed with me. It feels real.

When did you record A Short Story About A War?

I made the album while we were doing a lot of filming for Hip-Hop Evolution. It was a two weeks on, two weeks off, kind of thing. I would be in the studio for two weeks and then on the road for two weeks. I think that helped the process. I find when I’m making music it’s nice to zoom in and zoom out, pretty intensely and then be able to pull back and get some perspective. Listen to what I’ve been working on and not get lost in the details.

Does zooming out also feed into the record?

That’s a good question. I think that it does. The story occurred to me while I was living in Vancouver but then I started to see it everywhere and that keeps feeding into the story. I was getting new understanding and layers of stuff as I was able to think about it more. I think it did feed into the process.

You’re bilingual. Does French factor into the creation of your own music?

Pretty much all my influences in hip-hop are English and that’s the language I work in the most. I rap mainly in English because that’s the language that I can really play with and bend the most.

You create content as a musician but also go behind the scenes and document the music with your series. That double duty seems like a rare combination of roles.

Most artists are at least amateur historians because we are fans and that leads you to be a deep listener. A lot of artists I know are kind of amateur music historians. My friends that are DJs are really deep with their knowledge of music. It feels natural to me. I am into making music as a fan. I’m not trained as a musician. I’ve learned everything I know by listening to the music.

The non-profit Confucius Institute has been operating in 28 New Brunswick schools, with more than 5,441 students taking part in 2016, according to the organization's website.

It is largely funded by the Chinese government and was introduced to New Brunswick in 2008, when Shawn Graham was the Liberal premier.

At the time, the New Brunswick government said the mandate was to teach and promote Chinese language and culture.

Dominic Cardy said the programs give a ""one-dimensional"" view of China. 0:54

But Cardy said it's clear to him the program's real mandate is to present a ""one-dimensional"" view of China and to influence students to only perceive the country in a positive light.



""Their job is to create a friendly, cheerful, face for a government that is responsible for more deaths than nearly any other in the history of our species,"" Cardy said Thursday.

""And I don't think in an education system that is supposed to be the vehicle that transmits our values to the next generation that showing that we're open to a government that behaves that way is appropriate.""

The program hosts teachers from China who have taught Mandarin, history and a variety of cultural practices, including calligraphy and arts in different classes across the province. The 28 anglophone schools include elementary schools and high schools in Fredericton, Oromocto, Bathurst, Saint John, Moncton, Dieppe, Rexton and Richibucto.

According to the Confucius Institute of New Brunswick's website, 5,441 New Brunswick students took part in the program in 2016. (Confucius Institute of New Brunswick website)

Cardy said he has already issued the Confucius Institute a letter of intent to discontinue the program. He hopes to have it gone by June.

He has also already informed Premier Blaine Higgs, as well as cabinet members, of his intent to remove the institute. Cardy is now reviewing the contract between the province and the Confucius Institute so he can terminate it.

""It's something that has concerned me. Not because of any feelings of dislike towards anyone in China, in fact quite the opposite. My concern is we have an institute whose job it is to put a very one-dimensional perspective of China into our schools

The organization has classrooms in 28 anglophone schools, including Fredericton, Moncton, Bathurst, and Saint John. (Confucius Institute of New Brunswick website)

Cardy says he's recently received five complaints from students who attended the Confucius Institute programs. Each told of topics in Chinese history that were off-limits to discussion.

""One of them tried to discuss Taiwan's recognition and the professor told him he was forbidden from having this discussion,"" said Cardy.

CBC News has requested a copy of the letters, as well as a copy of the letter of intent sent to the Confucius Institute.

CBC News and Radio-Canada also made several attempts to contact the Confucius Institute of New Brunswick. No email or phone calls were returned.

History of controversy

The move by Cardy to remove the Confucius Institute from schools follows similar moves in other jurisdictions. In 2014 the Toronto District School Board voted to remove the institute from their schoolsfollowing protests. McMaster University and the University of Manitoba have also removed the Confucius Institute from their campuses over freedom of education concerns.

Educators haven't been the only people to sound the alarm about the Confucius Institute. Seven years ago, CSIS issued warnings about the program. The agency suspected Confucius Institutes are used as spy satellite offices by China, according to a veteran Canadian operative.

Michel-Juneau Katsuya, a former CSIS Asia-Pacific bureau chief, compared the Confucius Institute to a 'Trojan horse.' (CBC)

In 2012, Michel-Juneau Katsuya , a former CSIS Asia-Pacific bureau chief, compared the Confucius Institute to a ""Trojan horse."" He said the programs were used by the Chinese government ""to carry out intelligence and spying activities.""

Defending the program

When Graham brought in the Confucius Institute, his government said it would also be a resource for companies wanting to do business in China.

Despite the criticism now, Graham said the program shouldn't be canned so quickly.

""To abandon the program today, simply by three or four students saying they weren't allowed to talk about Chinese politics, I think the better route would have been to undertake a review of the program,"" said Graham.

Former premier Shawn Graham says the current government should review the Chinese cultural program before kicking it out. (Gilles Landry/Radio-Canada)

""Make sure the rules are being followed,"" he said. ""Then you can make a better determination as a government how you want to send your first signal to that country.""

Graham now owns a consulting business, G&R Holdings, where he works with several Chinese businesses to increase trade between China and Canada's East Coast.

""Does China matter, or does China not matter?"" he asked.

""Today, the government of New Brunswick has to do business with China, so we have to be prudent and cautious during these heightened diplomatic times that show we want to respect human rights, and the federal government must continue to push for that.""",Education minister pulling plug on Chinese education program in schools,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/education-mnister-pulling-plug-confucius-institute-new-brunswick-1.5028098

This raises concerns that a foreign adversary may be intending to weaponise, or strategically release documents, with an eye towards altering the 2019 election outcome.

Read more: A state actor has targeted Australian political parties – but that shouldn't surprise us

While the hacking of party and parliamentary systems is normally a covert activity, influence operations are necessarily noisy and public in order to reach citizens – even if efforts are made to obscure their origins.

If a state actor has designs to weaponise materials recently hacked, we will likely see them seek to inflame religious and ethnic differences, as well as embarrass the major parties in an effort to drive votes to minor parties.

If this comes to pass, there are four things Australians should look for.

1. Strategic interest for a foreign government to intervene

If the major parties have roughly the same policy position in relation to a foreign country, a foreign state would have little incentive to intervene, for example, in favour of Labor against the Coalition.

They may, however, attempt to amplify social divisions between the parties as a way of reducing the ability of Australians to work together after the election.

They may also try to drive down the already low levels of support for democracy and politicians in Australia to further undermine Australian democracy.

Finally, they may also try to drive the vote away from the major parties to minor parties which might be more favourable to their agenda.

This could be achieved by strategically releasing hacked materials which embarrass the major parties or their candidates, moving voters away from those parties and towards minor parties. These stories will likely be distributed first on social media platforms and later amplified by foreign and domestic broadcast media.

It is no secret that Russia and China seek a weakening of the Five Eyes security relationship between Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. If weakened, that would undermine the alliance structure which has helped prevent major wars for the last 70 years.

2. Disproportionate attention by foreign media to a local campaign

In the US, although Tulsi Gabbard’s polling numbers rank her near the bottom of declared and anticipated candidates for the Democratic nomination, she has received significant attention from Russia’s overt or “white” propaganda outlets, Sputnik and RT (formerly Russia Today).

The suspected reason for this attention is that some of her foreign policy positions on the Middle East are consistent with Russian interests in the region.

In Australia, we might find greater attention than normal directed at One Nation or Fraser Anning – as well as the strategic promotion of Green candidates in certain places to push political discussion further right and further left at the same time.

3. Promoted posts on Facebook and other social media platforms

Research into the 2016 US election found widespread violations of election law. The vast majority of promoted ads on Facebook during the election campaign were from groups which failed to file with the Federal Election Commission and some of this unregistered content came from Russia.

Ads placed by Russia’s Internet Research Agency, which is under indictment by the Mueller investigation, ended up disproportionately in the newsfeeds of Facebook users in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – two of the three states that looked like a lock for Clinton until the very end of the campaign.

What makes Facebook and many other social media platforms particularly of concern is the ability to use data to target ads using geographic and interest categories. One can imagine that if a foreign government were armed with voting data hacked from the parties, this process would be all the more effective.

Read more: New guidelines for responding to cyber attacks don't go far enough

Seats in Australia which might be targeted include seats like Swan (considered a marginal seat with competition against the Liberals on both the left and the right) and the seats of conservative politicians on GetUp’s “hitlist” – such as Tony Abbott’s and Peter Dutton’s seats of Warringah and Dickson.

4. Focus on identity manipulation, rather than fake news

The term “fake news” suffers from conceptual ambiguities – it means different things to different people. “Fake news” has been used not just as a form of classification to describe material which “mimics news media content in form but not in organisational process or intent” but also used to describe satire and even as an epithet used to dismiss disagreeable claims of a factual nature.

Studies of propaganda show that information need not be factually false to effectively manipulate target audiences.

The best propaganda uses claims which are factually true, placing them into a different context which can be used to manipulate audiences or by amplifying negative aspects of a group, policy or politician, without placing that information in a wider context.

For example, to amplify concerns about immigrants, one might highlight the immigrant background of someone convicted of a crime, irrespective of the overall propensity for immigrants to commit crimes compared to native born Australians.

This creates what communication scholars call a “representative anecdote” through which people come to understand and think about a topic with which they are otherwise unfamiliar. While immigrants may or may not be more likely to commit crimes than other Australians, the reporting creates that association.

Among the ways foreign influence operations function is through the politicisation of identities. Previous research has found evidence of efforts to heighten ethnic and racial differences through Chinese language WeChat official accounts operating in Australia as well as through Russian trolling efforts which have targeted Australia. This is the same pattern followed by Russia during the 2016 US election.

Liberal democracies are designed to handle conflicts over interests through negotiation and compromise. Identities, however, are less amenable to compromise. These efforts may not be “fake news” but they are effective in undermining the capacity of a democratic nation to mobilise its people in pursuit of common goals.

The Russian playbook

No country is immune from the risk of foreign influence operations. While historically these operations might have involved the creation of false documents and on the ground operations in target countries, today materials can be sourced, faked, and disseminated from the relative security of the perpetrating country. They may include both authentic and faked documents – making it hard for a campaign to charge that certain documents are faked without affirming the validity of others.

Most importantly, in a digitally connected world, these operations can scale up quickly and reach substantially larger populations than previously possible.

While the Russian interference in the 2016 US election has received considerable attention, Russia is not the only perpetrator and the US is not the only target.

But the Russians created a playbook which other countries can readily draw upon and adapt. The question remains as to who that might be in an Australian context.",We've been hacked – so will the data be weaponised to influence election 2019?

133,Empty,2019-02-22T16:56:34Z,"This is too innocuous for the Americans, too wholesome for Latin America, too complicated for the Swiss and Scandinavians","The SNC-Lavalin affair is the quintessential Canadian controversy. It is alleged by unnamed sources that the former justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, was pressured to order her officials to assess fines rather than prosecute executives for financial crimes in the matter of SNC-Lavalin’s methods in seeking certain construction contracts in Libya, not a country where the Better Business Bureau rules commerce with an iron fist. At a later date, Ms. Wilson-Raybould consented to be moved to the position of associate minister of national defence and minister of veterans’ affairs, generally considered a demotion. When rumours circulated in the media about the propriety of allowing the company to pay fines rather than prosecute some of its executives, the prime minister defended the government, denied the rumours, and stated that the minister’s continued presence in the government was proof that the rumours were unfounded. The minister then resigned, but has since attended a full caucus meeting and had a calming effect on the Liberal MPs. She has said nothing publicly because of the delicacy of lawyer/client privilege opposite the prime minister, who has declined to waive the privilege. This is, in fact, bunk. The prime minister was not the client of the minister of justice in the SNC-Lavalin affair, and the prime minister doesn’t have any standing to waive anything on this subject, and his invocation of cabinet secrecy is twaddle, especially after the subject was aired before the entire Liberal caucus.

This is Canada, the land of Dudley Do-Right, and before him, of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald singing Rose-Marie in the Rockies

All government spokespeople deny any official misconduct or impropriety but the principal secretary and chief strategist of the regime, Gerald Butts, resigned, with the novel explanation that although nothing inappropriate had occurred, he thought the air should be cleared, so he walked the plank. This is the point at which this supposed scandal becomes uniquely Canadian. A minister belatedly resigns but informally continues to attend cabinet and expatiate on this issue and the government reinforces its protestations of absolute innocence of wrongdoing by the prime minister accepting the abrupt resignation of the most influential non-elected person in the government (and he also had a great deal more influence than almost all the elected ministers and MP’s).

I invite any reader to cite another country where a minister would consent to be shuffled down, maintain a complete silence while her father, an indigenous leader, has conducted an entertaining non-stop press conference denouncing the “white man’s justice,” although he has clearly gamed the system pretty well for himself, and the head of the prime minister’s office and closest collaborator of the prime minister resigns while proclaiming that nothing improper has been done and that he is only sacrificing himself to satiate the false accusers. This is too innocuous for the Americans and major European countries, too wholesome for Latin America, too complicated for the Swiss and Scandinavians, too discrete for Australia, and small potatoes for the Japanese. This is Canada, the land of Dudley Do-Right, and before him, of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald singing Rose-Marie in the Rockies. The story line of this scandal is absurd, but in its way, magnificently Canadian.

In so far as the aroma of scandal has arisen and been maintained at all, it is largely by the usual remarks about shabby Quebec business ethics and large companies being protected from the consequences of their misdeeds by their size and the political influence of their principals. Sales incentives of one kind and another are not confined to Quebec and it is often difficult to distinguish legitimate concessions to make a deal from outright bribes. In this case, the allegation of $48 million in bribes and $130 million fraudulently received is impressive in its quantum and does raise at least one eyebrow. But it is unjust and unseemly for media and public opinion to leap to the conclusion that a fine rather than an expensive criminal trial of uncertain outcome is craven and corrupt truckling to the fatcat chums of the Liberal party.

Everybody, especially in such a woolly state of affairs as this, deserves a presumption of absence of guilt

Such an event would not be unprecedented, but it should not be presumed. The theory being bandied about that SNC-Lavalin is being spared because prosecution would bankrupt it is spurious. Companies have to disgorge funds sometimes but they don’t commit crimes; people do, and everybody, especially in such a woolly state of affairs as this, deserves a presumption of absence of guilt. And if executives are fairly judged to have committed crimes, they face the sentences but the company continues in the hands of people with better judgment and ethics. SNC-Lavalin has had its ups and downs, but it is a legitimate Canadian international business success story and should not be summarily castigated as financially and ethically bankrupt on allegations as flimsy and unsourced as these. Nor, as a country, should we be in the business of trying to drive a large and successful company into the hands of the receiver. The receivers are a bigger gang of crooks than any corrupt executives in this country going back to the CPR scandal of 1873. The entire bankruptcy system of this country is an outrage and Wilson-Raybould should have done something about that when she had the chance.

Gerry Butts will be missed by this government. I disagree with many of his policy ideas, especially his irrational faith in renewable energy — both its efficacy and the need for it. He largely carries the can for the McGuinty-Wynne negative Economic Miracle in Ontario that almost bankrupted this splendid jurisdiction. And I assume he has had some hand in the unmitigated pipeline and indigenous peoples policy disasters as well. But he is a capable man and something of a likeable scoundrel, a continuator, to a degree, of the cynical and often humorous competence of the men who performed in comparable roles for former Liberal prime ministers King, St. Laurent, Pearson, and Pierre Trudeau: Jack Pickersgill and Jim Coutts.

It will be hard for the government to spin this one other than damagingly, and whatever Gerry’s policy shortcomings, he is an astute political tactician, taking his cue from David Axelrod and even Sol Alinsky, far from the most wholesome American political influences. Nothing less than an ingenious hard-baller could have kept the ramshackle McGuinty roadshow going at Queen’s Park as long as he did. There is another interpretation of events. Gerry Butts’ political virtuosity presumably remains available to the Liberals this election year. If the government makes it, he can earn and receive much of the credit, because it will certainly not be swept back in on its record. If it is reversed at the polls, he will not be burned on the funeral pyre, and will be able to mount another Mephistophelean effort with Justin’s successor, or even, as Jack Pickersgill did, and Jim Coutts almost did, make the jump to elected politics himself.

If Gerry Butts’ political career ends here, it will be an absurd anti-climax, unless there is a lot more to this than meets even the inquisitive eye. This is a strange, hardly believable, crisis, and it’s hard to see where it’s going. Whatever happens, the country’s sense of humour is unlikely to be disserved.

Higgs estimates that the government spent about $5,000 to fly him and a staffer to the province last weekend to attend a rally in the town of Moosomin, where he endorsed federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer as a future prime minister.

The event was one stop on a cross-country trek by a caravan of oil industry supporters and activists who argue the federal Liberal government isn't supporting Western Canada's energy sector.

""We can't seem to get it across to the federal government, but we have a future prime minister here who's going to get it across to the federal government,"" Higgs said at the podium, gesturing at Scheer.

Higgs spoke to support the caravan and to talk up his desire to revive the cancelled Energy East pipeline.

But his endorsement of Scheer appears at odds with the practice that government-funded trips not be overtly partisan.

""I guess that's a valid point,"" Higgs told reporters Thursday when asked about the comment. ""Should I be doing that or not? I've generally said what I believe in and what I think is going to get results.

He added: ""I'll probably keep doing that and I'll be governed by what I feel is right for the province and what's necessary to move our country forward. Maybe I'll cross the edge a time or two. It's possible.""

Opposition critics

Liberal MLA Roger Melanson said Higgs should not have been promoting Scheer ahead of the federal election during a trip funded by taxpayers.

""There's a really fine line between going to Saskatchewan and wanting to promote pipelines, and going to Saskatchewan with all the Conservative leadership of the country,"" he said.

Liberal MLA Roger Melanson says taxpayers should not have to pay for trips that are 'perceived as partisan.' (CBC)

""I don't think taxpayers should pay for any trips that are perceived as partisan for the Conservative party of New Brunswick or even of Canada.""

Green Leader David Coon said the premier's partisan remark is at odds with the image he has tried to cultivate.

""He says he's not a politician, and politics gets in the way of progress. … but at the same time he's very committed to working with [Conservative premiers] for a pipeline that goes against climate change action.""

Rally speech

Higgs spoke for about six minutes at the rally in Moosomin, talking about his knowledge of the energy sector gained during three decades at Irving Oil and his desire to see more Canadian oil refined at the company's Saint John refinery.

He also mentioned former potash mineworkers he'd met who had moved to Saskatchewan for work and told the crowd he'd be visiting one of his daughters who now lives in Moose Jaw.

The convoy left Red Deer, Alta., on Feb. 14, bound for Ottawa. It was billed as a pro-oil sector caravan, organized by opponents of a federal bill that would overhaul the federal approval process for major energy projects.

Some participants have also adopted anti-immigration rhetoric, something Higgs said Thursday he wanted no part of.

""I'm certainly not in that camp,"" he said. ""That's not the reason I was there at all. We're not supporting any of that activity. Our focus was purely on the energy sector.""

Moosomin was chosen as the location of the rally because it was where a major lateral line would have fed crude oil from Manitoba and the United States into the main Energy East line.

Melanson said if Higgs wants to promote the revival of Energy East, he should be travelling to Quebec, where opposition to the project remains strong. Higgs said he plans to do that.

TransCanada Corp. cancelled its Energy East application to the National Energy Board in 2017, citing new environmental criteria the board planned to apply to the project.

Former pipeline executives and economists say the business case for the project is now dead, though Higgs continues to talk about finding a way to revive it.

TransCanada is now applying for approval to ship larger volumes of natural gas from Alberta to Eastern Canada. That would use up much of the excess pipeline capacity it would have converted to ship crude oil as part of Energy East.

Given that Energy East was cancelled, ""I don't blame them a bit,"" Higgs said Thursday. ""I would be doing exactly the same thing.""

But he said if New Brunswick can develop its own shale gas industry, something he's encouraging, that could once again free up capacity on TransCanada's line for oil shipments.

The Liberals officially support Energy East but Melanson said that with TransCanada moving on to other projects, Higgs's lobbying may be futile.

""We can't stop the premier from trying to promote it, but at the end of the day we'll need to have a private-sector proponent that wants to invest the dollars for this pipeline to be built, and today we don't,"" he said.",Higgs admits he may have crossed line promoting Scheer on taxpayers' money,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/higgs-partisanship-andrew-scheer-tax-funded-1.5028522

Conservatives’ scandals are like ‘we used orphans to build napalm to dump on Algonquin Park’ but every Liberal scandal is like ‘to understand the depth of wrongdoing, first understand the role of the Deputy Minister of Fisheries.’” So said a @matttomic on social media, expressing the deflated expectations of Canadians hoping for a hot political story — Canada became a division of Lockheed Martin in 2011 and no one noticed! Misogynist Jason Kenney’s real name is Janice! — to give them a break from the Trump news onslaught that began in 2016 and is eating their ears.

Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick waits to appear before the Justice Committee meeting in Ottawa on Thursday. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

The SNC-Lavalin matter already sounded like puff pastry when it first appeared and now it is a crumb, a particle. The allegation was that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his staff were concerned less about legal niceties than about huge job losses should SNC-Lavalin be prosecuted over dodgy money in Libya — is there any other kind? — and perhaps lose 10 years of federal contracts. Out of concern for the public good, they may have mentioned this to the justice minister/attorney-general, who can decide, if she chooses, to defer corporate prosecutions. This whole matter is down to whether they talked to her forcefully or gently. Did they hint or did they hammer? Who knows? More importantly, who cares?

She should have foreseen the catastrophe of grovelling to the Americans by arresting Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in B.C. to help them pressure China. She did not. So it was even more important for her to consult the PMO.

This is not a scandal. It is not even an anecdote. It is the Ottawa equivalent of the Daily Mail’s claim of a national backlash against Meghan’s New York baby shower. It does not exist. Which brings me to the man who explained why it didn’t exist. He is Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant, who owned the room at the justice committee. He spoke without hesitancy, with clarity and candour, about a danger sensed by many Canadians.

Article Continued Below

“I worry about my country right now, I’m deeply concerned about my country right now and its politics and where it’s headed. I worry about foreign interference in the upcoming election and we’re working hard on that. I worry about the rising tide of incitements to violence, when people use terms like ‘treason’ and ‘traitor’ in open discourse. Those are the words that lead to assassination. I’m worried that someone is going to be shot in this country this year during the political campaign.” I too have worried about Trudeau’s town halls being a danger to him. I’d worry about Conservative leader Andrew Scheer’s if he had any. Scheer always looks like a man who has just put eyedrops in and is in that blinking transitory state. Pleasant enough, he is easily led into traps laid by the extreme far-right. Why else would he have appeared with the racist yellow vests on Parliament Hill? Wernick, who has served under many prime ministers, abhorred yellow-vest-style remarks by a Saskatchewan senator that would “incite people to drive trucks over people, after what happened in Toronto last summer” simply because they were Liberal. “I worry about the trolling from the vomitorium of social media entering the open media arena,” he said. We do too. Wernick said he most worries about Canadians “losing faith in the institutions of governance in this country” and doubting that Canada is still, as Chrystia Freeland has put it, a rule-of-law country. He then crisply explained the SNC-Lavalin matter. The rule of law is safe, he concluded. The discussions were appropriate and ethical. There is no two-tiered justice. Deferred prosecution agreements can be rationally applied. In other words, there is no there there. I agree. The SNC-Lavalin matter was a media creation in an election year, possibly done inadvertently to gin things up. It became a sly collective patchwork of insinuation. And now that Wernick has explained the complex role of the Deputy Minister of Fisheries, we Canadians can see that it just doesn’t hold up.

TOP STORIES

Partisan politics

New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs called Federal Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer 'future prime minister' at a pro-oil industry rally in Moosomin, Sask. (CBC)

New Brunswick taxpayers paid $5,000 to fly Premier Blaine Higgs and a staffer to Saskatchewan last week to promote pipelines and the energy sector. But during the trip, the premier attended a rally where he endorsed federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer as a future prime minister.

As Jacques Poitras reports, Higgs's comments appear at odds with the convention that government-funded trips not be overtly partisan.

""Should I be doing that or not? I've generally said what I believe in and what I think is going to get results,"" Higgs said.

Opposition MLAs criticized the partisan display.

""I don't think taxpayers should pay for any trips that are perceived as partisan for the Conservative party of New Brunswick or even of Canada,"" said Liberal MLA Roger Melanson.

Speaking of pipelines, TransCanada Corp., the company behind the abandoned Energy East proposal, is asking federal regulators for permission to ship natural gas from Western Canada through existing pipelines to Eastern markets, including Atlantic Canada.

Mystery drones

Residents in the Bear Island area say drones have been flying low over their homes. (Submitted)

It's a bird. It's a drone. It's a student from the flight college?

People who live in the Bear Island and Lake George area were alarmed by the presence of what was thought to be large drones flying close to their homes for months. The mystery UFOs — they were literally unidentified flying objects — would appear at night, hover low and circle houses and vehicles, residents said.

The machines raised concerns for privacy and questions about enforcing regulations on operating drones.

Well, with the help of the Mounties, we may have gotten to the bottom of the case. They were planes. RCMP confirmed that on at least one occasion the drone was actually a small plane from a flight school.

But not everyone is convinced.

Cannabis Corner

The government announced Brian Harriman's resignation on Friday. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC)

This week in cannabis-related news:

Brian Harriman, CEO and president of NB Liquor and Cannabis NB, has resigned from his post to take the job as chief operating officer of Sundial Growers, a privately held cannabis producer in Calgary.

His resignation comes amid low cannabis sales, employee layoffs, store closures and supply shortages just months after legalization.

In Saint John, the president of Crosby's Molasses announced he's starting a cannabis edibles business. James Crosby says the company, EYG Consumables, has applied for a licence with Health Canada and purchased a property in the McAllister Industrial Park.

Legalized edibles are expected to hit retail shelves later this year.

In St. Stephen, the owner of a proposed aquaponics farm shifted his vision from farming fish and ""leafy green produce"" to, well, another, more potent kind of leafy green produce. Tanner Stewart will use his system to grow cannabis while farming tilapia.

""You're creating an ecosystem essentially,"" Stewart said.

""It's plants and animals living together in an ecosystem providing what they need to each other.""

Climate emergency

Edmundston Mayor Cyrille Simard says the city's declaration of a climate emergency won't just be a symbolic move, but affect policy and long-term planning decisions. (CBC)

What do Vancouver, Halifax and Edmundston have in common? Besides producing celebrities (#RochVoisineForever), the cities have declared a climate emergency.

Mayor Cyrille Simard said the declaration, which calls for accelerating the shift to greener forms of energy, reflects the impact climate change is already having on the community.

""We see the impact on the ground, we see the cost of that,"" he said, pointing to torrential rains, flooding that's worse and more frequent, and invasive species.

He hopes other municipalities will follow.

The flood zone

The spring freshet is just around the corner, and officials, communities and now an insolvency trustee are urging folks to be prepared for another potentially disastrous flood.

In Jemseg, a group of volunteers will be hosting an all-day workshop to discuss ways to prepare for future flooding. The workshop, which starts at 8:30 a.m. Saturday at the Jemseg Lions Centre, will give residents the chance to recognize vulnerable areas of their communities and start thinking up solutions and prepare for another flood event.

The area was devastated last spring when the St. John River and Grand Lake swelled to historic levels.

Are you a waterfront resident? Be sure to read the handy financial advice offered by Kristi Neilsen, a Saint John-based licensed insolvency trustee.

Neilsen touches on creating a financial cushion, insurance providers and tips to ensure you're protected if a flood comes.

In Nauwigewauk, the province is moving ahead with plans to raise the only road onto Darlings Island — a road that's often flooded during the spring freshet.

But, as Connell Smith reports, in December the province purchased a home for $295,000 that was built on the flood-prone road three years earlier with approval from the province.

The cost of cancer

On Dec. 7, Marilyn Steele was told she could die of a rare cancer in three months. Her doctor said surgery wasn't an option in New Brunswick or Nova Scotia, so the Nashwaak Bridge woman headed to Florida to undergo the procedure.

She accumulated $144,000 in medical bills, and now her family faces the prospect of selling their house.

""We're not rich people,"" she said. ""We're both retired on a small pension. And the only asset that we have is our home. And it's a very modest three-bedroom bungalow in the country.""

A spirited musher

New Brunswick's Remy Leduc may not have won the renowned Yukon Quest, a 1,000-mile dog-sledding race from Whitehorse to Alaska; he was just happy to cross the finish the line.

His efforts during his first Quest earned him the Challenge of the North Award, which is given to the musher who best exemplifies the spirit of the race.

He's already planning for next year's race.

Crowley on Thursday was named honorary co-chairman of Pass USMCA, a coalition of business, trade and advocacy groups promoting swift passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement.

The coalition was launched earlier this month by President Trump’s former deputy chief of staff, Rick Dearborn.

Dearborn told The Hill that the coalition approached Crowley to join the effort and is focusing on getting Democrats on board with the president's trade agreement.

“I think that’s the smart focus,” Dearborn told The Hill. “There’s a lot of fresh new faces in the Democratic caucus [and we will be] providing them really good information, answering their questions, and ultimately I’m hopeful that they can see clear to be supportive of the deal.

""In the end, I think it will pass,” he predicted.

Trump signed the deal in November, setting off a six-month deadline for Congress to approve the pact.

Crowley was chair of the House Democratic Caucus for two years and was defeated by progressive Rep.

“He is someone that knows how to actually build bridges and work to get things done. I’m a conservative Republican, he’s a much more liberal Democrat, but I think we can both agree, along with Gov. Locke, that this trade deal’s extremely important, its passage swiftly is really critical.”

Gary Locke, the former Democratic governor of Washington and a onetime ambassador to China, is also an honorary co-chairman.

The coalition has 12 members so far, including the Household and Commercial Products Association, the International Association of Drilling Contractors, PhRMA, the Washington Council on International Trade, the Canadian American Business Council and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council.

There are other coalitions working to get the deal passed, and Dearborn said what makes Pass USMCA unique is “we have no conditions,"" calling their sole focus ""the quick and clean passage of USMCA.”

“I think our members feel that what was accomplished in these negotiations with Canada and Mexico was really significant and really, really good for American businesses, workers and our economy,” he said.

Dearborn announced his departure from the White House in December 2017, finally resigning in March 2018.

142,Empty,2019-02-21T18:48:47Z,,"Federal Conservative leader Andrew Scheer welcomed a small convoy to Parliament Hill and white nationalist Faith Goldy told Indigenous rights defenders to go back where they came from as the United We Roll protest descended on Ottawa on Tuesday and Wednesday.

“After four days of cross-country driving, the convoy mustered in Arnprior, Ontario, just outside the capital but got off to a late start Tuesday morning,” The Canadian Press reported. “With police escorts, its trucks, buses, and cars hit downtown Ottawa after the morning rush hour, disrupting the city only slightly.”

Mixed message fly as conservative politicians support #unitedweroll convoy, @mitchellbeer writes, as opponent warns if they'd looked closely ""they would’ve found a death threat directed towards Trudeau, they would’ve found examples of overt racism.""

But once they got where they were going, “scores of semis, pickups, and other vehicles occupied several blocks of the street in front of Parliament as about 150 people gathered in knee-deep snow on the Hill for speeches by organizers and a handful of conservative lawmakers,” CP adds. “About 30 police officers stood between the convoy members and a counter-protest that gathered nearby, focused on Indigenous causes.”

“We’re fighting for you. We’re standing with you,” Scheer told the protesters. “It is time that Canada has a prime minister that is proud of our energy sector,” he added.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's spokesperson Cameron Ahmad responded on Twitter, saying that Scheer ""had the opportunity to denounce the anti-immigrant & alt-right elements attempting to co-opt the movement he so proudly endorses"" but that he instead ""posed next to a billboard calling for the Prime Minister to be 'tried for treason.'""

“You’re not asking for handouts, you’re not asking for any privileges, you’re just asking for being sure that this country will be able to build pipelines. That’s important not only for you, that’s important for all Canadians,” said People’s Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier.

Goldy distinguished herself after Indigenous counter-protesters booed and name-called her when she attempted to speak from the back of a truck. “If you don’t like our country, leave it,” she said, according to a report by Vice News.

Yesterday, Scheer had the opportunity to denounce the anti-immigrant & alt-right elements attempting to co-opt the movement he so proudly endorses.



Instead, he posed next to a billboard calling for the Prime Minister to be “tried for treason”. This is not leadership. https://t.co/RG18KbUgRs — Cameron Ahmad (@CameronAhmad) February 20, 2019

Saskatchewan Conservative Senator David Tkachuk, appointed to the Red Chamber in 1993 by then-prime minister Brian Mulroney, urged the truckers to “roll over every Liberal left in the country.” He told HuffPost that “people aren’t driving all the way across the country to have lunch with their neighbours. They’re driving across the country because they’re worried about losing their home and educating their children. And that’s why they came here.”

“Pro or anti #pipeline no one should ever encourage a crowd to run over their political opponents. Senator David Tkachuk did just this today at the #UnitedWeRoll rally. Shameful behavior,” tweeted University of Ottawa energy culture specialist Patrick McCurdy in response.

“Half a dozen Conservative MPs and senators blasted the Liberals’ carbon tax and reiterated their support for the oil and gas sector,” CP reported. “They left out another of the convoy organizers’ complaints: that Canada signed a non-binding United Nations agreement on migration in December.”

Ontario's Progressive Conservative government got in early with a plug for pipelines and has been silent since the message got muddied.

Premier Doug Ford welcomed the convoy to Ontario with a tweet on Feb. 16 that said ""I support your call to build the pipeline and stop the job-killing carbon tax"" and another with a video of Ford shot at Toronto's annual automotive show.

United we roll! Stop the carbon tax and let’s get those pipelines built! #UnitedWeRoll pic.twitter.com/sYXtMVv7rn — Doug Ford (@fordnation) February 15, 2019

Stephen Lecce, Ford's parliamentary assistant and the province's minister for infrastructure, shot his own video to welcome the convoy to Ontario and tell the UCP MLA for Fort McMurray that Ontario had relinquished its veto right over pipeline approvals.

Neither Ford, nor Lecce spoke either in favour or against the immigration and race issues raised by the people in the convoy.

Natural Resources Minister and Edmonton-area MP Amarjeet Sohi was quick to point out the overlapping issues that continue to connect the convoy with a wider brew of racist and white nationalist causes—a problem that earlier forced fossil industry interests to abandon the organizing effort.

“It’s very unfortunate that the convoy that is here today, that their message has drifted away from pipelines to issues that are not relevant to the discussion on pipelines,” he said. “We will continue to focus on the real issues that matter to Albertans, which is building the pipeline capacity that is so much necessary for us to get our resources to global markets.”

This was the same tune Alberta's government was whistling in response to the convoy’s mixed messages. “What I know is that Albertans, not only in that convoy but Albertans across this province for at least two or three years now, have been doing a tremendous case reaching out to Canadians across the country making the strong case for why pipelines matter,” Premier Rachel Notley told reporters in response to a question from National Observer.

But “what I have said all along though is that we cannot stand with those that are delivering additional messages that are divisive and quite frankly not ones that we agree with.”

Along with pro-pipeline slogans, some of the messages displayed on protest signs or on the vehicles seeking to block traffic were calls for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to be tried for treason, claims that carbon dioxide emissions are not causing climate change, calls for tougher voter identification and against a United Nations agreement on migration.

The broader context for the protest could be seen on a placard on at least one of the trucks, which declared NO to “UN/globalism, carbon tax, tanker ban, dirty foreign oil, open borders” and YES to “Charge Trudeau with treason, Energy East, yes to pipe lines, look after veterans, photo ID & Canadian citizenship to vote.”

CBC said convoy organizer Glen Carritt, who owns an oilfield fire and safety company in Innisfail, Alberta, had to rebrand the convoy to try and get out from under the controversy. “Carritt originally referred to his group as the “yellow vest convoy” but renamed it United We Roll after it was linked to extremist elements,” the national broadcaster reported. Even so, “one of the group’s other organizers, Jason Corbeil, was forced to distance the group from a Sault. Ste. Marie, Ontario yellow vest group that had boasted online about being part of the convoy. A blog run by one of that group’s organizers includes calls for specific politicians to be executed, refers to immigrants as ‘sub-human’, and argues women don’t belong in politics.”

Carritt had tried to tamp down that message in an earlier interview with CP. “The core message is we need immediate action for our pipelines to get in the ground, to get to tidewater and to the rest of Canada,” he said.

But on Parliament Hill, one of the first speeches came from Saskatoon Yellow Vest organizer Mark Friesen, who talked about “federal policies as the results of agreements with the United Nations to implement its sustainable development agenda,” CP reported.

“You cut the head of the snake off, we get our country back, all of it, including pipelines built, including dumping the carbon tax, including getting rid of the migrant pact,” Friesen said.

Canadian Anti-Hate Network Executive Director Evan Balgord “expressed frustration with how the convoy’s more extreme elements have been overlooked by politicians and in media coverage,” VICE News reported.

“How many examples do I have to provide of overt racism and death threats?” he asked. “How many examples do I have to provide of the organizers of the goddamn convoy expressing support for hate groups before people will get it?”

“This convoy is a Yellow Vests Canada convoy, and any well-meaning pro-pipeline individuals involved are in fact legitimizing and breathing oxygen into the broader Yellow Vests Canada movement, which spreads hate, conspiracy theories, and death threats targeting Muslims, politicians, and other Canadians,” Balgord added in a CBC interview.

“A movement may try to distance itself and claim a project they think is innocent, but when you scratch the surface you realize it’s a vehicle of hate,” agreed McMaster University professor Ameil Joseph, who specializes in race theory, immigration, and mental health. He called Yellow Vests “a re-visioned white nationalist, white supremacist movement.”

Carritt and other organizers stressed the convoy was intended as a peaceful protest, open to anyone who was committed to non-violence. But “several of the organizers have expressed support online for anti-Muslim hate groups, like Soldiers of Odin, the 3-percenters, and several others,” Vice reported, citing Balgord. “The head of the Canadian Combat Coalition, an anti-Muslim hate group, was welcomed as part of the convoy.” And Yellow Vests Canada, with more than 110,000 members on Facebook, “has become notorious for hateful rhetoric about immigrants, and especially Muslims.”

“Since December, members have posted conspiracy theories about Muslims to the Facebook page, and refer to them using derogatory terms,” the HuffPost report added. “There is a post calling for Liberal MP Iqra Khalid to be deported, another saying ‘euro-Canadians’ should advocate for their ‘ethnic interests.’ Last month Facebook began removing comments from the page after Global News reported members were making death threats against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.”

Balgord said he doubted Scheer is unaware of the extremist views the convoy is fostering.

Scheer’s office didn't respond to a request for comment from National Observer.

“Your [political leader] doesn’t endorse a thing without a staffer looking at it. If they looked at this movement for even 10 minutes on social media, they would’ve found a death threat directed towards Trudeau, they would’ve found examples of overt racism,” said Balgord. “It’s that prevalent.”

143,Empty,2019-02-23T05:00:00Z,,"This report from Ottawa confirms that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould last September about the ongoing discussions between their government and SNC-Lavalin concerning the disposition of criminal charges against the company.

As your story notes, Trudeau “did not detail the whole conversation.” Why not?

His statement raises a critical unknown: What exactly did Trudeau say to Wilson-Raybould that prompted her question. I find it impossible to believe that her query came out of the blue and was not in response to something Trudeau said to her and that he is now extremely reluctant to repeat.

The story quotes Trudeau as saying, “When she asked me if I was directing her or giving her instructions in relation to this decision (as between a criminal trial or a deferred prosecution agreement) I told her, ‘No, assuredly not. It’s your decision to take.’”

Here’s hoping that the harsh spotlight on Butts’ machiavellian role will discourage any future repetition of allowing unelected appointees to run things behind the scenes in Ottawa.

It seems highly unlikely that those employees would fund such initiatives out of their own pockets. Once again, the key to unravelling sordid affairs of this nature is to follow the money.

The issue is not whether SNC-Lavalin should be prosecuted but what kind of penalty it should face. There are 50,000 jobs at stake here. Is it not the federal government’s role to protect those jobs?

When opposition politicians and other critics take shots at the federal government, hoping to score electoral points with voters, they have forgotten the big picture.

The former attorney general decided not to allow a deferred prosecution agreement, but chose to proceed with criminal prosecution that could lead to the demise of the firm (over a business practice that is illegal in Canada but is a necessary norm in Libya).

Why shouldn’t the PMO not have a right to seek a path where substantial jobs are protected while penalties are still imposed? How does making 50,000 people unemployed serve the nation?

Canadians care about jobs and how the federal government is improving their lives. All these political attacks on the federal government do not advance the needs of Canadians and show how out of touch the opposition politicians are with our needs.

First, the company is well-known to be a strong supporter of the Liberal Party. More importantly, the goods the company manufactures in Canada for export ensure a steady flow of money into the federal treasury.

Note that this includes war materials sold, indirectly, to Saudi Arabia. Does this not matter to us?

Alan Craig, Brampton

The job of the AG is a high-pressure one because it is her job to hear all sides in order to make a fair decision that benefits Canadians. The final decision is made by the AG alone.

There is no scandal if the PMO discussed the case or even indicated what outcome the government would prefer. There is only scandal if someone directed or told the AG what the decision had to be. The AG has to be strong, focused and independent enough to withstand pressure from all sides.

Gail Rutherford, Toronto

The only way to change a company’s culture is to punish the company, whose stock then drops. The shareholders then elect a more honest group of directors.

G.H. MacKenzie, Niagara Falls

In the pipeline showdown on Parliament Hill, again, jobs are at stake, but so is the environment.

These are serious dilemmas for all of us to consider and it looks like the opposition is merely looking at how to garner political support during an election year.

Stephen Bloom, Toronto

What we know so far is that Jody Wilson-Rebould as justice minister had “robust discussions” with the PMO regarding the SNC-Lavalin case and, in the end, it appears she leaned in favour of the rule of law.

If indeed the prime minister accepted the decision that he explained was Wilson-Rebould’s to make, why was she demoted? Why demote a minister who was Canada’s first Indigenous justice minister? What was the message being sent, and why?

As for Gerald Butts, his resignation does little to assist the prime minister, as it conjures up more questions than it answers and keeps the story on the front pages. Odd step to take.

Lloyd Longfield MP

February 20, 2019

Dear Lloyd,

I am a longstanding member of Science for Peace, Canada’s most renowned scientific community for peace research and advocacy over more than 30 years centered in the Department of Physics of the University of Toronto. Its co-founding president was George Ignatieff whose son later led the Liberal party of Canada. So the positions Science for Peace adopts are not marginal and very seriously thought through.

The attached brief position paper advocating withdrawal from NATO is the result of years of research, debate and vigorous membership discussion which represents the overwhelmingly supported position of Science for Peace. It rightly advises that Canada in NATO is now in repeated violation of United Nations Treaty and Declaration in military aggressions under international law, and the President’s covering letter emphasizes the need “to oppose global trends towards militarizing the many urgent and devastating humanitarian situations”. I urge you to communicate these issues to your constituency and colleagues in the knowledge that the position paper and letter have also been sent to the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister.

NATO’s increasingly warlike policies far beyond the North Atlantic regional alliance it was founded on, coupled with US-led demands for ever more needed public money to finance its non-defensive policies of nuclear and military domination across continents, are directly opposed to Canada’s common life and public interest, especially with Canada and the world’s environmental defence so threatened and underfunded at the same time.

This is a repressed turning-point issue of our age which the responsible federal government must come to grips with for its integrity as well as for Canada and humanity’s future.

Dear Prime Minister:

Re: Canada’s Withdrawal from NATO

Science for Peace calls on the Government of Canada to withdraw from NATO and to cease from colluding with NATO’s pretence of pursuing defensive goals. In addition, we urge the government to join in condemning NATO’s violations of international peace and security.

Finally, we call on the Canadian government to sign the United Nations’ treaty to ban nuclear weapons and to work towards dismantling NATO altogether. Canada can, and should, do more to oppose global trends towards militarizing the many urgent and devastating humanitarian situations.

I attach a brief position paper, prepared by Science for Peace, which explains the reasoning behind our proposals for a major foreign-policy shift by your government.

Yours sincerely,

Richard Sandbrook DPhil, FRSC

Acting President

Why Canada Should Withdraw from NATO

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed (1949) under a Treaty renouncing “the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” The Treaty calls for military action only in response to an attack upon a member. By reserving the liberty of deciding when military action is required, it usurps the authority the UN Charter supposedly confers on the Security Council to make such decisions. But NATO’s assault on world peace goes much farther. Plainly, its many military initiatives (as in former Yugoslavia in 1992 and 1999, and in Libya in 2011) and its military “exercises” threatening Russia on its very borders (up to the present) have violated NATO’s self-declared limitations. One might regard this as sufficient reason for a peace-seeking member nation to withdraw.

Almost from its beginning, NATO has committed a still more serious breach of the spirit and letter of international agreements: it systematically strives to impose its will by the threat of nuclear war. On the one hand, Science for Peace can not condone Canada’s adherence to an alliance which insists on its readiness to be the first to resort to nuclear arms (discussed, e.g., by the Arms Control Association); but on the other hand, even were NATO abruptly to accept the principle of No First Use, the use or threat of nuclear war even in retaliation incurs absolutely unacceptable danger to the survival of humanity and must be repudiated. The rationale of nuclear deterrence, far from shielding Canada or anyone under a “nuclear umbrella”, acts to multiply the ways a nuclear war may be triggered, and magnifies the destruction it threatens1.

Despite the increasingly potent threats to human survival through nuclear war and climate change, the public is largely uninformed by media, the government, and to a great extent within academia. Knowing the historical context is essential. With regard to laws and implementation of regulations that need to truthfully provide human security:

“The malleable, indeterminate, and oft-ignored ‘rules’ of the [U.N.] Charter concerning use of force can plausibly be marshaled to support virtually any U.S. military action deemed in the national interest. Limited or ambiguous U.N. Security Council approval, where available, is easily stretched.”2

In 1996 the International Court of Justice declared that “the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, and in particular the principles of humanitarian law”3 and yet there is silence about these threats coming from President Trump or implicitly from NATO’s first-use policy.

Similarly indeterminate and lacking in meaningful constraints have been the agreements around nuclear weapons. The U.N. Non-Proliferation Treaty has not resulted in sanctions or limit-setting in any of the states already possessing nuclear weapons and has not addressed former president Obama’s $1.1 trillion allocation for nuclear weapons proliferation. The public is uninformed about the significant escalation of danger since 1991: George W. Bush’s withdrawal from the Anti Ballistic Defense Treaty with the consequent development of a missile defense system that effectually increases NATO’s belief that after a first strike a missile defense system could stop a nuclear counter-attack and that a nuclear war is winnable.

Challenging the ambiguity and compromises of the U.N. Security Council in order to address the mounting threats of human extinction, non-NATO nations and civil society members joined together to implement a nuclear ban treaty. Canada, bowing to NATO pressure, did not even participate in the meetings leading up to the treaty. Canada is also bowing to NATO pressure to increase military spending.

Science for Peace calls on the Government of Canada not only to withdraw from NATO and to cease from colluding with NATO’s pretence of pursuing defensive goals, but to join in condemning its violations of international peace and security. We call on the Canadian government to also sign the treaty to ban nuclear weapons and to work towards dismantling NATO altogether and to oppose the global trends towards militarizing the many urgent and devastating humanitarian situations.

Lastly, it is the responsibility of an informed public to engage politically and demand the deep changes required for human survival.

Thousands have signed a petition to have her freed from the shackles of solicitor-client privilege. There are opposition calls verging on a chant to let her account of things be fully revealed. Political cartoonists have (insensitively and ill-advisedly, having missed the memos about #MeToo and MMIW) pictured her bound and gagged.

But here’s a question: Why didn’t former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould speak up publicly last spring — or at any other time during her three-plus years as Canada’s justice minister and attorney general — when the “deferred prosecution” instrument now at the centre of a national political storm was still just a self-serving idea championed by Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin, and then became a Liberal government proposal self-servingly slipped into its omnibus bill encompassing the 2018 federal budget?

Let’s dial the clock back to May 2018, when the House of Commons finance committee was debating that controversial mega-bill — the kind of overstuffed legislative package notoriously preferred by the former Conservative government of Stephen Harper, and which a future prime minister, Justin Trudeau, once vowed he would never, ever use because of its inherently anti-democratic nature.

Opposition MPs at the time argued that the DPA provisions should have been examined separately by the justice committee, where Wilson-Raybould might have been available for questioning about a law that prompted even local Quebec Liberal MP Greg Fergus — a member of the finance committee — to state bluntly: “We seem to be letting off people in white-collar crimes with a little slap on the wrist.”

Even local Quebec Liberal MP Greg Fergus — a member of the finance committee — stated bluntly: “We seem to be letting off people in white-collar crimes with a little slap on the wrist.”

That comment came during a brief Q-&-A session between committee members and Ann Sheppard, a senior Department of Justice official. The time pressures involved in approving the budget bill never allowed a proper debate to occur on deferred prosecutions, which allow for decisions in which companies charged with corruption pay a big fine, avoid a messy court case and — crucially — remain eligible for future federal contracts.

A Senate committee reviewing the budget did manage to arrange special sessions on the proposed DPA measures — but Wilson-Raybould ignored requests to appear.

“It’s very unusual to study a bill, especially in the criminal domain, and to not have the minister responsible appear before the committee,” Conservative Sen. Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu stated at the time. Recalling Wilson-Raybould’s absence from those May 2018 hearings, Independent Liberal Sen. Serge Joyal told the Canadian Press last week: “Now, of course, in retrospect … I can understand that she might not have been at ease with the overall issue of remediation (DPA) agreements and didn’t want to submit herself to questions in relation to that.”

So the budget bill — including the DPA provisions — was passed by Parliament in June without a public word from Wilson-Raybould.

But let’s dial the clock back even further to November 2015, just a month after the election victory that brought the Trudeau Liberals to power. That’s when The Globe and Mail first reported on the proposed DPA concept for Canada under the telling headline: “SNC-Lavalin seeks corruption settlement with Ottawa.”

The story rightly observed that the company’s bid to avoid prosecution would be politically challenging for a new government also committed to battling corruption: “It could be a key early file for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Minister of Justice, Jody Wilson-Raybould.”

But before the Globe broke the story this month about Wilson-Raybould feeling pressured to offer SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution deal, only one other news story over the past four years linked her directly with the DPA issue: a May 2018 Canadian Press article in which a Wilson-Raybould spokesman — not the minister herself — explained certain benefits of the planned legislation.

David Taylor told CP at the time that the agreements “are a way of holding corporations accountable while protecting ‘innocent third parties’ such as those who stand to lose jobs, pensions or investments in the event of criminal sanction.”

Still, Wilson-Raybould’s own views appear to be absent from the public record during the years when SNC-Lavalin was lobbying — relentlessly and eventually successfully — for the creation of a no-prosecution alternative to corporate corruption trials.

A search of the Hansard parliamentary archive reveals no discussion of DPAs by the former minister. And a record of public consultations in 2017 on proposed changes to Canada’s “Integrity Regime” — including the introduction of DPAs and other measures aimed at “expanding Canada’s toolkit to address corporate wrongdoing” — makes no mention of input from Wilson-Raybould.

Perhaps there’s a good explanation for her silence (at least in public) over that period, during three years of aggressive SNC-Lavalin advocacy and many months of Liberal law-drafting and budget-making. Perhaps it’s Joyal’s explanation, but we just don’t know.

All that happened long before Wilson-Raybould’s now-contentious discussions last autumn with Trudeau, then-PMO chief Gerald Butts, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick and others — the talks about which the ex-minister has been forced to remain, so far, infamously mute.

On the surface, though, it’s hard to square the noble mission Wilson-Raybould recently said she had assigned herself as justice minister and attorney general — to pursue a path of “principled independence,” to safeguard a justice system “free from even the perception of political interference,” to be “non-partisan” and “always willing to speak truth to power” — with her strangely tight-lipped approach to a DPA law drafted by her government at the bidding of SNC-Lavalin, once a marquee donor to the Liberal party.

We all know now how important this piece of legislation was for the Trudeau government. The prime minister and his officials evidently pushed hard enough to risk a damaging break with the justice minister — a high-profile Indigenous woman widely viewed as a cabinet superstar — over trying to offer a DPA to SNC-Lavalin even after prosecutors had balked at the idea.

We all know now how important this piece of legislation was for the Trudeau government. The prime minister and his officials evidently pushed hard enough to risk a damaging break with the justice minister — a high-profile Indigenous woman widely viewed as a cabinet superstar.

So what does “speaking truth to power” mean when you actually are a key part of the power — as the federal minister of justice and attorney general — that oversees the creation of new laws? Apparently for Wilson-Raybould, in terms of shaping and adopting the DPA legislation, it meant saying nothing out loud.

The frustrating silence of Wilson-Raybould about later events remains the most pressing political issue in the country right now. Trudeau wondered aloud last week (insensitively and ill-advisedly, according to some critics) why Wilson-Raybould hadn’t spoken to him last fall if she’d felt bullied by the PMO to go easy on SNC-Lavalin.

She now seems anxious to unburden herself of some troubling truths — she’s expected to appear before the House of Commons justice committee next week — but it’s still unclear how much she’ll be able to say or will choose to say about certain conversations.

What’s remarkable in the wake of this scandal is that average Canadians are only now engaged — a year too late — in a vigorous debate about the merits and pitfalls of the legislation that made it possible for federal prosecutors to even consider pursuing a DPA with SNC-Lavalin.

So in addition to getting answers about the political pressure Wilson-Raybould felt last fall over the SNC-Lavalin case, the justice committee should inquire about why she was so quiet for years about the deferred prosecution proposal that would eventually explode in this month’s crisis.

Oligopolies impair productivity, competitiveness, says business professor

NEWS ANALYSIS

The Liberal government is in hot water because of its alleged actions regarding SNC-Lavalin, a company deemed to be of national significance but saddled with a history of questionable conduct. The government’s efforts to assist the Montreal-based global engineering and construction firm shows how far it can go for such companies.

SNC-Lavalin employs around 50,000 people and earned $9.1 billion in revenue in 2017. In Quebec, the company is viewed by many as a crown jewel. It is but one example of a large Canadian company in which the government effectively has a vested interested in helping avoid ruin.

With a reputation of holding political sway in Quebec City and Ottawa, SNC-Lavalin is desperately trying to move beyond charges of bribing Libyan officials while avoiding crippling punishment.

Through remediation agreements (RAs) that came into effect in September 2018—a company may be able to avoid potentially harsher penalties imposed by a guilty conviction in a court of law.

According to The Globe and Mail on Feb. 7, SNC-Lavalin told the government it was in dire circumstances and needed suspension of criminal charges. Since the start of 2017, there have been more than 50 meetings between the firm and the feds on subjects of justice and law enforcement. The Globe reported that Liberal party insiders knew the 2018 budget’s introduction of RAs was meant to help out SNC-Lavalin, which gives an idea of the company’s political sway.

Hard Reality

Large companies having deep relationships with the government like SNC-Lavalin seem to play by a different set of rules from smaller firms struggling under regulatory burdens. The result is a less competitive and less productive economy.

The Canadian economy is small and concentrated in certain industries. A handful of large companies tend to dominate industries like banking, airlines, and telecommunications. This reality has the potential to create more hairy situations for the government.

“We [Canada] have so many oligopolistic companies. This is going to come up again. This is not the first time that a justice minister or prime minister has been involved in trying to … help a company get off the hook,” said Carleton University business professor Ian Lee in an interview.

The government desires a thriving economy and wants jobs to be created, not lost. It would not want SNC-Lavalin to suffer like Bombardier—another Quebec darling—did. The government granted hundreds of millions of dollars in interest-free loans when Bombardier ran into various difficulties; it has laid off thousands of workers.

“The more people that can potentially lose their jobs, the more quickly the politicians will react,” Lee said.

Companies like SNC-Lavalin and Bombardier have a special status, says Lee. “[They’re] so important to Quebeckers and the provincial government. That necessarily makes them important to the federal political parties,” he said.

Remediation Agreements

SNC-Lavalin faces a potential 10-year ban from government business. Lee says such punishment would have been too severe, but he has concerns about the newly introduced RAs being little more than a slap on the wrist.

Based on how RAs have evolved in the United States, Lee suggests a “mega fine” of 5–10 percent of assets along with a written public enumeration of the company’s wrongdoing approved by a superior court judge would be appropriate.

“We want the penalties to change their behaviour and other companies in the future,” Lee said.

So far no company has yet “benefited” from an RA through the government’s public prosecution service after the amendment to the Criminal Code came into force.

Uncompetitive Economy

In its report “Death by 130,000 Cuts: Improving Canada’s Regulatory Competitiveness,” the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said that of all the skills needed to do business in Canada, “perhaps the most important is learning to navigate government regulations and bureaucracy.”

And these regulations serve as a moat around large companies, which have the human and financial resources to navigate the regulatory quagmire. The number of federal requirements that impose an administrative burden on businesses went up from 129,860 in 2014 to 131,754 in 2015.

“Onerous compliance costs along with inefficient and unpredictable regulatory processes divert business resources away from more productive activities. This is especially true for small businesses, which lack the specialized and dedicated compliance resources of larger firms,” according to the report.

Canada has fallen to No. 14 on the global competitiveness index from No. 9 eight years ago. On the burden of government regulation, Canada ranks 38th. The country has become far less attractive to foreign investment, which would challenge larger companies.

“In the oligopolistic markets there’s a lot of hidden barriers that keep out foreign competition,” Lee said.

In Canada, 87 percent of the domestic market is controlled by two airlines and Canadians endure some of the highest airfares in the world, according to Mark Morabito, executive chairman of Canada Jetlines.

And of course, the big six banks own upward of 95 percent of total bank assets in Canada.



Lee says that the oligopolistic nature of Canada’s business landscape hurts the nation’s productivity vis-a-vis the United States and that more competition and foreign investment—which the Liberal government desperately seeks—will diminish the government’s influence over the business landscape.

“When you open it up to competition, it’s harder to get the government to protect you,” Lee said. “When you make the economy more competitive, it’s going to chip away at this kind of behaviour we’re discussing.”

Transparency is extremely important since the competitive marketplace isn’t able to keep everybody in check, says Lee, adding that this is why, more than ever, Canada needs a free media, academics, and NGOs that can ferret out bad corporate behaviour.

“When people know their behaviour is going to become public, it changes their behaviour,” Lee said. “I profoundly believe that.”

“Maduro declared in his February 4 Caracas speech: ‘Not one Yaqui soldier will enter Venezuela.’”

Is Trump contributing to a unique experience in protagonist democracy in Venezuela? If so, his administration and the Democratic Party supporting the U.S. elite’s Venezuela policy are in for a big surprise. On February 25, 2014 – five years ago! – BAR published my article titled “Obama’s Arrogant Interference in Venezuela and Resistance by a Participatory Democracy.” Over the five years of tampering, obstruction and suffocating sanctions, the Obama and Trump administrations have not been able to conquer Venezuela. Why?

The U.S.-centric mindset has been steeped in the white supremacist notion of the “chosen people” from the time of the Pilgrims. It consists, among other features, of the racist outlook that peoples in the “Third World,” such as Latin America, cannot take their destiny in their own hands. Since the publication of that piece five years ago, history — along with my experience during other short visits to Caracas and my close following of TeleSUR in both English and Spanish — has forced me to revise my appreciation of Venezuela’s unique experience in democracy. It has certainly gone up more than just a notch. As a result of U.S. policies, democracy in Venezuela has been crossing the Rubicon from participatory democracy to a protagonist one. While the two are similar, especially in comparison with the experience of the Diktat in the capitalist North, there is a qualitative difference. Any hesitation at this time to qualify Venezuela’s Bolivarian Revolution’s democracy as being “above all” – as Chávez predicted and desired – “protagonist and not only participatory” vanished on February 4, 2019 in Caracas.

“The main issue now is the right of Venezuela to its sovereignty and to choosing its own path without foreign interference.”

Many valuable articles have already been published in BAR concerning the legitimate election of Maduro in the last elections of May 2018 on the one hand and, on the other, regarding the violation of Venezuelan and international law, including the United Nations in “recognizing” its man in Caracas. Furthermore, the main issue now is the right of Venezuela to its sovereignty and to choosing its own path without foreign interference, irrespective of any other considerations. Moreover, within this optic, the principal reality – ignored by the international media – is the civilian military union as a key component of Venezuelan democracy. It is not recognized either by ignorance or by mere wishful thinking, as those who want to eliminate the Bolivarian Revolution know very well it is this union that blocks their plan.

Although it was not the first time that I had heard Maduro speak, his February 4 talk in that semi-private meeting with Venezuelans and foreign guests was a clincher. Among other points, he outlined in detail how he and the other leaders (whom I also met briefly in that meeting) have been and are today still working to organize and inspire — and in turn are being inspired by — all the sections of the armed forces all over the country, from pilots, navy to the army to the people’s militia. He pointed out that this civilian military union has been developing in the country over several decades.

“The principal reality is the civilian military union as a key component of Venezuelan democracy.”

To flesh this out, I would add that more recently in the 1990s Chávez spent considerable time and effort to build a civilian military union. The goal was to overthrow the U.S.- backed de facto dictatorship that had ruled for many decades through the “two-party system” — all too familiar to Americans — alternating from one discredited party to another… that also soon became disgraced and so on. On February 4, 1992, Chávez and other officers and civilian revolutionary leaders organized a coup to overthrow the corrupt wealthy political elite to be replaced by the Bolivarian principles of independence and social justice. It failed, but then Chávez returned from prison to declare to the people on state TV that “for the moment” [por ahora] the rebellion had failed. This now iconic image and perspective words had further cemented the union between the military and the civilian population who had never before seen a political-military leader ready to give his life for a new Venezuela.

This union rose to the fore again on April 13, 2002 when the civilian-military alliance brought Chavez back to power as the legitimate president after a short- lived US-backed coup executed on April 11, 2002.

“Maduro and the other leaders have been working to organize and inspire all the sections of the armed forces all over the country.”

What then is this civilian-military union, its history and tradition?

Chávez said that he found the idea of the civilian-military alliance in the political thought of the Venezuelan intellectual, guerrilla leader, Fabricio Ojeda, who wrote in his 1966 book La guerra del pueblo (The People’s War):

“The anti-feudal and anti-imperialist basis of our revolutionary process suggests a form of alliance that can accommodate differences in background, political credo, philosophical conception, religious convictions, economic or professional status, or party affiliation among Venezuelans. The strength and might of the common enemy calls for a united struggle to defeat it… The forces most inclined to fight for national liberation are the workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, students, intellectuals, and professionals as well as the majority of officials, Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs), and soldiers of the air, sea, and land forces…” In Ojeda’s vision, which Chávez shared, all these civilian and military sectors are called upon to come together in a genuine national revolutionary alliance. (Ramonet, Ignacio, Hugo Chávez: Mi primera vida. Conversaciones con Ignacio Ramonet, Vintage Español, Nueva York, 2013. [Translation by Arnold August]).

“The civilian population had never before seen a political-military leader ready to give his life for a new Venezuela.”

Today, more than ever before, in the face of a potential U.S. military intervention, this feature of the people being the authors of their ownBolivarian Revolution, rather than just participants in it, Venezuela is displaying a protagonist democracy to the world. It can be the death knell to any military adventure.

The U.S. should not be mistaken. While Maduro declared in his February 4 Caracas speech to us that his government is ready to participate in any efforts at mediation, he also made clear that Venezuela is ready to defend its country: “Not one Yaqui soldier will enter Venezuela.”

The threat of U.S.-led military intervention is more real than ever. The issue for us all: No to military intervention in Venezuela and full support for the right of Venezuela to defend itself in the worse-case scenario. Polls in Europe and other countries show support for this position, while the main unions in Canada have issued and are issuing statements rejecting the pro-Trump position of the Justin Trudeau Liberal Party position and demonstrations are taking place in the U.S.

“The strength and might of the common enemy calls for a united struggle to defeat it.”

The Justin Trudeau government hosted the so-called Lima Group in Ottawa on that same day, February 4, when we were in Caracas meeting with the Maduro government leadership. The official communiqué reaffirmed its support for the Trump position on Venezuela, consisting of foreign interference in the internal affairs of that country with full support of its puppet as the so-called president. The position of the Justin Trudeau government is a major and historical (in the very negative sense of the term)changein Canadian foreign policy, including within his own Liberal Party.In contrast for example, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War (March 2013) former Liberal Party Prime Minister Jean Chrétien said in an interview regarding Canada’s position to NOT support the U.S. war in Iraq, that he [Chrétien]has no regrets about rejecting Canada’s participation in the U.S.-led mission. It was a very important decision, no doubt about it. It was, in fact, the first time ever that there was a war that the Brits and the Americans were involved, and Canada was not there, Chrétien told CTV’s [Canadian national news network] Power Play.

The move also helped assert Canada’s independence on the world stage, he said.

Unfortunately, a lot of people thought sometimes that we were the 51st state of America. It was clear that day that we were not.

“The main unions in Canada have issued and are issuing statements rejecting the pro-Trump position.”

Chrétien said he refused to commit to military action in Iraq without a resolution from the UN Security Council. He said Canada always followed the UN and intervened in other conflicts when asked to.

Chrétien also said he was not convinced that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction — the threat that fuelled support for a U.S.-led invasion of the country — and that turned out to be true.

Chrétien also addressed his visit to Venezuela last week [March 2013] (to attend President Hugo Chávez’s funeral).

He said he went because he knew Chávez personally and “never had any problem” with the controversial leader, even though he didn’t agree with him “on many things.” He also wanted to show his respect for the people of Venezuela.

He had support of the people and he was loved by the poor of his country. He was kind of a Robin Hood, Chrétien said.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper [of the Canadian Conservative Party] angered the Venezuelan administration by saying in a statement that he hoped the country can have a better, brighter future after Chávez’s death.

Chrétien said the Venezuelan authorities were very, very happy to see him at the funeral, because they were very unhappy with Harper’s remarks.

Let us recall what most political people in Cuba, Latin America, and many in the West know: Justin Trudeau’s own father, as Liberal Party Prime Minister of Canada, went to Cuba when he stood next to Fidel Castro in June 1976 and shouted in a public meeting “Long live Prime Minister Fidel Castro!,” and had taken other positions independent of the U.S.

“Everyone in Canada hates Trump for all his policies, yet Justin Trudeau is aligned with him.”

As the Canadian and other peoples increasingly recognize now, like any other family in whatever system, family relations and characteristics change. Regarding foreign relations, Justin Trudeau is not at all like his father. The press can quote me here as a Canadian: “Justin Trudeau’s father would turn over in his grave if he knew what his own son was doing.” Everyone in Canada hates Trump for all his policies, yet Justin Trudeau is aligned with him.

While the Trudeau government admonishes Venezuela for its supposed lack of democracy, it does not seem to recognize cynical incongruities, such as when, last January 2019 (while the Lima Group anti-Venezuela “pro-democracy “conspiration was in full swing), the Canadian government’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) — as part of the century-long racist colonial occupation of indigenous lands — arrested 14 native people and entered a fortified checkpoint on a forest service road in northern B.C., where people at the Gidimt’en camp were barring a pipeline company from access (CBC). That led to more protests (YouTube: Toronto Star).

“Democracy” in the North is one thing. The constantly developing protagonist democracy in Venezuela is entirely the opposite. Furthermore, it is the main shield to defend the fledgling Bolivarian socialist path against U.S.-led foreign interference which we must all fully oppose.

The comment was part of a message to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos after he and his company pulled out of a deal to have a headquarters in Queens in New York City.

He said the company now had a chance to 'actually do good' and help out areas of the country that are less prosperous.

In the closing remarks of his HBO show on Friday night, Maher compared Bezos to Bugsy Siegel, remarking that if the mobster built Las Vegas in the midst of a desert, then Amazon could do the same by turning Nebraska 'into the next Silicon Valley'.

'We have a problem in America called spatial geographic inequality which means the most affluent and educated people are clustered in just a few cities,' Maher said.

Real Time host Bill Maher said the 'most affluent and educated people are clustered in just a few cities', referring to those in blue states, in the closing remarks of his Friday show

He then went on to mention a comment made by Hillary Clinton about how she 'won the places that represent two-thirds of America's gross domestic product' in the 2016 presidential election.

Maher then shows a map where the majority of Middle America is in red while the coasts are heavy in blue, indicating where the plurality voted Democrat or Republican.

'The blue parts of America are having a prosperity party while that big sea of red feels like their invitation got lost in the mail,' Maher said.

He then goes on to say there are clearly 'two Americas'.

'We have orchestras and theaters districts and world-class shopping. We have Chef Wolfgang Puck, they have Chef Boyardee,' Maher said.

'Our roofs have solar panels. Theirs has last year's Christmas lights.'

The late-night host said Middle America, or 'the passed-over states', are not just angry - they're 'pissed off'.

'They don't hate us, they want to be us,' Maher said.

Maher also accused Amazon of 'playing cities off against one another' during its bidding process for new headquarters.

After 238 cities and regions submitted proposal, Amazon chose New York City and Arlington, Virginia, which is suburban Washington, DC.

'And Amazon picked two places that didn't need them at all, places where prosperity already was. Bezos you're worth 130 billion,' Maher said.

'Take one for the team. Stop playing cities off against one another and help a dying one come back to life!'

Maher (left in December 2018 and right in August 2017) then goes on to say there are clearly 'two Americas', one where there is 'Chef Wolfgang Puck' and another when there is 'Chef Boyardee'

On February 14, Amazon abruptly dropped plans Thursday for a big new headquarters in New York that would have brought 25,000 jobs to the city.

Several politicians and activists objected to the nearly $3 billion in incentives promised to what is already one of the world's richest, most powerful companies.

'We are disappointed to have reached this conclusion - we love New York,' the online giant from Seattle said in a blog post announcing its withdrawal.

The stunning move was a serious blow to Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had lobbied intensely to land the project.

New York City competed against more than 200 other metropolitan areas across the continent that were practically tripping over each other to offer incentives to Amazon in a bidding war the company stoked.

Cuomo lashed out at fellow New York politicians over Amazon's change of heart, saying the project would have helped diversify the city's economy, cement its status as an emerging tech hub and generate money for schools, housing and transit.

'A small group (of) politicians put their own narrow political interests above their community,' he said.

But Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City's new liberal firebrand, exulted over Amazon's pullout.

'Today was the day a group of dedicated, everyday New Yorkers and their neighbors defeated Amazon's corporate greed, its worker exploitation, and the power of the richest man in the world,' she tweeted, referring to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.

In pulling out, Amazon said it isn't looking for a replacement location 'at this time.' It said it plans to spread the technology jobs that were slated for New York to other offices around the U.S. and Canada, including Chicago, Toronto and Austin, Texas.

Trudeau is battling allegations that his officials last year pressured Wilson-Raybould, then justice minister, to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption and bribery trial.

Trudeau insists there was no wrongdoing and said Wilson-Raybould has not made clear her reasons for leaving. In an unusual move, she was allowed to address her Cabinet colleagues on Tuesday, even though she was no longer a minister.

“I continue to be surprised by Jody Wilson-Raybould’s decision ... This is not a decision that remains clear to me,” he told a televised news conference in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.

Trudeau’s version of events was backed up by Michael Wernick, the head of the federal civil service, who was present for several top-level meetings with Wilson-Raybould last year and said nothing untoward had happened.

“There was no inappropriate pressure put on the minister at any time,” Wernick told the House of Commons justice committee on Thursday, saying Wilson-Raybould had had plenty of opportunities to complain had she felt the need to.

Wilson-Raybould, who on Wednesday said “I hope that I have the opportunity to speak my truth”, is consulting lawyers to determine how much she is able to say. She is due to address the justice committee next week.

The Globe and Mail on Thursday said Wilson-Raybould told the Cabinet she had come under improper pressure from officials.

“How she interprets and perceives those conversations she can tell you next week. I can tell you my view very firmly is they were entirely appropriate, lawful, legal,” said Wernick, a civil servant who is not a member of Parliament.

The issue could threaten the ruling Liberals’ election chances this October. Opposition politicians have accused the Liberals of a cover-up and want a full public inquiry.

SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in the province of Quebec province, where the Liberals say they need to capture more seats in the October election to have a chance of holding on to power.

“We believe in the independence of the judiciary and we believe in fighting for good jobs,” said Trudeau.

The prime minister on Wednesday sought to calm restless parliamentarians at a meeting to discuss the resignations of Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau aide Gerald Butts, a major architect of the Liberals’ surprise victory in October 2015, who quit on Monday while insisting he had done nothing wrong.

Trudeau sidestepped questions about how he planned to handle the crisis, party sources said.

Signs of stress remain. Two Liberal legislators voted with the opposition on Wednesday in a failed bid to launch a public inquiry, while a female Liberal member of parliament tweeted her support for Wilson-Raybould, adding the hash tag #IStandWithHer.

The former minister, who the Globe and Mail said had ignored the pressure to go easy on SNC-Lavalin, was demoted from the justice ministry last month.","Despite briefing, Canada PM still puzzled by minister's resignation",Reuters,https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1QA2CT

As you click on the tab that reads Play Game, you are welcomed by a screen that has a list of countries. Every country has a detailed chart with information on population, life expectancy, gross domestic product, per capita income and so on and so forth. After you pick your country, you get to name your political party and choose the length and limits of your term of office.

Democracy III is one of the 16 interactive video games that are on display at the Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan. This is part of Global Games: Games And Politics, an ongoing exhibition of political video games created since 2004 and developed by the Goethe-Institut and the Germany-based ZKM (Center for Art and Media).

The huge hall at the Goethe-Institut is lined with monitors. Each monitor has a silver balloon perched atop; it lends a futuristic touch, very Star Trek. One can see the occasional figure bent over a monitor, headphones in place, clicking away. I pick a country, Canada, and a message flashes on the screen: “Congratulations! Welcome to your new job as Prime Minister. The lives of all 3,34,76,000 citizens are now in your hands.”

There are tabs titled GDP, Poverty, Health, Education, Unemployment, Crime. Alter any one and the change impacts the rest. One also gets to pick from a list of natural calamities during one’s tenure — hurricanes, earthquakes. Crime, unemployment, national debt, terrorism, climate change are other heads that appear onscreen as the game progresses. Detailed data tables, diagrams and trend indicators are available at a click to aid decision-making.

There are 21 categories of citizens listed under a country — farmers, industrialists, liberalists, capitalists, the youth and the retired, to name a few. Every decision is applauded by some and rejected by others — indicated by colour codes — and you realise you can never please all the people. The goal could be either to get re-elected or to turn your country from a liberal to a conservative state.

Into the first 10 minutes of my term as Prime Minister of Canada, I tighten the environmental laws and increase fines for violators. The effect on the environment is positive, but the GDP plummets. The next thing I know is that the number of unemployed people is rising, and thereon all starts to go haywire.

According to Friso Maecker, the director of Max Mueller Bhavan, Calcutta, he had wanted to host an art exhibition that would be “relevant” across age groups. He says, “Video games are played by all age groups. They have entered peoples’ living rooms and are not hushed away into a dark corner anymore.

So this exhibition deals with a medium that many people use in their everyday lives.”

Speaking of relevance, the game Orwell begins with a blast. The context of the game: on April 12, 2017, a bomb explodes in the populated Freedom Plaza in Bonton, Germany, destroying an important statue and killing several people. A note containing the first three stanzas of the German folk song Die Gedanken sind frei or The Thoughts are Free is found at the site. Present at the Plaza shortly before the explosion was Cassandra Watergate, an artist who was arrested for assaulting a police officer at a protest some weeks ago. As a player, I have to investigate the case; it involves surveillance. As the game unfolds, it penetrates the most private aspects of citizens’ lives — their surfing habits, call details, where they shop, who they socialise with, their personal milestones.

Maecker suggests that the experiential nature of the games might move individuals to an informed understanding of the world they are living in. He says, “It is the nature of the video game that it tries to blur the lines between real and fiction. While playing, one needs to take decisions for the character one becomes in the game, thus experiencing and understanding a whole range of political systems.”

The 2016 game Yellow Umbrella recreates blockades complete with tear gas-wielding police, thugs, a politician and regular citizens. Unmanned, which is from 2012, is about the effects of drone warfare from a pilot’s perspective. And then there is This War of Mine, a war game that shows the consequences of armed conflict through a civilian’s experience. It was developed in 2014.

Not every game has to do with the politics of the state, there are those that explore gender politics too. A student of Loreto College, Illanjana Bhadra, has played two games — Coming Out Stimulator and Dys4ia. While the first chronicles the challenges an individual faces after having decided to come out, the second plays out a narrative about a person going through sex change. Bhadra hopes such gender sensitive games will foster a spirit of empathy and inclusiveness. Till then they make for some great gaming.",Politics on a Platform,Telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/politics-on-a-platform/cid/1685343
153,Empty,2019-02-22T17:40:18Z,NEB says Trans Mountain pipeline expansion in public interest despite ‘adverse’ impact on whale population theglobeandmail.com,"The National Energy Board recommended on Friday that the federal government approve for a second time the long-stalled Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, despite the fact it would likely have “significant adverse” impacts on endangered killer whales and the Indigenous communities in British Columbia that revere them.

In its 700-page report, the energy regulator said the expansion of the crude oil pipeline would be in the public interest by creating a diverse market for Western Canadian oil producers; spurring job creation and economic development for local and Indigenous communities, and enhancing revenues for governments. While the benefits would be largely national and regional in scope, the environmental risks will largely be borne by local communities, including First Nations, the board noted.

The federal government will continue its consultations with First Nations to determine what precise concerns affected communities have about the project, and how their views can be accommodated. Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Ottawa will aim to conclude its consultations and make a decision by June.

Despite negative impacts, “the NEB recommends that the government of Canada finds that they can be justified in the circumstances in light of the considerable benefits of the projects and measures to mitigate the effects,” the board’s chief environment officer, Robert Steedman, told a Friday news conference in Calgary. The board set out 156 conditions the pipeline proponent – now the federal government – would have to meet, while making 16 recommendations to Ottawa for measures that would limit the impact of increased ship traffic in the Salish Sea and help restore the already-polluted, heavily travelled waterway.

The pipeline expansion plan has provoked inter-provincial feuding, oil-industry rage and fears among activists and some First Nations communities over threats to the environment and marine species. The government of Alberta and the oil industry maintain the Trans Mountain project is a crucial economic lifeline to expand crude exports and relieve the frequent price pressure on Western Canadian crude that results from insufficient pipeline capacity. Environmental activists decried the NEB’s conclusion, saying it is clear the pipeline will cause further damage to the orcas in the Salish Sea and would increase greenhouse gas emissions from the oil industry.

Ottawa’s 2016 approval of the pipeline expansion was quashed last August when a Federal Court of Appeal judge found the government’s First Nations consultations had been inadequate and that the NEB did not properly consider the impacts of increased marine traffic.

Explainer: Trans Mountain, Trudeau and First Nations: A guide to the political saga so far

However, the project was in trouble even before the court decision. Faced with opposition from the government of British Columbia, Indigenous leaders, and environmental groups, former owner Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd., announced last April that it was halting construction.

In late May, the Liberal government announced it would purchase the existing Trans Mountain pipeline and terminal for $4.5-billion and finance the expansion project until it could eliminate much of the political and legal risk and resell it to the private sector. Some First Nations leaders in Alberta and B.C. have expressed an interest in purchasing a stake in the pipeline project, a notion the Liberal government supports.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said the NEB’s revised conditions and additional recommendations were sound, though she cautioned that Friday’s report isn’t the end of the process. Specifically, she acknowledged that the project could still face more court challenges and protests.

“Many obstacles have been put in our way, and quite clearly we are not done yet,” she told reporters in Calgary.

Ms. Notley said that once the federal cabinet makes its decision, which she expects before the federal election, construction would likely resume very quickly. In the meantime, she said she’ll be pressing the federal government to ensure consultations with First Nations are adequate so a new federal approval won’t be derailed by another court challenge.

British Columbia’s Environment Minister, George Heyman, said he was disappointed at the NEB’s ruling. “They found there would be significant impacts on southern resident killer whales, [and] that there would be a catastrophic impact if there was a spill,"" he said. ""And they reached the conclusion, astoundingly, that no new conditions were needed.” He vowed B.C. will continue with legal reference case that will test the constitutional limits of the province’s authority to restrict the flow of oil crossing its borders.

Indigenous leaders opposed to the pipeline project said Friday the board’s report does nothing to allay their concerns about risks to the salmon and killer whales. And they vow to pursue further legal challenges if Ottawa approves it again.

“We have a reciprocal and loving and spiritual relationship with the lands and the water and the things on it like the salmon and the whales,” said Rueben George, of the Tsleil Waututh First Nation, which was part of the legal challenge that quashed the first permit. “We’ll do whatever it takes to protect the things that we love, because no price can be put on the sacred.”

The allegation is contained in a lawsuit filed by Vivian Bercovici, a former Canadian ambassador to Israel, who was appointed by the previous Conservative government of Stephen Harper and subsequently fired by the Trudeau Liberals.

Bercovici alleges she was terminated without being properly compensated for pension benefits, and that the government abused and harassed her.

On Monday, her lawyer will petition the Ontario Court of Justice to amend the lawsuit to have Telford and four senior officials of Global Affairs Canada added as defendants.

The allegations have not been proven in court, and the Prime Minister's Office did not respond to a request for comment.

The Justice Department says in a reply filed in court last month that Bercovici's ""bold allegations"" should be dismissed.

Bercovici has been a source of controversy since Harper appointed her as his envoy to Israel in 2014. She was not a career diplomat — which is not unusual for high-profile ambassadorial appointments — but she faced internal opposition within the foreign ministry for being too pro-Israel. Bercovici is Jewish and a self-described supporter of Israel.

The Harper Conservatives faced frequent criticism that they were too pro-Israel in their Middle East stance, and vigorously rejected the long-held notion in Canadian diplomacy that Ottawa should see itself as an ""honest broker"" in the conflict between the Jewish state and the Palestinians.

'Unwelcomed' by bureaucracy

Bercovici's lawsuit alleges she was unwelcomed by the bureaucracy from the moment she was appointed. She was ""not only unsupported in her role, but the individual named Defendants as well as countless others within the Public Service, intentionally and maliciously waged a campaign of abuse"" against her.

After the Liberals fired her in mid-2016 — as they were entitled to do — Bercovici alleges the government withheld almost $32,000 in pension benefits. She is suing for that amount, as well as millions of dollars in punitive and moral damages.

Bercovici's lawsuit alleges that she reached out to Telford repeatedly through emails and phone calls to deal with her pension issue, but was ignored each time.

In her lawsuit, she is seeking $250,000 in damages from Telford for the ""intentional affliction of mental suffering.""

Telford, 4 officials named as defendants

The motion to add Telford and four senior Global Affairs Canada officials as defendants was filed in December and is to be argued in a Toronto court on Monday.

On Jan. 9, the Justice Department filed its reply with the court, arguing that there was no merit to adding five new defendants to the lawsuit.

""The Plaintiff's claims against the proposed individuals is frivolous and discloses no reasonable cause of action,"" says the factum filed by the Justice Department.

""The allegations made by the Plaintiff do not rise to the level of 'flagrant and outrageous' conduct. The Plaintiff has failed to plead any material facts to support her allegations of being 'sidelined,' 'threatened,' 'undermined' or suffering 'personal attacks.' The Plaintiff makes bold allegations that are devoid of any particulars.""

The long-simmering legal drama is unfolding as the Prime Minister's Office grapples with the resignation of Butts, who served as Trudeau's principal secretary and most trusted adviser.

Butts denied any impropriety, but said he was becoming a distraction to the government amid allegations that unnamed officials in the Prime Minister's Office put undue pressure on the former attorney general in a case involving engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

Architects of Trudeau victory

Butts and Telford were the architects of Trudeau's rise to the Liberal party leadership and his subsequent 2015 election victory.

Natalie MacDonald, Bercovici's lawyer, suggested the current controversy enveloping the Prime Minister's Office has resonance for her client.

""We have pleaded that Katie Telford, a central figure in the PMO, purposely ignored repeated requests for immediate assistance and intervention with respect to the government's unconscionable withholding of Ms. Bercovici's pension monies,"" MacDonald told The Canadian Press.

""Our client was given no choice but to sue.

OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be pressured Monday to testify at a House of Commons committee looking into allegations the prime minister and his staff pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop a criminal prosecution of Montreal-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The Conservative party will introduce a motion arguing that since Trudeau keeps saying the Commons justice committee is well placed to investigate the allegations, he should have no problem showing up there himself to answer questions about his role in the matter.

The motion will ask all MPs to vote to call Trudeau before the committee for at least two hours, by March 15.

Motions in the House of Commons are not binding and regardless of the outcome, the committee itself would still have to decide whether to invite Trudeau. Besides that, MPs, including the prime minister, cannot be forced to appear before committees.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said Friday the committee has already heard from the clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick, that ""Justin Trudeau had his fingerprints all over this.""

Wernick told the committee Thursday that no improper pressure was applied to Wilson-Raybould, who quit the cabinet last week, and that Trudeau's staff have conducted themselves with ""the highest standards of integrity.""

He said that Trudeau was worried a prosecution might result in SNC-Lavalin's moving its operations overseas or closing up shop, hurting innocent employees, shareholders, pensioners, third-party suppliers and communities in which the company operates. Wernick said he told Wilson-Raybould about those concerns during a conversation in December but that his intention was to provide ""context,"" not pressure.

He also said the prime minister assured Wilson-Raybould at every opportunity that a decision on whether to halt the prosecution was hers alone.

Trudeau said Wernick's words should carry weight with Canadians.

""The clerk of the privy council, Michael Wernick, is an extraordinary public servant who has served this country and continues to serve this country under governments of different political stripes, with integrity and brilliance,"" said Trudeau. ""He is someone we need to heed very carefully when he chooses to express himself publicly and I'm sure everyone is taking a careful look at his words yesterday.""

But Scheer said Wernick's testimony laid bare just how many times Trudeau, members of his political staff, and Wernick spoke to Wilson-Raybould in an attempt to change her mind and allow SNC-Lavalin to enter into a remediation agreement rather than go on trial for fraud and bribery related to the firm's work in Libya.

Scheer dismissed Wernick's assertion that those conversations were within bounds.

""It's all well and good for someone who is trying to defend his own actions and defend the actions of the government to come to that conclusion,"" said Scheer.

Some opposition MPs and pundits have suggested Wernick crossed into partisanship by defending the government. Scheer wouldn't go that far but he did seem surprised by what Wernick said.

""I had certainly not seen a performance like that in the past,"" said Scheer.

Trudeau's government has been rocked by the anonymous allegations that Wilson-Raybould was under pressure from the Prime Minister's Office to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin -- a kind of plea bargain that would force the company to pay restitution but would spare it a criminal conviction that could cripple it by barring it from bidding on government contracts for up to 10 years.

Also on Friday, SNC-Lavalin chief executive Neil Bruce lashed out over the pummelling the company is taking from politicians.

""Frankly, we've had enough of all that, and we're just going to vigorously defend ourselves in court, and that's our strategy,"" he said.

Bruce said the Public Prosecution Service of Canada can still invite SNC-Lavalin to negotiate a remediation agreement and the company would be willing to do so.

""But frankly, it doesn't look like that today,"" he said.

Trudeau was not as eager to heed Wernick's opinion on solicitor-client privilege, the principle Wilson-Raybould has repeatedly cited to refuse comment on the allegations that she was improperly pressured. The clerk told the committee he doesn't think solicitor-client privilege applies in this instance and it's up to Wilson-Raybould to choose how much she wants to say on the matter when she appears before the committee next week.

Trudeau said he is still receiving advice on whether to waive the bond of secrecy between lawyer and client because there are potential consequences for two ongoing court cases against the company.

Scheer accused Trudeau of ""cherry picking"" which parts of Wernick's testimony he wants to listen to.

Trudeau is seeking advice on the privilege matter from David Lametti, whom he appointed justice minister and attorney general in an early January cabinet shuffle in which he moved Wilson-Raybould to the veterans-affairs post.

Under opposition demands Friday to explain why solicitor-client privilege has not been waived, Lametti told the Commons it's an exceptionally complex issue but he's doing his ""level best"" to find a way ""such that the former attorney general can, in fact, speak.""

Preliminary results showed Jagmeet Singh won a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia.

Singh captured just under 40 percent of the vote.

A practicing Sikh, Singh made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau’s chances become.

“This staves off all the talk that Singh would have to quit ... at least for the moment he is vindicated,” said Richard Johnston, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia.

Johnston said in a phone interview that Singh would still need to overcome unhappiness with his leadership.

Singh, 40, a former legislator in the province of Ontario, had no experience in federal politics when he took over from former leader Thomas Mulcair.

He has clashed openly with senior members of parliament on a number of issues. A quarter of the 44 NDP legislators who won seats in the 2015 election have either already quit or announced they are not running again in October.

And in a further sign of challenges ahead, in another special election on Monday, the NDP lost the Montreal seat Mulcair had held to the Liberals.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News last week put the Liberals at 34 percent public support and the right-leaning official opposition Conservatives at 35 percent. The NDP was far behind at 17 percent.

The Liberals are stumbling amid allegations that officials in Trudeau’s office leaned on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help a major construction company avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The struggling head of Canada's left-leaning New Democrats, an opposition party that competes with the Liberals of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, will try to win a parliamentary seat on Monday amid speculation he could be ousted if he loses.

Jagmeet Singh, a practicing Sikh, made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau's chances become.

Singh is contesting a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia. Results should become available at around 11 p.m. Eastern (0400 GMT Tuesday).

Singh, 40, a former legislator in the province of Ontario, had no experience in federal politics when he took over from former leader Thomas Mulcair.

He has clashed openly with senior members of parliament on a number of issues. A quarter of the 44 NDP legislators who won seats in the 2015 election have either already quit or announced they are not running again in October.

In unusually frank remarks, Mulcair said last month that ""it would be extremely difficult for Mr. Singh to stick around"" if he lost on Monday.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News last week put the Liberals at 34 percent public support and the right-leaning official opposition Conservatives at 35 percent. The NDP was far behind at 17 percent.

The Liberals are stumbling amid allegations that officials in Trudeau's office leaned on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help a major construction company avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges.

Singh and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer are both calling for a public inquiry into the matter. Wilson-Raybould is due to testify to the House of Commons justice committee on Tuesday.

Both Craft and her husband are major supporters of President Donald Trump.

The pick gives the former Republican commentator Max Boot major concerns that the Trump administration will once again become a laughingstock on the world stage.

Writing in the Washington Post, Boot points out that historically that position was filled by the major statesmen of their time — major historical figures including Henry Cabot Lodge and Adlai Stevenson. He notes that the President’s first pick, Nikki Haley, was a continuation of that legacy. “She was a former governor who has been talked about as a possible presidential contender, and she acquitted herself admirably at the United Nations,” Boot writes.

Her initial replacement, Heather Nauert, did not have an equally relevant resume. Nauert had previously worked at Fox News.

Craft is even more problematic, argues Boot.

“Kelly Knight Craft was chosen to be U.S. ambassador to Canada, and now to the United Nations, because she and her third husband, the billionaire coal baron Joe Craft, are mega MAGA-donors,” he writes.

“According to The Post, they gave ‘about $1.5 million to GOP candidates in 2016, including $270,800 to Trump’s campaign committee or his joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee.'”

He observes that Craft appears to be politically connected to the Trumps and the Republican leadership. She previously served as ambassador to Canada.

“Perhaps just as important from this president’s perspective, they are also ‘repeat, high-paying customers at Trump’s hotel in Washington.’ Craft’s other recommendation is that, as a Kentucky native, she is a supporter of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and is said to be friends with McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.”

“If confirmed, Craft will arrive at the United Nations as a laughingstock — just like her boss,” writes Boot, who left the Republican Party due to their embrace of President Donald Trump.

WHITE HOUSE PALACE INTRIGUE -- “Officials Play Down Appearance of Rift Between Trump and Lighthizer on Trade,” by WSJ’s Bob Davis: “U.S. trade officials are looking to knock down speculation of a split on China policy between President Trump and his lead trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, following a testy exchange between the two in the Oval Office Friday.

“The incident occurred in front of reporters Friday afternoon, as the president and cabinet officials met with China’s top trade envoy, Vice Premier Liu He, to announce that talks aimed at settling the U.S.-China trade dispute were making progress and would be extended through the weekend.

“Mr. Trump appeared to upbraid Mr. Lighthizer, who said he was negotiating memorandums of understanding with China. The MOUs cover a half-dozen subjects including agriculture, currency policy and technology transfer. ‘An MOU is a contract,’ Mr. Lighthizer said, turning to reporters. ‘A memorandum of understanding is a binding agreement between two people. And that’s what we’re talking about.’ That provoked what many saw as a rebuke from the president.” WSJ

THE SUMMIT …

-- CNN’S JAKE TAPPER spoke to SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO on CNN’S “STATE OF THE UNION”: TAPPER: “Do you think North Korea remains a nuclear threat?” POMPEO: “Yes.” TAPPER: “But the president said he doesn’t.” POMPEO: “That’s not what he said.” TAPPER: “He tweeted, there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” POMPEO: “What he said was the efforts that had been made in Singapore, this commitment that Chairman Kim made, have substantially taken down the risk to the American people.”

-- WAPO’S DAVID NAKAMURA: “‘No rush’: Trump redefines success ahead of second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un”: “Days ahead of his second summit with Kim Jong Un, President Trump is redefining success in his bid to force North Korea to relinquish its nuclear program, tamping down public expectations amid evidence that Pyongyang has done little to curb its weapons production. Trump is hopeful that his bilateral meetings with Kim this week in Hanoi will re-create the international media spectacle of their historic first summit in Singapore last summer — and perhaps distract from mounting domestic political turmoil.

“But wide gaps remain between U.S. and North Korean negotiators, who have yet to agree on a basic definition of what ‘denuclearization’ means to both sides, according to U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks. Senior Trump aides have privately expressed skepticism over the prospects that a deal can be reached to significantly advance the largely symbolic agreement announced in Singapore.

“Some fear that Trump could feel pressure to make a major concession to Kim during face-to-face talks, including a one-on-one session, in hopes of securing a reciprocal commitment he can herald as a political victory.

“In recent days, Trump has sought to create the conditions to declare the summit a success regardless of the outcome. Having once demanded that the North give up its weapons quickly, Trump said last week he is in ‘no rush’ as long as the regime maintains a testing moratorium on nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles that has been in place since November 2017. ‘I have no pressing timetable,’ he said, adding that he expects his meeting with Kim in Hanoi won’t be their last.” WaPo

But in the filing submitted Friday and made partially public Saturday, they recommended no specific punishment for those crimes, saying that is the practice of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, whose office brought the case. Prosecutors noted that federal guidelines call for a sentence of 17 to 22 years, although under Manafort’s guilty plea in his D.C. case, the maximum he faces behind bars is 10.

“The special counsel team said it may ask for Judge Amy Berman Jackson to impose a sentence that runs after any prison time Manafort is given for related crimes in Virginia federal court. ‘Manafort chose repeatedly and knowingly to violate the law’” prosecutors said, from ‘garden-variety crimes such as tax fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice, and bank fraud’ to ‘more esoteric laws’ involving foreign lobbying. He lied, they noted, ‘to tax preparers, bookkeepers, banks, the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice National Security Division, the FBI, the Special Counsel’s Office, the grand jury, his own legal counsel, Members of Congress, and members of the executive branch of the United States government.’” WaPo ...

Now, in the latest about-face, Mr. Trump has agreed to leave about 400 troops in Syria — 200 in a multinational force in the northeastern part of the country and another 200 at a small outpost in the southeast, where they will seek to counter Iran’s influence throughout the country.

“His decision to commit what one senior administration official described on Friday as a ‘couple hundred troops’ to the multinational force, operating south of the Turkish border, came after European allies refused to send troops if the United States would not.

A message from AARP: There’s no question about it: The big drug companies’ profits are soaring while too many Americans are struggling to make ends meet. As we continue to pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world, drug companies continue to pocket billions of dollars. They can afford to spend nearly $175 million for lobbying, and more than $6 billion for advertising, and yet we’re supposed to believe they can’t find a way to lower prices? Americans shouldn’t have to choose between buying medication and buying food for our families. It’s time for Congress to step up and put people before profits. Stop the greed. Cut drug prices now. https://www.aarp.org/Rx

US presidents have bombed or invaded places like Grenada, Panama, Iraq and Sudan to distract from domestic scandals or to gain a quick boost in popularity. But, do Canadian politicians also pursue regime change abroad to be cheered on by the dominant media as decisive leaders?

In a discussion on regime change in Venezuela after last Monday’s “Lima Group” meeting in Ottawa, Conservative foreign affairs critic Erin O’Toole praised Canadian policy but added that the Liberals used the meeting of countries opposed to Nicolas Maduro’s government to drown out criticism of their foreign policy. O’Toole claimed the “Lima Group” meeting was “put together quite quickly and I think there are some politics behind that with some of the foreign affairs challenges the Trudeau government has been having in recent months.” In other words, O’Toole believes the Liberals organized a gathering that concluded with a call for the military to oust Venezuela’s elected president to appear like effective international players.

Understood within the broader corporate and geopolitical context, O’Toole’s assessment appears reasonable. After being criticized for its China policy, the Liberals have been widely praised for their regime change efforts in Venezuela. In a sign of media cheerleading, CTV News host Don Martin began his post “Lima Group” interview with foreign minister Chrystia Freeland by stating “the Lima summit has wrapped and the object of regime change is staying put for the time being” and then he asked her “is [Venezuelan President Nicolas] Maduro any step closer to being kicked out of office as a result of this meeting today?” Later in the interview Martin applauded the “Lima Group’s” bid “to put the economic pincers around it [Venezuela’s economy] and choking it off from international transactions.”

In recent days Ben Rowswell, a former Canadian ambassador in Caracas, has been widely quoted praising the Liberals’ leadership on Venezuela. “It’s clear that the international community is paying attention to what Canada has to say about human rights and democracy,” Rowswell was quoted as saying in an article titled “Trudeau’s Venezuela diplomacy is a bright spot amid China furor”.

Rowswell heads the Canadian International Council, which seeks to “integrate business leaders with the best researchers and public policy leaders”, according to its billionaire financier Jim Balsillie. Long an influential voice on foreign policy, CIC hosted the above-mentioned forum with O’Toole that also included the Liberal’s junior foreign minister Andrew Leslie and NDP foreign affairs critic Hélène Laverdière. CIC’s post “Lima Group” meeting forum was co-sponsored with the Canadian Council of the Americas, which is led by Kinross, Kinross, ScotiaBank, KPMG and SNC Lavalin. On the day of the “Lima Group” meeting CCA head Ken Frankel published an op-ed in the Globe and Mail headlined “Venezuela crisis will be a true test of Canada’s leadership in the hemisphere.” Frankel told CPAC he was “always supportive of Canadian leadership in the Hemisphere” and “the Venezuela situation has presented … a perfect opportunity for the Trudeau government to showcase the principles of its foreign policy.”

At the CCA/CIC forum Laverdière made it clear there’s little official political opposition to Ottawa’s regime change efforts. The NDP’s foreign critic agreed with Canada’s recognition of Juan Guaidó as president of Venezuela, as she did on Twitter, at a press scrum and on CPAC during the day of the “Lima Group” meeting in Ottawa. (Amidst criticism from NDP activists, party leader Jagmeet Singh later equivocated on explicitly recognizing Guaidó.)

With the NDP, Conservatives, CIC, CCA, most media, etc. supporting regime change in Venezuela, there is little downside for the Liberals to push an issue they believe boosts their international brand. To get a sense of their brashness, the day of the “Lima Group” meeting the iconic CN Tower in Toronto was lit up with the colours of the Venezuelan flag. A tweet from Global Affairs Canada explained, “As the sun sets on today’s historic Lima Group meeting, Venezuela’s colours shine bright on Canada’s CN Tower to show our support for the people of Venezuela and their fight for democracy.”

The Liberals drive for regime change in Venezuela to mask other foreign-policy problem is reminiscent of Stephen Harper’s push to bomb Libya. Facing criticism for weakening Canada’s moral reputation and failing to win a seat on the UN Security Council, a Canadian general oversaw NATO’s war, seven CF-18s participated in bombing runs and two Royal Canadian Navy vessels patrolled Libya’s coast.

The mission, which began six weeks before the 2011 federal election, may have helped the Conservatives win a majority government. At the time Postmedia published a story titled “Libya ‘photo op’ gives Harper advantage: experts” and Toronto Star columnist Thomas Walkom published a commentary titled “Libyan war could be a winner for Harper”. He wrote: “War fits with the Conservative storyline of Harper as a strong, decisive leader. War against a notorious villain contradicts opposition charges of Conservative moral bankruptcy. The inevitable media stories of brave Canadian pilots and grateful Libyan rebels can only distract attention from the Conservative government’s real failings.”

Similar to Venezuela today, the regime change effort in Libya was unanimously endorsed in Parliament (three months into the bombing campaign Green Party MP Elizabeth May voted against a second resolution endorsing a continuation of the war). “It’s appropriate for Canada to be a part of this effort to try to stop Gadhafi from attacking his citizens as he has been threatening to do,’’ said NDP leader Jack Layton. After Moammar Gaddafi was savagely killed six months later, NDP interim leader Nycole Turmel released a statement noting, “the future of Libya now belongs to all Libyans. Our troops have done a wonderful job in Libya over the past few months.”

Emboldened by the opposition parties, the Conservatives organized a nationally televised post-war celebration for Canada’s “military heroes”, which included flyovers from a dozen military aircraft. Calling it “a day of honour”, Prime Minister Stephen Harper told the 300 military personnel brought in from four bases: “We are celebrating a great military success.”

Today Libya is, of course, a disaster. It is still divided into various warring factions and hundreds of militias operate in the country of six million.

But who in Canada ever paid a political price for the destruction of that country and resulting destabilization of much of the Sahel region of Africa?

A similar scenario could develop in Venezuela. Canadian politicians’ push for the military to remove the president could easily slide into civil war and pave the way to a foreign invasion that leads to a humanitarian calamity. If that happened, Canadian politicians, as in Libya, would simply wash their hands of the intervention.

""Listen, we stand together united as a country,"" Lethbridge MP Rachael Harder told the crowd. ""This is about developing an energy industry that keeps us alive and gives us a place on the world stage.""

It was also about other things. Members of the convoy, which left Red Deer, Alta., on Feb. 14, expressed a wide variety of demands. Primary among them were scrapping the federal carbon tax and two bills that overhaul environmental assessments of energy projects and ban oil tankers from the northern coast of British Columbia.

Another equally prominent complaint is that Canada signed a non-binding United Nations agreement on migration in December, supposedly surrendering its immigration policies to foreigners.

Mark Friesen, a convoy organizer from Saskatoon, spoke for a second time Wednesday, attacking so-called ""global governance"" and saying policies down to the municipal level were the results of agreements with the United Nations to implement its sustainable development agenda.

Friesen, like many of the convoy participants, is affiliated with the populist ""yellow-vest"" movement, which critics have accused of being racist and anti-immigrant. Other organizers said that yellow-vest members were welcome but the convoy was not a yellow-vest action.

In the order they appear: Edmonton’s Dana Flick who drove to Ottawa with the convoy, Harold Stewart from Vittoria, Ontario, and United We Roll Convoy head organizer Glen Carritt explain what they believe the protest has achieved. 1:54

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, finance critic Pierre Poilievre, several other Tories, and People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier also addressed the demonstration Tuesday, all sticking to their support of oil and gas pipelines and the energy industry and staying away from talk about the United Nations, immigration and the idea that appeared on some protest placards that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should be arrested for treason.

When the convoy left Alberta, it claimed more than 150 vehicles and about that many people gathered on Parliament's lawn Tuesday. By Wednesday, an assortment of about 40 semis, pickups and cars occupied several blocks in front of Parliament and 50 or so people listened to the final speeches.","Shrunken protest convoy leaves Ottawa after second day, enjoying Tory support",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/smaller-convoy-protest-leaves-ottawa-1.5027385
164,Empty,2019-02-24T15:27:18Z,"Historically, successful Black Canadian politicians have operated as quiet leaders and shy elitists.","In 1971, the Yale professor Robin Winks wrote that Black Canadians wanted “nothing more than to be accepted as quiet Canadians.”

In The Blacks in Canada, Winks claimed that Black Canadians were “unlikely to organize militant, noisy, pushy protests.” He considered Daniel Hill, the first full-time director of the Ontario Human Rights Commission in 1962, to be an exemplary model of quiet leadership.

Hill returned the compliment by praising Winks’ history of Blacks in Canada as a powerful tool in his campaigns against serious discrimination in housing, education and employment. Hill’s study of human rights in Canada for the Canadian Labour Congress in 1977 also denounced “aspiring leaders” in militant organizations who did not propose what he considered to be constructive action.

Yet whereas Winks was a rather unabashed elitist who had little time for “simple minds,” Hill translated the work he gleaned from “obscure historical journals” into popular histories. He would work closely with his friend Alan Borovoy, the longtime general counsel for the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, who defined his anti-racist campaigns against “ineffectual intellectuals with no concept of action.”

Hill and Borovoy may be described as Canadian “shy elitists.” They were uncomfortable with anything that they considered too elitist or radical for Canadian tastes. Yet they also encouraged the public to celebrate and defer to prominent, “respectable” figures in elite institutions.

Since we have not ended our dependence on shy elitism, there remains an understandable interest in celebrating Black men and women who have achieved recognition from the Canadian state.

Canada Post

However, we also need to recognize that Black Canadians are not problems when they do not conform to the model of a quiet leader. They are people who confront the problem of shy elitism in Canada.

Consider some of the challenges faced by the politician, social worker, human rights advocate and academic Rosemary Brown.

Introducing Rosemary Brown

Rosemary Brown moved to Canada in 1951 from Jamaica to study social work at McGill University. She became the first Black woman elected to a provincial legislature in Canada in 1972 and the first Black person to run for leadership of a federal political party in 1975.

(CP PHOTO/Ryan Remiorz)

Featured in a profile in the Toronto Star on Jan. 9, 1973, Brown was introduced as a “McGill University graduate, wife of Vancouver psychiatrist and mother of two.” Aside from the sexism of highlighting her marital and parental status, such descriptive remarks reminded Canadian readers that Brown was educated at McGill, an institution known for training young people to become the next generation of quiet Canadian leaders.

In other words, Brown was portrayed as a solid, respectable member of the middle class who defied North American stereotypes of Black cultural pathology and single mothers raising children outside of nuclear families.

Brown responded to these media profiles by pointing to her upbringing in Jamaica in the 1930s and ‘40s. Unlike Blacks in Canada in the 1960s and '70s, she could claim that she grew up in an environment in which the “governor was Black, judges were Black, the police were Black, anyone who was anyone was Black.”

Exoticizing Rosemary Brown

In the British Columbia legislature, politicians like Pat Jordan, the conservative-populist Social Credit Party MLA, asked why Brown did not move back to Jamaica to solve its problems of “slave labour and poverty.”

Media profiles questioned Brown’s socialist credentials by pointing to her comfortable upbringing and privileged status in Jamaica. Stories in The Vancouver Sun highlighted her expensive home in the fashionable Point Grey area and her Parisian wardrobe. Chatelaine magazine depicted Brown as “deliciously minority and yet so chic.”

Brown’s dismissal of these sneers about radical chic did not go unnoticed by Canadian commentators. Journalist Allan Fotheringham identified a certain haughtiness in Brown’s public demeanour. Bob Hunter, the public intellectual, eco-theorist and founder of Greenpeace, said that Brown had to pass through hoops that were understandably frustrating to someone with her intelligence and potential to become Canada’s “Philosopher Queen.”

Domesticating Rosemary Brown

In her autobiography, Brown conceded that she increasingly felt the need to communicate her message in the “safest, most acceptable and bland” terms to the Canadian voter.

(CP PHOTO/Tom Hanson)

This did not mean that she shied away from controversial issues. It did mean, however, that her campaign to become the federal leader of Canada’s left-leaning New Democratic Party would repeat Canadian platitudes. It was claimed, for example, that the candidacy of a Jamaican-born feminist offered voters an opportunity to live up to Canada’s claim to be a multicultural “nation of immigrants.”

Brown also stressed that responsible, quiet human rights organizations had “more lasting impact on the quality of life” of Black Canadians than more prominent or newsworthy radical organizations.

Although she would not win the NDP leadership, Brown would emerge from the contest with a national profile as a dynamic speaker who could convey the realities of racism and sexism in a manner that was palatable to “ordinary, fair-minded Canadians.”

Brown was increasingly portrayed in the media as a responsible Canadian who encouraged minorities and women to achieve major social change by working inside formal institutions.

Unsettling shy elitism

Brown upheld the legacy of Daniel Hill as chief commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Agency between 1993 and 1996. She also became an Officer in the Order of Canada in 1996 after she lamented the failure of academics and critical theorists to do anything that might appear “commercialized, common or ordinary.”

Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose?

To unsettle the system of shy elitism in Canada, we need to contest oversimplified solutions to the so-called problem of Blackness in Canada.

166,Empty,2019-02-23T14:49:14Z,All-in-one ETF portfolios make investing easier and cheaper than ever [Globe & Mail],"In many aspects of our lives, we embrace convenience. We buy prepared meals instead of assembling and cooking the ingredients ourselves. We shop in malls rather than driving to four or five individual stores. We recognize our time is valuable and our mental bandwidth is limited, so we look for very good solutions, not perfect ones.

Except when it comes to investing. It’s the one area where simple, excellent options are available, yet too many people resist them because they’re too, well, simple. Here’s hoping a recent trend in the ETF marketplace will help investors overcome that tendency.

In the past year or so, all three of Canada’s largest exchange-traded-fund providers have launched products that allow investors to own a complete portfolio with just one trade. Each includes a mix of global stocks and bonds, so anyone with a brokerage account can get extremely broad diversification with minimal maintenance and rock-bottom costs.

Story continues below advertisement

Vanguard Canada was the first ETF provider to launch one-ticket solutions just over a year ago, and iShares followed in December. Earlier this month, BMO joined the party with its own family of all-in-one portfolios.

Let’s look at a typical example: the Vanguard Balanced ETF Portfolio (VBAL). Like its counterparts, it’s a “fund of funds” built using seven underlying ETFs. There are three for fixed income: one each for Canadian, the United States, and global bonds. Then there are four equity components: Canadian, U.S., international developed and emerging markets. Vanguard has estimated that the portfolio offers exposure to about 94 per cent of the world’s public markets.

VBAL has a long-term target of 40-per-cent bonds and 60-per-cent stocks, which is the traditional split for a balanced portfolio. But there are other options for people with different risk profiles, ranging from just 20-per-cent stocks in the Vanguard Conservative Income ETF Portfolio (VCIP) to 80-per-cent stocks in the aggressive Vanguard Growth ETF Portfolio (VGRO). All the funds have the same components, just in different proportions.

The iShares and BMO families are very similar. They vary in their specific holdings, but they all include a target allocation of Canadian and non-Canadian bonds, plus an equity mix with one-quarter to one-third domestic stocks, with the remainder split between the U.S. and overseas markets. In all, we’re talking about thousands of stocks and bonds from around the world, which is all the diversification anyone needs.

Moreover, as markets move in different directions and at different rates, the ETFs will be rebalanced so they maintain those long-term targets. This feature makes them virtually maintenance-free, and it puts some competitive heat on robo-advisers, the online services that charge about 0.50 per cent and advertise automatic rebalancing as one of their key benefits.

And the price tag for this elegant portfolio? The management fees range from 0.18 per cent to 0.22 per cent, which is about 90-per-cent cheaper than traditional balanced mutual funds. On a $100,000 portfolio, the monthly cost is a little more than you’re paying for Netflix.

The good news is that these all-in-one ETF portfolios have been embraced by many do-it-yourself investors: VGRO, for example, has attracted more than $570-million in assets in barely a year. But there has been resistance, too. I’ve heard from many investors who are concerned the funds are not optimized for tax-efficiency, or that you could reduce your fees even further by buying the underlying holdings individually. But how many honestly believe they can build and maintain a better portfolio? In the real world – where people are busy with work and family, and would rather watch the hockey game than fiddle with a spreadsheet – no one manages their portfolio optimally.

Story continues below advertisement

Others dismiss these funds as cookie-cutter solutions, or argue that they’re only appropriate for very small accounts or unsophisticated investors. What nonsense. I’ve reviewed a lot of portfolios over the years, with six- and seven-figure balances, many of which were designed by people who manage money for a living. Almost none of them were more thoughtfully structured than what Vanguard, iShares and BMO have packed into a single ETF.

Are these products right for everyone? Certainly not. Are they perfect? No, but neither is any other option. And here’s the thing: You don’t need an optimal portfolio, you just need an excellent one. No one has ever failed to meet their financial goals because they had exposure to only 94 per cent of the world’s stock and bond markets, or because they failed to keep their investing costs lower than 0.18 per cent. Countless millions have failed by trying to do better.

Eating well and staying in shape takes a lot of effort: It’s much easier to flop on the couch and order pizza. Learning to speak Gaelic, playing the trombone, nurturing a romantic relationship – these take a lot of work. But successful investing is the opposite: You usually thrive by doing less, not more. With the appearance of these all-in-one ETFs, building an extremely well-diversified portfolio has never been easier or cheaper. The only problem that lingers is the one in the mirror.

I first …","This year, Berlin’s CTM Festival celebrates its 20th anniversary with a truly diverse lineup of innovative club and experimental music. FACT’s John Twells endured the entire 10-day marathon and witnessed a seismic shift in the global dance continuum.

I first visited Germany in 2002 and had little travel experience. I was embarking on a short-lived career as a low-level IDM producer and had been invited to spend a couple of weeks on tour, performing alongside artists I idolized. When I arrived in Berlin it was icy cold and vast, pocked by characters who would dip in and out of my field of vision for the next couple of decades, but I was uncomfortable. Maybe it was the notorious British aversion to German humor, but I felt lonely, distant and isolated. At the time, it felt as if Germany, not touring, was to blame for my crippling anxiety.

In the following months and years, I found myself in Berlin frequently and never warmed to its charms. As friends settled in the city, I kept it at arm’s length, troubled by its avoidant level of comfort. The self-flagellating bleakness of Birmingham or, later, Manchester felt more familiar and when I relocated to the USA, Berlin’s UV strobes dimmed further; I had the perfect excuse to detach. I haven’t been back to the city in years.

Setting foot in Berlin in 2019 feels like interacting with San Francisco a decade ago as the tech symbiote dug in its tendrils, choking out humanity’s sensual chaos. Berlin has its own booming tech sector now, accompanied by all the slick, American-global fast-casual culture we’ve come to recognize, expect and patronize. If you want a poke bowl to accompany your nitro cold brew and sourdough toast, you’re in luck – Berlin has everything the twentysomething e-worker needs to momentarily slake their thirst for easy-access, just-authentic-enough experiences. But this is an observation, not judgement. The city is neither particularly good or particularly bad, and that’s a problem: Berlin now exists in a numb state of permanent adequacy.

Three million clubbers visited the city last year, spending a jaw-dropping €1.5 billion, and the big draw is that Berlin’s club scene is so deeply embedded into the city’s DNA that it feels somewhat dangerous, albeit in a controled, conservative way. Back in Boston, where I live most of the year, venues are forced to close at 2am, prompting an off-grid after-hours party scene that’s always vulnerable to law enforcement. In Berlin, you can technically rave as long as you want to, but make sure you dress right, make sure you have the right friends and make sure you’re on the right drugs: you might not be worthy of partying with the European techno aristocracy.

CTM festival turns 20 this year and, fittingly for me, its theme is “persistence”. The annual expo started in 1999 – the year I graduated high school and began to consider a life in music – and runs for 10 days, with concerts, panels, workshops, club nights and art installations spread across some of the city’s best venues. Maintaining an experimental music festival for two decades is an achievement in itself and studying the lineup from that first year, the festival’s outlook has evolved drastically.

In 2016, CTM presented a program entitled “New Geographies”, charting a course that would take the organization into fresh territory. “New Geographies examined today is rapidly collapsing borders and emerging new hybrid topographies,” explains the festival’s website, “and aims to provide the tools needed to approach the complexities of a polycentric, polychromatic, and increasingly hybrid (music) world with greater openness.” This wasn’t just a performative gesture: the festival’s programming has been noticeably different since 2016. This year, CTM presented its most ambitious and wide-reaching program to date, showcasing a broad, challenging selection of collectives and artists that stand in opposition to targeted political violence across the world, and a growing throng of musicians who represent a wave of innovative, explorative experimental and club music from the Global South.

When I arrived at Berghain for opening night, the mood in the club was predictably intense. A flexing, masculine dancefloor dripped with sweat while Machine Woman, Buttechno, Temp-Illusion and Anastasia Kristensen performed alongside Bassiani residents, filling the room with deafening percussion. But the mood was flattened by the crowd’s emotional disengagement. Upstairs at Panorama Bar, meanwhile, my heart began to flutter.

Norwegian DJ SVANI provided early entertainment with a fusion of romantic R&B, pop edits and snippets of reggaeton and mainstream rap, but the night belonged to Chinese club producer RUI HO, who upset the mass of Northern Electronics T-shirt models with a riotous set that connected gabber, fast trance, Southern rap, global pop, noise, jungle and hard techno. A handful of dedicated ravers danced themselves into anti-aesthetic bliss, but as the chosen few moved at 190bpm, it was impossible not to notice the minimal techno dads ‘n lads looking on in disgust. By the time Qween Beat’s quest?onmarc took to the decks and dancers dwindled further, I wondered whether Berlin’s dusty cobwebs had become a permanent fixture.

The next evening, the party moved to Griessmuehle, a grubby, druggy space that feels like a cross between a basement and a summer camp. Sarah Farina’s Through My Speakers crew handled the main room, presenting members LeFeu, Qumasiquamé, Walter Vinyl and Farina herself alongside Kenya’s Slikback, Ghana’s Gafacci and South Africa’s Sho Madjozi and Phatstoki. And whether it was Madjozi’s rap-flecked gqom exuberance or Gafacci’s shuffling, wobbly bass explorations, the room buzzed and bounced, captivated by a rotating cast of dancers and performers. By the time Slikback took to the stage, the room was mentally prepared enough to receive a transmission from the future. Since last year’s Nyege Nyege festival in Uganda, Slikback has been working alongside a host of different producers in Kampala at Nyege Nyege’s incubator and hearing his music critique established Western experimental club forms was shocking and important. His set wasn’t quite like anything I’d heard before: it was the egotistical, problematic dream of “intelligent dance music” evolved, inverted and remodeled as a soundtrack to utopian sci-fi liberation. For an hour, I caught a glimpse of genuine progression; it was nothing I’d ever witnessed during my long tenure as an IDM C-lister, Boomkat scribe and FACT editor.

Downstairs in room II, LSDXOXO presented his “Floorgasm” concept with additional performances from Wallis, Juliana Huxtable and Pangaea. As I absorbed Juliana Huxtable’s psychedelic compound of euphoric pop, searing noise, fractured club music and neon queer bounce, it dawned on me why this particular soup of influences felt so perfectly mapped to my brain. Back in 2000, I started DJing with my art school bestie Arash Moori. We had a concept – embarrassingly called “Left Handers Disco” – that was intended to fuse all our favorite music into one all-encompassing genre-free landfill. At the time, this was sloppy cuts of Missy Elliot, Kelis and Jill Scott blended awkwardly with Roulé 12″s, ambient LPs, pitched-down techstep, SND, Basic Channel, Boards of Canada and Autechre; of course, it collapsed before it had even really started. In trying to find a mid-point between our experiences – my background growing up alienated and traumatized in the Black Country and his growing up detached and anxious in South Africa – we instinctively pushed everyone away.

I was never the right person to perfect this precarious fusion. My experiences only allowed me to go so far – to hit a certain note colored by self-hatred and nowhere near enough self-awareness, humility or reflection. Huxtable shifts wildly from one sound to another, but challenges her devoted flock without antagonizing them, welcoming newcomers into her spiky, unfathomably beautiful dreamscape with a bright guiding light. When we woke up, the small group of ravers I was dancing with were almost speechless; a few needed to leave, not wanting anything to shake the experience we’d just witnessed. Thankfully, I had enough energy to stick around for LSDXOXO’s triumphant extended set, in which he ran through the very best of US queer club music, honing in on the dancefloor’s gooiest spots and weaving slippery hooks (an edit of Kylie Minogue’s ‘Can’t Get You Out Of My Head’ was a particular high point) into hardcore rhythms as if toxic Western musical hierarchies had never existed in the first place.

One of CTM’s most ambitious projects to date is Nusasonic, an ongoing scheme that engages with the experimental music landscape in Southeast Asia. It sprung to life last October in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and a selection of artists and innovators from the region were invited to this year’s edition of CTM. On Monday, I attended a “hacklab” where Andreas Siagian and Lintang Radittya invited attendees to hear more about the world of Indonesian electronic music. Siagian explained that the idea of hacking was initially confusing to him; after being labelled a hacker, he looked up the term and wasn’t sure it was accurate. Instead his mind was drawn to the concept of “jugaad”. A Hindi word, jugaad loosely describes the art of frugally improvising to creatively overcome harsh constraints. A quick Google image search gives plenty of examples of car seats attached to pedal bikes, trumpets on tail pipes, bottles used as shower heads and vaporizers made from car batteries. Siagian went further into the concept, explaining how it related to his process of building instruments and working with new technologies to flesh out his ideas, using anything at hand.

This made a lot of sense and has a wider application; artists in developing countries are using Western digital audio workstations such as FL Studio or Ableton Live that come saddled with decades of established dance music’s most recognizable signifiers. In Europe particularly, we know these sounds and templates almost instinctually and we know where they sit in the canonical hierarchy; some of us even helped establish that hierarchy. But when these tools are used outside of the bubble, hierarchies can be flattened. When performative traits that signal class, race, gender and sexuality are flipped, we’re left with a form that isn’t just new, but one that shows us exactly what we’ve done wrong, often completely without spoken language. If you listen carefully, you can hear a loud, confrontational critique of our narrow understanding of freedom.

This thought colored my listening for the rest of the evening as I lost myself in Iranian duo 9T Antiope’s hour of immersive noise and drone. I was privileged to have the chance to sit and talk with both artists, who connected me with other members of Iran’s experimental music scene, brought together by CTM’s collaboration with Tehran’s SET Festival. As I received tales of secluded, psychedelic raves and shared experiences of community, art and activism I thought about my own biases about Iran and its underground music scene. These weren’t issues completely unique to Iran; the problems highlighted in fact were chillingly familiar: policing, lack of space to assemble, lack of funding and oppressive, opaque travel restrictions. In the US, the same roadblocks exist, they’re just obscured by safe, corporate platitudes and the deceit of relative comfort.

On Tuesday, Berghain assumed a different form. It felt smaller and more intimate as a live music venue, but sets from John Bence and Croatian Amor left me unfulfilled. Both performances rested on a set of sounds and ideas I’ve heard too many times before. Vocal ambient fuzz, post-witch house, knackered IDM, club drone – call it what you want, it’s numb, anxious and surplus to requirement. But then came Zoo. A four-piece rock band from Yogyakarta, Zoo had the whole club awestruck in just a few minutes. Their fusion of Indonesian folk styles and global rock tropes was breathtaking: more technical and challenging than Battles’ masturbatory math rock, more charming than crooning easy listening and more percussive and visceral than breakcore.

I was back in Berghain on Wednesday just in time to catch Manila’s Caliph8 & Nonplus. Both artists have been active in their local scene for the last 20 years and have perfected a woozy synthesis of turntablist techniques, harsh noise and innovative percussive exploration. It was a virtuosic display, familiar in some ways (illbient, anyone?) but bizarre and beautiful, warming the audience up for a cataclysmic event: Moor Mother and DJ Haram’s 700 Bliss. The duo were responsible for FACT’s favorite track of 2018, but that hardly prepared me for what I was about to see. The two performers towered over the audience on an elevated stage and their set was empowered, energetic and deeply nuanced. It felt like the discarded, broken pieces of Berlin’s Digital Hardcore Recordings, industrial music and rap, bonded with urgency and glazed with corrective political power. The despondent groan of Western frustration was absent; this was a broadcast from a USA in crisis, assuring an unapologetic Europe that what they ignore is eviscerating real human bodies. When the duo reached ‘Ring The Alarm’ the room exploded in a mixture of fear and adoration. It provided the soundtrack to a new kind of revolution, where the audience’s job was to listen, learn and stand the fuck down.

That wasn’t the end of the night, even if it felt like the end of an era. I ventured down to Säule – a more intimate space underneath Berghain’s main room – to check out Kilo Vee, the co-founder of Shanghai’s excellent Genome 6.66 Mbp label. Like his label mate RUI HO on the Friday before, Kilo Vee traversed styles with seemingly no attention paid to expected dance music aesthetics. The “deconstructed club” label has never felt more dishonest: this wasn’t a deconstruction of anything, it was a reconstruction of dance music forms that knowingly avoided club norms. This was a place where eerie pads and anxious, distorted beats would easily brush up against Chinese pop or twee gabber; it wasn’t intended to confuse or annoy dancers, but inspire them. Infinite Machine’s Ani Klang followed and dedicated ravers were treated to a cybercore assault of rapid-fire kick drums and anxious, emotional moods until our minds ached and we were ushered out into the morning light.

By Thursday, I was feeling the burn. It’s probably not intended for people to experience CTM as a marathon, but I reached Berghain in time to see Eartheater, Gazelle Twin and Lotic twist pop into noisier realms on the main stage. It was Panorama Bar, though, that attracted my full attention. I’m lucky enough to have seen APOCALIPSIS founder and Bien Buena co-host Riobamba a few times already – she established Pico Picante, one of Boston’s most important and influential club nights, back in 2010 – so I was curious to see how she would be received. Europe’s reaction to reggaeton has been resistant, so witnessing Berlin’s Latinx community screaming along to ‘Gasolina’ felt revolutionary. For a moment, we could have been anywhere else in the world, and Berlin quickly limbered up with every shuffled beat and blasting horn.

After a couple of hours sleep, I needed something to sooth my rapidly cracking mind, so the chance to experience MONOM – a one-of-a-kind instrument for up to 400 people to experience 48 omnidirectional speakers and nine subs, based around the 4DSOUND system – seemed ideal. CTM presented four collaborations with MONOM this year, and I opted for the third, with performances from 4DSOUND software developer Casimir Geelhoed and drone deity Drew McDowall. The system has to be heard to be believed; it’s not a place where you need to wander around awkwardly to find a sweet spot between all the speakers and subs – the entire space sounds phenomenal, but tracking through and paying attention is an experience in itself. The sounds shift perceptively, but don’t lose quality – movement simply modifies the experience.

Geelhoed’s set was an expert demonstration of the system’s capabilities, with heaving tones scraping through the venue like ghosts, moving through solid objects, in and around the pillars. But it was Drew McDowall who brought the audience to their knees. He had spent close to 100 hours working with the MONOM system and it showed as his modular synth wobbles coaxed a truly psychedelic experience, vibrating woozy drones through the brain and tickling the pineal gland intimately.

It was just what I needed to prepare myself for another long night. I wasn’t expecting much – Venetian Snares had been replaced last minute after flight problems – but I dragged my limp body to Berghain yet again and was instantly shocked to life by Indonesian duo Gabber Modus Operandi. Backed by a gigantic screen playing distorted YouTube clips, producer Kasimyn played a selection of truly eccentric tracks fusing noise, grindcore, gabber, jathilan and footwork, while vocalist Ican Harem screamed, bounced, stripped and sprayed vomit on the unexpected audience. This set the pace for the entire night and Berghain throbbed with a genuinely rebellious energy. Singeli duo MCZO & Duke followed, bringing the sound of Tanzania to the world’s most notorious nightclub. The room was jagged with bass, frenetic rhythms and chattering rap and Berghain was noticeably confused, moving awkwardly but instinctively.

In Panorama Bar, São Paulo’s BADSISTA dragged ravers to another continent, showcasing her city’s vibrant club scene and frothing the ample crowd into a grinding stupor. She’s a natural, innovative DJ and brought another new mood to an unfamiliar space, coaxing a warmth from the crowd that felt electric, honest and queer. It was the sharp workout necessary before the main room bubbled into distorted mayhem at the hands of Iranian mainstay Sote. Ata Ebtekar is a veteran producer and has been draping Iranian sounds in abstract electronics since the 1990s and this special presentation was a tribute to the hardcore era. So far, so nostalgic, but Ebtekar went beyond the lazy revivalism of the contemporary set, sounding as searing as Merzbow but with the rhythmic intensity of Hellfish & Producer.

It was around this point that the night began to get really weird. The Black Madonna had control of Panorama Bar, while Parisian crew Casual Gabberz rattled through an impressively jagged, high-octane blend of breakneck trance, hardstyle and, of course, chainsaw gabber. This worked best if you stood in in the corridor between both areas, with dusty disco frothing in one ear and buzzing digital synths in the other. As the night continued, through bizarre and brilliant sets from Putas Vampiras and Sentimental Rave, there was a point where rapid-fire kick drums and searing digital synthesizer stabs subsided into crackling easy listening and the entire crowd started ballroom dancing. Someone might have slipped research chemicals into the smoke machines and nobody would have noticed.

Saturday was going to have to try hard to follow that mind-altering night of music. The party had relocated again to SchwuZ, one of Berlin’s best-loved gay clubs, and after waiting outside in line for an hour, I ventured inside and saw Swedish live electronic trio Vanligt Folk dilate time with their odd blend of EBM, Swedish folk music and dancehall. If that sounds hard to imagine, it’s because it’s completely unique; the band looked like a basement punk act but smashed together an eccentric sculpture of human influences with the finesse of early Napalm Death and the attitude of African Head Charge.

Brazilian rapper Linn da Quebrada presented her breathtaking “Trava Linguas” DJ set in the larger space next door, flanked by DJs BADSISTA and Pininga and a set of percussionists, dancers and performers who turned the stage into an exuberant, theatrical, queer circus. It was powerful, dense and sensual, questioning heteronormativity and gender constructs with vivid displays of body, sexuality and power. It was among the most memorable performances of the week, coaxing the crowd into convulsions as fragments of funk, rave and collapsed global club rhythms smashed up against each other, hinting at the possibilities of a fairer world. This might have been the future conservatives were terrified of; it’s certainly the future humanity desperately needs.

By the time Sunday rolled around, with a closing party at Paloma, my head was buzzing uncontrollably with sounds and ideas. The lineup here was a smart distillation of many of the sounds I’d absorbed for the last 10 days. Subtext’s xin impressed early on, fusing cybercore intensity with sci-fi textures and dangerously heavy club rhythms. In the larger upstairs room, Yves Tumor rattled through some forgettable minimal techno, before Nyege Nyege co-founder Moroto Heavy Industries tore the club apart with a selection of hyper-speed East African club music that had dancers vibrating into a parallel universe. Gabber Modus Operandi’s Kasimyn brought flashbacks of Friday’s anti-aesthetic mayhem next, before Boo Lean and Dis Fig shut CTM down with a riotously fun b2b that none of us wanted to end. Then, finally, I could sleep.

CTM’s lineup highlighted an awkward truth: that the testosterone-rich scent of minimal techno might be the stench of atrophy. The genre plateaued some time ago and it would be dishonest not to address that. Some saw a solution in looking back to go forward; in the last few years, nostalgia replaced innovation and it’s not hard to see why. The edgy stories of rave’s halcyon days were always intoxicating – they drew me to clubs and festivals in the first place – but I’ve been hearing those same tall tales for two decades and they haven’t changed. Now, I’m old enough to have been there and my memory is very different. It’s controversial to say it, but dance music is better than it has been in a long, long time and if you’re looking in the right places there’s a surplus of hope. Nostalgia, meanwhile, is defeatist: we can’t turn back time, no matter how hard we try.

Right now, artists across the world are challenging Western models and showing a resistance to European dance music’s built-in culture of avoidance. Across the diaspora, in the queer community and throughout the Global South, a progressive vision of community, identity and revolution is being spread relentlessly and purposefully. So what can we do? We cannot fetishize; that’s been done too many times before. This movement needs to be noticed, upheld and supported: it is the next wave of dance innovation – a new global dance music continuum. But it cannot be a flash in the pan, it cannot be appropriated and turned into a set of tropes. These sounds, themes and philosophies are giving us the chance to be better, to take notice and to be humble. We need to fucking listen and listen immediately, there’s not much time left. Persistance is constant change and if we want to survive, it’s imperative we evolve immediately.

The #TellMe campaign launched Aug. 28, and within two weeks the Progressive Conservatives and the Liberals both promised to make sure that the information would be shared.

Within weeks, several provincial governments across Canada committed to reviewing or changing their reporting policies. Those provinces included British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia.

Radiologists say dense breast tissue can obscure cancers on a mammogram, but the majority of Canadian women are unlikely to be aware of the risk or their breast density.

An estimated 80,000 New Brunswick women have dense breasts, and 18,000 of them would fall into the ""highest density"" category, where the accuracy of a mammogram is about 50 per cent, according to studies.

Advocates say women should be given density information on their mammogram report to be able to seek additional, more effective screening.

""A lot of work has been going on behind the scenes before this, but I think that the commitments made by the leaders in New Brunswick really started something,"" Kaufield said.

""I hope it grows and grows until all women across Canada are notified of their breast density, and I'm not going to give up in New Brunswick until that happens.""

The Progressive Conservative government intends to keep its promise, according to Health Minister Ted Flemming.

""It's a platform commitment made by Premier Blaine Higgs and we will follow through with it,"" Flemming said in a statement.

""From a policy point of view, we will consult with our stakeholders, such as the regional health authorities and the New Brunswick Medical Society, to work with us on this issue towards implementation.""

Those consultations began this winter, and Kaufield was one of the stakeholders meeting with the government.

She said the meeting was positive and she was pleased to hear the minister's support.

But the fight for Kaufield and other proponents of change is far from over.

After a fall full of good news, breast cancer and breast density advocates were dealt what they see as a major blow.

New task force guideline

In early January, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care updated its breast cancer guideline. Task force guidelines are peer-reviewed recommended best practices for primary-care providers, and they inform roughly 36,000 family doctors across the country.

The new breast cancer guideline, an update to the original published in 2011, falls short of the change Kaufield and others hoped for.

Describing breast density as an ""emerging risk factor,"" the task force ultimately didn't associate dense tissue with an increased risk of breast cancer, according to Dr. Ainsley Moore, the vice-chair.

Most women aren't routinely informed if they have dense breasts, but the condition can mean cancers are less likely to show up on mammograms. Kathy Kaufield, a cancer survivor and advocate, wants doctors to be mandated to tell women. 16:18

Moore, a clinical associate professor at McMaster University, said density is a risk factor but there are many risk factors for breast cancer, including early menstruation, alcohol intake, a sedentary lifestyle and a full-term pregnancy later in life.

""They're not considered risk factors that put women at a high risk for breast cancer and breast density is not associated with an increased risk of dying from breast cancer,"" Moore said.

""There are uncertainties here and there are subtleties here.""

Moore said there is ""instability"" in how radiologists define and diagnose dense breasts, and there isn't enough ""trustworthy"" data from randomized control trials to point to an effective screening strategy or suggest a woman's chances of survival are improved by screening one way or another.

Dense breast tissue can obscure cancer in a mammogram image. (Submitted by Dense Breasts Canada)

Dr. Paula Gordon, a breast radiologist and clinical professor at the University of British Columbia, said breast density is far from an emerging risk after decades of studies on the issue and into benefits of additional screening with an ultrasound or MRI.

Gordon, a medical adviser to the foundation Dense Breasts Canada, has said ultrasounds on women with dense breasts double the cancer detection rate over mammography.

She said the evidence used by the task force in forming its guideline is outdated and based on outdated technology. The task force only considers data from randomized control trials, she said, but there isn't a completed breast density trial.

There is a trial going on in Japan, Gordon said, but it could takes years, decades even, before it's finished.

Harms and benefits

The new guideline recommends women aged 50 to 74 undergo mammogram screening every two to three years. For women aged 40 to 49, it recommends against screening with mammography.

Moore said the updated guideline now encourages shared decision-making between patient and doctor if there's an interest in being screened.

""The task force isn't really telling women what to do here. It's providing the tools for women to make the choice best for them.""

Those recommendations are based on the balance of benefits (the probability of surviving breast cancer) and harms of screening (false positives and overdiagnosis).

False positive harm is the undue stress of something picked up by screening that's ultimately nothing or non-threatening. Overdiagnosis is finding indolent cancers that won't cause death but can lead to unnecessary and harmful treatment.

Gordon argued the harms, despite possible physical or emotional pain, do not outweigh the benefit of saving a life.

Gordon has been critical about how the task force operates with no oversight as an independent, arm's-length body from Health Canada and wants to see it restructured.","Breast density campaign helps spur change in province, ripples across Canada",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/breast-density-cancer-screening-report-task-force-guideline-1.5025143

I will now turn the call over to Jim Hoffman, President and CEO of Reliance.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year financial results with you today. 2018 was an incredible year for Reliance, full of significant financial and operational milestones. But more importantly, I'm happy to say, we improved our safety performance and I would like to say thank you to each of our 15,000 plus employees for making safety part of our culture.

In 2018, we achieved numerous earnings records invested in growth through both acquisitions and organic initiative and demonstrated our continued confidence in the strength of our business strategy and outlook by repurchasing a record $484.9 million of our common stock. Earlier this month, we celebrated Reliance's 80th anniversary. Reliance was founded in 1939 based on the core principles of providing outstanding service to our customers. We have grown tremendously in our 80-year history, made possible by our decade long course of expansion through organic growth and strategic acquisitions with emphasis on high margin, specialty products and value-added processing. Today, we are the largest metal service center country -- company in North America, servicing over 125,000 plus customers over 300 locations in 40 states and 13 countries outside of the US.

Despite tremendous growth of our business and footprint, our founding commitment to customer service remains unchanged and our many accomplishments would not be possible without our folks in the field, across the entire Reliance family of companies. We thank each of you, not only for the contributions you have made to our growth, profitability and quality of earnings, but for your unwavering daily commitments to delivering unparalleled customer service enhancing Reliance's safety culture and giving back to the communities in which you live.

I would also like to acknowledge Gregg Mollins, for his immense contributions to Reliance during his time as President and CEO, and throughout his 32-year tenure with the company. Gregg's influence is visible in our -- as our culture of customer service and caring for our employees, as well as our focus on gross profit margin, inventory management and organic growth that contributed to our record financial achievements in 2018. Thank you for all you've done Gregg. 2018 was marked by multiple quarters of record financial performance. We experienced improved pricing conditions healthy demand and excellent execution by our managers in the field. As a result, we generated record net sales of $11.53 billion, which -- when combined with our strong gross profit margin of 28.4% produced record gross profit dollars of $3.28 billion and record pre-tax income of $850.6 million.

Importantly, our pre-tax income increased 45.7% year-over-year on an 18.7% year-over-year increase in sales. Demonstrating the strength of our business model and disciplined strategy of focusing on higher margin business. Our full-year non-GAAP earnings of $8.94 per diluted share was also a new Reliance record and represents a year-over-year increase in 64.3%. Turning to the fourth quarter, while we experienced the normal seasonal decline of lower shipping volumes due to the customer shutdowns and vacation schedules, underlying demand remained healthy and we continue to experience positive demand conditions across end markets we serve.

As a result, our tons sold in the fourth quarter were down 5% from the third quarter of 2018 at the top end of our expected range of down 5% to 7%. Our outlook remains positive in 2019 with feedback on demand trends of our end markets, ranging from steady to strong. Overall metals processing was relatively steady in the fourth quarter with our average selling price per tons sold down 0.4% compared to the third quarter of 2018. Our fourth quarter pricing outlook of flat to up 1% factor in the potential for some price increases. Following the October announcement of a price increase for carbon flat-rolled products which did not hold.

Our average selling price in the fourth quarter increased 20.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by both solid demand and trade actions that supported multiple mill price increases throughout the first nine months of 2018. However, the absence of meaningful mill price increases in the fourth quarter pressured our gross profit margin from elevated levels in the first three quarters of 2018. In addition, we recorded LIFO expense of $106.8 million in the fourth quarter, significantly above our estimate of $55 million, which further impacted our gross profit margin along with the higher than expected tax rate reduced our earnings per diluted share. Karla will discuss the LIFO expense and tax rate in more detail, but in short, adjusting for our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.08 for the $0.55 higher than expected LIFO expense and the $0.10 higher than expected tax rate would have resulted in an earnings per share of $1.73 for the fourth quarter of 2018.

Turning to market conditions in our key end markets. Demand for automotive, which we service mainly through our toll processing operations in the U.S., and Mexico remains very strong. We continue to invest in facilities and value-added processing equipment to meet the increased robust demand for the services we provide, especially related to increased aluminum content in vehicles.

Aerospace also continues to perform well, with mill lead times extending and the backlog for orders remaining solid. We maintain our positive outlook in this market and continue to focus on growing our market share, both domestically and abroad. Demand in heavy industry, energy and non-residential construction was steady in the fourth quarter and we expect actively to remain at similar levels in 2019 as compared to 2018.

Finally, we have noticed in the reduction and demand in semiconductor market. That said, our long-term outlook remains positive and we expect slow improvement in demand as we progress through 2019. As for pricing, mill pricing for carbon steel products remains high levels in the fourth quarter following a number of increases in the first nine months of the year. Pricing for carbon products including plate, structural and tubing, where we have a significant presence were relatively stable during the quarter, though we did see some pressure on carbon flat-rolled price. We believe overall pricing for carbon steel products will remain stable to up in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, and we continue to monitor the recent price increases announced on hot-rolled coil.

Our sales into the aerospace market consist of heat-treated aluminum products, especially plate as well as specialty stainless steel and titanium products. Demand for heat-treated aluminum plate remains strong and the 5% to 7% price increase that became effective in January continues to hold. We saw significant strength in pricing for common alloy aluminum products throughout 2018 with continued increases in the fourth quarter. Demand for common alloy aluminum sheet remains strong and supply continues to be tight, which we expect to persist throughout 2019. Based on these trends, the recent $0.07 per pound price increase announced for March was fully supportive.

Demand for our stainless steel flat products continues to be solid. Our average selling price for stainless steel products in the fourth quarter was relatively steady following price increases announced by the mills during the third quarter. As a reminder, pricing for stainless steel products is impacted by nickel prices which remained challenge. Looking ahead, while lead times remain short and surcharges have been pressured, base prices have continued to hold.

Finally, alloy pricing remains relatively strong supported by positive demand trends in automotive and energy. Turning to capital allocation, our 2019 capital expenditure budget of $230 million is once again focused on strategic investments to drive organic growth. We will continue to invest in our facilities and innovative technology and equipment to support our customers need. Importantly, we continue to identify opportunities to expand our value-added processing capabilities, which positively contributed to our gross profit margin.

We are pleased with the robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities in the market, but we will remain selective in our M&A activity. Our November 2018 acquisition of All Metals Holding, LLC aligns with our strategy of acquiring well-run businesses that complement our diversification of products, service, geography and our value-added processing capabilities. All Metals specializes in toll processing and transportation and logistics services primarily for customers servicing the automotive, construction, appliance and other diverse end markets, strengthening our already solid position in these markets.

From a shareholders' return perspective, quarterly cash dividends and share repurchase remain core to our capital allocation philosophy. We paid regular quarterly dividends for 59 consecutive years and the 10% dividend increase announced today represents 26 increase since our 1994 IPO. Our record share repurchases in 2018 reflect the trust and confidence our board and management have in our strong consistent business strategy and outlook. And we will continue to be opportunistic in our approach to repurchases.

I am extremely proud of our 2018 financial results made possible by the excellent execution of our dedicated employees and supported by solid pricing and strong demand in the marketplace. Looking ahead, we remain confident about the demand environment in nearly all of the end markets we served, supporting our ability to maximize our earnings power and increase value for our stockholders. In closing, keeping our employees safe is our most important goal and while applaud our team for improving our safety performance through 2018, we must aim to continue to improve in 2019.

Thank you for your time and attention today. I will now turn the call over to Karla to review our fourth quarter 2018 financial results in more detail. Karla?

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Thanks Jim and good morning everyone. Our record sales of $11.53 billion in 2018, were up $1.81 billion from 2017 due to the healthy demand and improved pricing conditions that Jim discussed, as well as our focused pricing discipline and increased levels of value-added processing with 49% of our orders processed in 2018. Our tons sold were up 1% and our average selling price was up 17.9% increase in our average order size in 2018 to $2,130. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 were $2.81 billion, up $437.6 million or 18.4% from the fourth quarter of 2017. And while our tons sold decreased 1.6% year-over-year, our average stock price per tons sold rose 20.4%.

Our 2018 gross profit of $3.28 billion was a record and our gross profit margin of 28.4% was near the high end of our estimated sustainable range of 27% to 29% primarily due to the positive impact of increased metal pricing in 2018. However, the increased metal prices also negatively impacted our gross profit margin with our highest ever annual LIFO expense of $271.8 million or $2.81 earnings per diluted share compared to $30.7 million or $0.26 EPS in 2017.

Because LIFO is an annual calculation that we estimate during the year and record to actual at the end of each year and because our LIFO expense was $51.8 million higher than we had estimated at the end of the third quarter of 2018. Our LIFO expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $106.8 million or $1.13 earnings per share. This is significantly higher than estimated LIFO expense along with the lack of mill price increases in the fourth quarter of 2018, combined to reduce our gross profit margins to 25.2% and was higher than our LIFO expense of $77.5 million in the third quarter of 2018 and $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. When metal prices increase, our inventory costs increase and generate LIFO expense.

This results in lower gross profit during these periods that builds the LIFO reserve that will be reversed and generate LIFO income in future periods when metal prices decline and will positively benefit our gross profit margin and earnings during periods of declining prices. Our 2018 LIFO expense of $271.8 million, increased our LIFO reserve to $293.6 million as of December 31, 2018. Currently, we estimate that metal prices will be somewhat lower at December 31, 2019 then at December 31, 2018 with an estimated annual LIFO benefit or income of $50 million in 2019. As in prior years, we will update our expectations quarterly based upon our inventory costs and metal pricing trends.

As a percentage of net sales, our fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 18% down from 20.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and consistent with the third quarter of 2018. The reduction as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher selling prices in 2018, which increased our net sales. In addition, our SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 included a gain from the sale of non-core assets that reduced our expenses by $18.2 million.

Our record pre-tax income of $850.6 million in 2018 represents an increase of $266.8 million or 45.7% compared to 2017 due to our strong execution and a favorable pricing and demand environment. Pretax income in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $123.9 million. Our effective income tax rate was 24.5% in 2018 with our rate increasing to 29.5% in the fourth quarter as we adjusted certain deferred tax amounts to comply with recently issued interpretations of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our tax rate was a negative 6.4% in 2017 due to a one-time benefit of $207.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 attributable to the enactment of the new tax rules.

We currently expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 24.5%. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $85.6 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $1.22, which were reduced by $0.55 as a result of higher-than-expected LIFO expense and $0.10 from our higher tax rate that benefited by $0.20 from the sale of the non-core asset and $0.04 from our share repurchases in the quarter. For the full year, we had record net income of $633.7 million and record earnings per share of $8.75. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were also the highest in Reliance's history at $8.94, up $3.50 or 64.3% from $5.44 in 2017.

Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow, our record 2018 earnings resulted in strong cash flow from operations of $664.6 million despite higher working capital requirements, with $431.3 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2018. We used our cash flow to execute on our capital allocation priorities of investing in the growth of our business and returning value to our stockholders. In 2018, we invested a record $239.9 million in capital expenditures and paid $77.6 million to complete three acquisitions to further grow our business.

We also continued to execute on our stockholder return activities with a record share repurchases totaling $484.9 million and payment of $145.3 million in dividends to our stockholders. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased $4.55 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $77.77 per share for a total of $354.2 million. For the full year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased $6.07 million shares at an average cost of $79.94 per share. The pro forma annual effect of our total 2018 share repurchases is $0.77 earnings per diluted share. At December 31, 2018, our total debt outstanding was $2.21 billion resulting in a net debt to total capital ratio of 30.8%, our net debt to EBITDA multiple was 1.7 times. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had $533 million available on our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, providing us ample liquidity to continue executing all areas of our capital allocation strategy.

Turning to our outlook, we are optimistic with regard to business conditions in the first quarter of 2019 and we expect that demand in the first quarter will remain healthy. As a result, we estimate our tons sold will be at 6% to 8% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, which reflects the normal seasonal increase in shipping volumes compared to the fourth quarter. As Jim discussed, we anticipate price increases for many of our products, given recent announcements and solid pricing fundamentals supported by current demand, raw material costs and the effects of ongoing trade actions.

However, we expect our average selling price in the first quarter of 2019 will be flat to down 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. As many of these price increases are not effective for the full quarter and our average selling price trended downward during each month of the fourth quarter of 2018. As discussed earlier, we expect our inventory costs at December 31, 2019 to be lower than at the beginning of the year and therefore we currently estimate LIFO income of $12.5 million in the first quarter of 2019. We also anticipate a $0.17 benefit to our earnings in the first quarter of 2018 due to the lower number of total shares outstanding as a result of our 2018 repurchases.

As a result, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45 for the first quarter of 2019. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our financial and operational results in 2018, which were supported by a solid demand and pricing environment and outstanding execution by our employees. Our strong balance sheet provides us with the foundation to continue executing our growth and stockholder return activities. Our record repurchase of $484.9 million of our common stock in 2018 and the 10% increase in our quarterly dividend effective in the first quarter of 2019 together reflect the confidence that our Board and Management have in our business outlook and our ability to perform in the current healthy pricing and demand environment.

That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention, and at this time, we would like to open up the call to questions, operator?

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Great, thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Matthew Korn from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Matthew Korn -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Hey, good morning Jim, Karla. First off, congratulations on all the -- all the accomplishments during the year and it was a big year.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank Matt.

Matthew Korn -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Jim thanks. So I have like a micro question and then a macro question for you, in a way. We heard in the fourth quarter according to a lot of the steel mills, and they characterize the buyer strike, and they watched key prices to particularly decline, and that was on top of normal seasonality. And I'm looking at your expectations into 1Q19 is a little softer we expected, little bit below the double-digit growth we've been kind of used to in the last couple of years, going into the first quarter. Question there is, do you see any signs even given your optimism on the demand level that buyers for right now, are still holding out a little bit and going hand to mouth? Was it still the phenomenon that you're seeing.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah Matt. Our business really doesn't change that much. We just kind of pay attention to what our customers need. They seem to be positive. Orders are coming in like they always have. As far as the buyer strike, one of the mills guys said that maybe a try, we don't know. We don't, we don't see those kind of things, but it's -- there are, we were conservative by nature, that's just what we do, but we really just pay attention what our customers are telling us and that's reflected in the orders they give us on a day-to-day basis. But we're -- what we said in the script and our release, we're optimistic, and we think it's going to prove out.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

And I think Matt those comments were a little more directed as you indicated toward the flat-rolled side of the business, and remember carbon flat-roll is only about 15% of our total sales dollars. So we see that enforcement of business and we think some of the recent price increase announcements may help spur some of those folks to start buying again.

Matthew Korn -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it, appreciate that. And let me ask on, one more bigger picture question. In the wake of the higher steel prices that we've seen in flat loans, policy changes in the U.S., over this past year, there has been the number of mills expanding the capabilities, expanding the capacities. Many of these seemingly are in the regions where they feel underserved or whether as there is particular high growth potential. Do you see any kind of risk to your business from a broader steel mill reach or deeper availability of things like coated or painted or the types of processed steel, if these things really to come true?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

I don't, -- again we are -- we run the business day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month and we just again service our customers where they want to be serviced, we listen to them, all the capacity is coming online. We know all those folks. We're a big customer of all of them. They all have very smart people running those companies, that's what they see is good, good for them and that will be good for us. So I really don't see any risk coming on board to that, we actually our customer and their customer of ours, we do a lot of -- as you've probably realize that we do call processing for a lot of those folks and they are positive. And we like it when our domestic partners are profitable and busy. So we're -- we applaud their decisions, because they're all -- they make good decisions and we're going to be there for them and they will be there for us. So I don't see a big risk.

Matthew Korn -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it, appreciate it Jim. Congratulations again.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you.

Operator

Our next question is from Martin Englert from Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Hi, good morning everyone.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Good morning.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Just wondering if you could touch on what you're seeing so far over the past month or so here with new order entries and maybe talk about what you believe could be driving lower year-on-year volumes more recently, as well as into 1Q here, which I think is implied by the guidance?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

If I understand your question promptly, again we -- it just changes daily. We run the company day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month. We can have a good day, and not so good days. There's really nothing that I can really pin point.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, I mean volumes were a little lighter, Q4'18 to '17, you know and I think the MSCI numbers for January came out, and they were down a little bit from January last year, but overall, even with the slight decrease, I mean, as Jim mentioned earlier, our customers are still optimistic. I think there's been a little uncertainty in the market from a pricing standpoint, and just general macro concerns out there, but as Jim indicated, I mean day-to-day our customers are busy, maybe not as busy as they were, maybe not buying as much as the year ago, but we're still on -- positive on demand, we're very -- the demand is supporting, helping pricing levels and we can do very well in this type of environment, even with demand down slightly.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And another thing to remember Martin, we have a really diverse group of customers going into a lot of different markets. And it's hard -- it's even difficult for us to look at our company as this massive company. We don't run it that way, we run it like we have many customers and many markets and they all do different things and one market is up, very few times in my 38-year career has every market been up at the same time and every market has been down at the same time. So we've got it -- as part of our strategy also obviously the companies we buy and the products we sell, we like to spread it out as much as we can. So we're a little less of the target when things -- things change dramatically in the market as -- part of our market could be up.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Okay, thanks. I appreciate all that detail there. Maybe, if you can just provide an update also on your tolling business there. You touched on this briefly in prepared remarks and kind of continued strength within automotive and I guess what you're seeing at the start of this year, expectations on volumes as the year progresses, and maybe just review some of the past and future growth initiatives that you've had there?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. We like that business. It's a good business for us. It continues to do well. We continue to invest, we've got nice company in Mexico with four locations and we've expanded that. We have a lead company in the U.S. that's extremely busy and as Karla mentioned our CapEx dollars, that they -- it's a capital-intensive business, and we continue to expand their offerings when the -- the number of units and the SARs report comes up, when it goes up or down, it's still at a really, really high number, which is good for us and over the last couple of years we picked up a lot of share, if you will, because of the exposed aluminum that happens to be going, and that's being designed into all kinds of different automobiles, particularly light trucks and what have you, SUVs, that's kind of our sweet spot. And again this one particular company has kind of one of a kind type equipment that we design and build ourselves and they've got a great relationship with -- in the market.

William K. Sales -- Executive Vice President, Operations

And we're also really excited about the new acquisition, All Metals. So that's going to add to the tolling part of our business.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

And in addition to All Metals, we also increased our ownership of the Acero Prime, our toll processing business in Mexico during the fourth quarter that we now have a 100% ownership of that. So, and we see growth opportunities for them as well and also just to point out our -- the number of tons sold that we report do not include any of our tolling tons and we have seen increases in the number of tons that we've sold both in the fourth quarter of '18 versus the fourth quarter of '17 and in January so far we're also up compared to last year. So because of the investments that we've made in the growth we continue to see us doing more there and picking up the market share primarily -- especially with the aluminum forces.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, another factor, remember, our customer base in that business, it really isn't the end user. It's the producers of the product, whether it be steel or aluminum. So that's kind of a unique relationship. We're their customer and they are our customer.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Thanks for all the detail there. I don't know if you'll touch on it at all, but are tolling volumes in excess of your reported volumes now.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yes, they are, and they have been for quite some time.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Okay, excellent. Thanks for all the color on that business there.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Sure.

Operator

Our next question is from Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Yeah, hey, good morning, guys. And happy 80th anniversary.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Thank you.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you.

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Okay, so I wanted to ask a little bit more. First, on the year-over-year question that Matt asked earlier, I get the sequential improvement, but are there any areas in particular that are performing worse year-over-year or better if you could just give a little bit more color? And if you could talk a little bit more while you're at it about your key carbon products specifically plate and beams.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, Timna, like I said in the remarks. The one market that's not doing real well right now but does have legs going forward is the semiconductor business, it's good business for us. It's a little slow right now, what we anticipate that getting better at some point and then the rest of the markets that we're doing are at good ones. They're at good levels, and levels and they've been better and they've been worse, and so we're OK and we like -- we kind of like where it is. We like where it's going as far as the -- Bill, do you want to say anything about aerospace or anything --?

William K. Sales -- Executive Vice President, Operations

Aerospace continued strength as we said, we really watch lead times backlog and build rates, all those are very positive and our outlook for aerospace continues to be very fast.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And Timna, what was your question on the plate and beams?

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Just a bit more color on those markets and non-res construction is big for you guys, within plate, beams and pipe, and I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color on those products in that market?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, those are good markets for us. The non-res is chugging along kind of, and we also -- as you all know, we also grow infrastructure spending in there and so we haven't seen that yet, we're all like the rest of Americans are waiting to see if we're going to fix all those bridges that are falling down. So we're hoping that that will come, but as far as the business that we're participating in, it continues to go on in a good direction. We'll see there were some filings and some suits filed on -- let you know, about the product coming in from China into Canada being stock -- semi producers and shipped back into the U.S, which is absolute cheating by the way, and we don't appreciate that no American really should appreciate that. However, that's happening and I don't know -- I have no idea what's that -- what's that findings will be or what the penalties will be, but certainly if that does happen, then we will have a more of a fair -- our fabricators, domestic fabricators will have a fair, more even playing field to participate in. So that could give us a nice little bump.

Plate -- plates are really good product for us, it's an unusual market to figure out what goes on. right now. I believe that plate pricing is, well, it's kind of just a little flat right now. And I -- with Korea being shut out for so long last year, there is an uptick -- the import is an uptick coming in, right now because they're -- they got shut out because of the quality. Now they're getting to catch up. That can't last long. So there may be a little down take in the pricing. I don't know, certainly the import pricing that we do see, it's not attractive. We're not participant but we get all of the offerings and this really not there to drag, I don't see what you can count on Reliance is not participating because we're still 95% huge fans for domestic partners. So we're going to continue to support them. So again, again kind of a boring answer because it continues to be just fine.

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Okay. And I'm surprised you guys didn't mentioned in a while. I know you guys were involved in that. I think, you mentioned tubing was part of the walls initial phases years ago and now that it looks like it might be getting under way, again, is that an opportunity for you?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

I know about as much as the wall -- about what's going to happen to more as you do, nobody knows. So all I know is that -- we sell metal and people talk metal going into that wall and we certainly will call on pieces and parts of that we have in the past. And if they decide to build some of it, I hope they call Reliance for their tubing in the flight that goes into it.

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Okay, fantastic. I could switch to Karla. I want to ask a couple of questions on cash flows and just what to expect for 2019. You should see a pretty big working capital release you had in this last couple of quarters. It sounds some pretty high days of inventory and then they kind of came down sharply by the end of the year. Any color you can give us on what kind of working capital release you might expect assuming kind of stable prices? And then on the buyback, is that a signal of more to come or will you capitalizing on a particularly weak market in Q4.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So, hi Timna, first off on the cash flows, we had a strong cash flows in 2018, $665 million for the year and that was, as you commented with higher working capital requirements, primarily from the cost -- the price standpoint of the metals. So, we anticipate given our guidance on LIFO and things that we would have a little relief, just from a price standpoint in 2019. And our inventories, we did end the year at a higher level than what our goal is inventories is still in decent shape, but a little higher than we prefer to see them. So, we do anticipate some relief from a quantity standpoint on the inventory this year. So, certainly we would anticipate being at a higher level than the $665 million of cash flow from our last year, what level, we are not really projecting or guiding toward that but certainly, we're expecting it to be stronger than in 2018.

From a buyback standpoint, we're consistent with the way we're approaching buybacks, being opportunistic and really looking at where the stock was trading in the fourth quarter, there was a lot of volatility. They gave us a lot of opportunity, we looked at buying back shares of Reliance is being the most low risk acquisition that we can make. So we needed to see our stock trading there, but we're pleased we were able to repurchase the shares at that level because we think it's very positive for our shareholders on a long-term basis. So we took advantage of that and we'll continue to look at opportunities as we move forward. I think, I saw some hints of comments that maybe we bought back more stock because we didn't see other opportunities but we continue to see opportunities for all of our capital allocation levers, as Jim mentioned in his comments. There are still acquisition opportunity out there, we expect to continue to execute on that as we move forward as we did last year.

Dividends, we just increase again in the first quarter of this year. So we're happy to do that for our shareholders and then we're continuing to invest in capital expenditures to grow the business, we're at our highest level last year and have a high budget for this year because we continue to see a lot of good opportunities to do more for our customers. So, we'll approach the share buybacks, the same way we have been doing.

Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Okay. High quality (ph) problem. Thanks a lot guys.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Thanks.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Timna.

Operator

Our next question is from Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank. Please go head.

Chris Terry -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. Just two from me. Firstly, just to flesh out the capital management. Just a little bit further, basically in terms of buyback and dividend in total, you paid close to the net income of the company to 2018, understand you use buybacks opportunistically. Maybe you can just comment on the split of buybacks versus dividends and the -- the total amount that you willing to allocate. And the second question I had, it's probably for Karla as well. Just on the CapEx around the 230 level, 240 level over the last two years, a few years ago it used to be below the 200 level. Should we eventually expect that you glide down to that point or how do we think about forward CapEx. Thank you.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Hi, Chris. So first off on kind of the capital allocation and the split between buybacks and dividends. We did have a fairly high shareholder return cash amount out last year but as we commented, we think it was good execution on that. Dividends, we did not have a formal policy that -- what we try to do is make sure we're returning from a yield standpoint, kind of at or above markets levels for our best-in-class type of stock. We also don't want to make sure that our quarterly dividend rate is at a long-term sustainable level because we have never and do not want to in the future have to reduce or start paying a dividend. So that's kind of how we manage the dividend there as the company continues to grow, we're able to increase our dividend rate periodically which we have to continue to do going forward, but want to keep it at that sustainable level.

And then as we mentioned on the share buyback, it's really opportunistic. We look at where the stock's trading. We look at other opportunities and we'll execute with that. So we don't have a set target, we want the flexibility to be able to jump into the market, and we think it makes the most sense for us. And then on -- from a CapEx standpoint, you've seen our gross profit margin improve our sustainable range, which we think the sustainable part of that has really been due to the additional value-added processing that we're doing, and where we can provide more value to our customers. So we're able to get paid for that and so our people out in this field work very closely with their customers and we are always looking for opportunities of how can we do more for our existing customers and some prospective customers.

And so with the opportunities we've seen, we have been at higher levels of capital expenditures over the last few years, we've also taken advantage of some of the -- of our operations center in leased facilities. If there are good operations for our businesses we prefer to own those. So we've also bought out some of our leased properties and those indeed bigger ticket items for us, but again remember that we were doing in that $230 million, there are a lot of different CapEx items, there are 300 different -- 300 plus different operating locations out there and we're continuing to invest in all of them with equipment and facility upgrade.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, Chris, Karla is right. Our customers are asking us to do more and more. They are just -- they are -- whatever their business plan is, they seems to be shifting a bit and we're kind of known for being a value-added type of business and when they ask and that makes sense for us, we'll buy, technology certainly changes a lot of the equipment we buy. Saws and lasers and all the different things where we get into now are frankly better than they were X amount of years ago, they hold tighter tolerances, they are faster, they are safer, and when we see an opportunity like that we can -- like Karla said offer something different to our customer base and make money on it, then we're going to do it and we've got a lot of really bright operators out in the field. And when they ask, we listen.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

And to your longer term question Chris, I mean, I think coming back down to $200 million for an average longer term CapEx level is probably reasonable.

Chris Terry -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Okay, thanks. Thanks, Jim, thanks Karla, all makes sense. Appreciate it.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Chris.

(Operator Instructions) My next question is from Chris Olin from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.

Chris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst

Hey, good morning.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Good morning, Chris.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning, Chris.

Chris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst

Curious, given your view on kind of the short-term -- shorter-term order trends, was the business or any of the stores impacted by either weather in the fourth quarter, particularly on the construction markets? Or did you see any kind of abnormal order activity during the government shutdown that could've support the business?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Chris, we don't -- we never blame our business on the weather or on something and that we can't control. Because what happens is -- if they need the product or the part and they can't get it today or tomorrow because of weather or government shutdown or some, they're eventually going to need, it. So if we may -- the timing may move, sometimes the timing moves month-to-month or over a quarter, but eventually it comes back. So we don't -- we don't, the weather and the government shutdown, things like that we do not -- we don't control that, but all we can really control is that we can provide on an uninterrupted flow of really good product to our customer bases. So when they do open back up or when they're able to receive the material -- we'll get it to. So it could be delayed by a couple of days, sometimes a week, I don't know how bad the situation is, but we've been out that long time. So doesn't really change.

Chris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst

Okay, that's fair. And I guess my second question is, can you talk a little bit more about aerospace? I guess, specifically, I'm curious if you anticipate any type of negative impact on, say, the aluminum plate market given the news about Airbus canceling its A380 program, that's a pretty big consumer of material, just any risk of inventory management or something like that?

William K. Sales -- Executive Vice President, Operations

Hey Chris, this is Bill. We really don't -- if you look at the aerospace plate market right now on the supply side, it's extremely tight. And again, when we look at the future, and we look at where mill lead times are, backlogs and build rates, it's very positive. Long-term, I mean if you look at what will happen with the cancellation, our eventual cancellation of that plane that will take obviously some capacity or some need out of the market, but overall that's being built back with conversions to other planes. So I think, if we look at -- right now on the aerospace side, the outlook continues to be very positive. We've had tremendous strength in North America and maybe the rest of the world wasn't quite as strong. Now we're seeing the rest of the world improve a bit too. So all of that leads to a real positive outlook on the aerospace side.

Chris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst

Can I just ask what percentage of your business now is aerospace related?

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

On the sales dollar basis, it's probably around 12%.

Chris Olin -- Longbow Research -- Analyst

Okay, great. Thank you.

Our next question is from Phil Gibbs from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Phil Gibbs -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Hey good morning.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Good morning, Phil.

Phil Gibbs -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Sometimes of a little bit more, maybe a little bit more color on the CapEx budget this year pretty healthy again has we noted a couple of times, but any big projects in particular, in that number. I know you talked about some of the value-added processes and a lot of your customers pulling you in those directions, which is a good problem to have, but any notable pieces in there?

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

I think, Phil, as I mentioned, we've got a couple of facilities where we are buying out the leases. So that takes up a chunk of the CapEx. We announced last year that we were expanding our aluminum toll process -- our toll processing business down in Kentucky to support a lot of the growth of aluminum down there. So that was a big item for last year carrying over into this year, it's really a lot of equipment and it's really spread out.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

They're all bigger clients. I mean, tube lasers are, $2 million plus. Flat lasers are well over $1 million. Those are, those are big ticket items. So we take them over a very seriously. So those that we have, I guess that we have -- we have a lot of big events that are -- that roll up into that large number. And if you would see as the front-out of our CapEx you'd be amazed how many line items are on that thing. But they all add up, and they're all expenses.

Phil Gibbs -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay. Then Karla your share count for the first quarter. Can you give us just exactly what that number is, I think you had pushed us some direction there?

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, so basically our actual shares outstanding at the end of 2018, we're at just over or just under $67 million shares and we generally have about a $1 million more shares that gets added to our diluted earnings per share. So right around 68-ish million shares.

Phil Gibbs -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay, that's helpful. And just want to say Greg if you're out there, I hope you're on the beach somewhere (ph).

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

He's probably sleeping, he is trying to get that fish in the boat.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Bill.

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Bill.

Our next question is from Tyler Kenyon from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.

Tyler Kenyon -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Hey good morning. Just wanted to touch on SG&A, a little bit. So we have seen some inflation labor transportation costs. Just curious if you can update on some of the inflationary pressures that you're seeing there, is that abating, getting worse and what appreciated? Thanks.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, so I think one thing on the SG&A, Tyler that we had commented on earlier in 2018 and as you've seen in -- our profitability levels, especially our pre-tax levels were up significantly in 2018 compared to prior years, and our compensation structure is very performance-based, not just here in our corporate office but also out in all of our management teams that are different operations. So, our elevated pre-tax income levels in '18, drove our compensation expense up because of that, which we think, it's kind of a good problem to have.

So, in '19 even though we expect continued high levels of profitability as a percent the margins and with some expectation that prices might come down a bit and not having the consistent mill increases that allow us to pop up our gross profit margin. We would expect some of that comp expense to potentially come down. We could get normal raises in 2019 as we normally do. So there is some inflation that you need to build in and I think the transportation costs, we did see a big ramp up last year, it's still a tight market out there for us to hire drivers and then also for our third-party carriers. But we're not expecting increases the rates that we had last year.

Tyler Kenyon -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Great. Yeah, thanks for all that color. So I guess the other, the last question I had was just on -- and I think you alluded to it earlier, but the M&A opportunities that you're seeing out there in -- at least, still aggressively pursuing that growth angle. Just curious, if you could provide us an update with -- what kind of opportunities you're seeing, right now. What are you seeing in terms of valuation and where would you be more positively disposed to in terms of expanding your reach from an end market or product category perspective?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, with the -- let's call it a target-rich environment. There's a lot of opportunities coming our way. We looked at lot of them last year. We pulled the trigger on -- how many, we did about three. But we don't change our kind of game plan when it comes to look at M&A, you have to -- you have to reach a certain point. We don't buy fixer-uppers. We like -- we only buy companies that are immediately accretive. They have to have the right people involved, they have to fit our culture. They have to good succession planning in place, and if you have those things and you make money and we like it. There's pretty good chance we'll talk to you and visit and see if we can't work something out so they're not there. Over the last couple of years this is my opinion.

I think that the tax reform kind of answered a lot of questions for these kind of family owned companies that are out there, that have been launched, they that want to sell because of the generational thing. Grandpa started the business, dad ran it, the kids don't want to be part of it and that's kind of companies it seems like we talked to a lot of I think. So there are more willing to engage with us and in kind of more willing to sell at reasonable price, sometimes people think their companies are off worth a lot more than we may think there were, but there's lot of out there. We stay busy. There's not a week doesn't come by that, Karla doesn't walk down the hall and hand me a several other than say, hey look, these guys. So it's busy.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

And I think on valuation, we have not changed the way we value companies that we try to look over a cycle and understand what we think the right normalized level of future earnings is for them and then we value the company based upon that. 2018 was a really good year for Reliance. It was also a good year for a lot of other companies out there, and we understand that. So, when we look at opportunities. We understand what happened in '18 and we believe we're still evaluating consistently and we hope that other potential buyers out there are sharp enough to also understand, that 2018 created some really strong earnings from our companies.

And then also Tyler, you asked about if there are any specific targets. You know, it really, other than the fact that what Jim mentioned about. We look for good companies. We do like kind of the higher margin specialty products and higher value add type companies but we look at every opportunity that's out there and determine if we think it's the right fit for Reliance or not.

Tyler Kenyon -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Thanks very much.

Karla R. Lewis -- Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Thanks Tyler.

Our next question is from Martin Englert from Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Thanks. Just one quick follow-up on Aerospace Aluminium heat-treated plate. Can you talk about how the lead times compare today versus where they were at in fourth quarter and maybe touch on the inventory trends there, whether there's any kind of destocking that still persist?

William K. Sales -- Executive Vice President, Operations

Yeah, happy to do that Martin. This is Bill. The lead times, I mean we've gone -- just recently, we've seen some of the domestic mills. The lead times have moved out one completely sold out through 2019. So, the supply side of that continues to be on the type side and as I mentioned, we receive the rest of the world that we're in the market was not as strong. We are seeing that improve. So, those lead times from those suppliers are starting to move out and so again, we see continued strength on the aerospace side.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Thanks for that. And the inventory trends there, what are you seeing?

James D. Hoffman -- President and Chief Executive Officer

There is some talk in the market about destocking. I think that's really more at the OEM level, it's really not an issue in terms of our business. See in a couple of reports where that the position was that destocking or the inventory in the system was moderating or there was less of it. I think that's specific to a couple of situations overall from our inventory standpoint, we're in good shape. We are not overstocked by any means.

Martin Englert -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Okay, thanks for all that detail there.

I will now turn the call over to Jim Hoffman, President and CEO of Reliance.

Jim Hoffman

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year financial results with you today. 2018 was an incredible year for Reliance, full of significant financial and operational milestones. But more importantly, I'm happy to say, we improved our safety performance and I would like to say thank you to each of our 15,000 plus employees for making safety part of our culture.

In 2018, we achieved numerous earnings records invested in growth through both acquisitions and organic initiative and demonstrated our continued confidence in the strength of our business strategy and outlook by repurchasing a record $484.9 million of our common stock. Earlier this month, we celebrated Reliance's 80th anniversary. Reliance was founded in 1939 based on the core principles of providing outstanding service to our customers. We have grown tremendously in our 80-year history, made possible by our decade long course of expansion through organic growth and strategic acquisitions with emphasis on high margin, specialty products and value-added processing. Today, we are the largest metal service center country -- company in North America, servicing over 125,000 plus customers over 300 locations in 40 states and 13 countries outside of the US.

Despite tremendous growth of our business and footprint, our founding commitment to customer service remains unchanged and our many accomplishments would not be possible without our folks in the field, across the entire Reliance family of companies. We thank each of you, not only for the contributions you have made to our growth, profitability and quality of earnings, but for your unwavering daily commitments to delivering unparalleled customer service enhancing Reliance's safety culture and giving back to the communities in which you live.

I would also like to acknowledge Gregg Mollins, for his immense contributions to Reliance during his time as President and CEO, and throughout his 32-year tenure with the company. Gregg's influence is visible in our -- as our culture of customer service and caring for our employees, as well as our focus on gross profit margin, inventory management and organic growth that contributed to our record financial achievements in 2018. Thank you for all you've done Gregg.

2018 was marked by multiple quarters of record financial performance. We experienced improved pricing conditions healthy demand and excellent execution by our managers in the field. As a result, we generated record net sales of $11.53 billion, which -- when combined with our strong gross profit margin of 28.4% produced record gross profit dollars of $3.28 billion and record pre-tax income of $850.6 million.

Importantly, our pre-tax income increased 45.7% year-over-year on an 18.7% year-over-year increase in sales. Demonstrating the strength of our business model and disciplined strategy of focusing on higher margin business. Our full-year non-GAAP earnings of $8.94 per diluted share was also a new Reliance record and represents a year-over-year increase in 64.3%.

Turning to the fourth quarter, while we experienced the normal seasonal decline of lower shipping volumes due to the customer shutdowns and vacation schedules, underlying demand remained healthy and we continue to experience positive demand conditions across end markets we serve.

As a result, our tons sold in the fourth quarter were down 5% from the third quarter of 2018 at the top end of our expected range of down 5% to 7%. Our outlook remains positive in 2019 with feedback on demand trends of our end markets, ranging from steady to strong. Overall metals processing was relatively steady in the fourth quarter with our average selling price per tons sold down 0.4% compared to the third quarter of 2018. Our fourth quarter pricing outlook of flat to up 1% factor in the potential for some price increases. Following the October announcement of a price increase for carbon flat-rolled products which did not hold.

Our average selling price in the fourth quarter increased 20.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by both solid demand and trade actions that supported multiple mill price increases throughout the first nine months of 2018. However, the absence of meaningful mill price increases in the fourth quarter pressured our gross profit margin from elevated levels in the first three quarters of 2018. In addition, we recorded LIFO expense of $106.8 million in the fourth quarter, significantly above our estimate of $55 million, which further impacted our gross profit margin along with the higher than expected tax rate reduced our earnings per diluted share. Karla will discuss the LIFO expense and tax rate in more detail, but in short, adjusting for our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.08 for the $0.55 higher than expected LIFO expense and the $0.10 higher than expected tax rate would have resulted in an earnings per share of $1.73 for the fourth quarter of 2018.

Turning to market conditions in our key end markets. Demand for automotive, which we service mainly through our toll processing operations in the U.S., and Mexico remains very strong. We continue to invest in facilities and value-added processing equipment to meet the increased robust demand for the services we provide, especially related to increased aluminum content in vehicles.

Aerospace also continues to perform well, with mill lead times extending and the backlog for orders remaining solid. We maintain our positive outlook in this market and continue to focus on growing our market share, both domestically and abroad. Demand in heavy industry, energy and non-residential construction was steady in the fourth quarter and we expect actively to remain at similar levels in 2019 as compared to 2018.

Finally, we have noticed in the reduction and demand in semiconductor market. That said, our long-term outlook remains positive and we expect slow improvement in demand as we progress through 2019. As for pricing, mill pricing for carbon steel products remains high levels in the fourth quarter following a number of increases in the first nine months of the year. Pricing for carbon products including plate, structural and tubing, where we have a significant presence were relatively stable during the quarter, though we did see some pressure on carbon flat-rolled price. We believe overall pricing for carbon steel products will remain stable to up in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, and we continue to monitor the recent price increases announced on hot-rolled coil.

Our sales into the aerospace market consist of heat-treated aluminum products, especially plate as well as specialty stainless steel and titanium products. Demand for heat-treated aluminum plate remains strong and the 5% to 7% price increase that became effective in January continues to hold. We saw significant strength in pricing for common alloy aluminum products throughout 2018 with continued increases in the fourth quarter. Demand for common alloy aluminum sheet remains strong and supply continues to be tight, which we expect to persist throughout 2019. Based on these trends, the recent $0.07 per pound price increase announced for March was fully supportive.

Demand for our stainless steel flat products continues to be solid. Our average selling price for stainless steel products in the fourth quarter was relatively steady following price increases announced by the mills during the third quarter. As a reminder, pricing for stainless steel products is impacted by nickel prices which remained challenge. Looking ahead, while lead times remain short and surcharges have been pressured, base prices have continued to hold.

Finally, alloy pricing remains relatively strong supported by positive demand trends in automotive and energy. Turning to capital allocation, our 2019 capital expenditure budget of $230 million is once again focused on strategic investments to drive organic growth. We will continue to invest in our facilities and innovative technology and equipment to support our customers need. Importantly, we continue to identify opportunities to expand our value-added processing capabilities, which positively contributed to our gross profit margin.

We are pleased with the robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities in the market, but we will remain selective in our M&A activity. Our November 2018 acquisition of All Metals Holding, LLC aligns with our strategy of acquiring well-run businesses that complement our diversification of products, service, geography and our value-added processing capabilities. All Metals specializes in toll processing and transportation and logistics services primarily for customers servicing the automotive, construction, appliance and other diverse end markets, strengthening our already solid position in these markets.

From a shareholders' return perspective, quarterly cash dividends and share repurchase remain core to our capital allocation philosophy. We paid regular quarterly dividends for 59 consecutive years and the 10% dividend increase announced today represents 26 increase since our 1994 IPO. Our record share repurchases in 2018 reflect the trust and confidence our board and management have in our strong consistent business strategy and outlook. And we will continue to be opportunistic in our approach to repurchases.

I am extremely proud of our 2018 financial results made possible by the excellent execution of our dedicated employees and supported by solid pricing and strong demand in the marketplace. Looking ahead, we remain confident about the demand environment in nearly all of the end markets we served, supporting our ability to maximize our earnings power and increase value for our stockholders. In closing, keeping our employees safe is our most important goal and while applaud our team for improving our safety performance through 2018, we must aim to continue to improve in 2019.

Thank you for your time and attention today. I will now turn the call over to Karla to review our fourth quarter 2018 financial results in more detail. Karla?

Karla Lewis

Thanks, Jim, and good morning everyone. Our record sales of $11.53 billion in 2018, were up $1.81 billion from 2017 due to the healthy demand and improved pricing conditions that Jim discussed, as well as our focused pricing discipline and increased levels of value-added processing with 49% of our orders processed in 2018. Our tons sold were up 1% and our average selling price was up 17.9% increase in our average order size in 2018 to $2,130. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 were $2.81 billion, up $437.6 million or 18.4% from the fourth quarter of 2017. And while our tons sold decreased 1.6% year-over-year, our average stock price per tons sold rose 20.4%.

Our 2018 gross profit of $3.28 billion was a record and our gross profit margin of 28.4% was near the high end of our estimated sustainable range of 27% to 29% primarily due to the positive impact of increased metal pricing in 2018. However, the increased metal prices also negatively impacted our gross profit margin with our highest ever annual LIFO expense of $271.8 million or $2.81 earnings per diluted share compared to $30.7 million or $0.26 EPS in 2017.

Because LIFO is an annual calculation that we estimate during the year and record to actual at the end of each year and because our LIFO expense was $51.8 million higher than we had estimated at the end of the third quarter of 2018. Our LIFO expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $106.8 million or $1.13 earnings per share. This is significantly higher than estimated LIFO expense along with the lack of mill price increases in the fourth quarter of 2018, combined to reduce our gross profit margins to 25.2% and was higher than our LIFO expense of $77.5 million in the third quarter of 2018 and $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. When metal prices increase, our inventory costs increase and generate LIFO expense.

This results in lower gross profit during these periods that builds the LIFO reserve that will be reversed and generate LIFO income in future periods when metal prices decline and will positively benefit our gross profit margin and earnings during periods of declining prices. Our 2018 LIFO expense of $271.8 million, increased our LIFO reserve to $293.6 million as of December 31, 2018. Currently, we estimate that metal prices will be somewhat lower at December 31, 2019 than at December 31, 2018 with an estimated annual LIFO benefit or income of $50 million in 2019. As in prior years, we will update our expectations quarterly based upon our inventory costs and metal pricing trends.

As a percentage of net sales, our fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 18% down from 20.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and consistent with the third quarter of 2018. The reduction as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher selling prices in 2018, which increased our net sales. In addition, our SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 included a gain from the sale of non-core assets that reduced our expenses by $18.2 million.

Our record pre-tax income of $850.6 million in 2018 represents an increase of $266.8 million or 45.7% compared to 2017 due to our strong execution and a favorable pricing and demand environment. Pretax income in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $123.9 million. Our effective income tax rate was 24.5% in 2018 with our rate increasing to 29.5% in the fourth quarter as we adjusted certain deferred tax amounts to comply with recently issued interpretations of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our tax rate was a negative 6.4% in 2017 due to a one-time benefit of $207.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 attributable to the enactment of the new tax rules. We currently expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 24.5%.

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $85.6 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $1.22, which were reduced by $0.55 as a result of higher-than-expected LIFO expense and $0.10 from our higher tax rate that benefited by $0.20 from the sale of the non-core asset and $0.04 from our share repurchases in the quarter. For the full year, we had record net income of $633.7 million and record earnings per share of $8.75. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were also the highest in Reliance's history at $8.94, up $3.50 or 64.3% from $5.44 in 2017.

Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow, our record 2018 earnings resulted in strong cash flow from operations of $664.6 million despite higher working capital requirements, with $431.3 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2018. We used our cash flow to execute on our capital allocation priorities of investing in the growth of our business and returning value to our stockholders. In 2018, we invested a record $239.9 million in capital expenditures and paid $77.6 million to complete three acquisitions to further grow our business.

We also continued to execute on our stockholder return activities with a record share repurchases totaling $484.9 million and payment of $145.3 million in dividends to our stockholders. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased $4.55 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $77.77 per share for a total of $354.2 million. For the full year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased $6.07 million shares at an average cost of $79.94 per share. The pro forma annual effect of our total 2018 share repurchases is $0.77 earnings per diluted share. At December 31, 2018, our total debt outstanding was $2.21 billion resulting in a net debt to total capital ratio of 30.8%, our net debt to EBITDA multiple was 1.7 times. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had $533 million available on our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, providing us ample liquidity to continue executing all areas of our capital allocation strategy.

Turning to our outlook, we are optimistic with regard to business conditions in the first quarter of 2019 and we expect that demand in the first quarter will remain healthy. As a result, we estimate our tons sold will be at 6% to 8% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, which reflects the normal seasonal increase in shipping volumes compared to the fourth quarter. As Jim discussed, we anticipate price increases for many of our products, given recent announcements and solid pricing fundamentals supported by current demand, raw material costs and the effects of ongoing trade actions.

However, we expect our average selling price in the first quarter of 2019 will be flat to down 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. As many of these price increases are not effective for the full quarter and our average selling price trended downward during each month of the fourth quarter of 2018. As discussed earlier, we expect our inventory costs at December 31, 2019 to be lower than at the beginning of the year and therefore we currently estimate LIFO income of $12.5 million in the first quarter of 2019. We also anticipate a $0.17 benefit to our earnings in the first quarter of 2019 due to the lower number of total shares outstanding as a result of our 2018 repurchases.

As a result, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45 for the first quarter of 2019. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our financial and operational results in 2018, which were supported by a solid demand and pricing environment and outstanding execution by our employees. Our strong balance sheet provides us with the foundation to continue executing our growth and stockholder return activities. Our record repurchase of $484.9 million of our common stock in 2018 and the 10% increase in our quarterly dividend effective in the first quarter of 2019 together reflect the confidence that our Board and Management have in our business outlook and our ability to perform in the current healthy pricing and demand environment.

That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention, and at this time, we would like to open up the call to questions, operator?

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Great, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matthew Korn from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Matthew Korn

So I have like a micro question and then a macro question for you, in a way. We heard in the fourth quarter according to a lot of the steel mills, and they characterize the buyer strike, and they watched key prices to particularly decline, and that was on top of normal seasonality. And I'm looking at your expectations into 1Q19 is a little softer we expected, little bit below the double-digit growth we've been kind of used to in the last couple of years, going into the first quarter. Question there is, do you see any signs even given your optimism on the demand level that buyers for right now, are still holding out a little bit and going hand to mouth? Was it still the phenomenon that you're seeing.

Jim Hoffman

Our business really doesn't change that much. We just kind of pay attention to what our customers need. They seem to be positive. Orders are coming in like they always have. As far as the buyer strike, one of the mills guys said that maybe a try, we don't know. We don't, we don't see those kind of things, but it's -- there are, we were conservative by nature, that's just what we do, but we really just pay attention what our customers are telling us and that's reflected in the orders they give us on a day-to-day basis. But we're -- what we said in the script and our release, we're optimistic, and we think it's going to prove out.

Karla Lewis

And I think Matt those comments were a little more directed as you indicated toward the flat-rolled side of the business, and remember carbon flat-roll is only about 15% of our total sales dollars. So we see that enforcement of business and we think some of the recent price increase announcements may help spur some of those folks to start buying again.

Matthew Korn

Got it, appreciate that. And let me ask on, one more bigger picture question. In the wake of the higher steel prices that we've seen in flat loans, policy changes in the US, over this past year, there has been the number of mills expanding the capabilities, expanding the capacities. Many of these seemingly are in the regions where they feel underserved or whether as there is particular high growth potential. Do you see any kind of risk to your business from a broader steel mill reach or deeper availability of things like coated or painted or the types of processed steel, if these things really to come true?

Jim Hoffman

I don't, -- again we run the business day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month and we just again service our customers where they want to be serviced, we listen to them, all the capacity is coming online. We know all those folks. We're a big customer of all of them. They all have very smart people running those companies, that's what they see is good, good for them and that will be good for us. So I really don't see any risk coming on board to that, we actually our customer and their customer of ours, we do a lot of -- as you've probably realize that we do call processing for a lot of those folks and they are positive. And we like it when our domestic partners are profitable and busy. So we applaud their decisions, because they make good decisions and we're going to be there for them and they will be there for us. So I don't see a big risk.

Operator

Our next question is from Martin Englert from Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Martin Englert

Just wondering if you could touch on what you're seeing so far over the past month or so here with new order entries and maybe talk about what you believe could be driving lower year-on-year volumes more recently, as well as into 1Q here, which I think is implied by the guidance?

Jim Hoffman

If I understand your question promptly, again we -- it just changes daily. We run the company day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month. We can have a good day, and not so good days. There's really nothing that I can really pin point.

Karla Lewis

Yes, I mean volumes were a little lighter, Q4'18 to '17, you know and I think the MSCI numbers for January came out, and they were down a little bit from January last year, but overall, even with the slight decrease, I mean, as Jim mentioned earlier, our customers are still optimistic. I think there's been a little uncertainty in the market from a pricing standpoint, and just general macro concerns out there, but as Jim indicated, I mean day-to-day our customers are busy, maybe not as busy as they were, maybe not buying as much as the year ago, but we're still positive on demand, the demand is supporting, helping pricing levels and we can do very well in this type of environment, even with demand down slightly.

Jim Hoffman

And another thing to remember Martin, we have a really diverse group of customers going into a lot of different markets. And it's hard, it's even difficult for us to look at our company as this massive company. We don't run it that way, we run it like we have many customers and many markets and they all do different things and one market is up, very few times in my 38-year career has every market been up at the same time and every market has been down at the same time. So we've got it -- as part of our strategy also obviously the companies we buy and the products we sell, we like to spread it out as much as we can. So we're a little less of the target when things -- things change dramatically in the market as -- part of our market could be up.

Martin Englert

Okay, thanks. I appreciate all that detail there. Maybe, if you can just provide an update also on your tolling business there. You touched on this briefly in prepared remarks and kind of continued strength within automotive and I guess what you're seeing at the start of this year, expectations on volumes as the year progresses, and maybe just review some of the past and future growth initiatives that you've had there?

Jim Hoffman

Yes. We like that business. It's a good business for us. It continues to do well. We continue to invest, we've got nice company in Mexico with four locations and we've expanded that. We have a lead company in the U.S. that's extremely busy and as Karla mentioned our CapEx dollars, that they -- it's a capital-intensive business, and we continue to expand their offerings when the -- the number of units and the SARs report comes up, when it goes up or down, it's still at a really, really high number, which is good for us and over the last couple of years we picked up a lot of share, if you will, because of the exposed aluminum that happens to be going, and that's being designed into all kinds of different automobiles, particularly light trucks and what have you, SUVs, that's kind of our sweet spot. And again this one particular company has kind of one of a kind type equipment that we design and build ourselves and they've got a great relationship with -- in the market.

William Sales

And we're also really excited about the new acquisition, All Metals. So that's going to add to the tolling part of our business.

Karla Lewis

And in addition to All Metals, we also increased our ownership of the Acero Prime, our toll processing business in Mexico during the fourth quarter that we now have a 100% ownership of that. So, and we see growth opportunities for them as well and also just to point out our -- the number of tons sold that we report do not include any of our tolling tons and we have seen increases in the number of tons that we've sold both in the fourth quarter of '18 versus the fourth quarter of '17 and in January so far we're also up compared to last year. So because of the investments that we've made in the growth we continue to see us doing more there and picking up the market share primarily -- especially with the aluminum forces.

Jim Hoffman

Yes, another factor, remember, our customer base in that business, it really isn't the end user. It's the producers of the product, whether it be steel or aluminum. So that's kind of a unique relationship. We're their customer and they are our customer.

Martin Englert

Thanks for all the detail there. I don't know if you'll touch on it at all, but are tolling volumes in excess of your reported volumes now.

Karla Lewis

Yes, they are, and they have been for quite some time.

Operator

Our next question is from Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.

Timna Tanners

Yes, hey, good morning, guys. And happy 80th anniversary.

Karla Lewis

Thank you.

Timna Tanners

Okay, so I wanted to ask a little bit more. First, on the year-over-year question that Matt asked earlier, I get the sequential improvement, but are there any areas in particular that are performing worse year-over-year or better if you could just give a little bit more color? And if you could talk a little bit more while you're at it about your key carbon products specifically plate and beams.

Jim Hoffman

Like I said in the remarks. The one market that's not doing real well right now but does have legs going forward is the semiconductor business, it's good business for us. It's a little slow right now, what we anticipate that getting better at some point and then the rest of the markets that we're doing are at good ones. They're at good levels, and levels and they've been better and they've been worse, and so we're okay and we like -- we kind of like where it is. We like where it's going as far as the -- Bill, do you want to say anything about aerospace or anything --?

William Sales

Aerospace continued strength as we said, we really watch lead times backlog and build rates, all those are very positive and our outlook for aerospace continues to be very fast.

Jim Hoffman

And Timna, what was your question on the plate and beams?

Timna Tanners

Just a bit more color on those markets and non-res construction is big for you guys, within plate, beams and pipe, and I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color on those products in that market?

Jim Hoffman

Yes, those are good markets for us. The non-res is chugging along kind of, and we also -- as you all know, we also grow infrastructure spending in there and so we haven't seen that yet, we're all like the rest of Americans are waiting to see if we're going to fix all those bridges that are falling down. So we're hoping that that will come, but as far as the business that we're participating in, it continues to go on in a good direction. We'll see there were some filings and some suits filed on -- let you know, about the product coming in from China into Canada being stock -- semi producers and shipped back into the U.S, which is absolute cheating by the way, and we don't appreciate that no American really should appreciate that. However, that's happening and I don't know -- I have no idea what's that -- what's that findings will be or what the penalties will be, but certainly if that does happen, then we will have a more of a fair -- our fabricators, domestic fabricators will have a fair, more even playing field to participate in. So that could give us a nice little bump.

Plate -- plates are really good product for us, it's an unusual market to figure out what goes on. right now. I believe that plate pricing is, well, it's kind of just a little flat right now. And I -- with Korea being shut out for so long last year, there is an uptick -- the import is an uptick coming in, right now because they're -- they got shut out because of the quality. Now they're getting to catch up. That can't last long. So there may be a little down take in the pricing. I don't know, certainly the import pricing that we do see, it's not attractive. We're not participant but we get all of the offerings and this really not there to drag, I don't see what you can count on Reliance is not participating because we're still 95% huge fans for domestic partners. So we're going to continue to support them. So again, again kind of a boring answer because it continues to be just fine.

Timna Tanners

And I'm surprised you guys didn't mention in a while. I know you guys were involved in that. I think, you mentioned tubing was part of the walls initial phases years ago and now that it looks like it might be getting under way, again, is that an opportunity for you?

Jim Hoffman

I know about as much as the wall -- about what's going to happen to more as you do, nobody knows. So all I know is that we sell metal and people talk metal going into that wall and we certainly will call on pieces and parts of that we have in the past. And if they decide to build some of it, I hope they call Reliance for their tubing in the flight that goes into it.

Timna Tanners

I could switch to Karla. I want to ask a couple of questions on cash flows and just what to expect for 2019. You should see a pretty big working capital release you had in this last couple of quarters. It sounds some pretty high days of inventory and then they kind of came down sharply by the end of the year. Any color you can give us on what kind of working capital release you might expect assuming kind of stable prices? And then on the buyback, is that a signal of more to come or will you capitalizing on a particularly weak market in Q4.

Karla Lewis

Yes. So, hi Timna, first off on the cash flows, we had a strong cash flows in 2018, $665 million for the year and that was, as you commented with higher working capital requirements, primarily from the price standpoint of the metals. So, we anticipate given our guidance on LIFO and things that we would have a little relief, just from a price standpoint in 2019. And our inventories, we did end the year at a higher level than what our goal is inventories is still in decent shape, but a little higher than we prefer to see them. So, we do anticipate some relief from a quantity standpoint on the inventory this year. So, certainly we would anticipate being at a higher level than the $665 million of cash flow from our last year, what level, we are not really projecting or guiding toward that but certainly, we're expecting it to be stronger than in 2018.

From a buyback standpoint, we're consistent with the way we're approaching buybacks, being opportunistic and really looking at where the stock was trading in the fourth quarter, there was a lot of volatility. They gave us a lot of opportunity, we looked at buying back shares of Reliance is being the most low risk acquisition that we can make. So we needed to see our stock trading there, but we're pleased we were able to repurchase the shares at that level because we think it's very positive for our shareholders on a long-term basis. So we took advantage of that and we'll continue to look at opportunities as we move forward. I think, I saw some hints of comments that maybe we bought back more stock because we didn't see other opportunities but we continue to see opportunities for all of our capital allocation levers, as Jim mentioned in his comments. There are still acquisition opportunity out there, we expect to continue to execute on that as we move forward as we did last year.

Dividends, we just increase again in the first quarter of this year. So we're happy to do that for our shareholders and then we're continuing to invest in capital expenditures to grow the business, we're at our highest level last year and have a high budget for this year because we continue to see a lot of good opportunities to do more for our customers. So, we'll approach the share buybacks, the same way we have been doing.

Operator

Our next question is from Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank. Please go head.

Chris Terry

Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. Just two from me. Firstly, just to flesh out the capital management. Just a little bit further, basically in terms of buyback and dividend in total, you paid close to the net income of the company to 2018, understand you use buybacks opportunistically. Maybe you can just comment on the split of buybacks versus dividends and the -- the total amount that you willing to allocate. And the second question I had, it's probably for Karla as well. Just on the CapEx around the 230 level, 240 level over the last two years, a few years ago it used to be below the 200 level. Should we eventually expect that you glide down to that point or how do we think about forward CapEx. Thank you.

Karla Lewis

Yes. Hi, Chris. So first off on kind of the capital allocation and the split between buybacks and dividends. We did have a fairly high shareholder return cash amount out last year but as we commented, we think it was good execution on that. Dividends, we did not have a formal policy that -- what we try to do is make sure we're returning from a yield standpoint, kind of at or above markets levels for our best-in-class type of stock. We also don't want to make sure that our quarterly dividend rate is at a long-term sustainable level because we have never and do not want to in the future have to reduce or start paying a dividend. So that's kind of how we manage the dividend there as the company continues to grow, we're able to increase our dividend rate periodically which we have to continue to do going forward, but want to keep it at that sustainable level.

And then as we mentioned on the share buyback, it's really opportunistic. We look at where the stock's trading. We look at other opportunities and we'll execute with that. So we don't have a set target, we want the flexibility to be able to jump into the market, and we think it makes the most sense for us. And then on -- from a CapEx standpoint, you've seen our gross profit margin improve our sustainable range, which we think the sustainable part of that has really been due to the additional value-added processing that we're doing, and where we can provide more value to our customers. So we're able to get paid for that and so our people out in this field work very closely with their customers and we are always looking for opportunities of how can we do more for our existing customers and some prospective customers.

And so with the opportunities we've seen, we have been at higher levels of capital expenditures over the last few years, we've also taken advantage of some of the -- of our operations center in leased facilities. If there are good operations for our businesses we prefer to own those. So we've also bought out some of our leased properties and those indeed bigger ticket items for us, but again remember that we were doing in that $230 million, there are a lot of different CapEx items, there are 300 different -- 300 plus different operating locations out there and we're continuing to invest in all of them with equipment and facility upgrade.

Jim Hoffman

Yes, Chris, Karla is right. Our customers are asking us to do more and more. They are just -- they are -- whatever their business plan is, they seems to be shifting a bit and we're kind of known for being a value-added type of business and when they ask and that makes sense for us, we'll buy, technology certainly changes a lot of the equipment we buy. Saws and lasers and all the different things where we get into now are frankly better than they were X amount of years ago, they hold tighter tolerances, they are faster, they are safer, and when we see an opportunity like that we can -- like Karla said offer something different to our customer base and make money on it, then we're going to do it and we've got a lot of really bright operators out in the field. And when they ask, we listen.

Karla Lewis

And to your longer term question Chris, I mean, I think coming back down to $200 million for an average longer term CapEx level is probably reasonable.

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. My next question is from Chris Olin from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.

Chris Olin

Curious, given your view on kind of the short-term -- shorter-term order trends, was the business or any of the stores impacted by either weather in the fourth quarter, particularly on the construction markets? Or did you see any kind of abnormal order activity during the government shutdown that could've support the business?

Jim Hoffman

Chris, we don't -- we never blame our business on the weather or on something and that we can't control. Because what happens is -- if they need the product or the part and they can't get it today or tomorrow because of weather or government shutdown or some, they're eventually going to need, it. So if we may -- the timing may move, sometimes the timing moves month-to-month or over a quarter, but eventually it comes back. So we don't -- we don't, the weather and the government shutdown, things like that we do not -- we don't control that, but all we can really control is that we can provide on an uninterrupted flow of really good product to our customer bases. So when they do open back up or when they're able to receive the material -- we'll get it to. So it could be delayed by a couple of days, sometimes a week, I don't know how bad the situation is, but we've been out that long time. So doesn't really change.

Chris Olin

And I guess my second question is, can you talk a little bit more about aerospace? I guess, specifically, I'm curious if you anticipate any type of negative impact on, say, the aluminum plate market given the news about Airbus canceling its A380 program, that's a pretty big consumer of material, just any risk of inventory management or something like that?

William Sales

We really don't -- if you look at the aerospace plate market right now on the supply side, it's extremely tight. And again, when we look at the future, and we look at where mill lead times are, backlogs and build rates, it's very positive. Long-term, I mean if you look at what will happen with the cancellation, our eventual cancellation of that plane that will take obviously some capacity or some need out of the market, but overall that's being built back with conversions to other planes. So I think, if we look at -- right now on the aerospace side, the outlook continues to be very positive. We've had tremendous strength in North America and maybe the rest of the world wasn't quite as strong. Now we're seeing the rest of the world improve a bit too. So all of that leads to a real positive outlook on the aerospace side.

Chris Olin

Can I just ask what percentage of your business now is aerospace related?

Karla Lewis

On the sales dollar basis, it's probably around 12%.

Operator

Our next question is from Phil Gibbs from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Phil Gibbs

Sometimes of a little bit more, maybe a little bit more color on the CapEx budget this year pretty healthy again has we noted a couple of times, but any big projects in particular, in that number. I know you talked about some of the value-added processes and a lot of your customers pulling you in those directions, which is a good problem to have, but any notable pieces in there?

Karla Lewis

I think, Phil, as I mentioned, we've got a couple of facilities where we are buying out the leases. So that takes up a chunk of the CapEx. We announced last year that we were expanding our aluminum -- our toll processing business down in Kentucky to support a lot of the growth of aluminum down there. So that was a big item for last year carrying over into this year, it's really a lot of equipment and it's really spread out.

Jim Hoffman

They're all bigger clients. I mean, tube lasers are, $2 million plus. Flat lasers are well over $1 million. Those are, those are big ticket items. So we take them over a very seriously. So those that we have, I guess that we have a lot of big events that roll up into that large number. And if you would see as the front-out of our CapEx you'd be amazed how many line items are on that thing. But they all add up, and they're all expenses.

Phil Gibbs

Then Karla your share count for the first quarter. Can you give us just exactly what that number is, I think you had pushed us some direction there?

Karla Lewis

Yes, so basically our actual shares outstanding at the end of 2018, we're at just over or just under 67 million shares and we generally have about a 1 million more shares that gets added to our diluted earnings per share. So right around 68-ish million shares.

Phil Gibbs

Okay, that's helpful. And just want to say Greg if you're out there, I hope you're on the beach somewhere.

Jim Hoffman

He's probably sleeping, he is trying to get that fish in the boat.

Karla Lewis

Thanks, Bill.

Operator

Our next question is from Tyler Kenyon from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.

Tyler Kenyon

Just wanted to touch on SG&A, a little bit. So we have seen some inflation labor transportation costs. Just curious if you can update on some of the inflationary pressures that you're seeing there, is that abating, getting worse and what appreciated? Thanks.

Karla Lewis

Yes, so I think one thing on the SG&A, Tyler that we had commented on earlier in 2018 and as you've seen in -- our profitability levels, especially our pre-tax levels were up significantly in 2018 compared to prior years, and our compensation structure is very performance-based, not just here in our corporate office but also out in all of our management teams that are different operations. So, our elevated pre-tax income levels in '18, drove our compensation expense up because of that, which we think, it's kind of a good problem to have.

So, in '19 even though we expect continued high levels of profitability as a percent the margins and with some expectation that prices might come down a bit and not having the consistent mill increases that allow us to pop up our gross profit margin. We would expect some of that comp expense to potentially come down. We could get normal raises in 2019 as we normally do. So there is some inflation that you need to build in and I think the transportation costs, we did see a big ramp up last year, it's still a tight market out there for us to hire drivers and then also for our third-party carriers. But we're not expecting increases the rates that we had last year.

Tyler Kenyon

Great. Yeah, thanks for all that color. So I guess the other, the last question I had was just on -- and I think you alluded to it earlier, but the M&A opportunities that you're seeing out there in -- at least, still aggressively pursuing that growth angle. Just curious, if you could provide us an update with -- what kind of opportunities you're seeing, right now. What are you seeing in terms of valuation and where would you be more positively disposed to in terms of expanding your reach from an end market or product category perspective?

Jim Hoffman

Yeah, with the -- let's call it a target-rich environment. There's a lot of opportunities coming our way. We looked at lot of them last year. We pulled the trigger on -- how many, we did about three. But we don't change our kind of game plan when it comes to look at M&A, you have to -- you have to reach a certain point. We don't buy fixer-uppers. We like -- we only buy companies that are immediately accretive. They have to have the right people involved, they have to fit our culture. They have to good succession planning in place, and if you have those things and you make money and we like it. There's pretty good chance we'll talk to you and visit and see if we can't work something out so they're not there. Over the last couple of years this is my opinion.

I think that the tax reform kind of answered a lot of questions for these kind of family owned companies that are out there, that have been launched, they that want to sell because of the generational thing. Grandpa started the business, dad ran it, the kids don't want to be part of it and that's kind of companies it seems like we talked to a lot of I think. So there are more willing to engage with us and in kind of more willing to sell at reasonable price, sometimes people think their companies are off worth a lot more than we may think there were, but there's lot of out there. We stay busy. There's not a week doesn't come by that, Karla doesn't walk down the hall and hand me a several other than say, hey look, these guys. So it's busy.

Karla Lewis

And I think on valuation, we have not changed the way we value companies that we try to look over a cycle and understand what we think the right normalized level of future earnings is for them and then we value the company based upon that. 2018 was a really good year for Reliance. It was also a good year for a lot of other companies out there, and we understand that. So, when we look at opportunities. We understand what happened in '18 and we believe we're still evaluating consistently and we hope that other potential buyers out there are sharp enough to also understand, that 2018 created some really strong earnings from our companies.

And then also Tyler, you asked about if there are any specific targets. You know, it really, other than the fact that what Jim mentioned about. We look for good companies. We do like kind of the higher margin specialty products and higher value add type companies but we look at every opportunity that's out there and determine if we think it's the right fit for Reliance or not.

Operator

Our next question is from Martin Englert from Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Martin Englert

Thanks. Just one quick follow-up on Aerospace Aluminium heat-treated plate. Can you talk about how the lead times compare today versus where they were at in fourth quarter and maybe touch on the inventory trends there, whether there's any kind of destocking that still persist?

William Sales

Yes, happy to do that Martin. This is Bill. The lead times, I mean we've gone -- just recently, we've seen some of the domestic mills. The lead times have moved out one completely sold out through 2019. So, the supply side of that continues to be on the type side and as I mentioned, we receive the rest of the world that we're in the market was not as strong. We are seeing that improve. So, those lead times from those suppliers are starting to move out and so again, we see continued strength on the aerospace side.

Martin Englert

Thanks for that. And the inventory trends there, what are you seeing?

There is some talk in the market about destocking. I think that's really more at the OEM level, it's really not an issue in terms of our business. See in a couple of reports where that the position was that destocking or the inventory in the system was moderating or there was less of it. I think that's specific to a couple of situations overall from our inventory standpoint, we're in good shape. We are not overstocked by any means.

Clement made his first post to Instagram Wednesday since he resigned as a Conservative MP in November.

Wednesday’s post includes a picture of him standing in the new House of Commons with a statement thanking his followers for getting him through the “dark valley” after the scandal broke.

In November Clement admitted he shared explicit images online with someone he believed to be a consenting female adult but who then turned around and demanded he pay 50,000 euros to prevent the images from going public.

He initially claimed it was a one-time lapse in judgement but when it became clear it wasn’t, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asked him to resign from the party caucus.

Clement now sits as an independent and says he is getting back to his duties as the MP for Parry Sound-Muskoka.

“I had a severe personal crisis and it manifested itself in the irrational behaviour that became apparent and for which I take full responsibility,” Clement says on Instagram.

He also says he was “getting the counselling I needed and working on my family life” during his time away from office.

Earlier this year, two men in the Ivory Coast were arrested and charged with trying to blackmail Clement.

The RCMP is continuing to work with the Ivory Coast’s cyber crimes unit.

Now one of its founders, Gavin Shuker, has provided the answer: to keep the prime minister in office, provided she offered a second referendum.

Shuker tells HuffPost that members of the group first made the offer to May’s de facto deputy, David Lidington, before their resignations:

“I went into the Cabinet Office about a month ago when Theresa May was in full listening mode and sat down with David Lidington when I was a Labour MP and I said, look you can have my support to pass any deal you like on Brexit – it can be Norway, it can be Theresa May’s deal, it can be Canada, whatever you want you can have my vote “But at the end of it I want a confirmatory referendum. “And do you know what? If you do that British politics is going to be shaken quite a bit if you get that through – I’m willing to extend confidence and supply to your government so it doesn’t fall over through the period of the referendum. If it’s a year, fine. “They obviously didn’t choose to go down that route. “But if you are asking me about future hypotheticals about when the maths of parliament are so febrile, it comes down to – to use the cliche – doing the right thing by the country.”

Though Lidington rejected the offer, Shuker said that it still stood in principle. He urged the government to support plans from the Labour backbenchers Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle to amend the next meaningful vote to approve the withdrawal agreement on the condition that it is put to the public in a confirmatory referendum.

The first thing to note is that it is an offer that May was, and is, bound to refuse for reasons of principle – her own opposition to a second referendum is well-known – and internal party management. To accept the Wilson-Kyle amendment would be to split a Conservative coalition that is every bit as restive as Labour. In that respect it is a non-starter.

Then there is the opposition. Some Labour frontbenchers believe that, should it come at the eleventh hour, the leadership could make its peace with voting for the withdrawal agreement on the proviso it was put to a referendum.

Optimists believe that those in the shadow cabinet who are opposed to a second vote are in fact a noisy minority and that such a plan could be spun internally as all things to all people: a vote for Brexit for those in leave constituencies, and a vote for a second referendum for those whose electorates backed remain. Failing to whip in favour of the plan would also risk a string of shadow ministerial resignations and further defections (the reverse is true for May).

But we know that a good chunk of the PLP is sufficiently squeamish about being seen to thwart or frustrate Brexit to oppose any parliamentary move to extend Article 50, especially given the widespread assumption that Theresa May will eventually have to do it herself. It is also clear that the leadership’s preference is to facilitate the passage of a deal without precipitating a further electoral event. When faced with a choice between jettisoning its frontbench Remainers and those in Leave constituencies, it has always chosen the former. Support from either Downing Street or the Labour leadership is more or less essential if Wilson-Kyle is to pass, but for these reasons is unlikely to be forthcoming.

That the Independent Group have drawn a straight line between the passage of that amendment and May surviving in office makes support from Labour unlikelier still. As far as Team Corbyn is concerned, the offer is a political gift. “Offering to prop up a Tory government that has inflicted so much suffering on our communities is shameful,” a source says. “This grubby offer shows what the new establishment coalition really stands for – austerity, privatisation and the interests of the super-rich”.

Given that the price Shuker has set for supporting a Brexit deal is too high for either leadership, it suggests the new grouping has decreased rather than increased the chances of a negotiated settlement passing the Commons – and with it increased the chances of the general election that is much too soon for it to fight.",The Independent Group name their price for keeping the Tories in power,Newstatesman.com,https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/02/independent-group-name-their-price-keeping-tories-power

Chinese technology giant Huawei today unveiled a new folding-screen smartphone on Sunday, which will run on superfact 5G networks and cost twice as much as the latest Apple iPhone, retailing for around £2,000.

Huawei revealed the Mate X phone on the eve of a four-day industry event in Spain to showcase new devices, and Executive Director, CEO of the Consumer Business Group, Richard Yu said it would satisfy consumers' demands for bigger screens and longer battery life when it goes on sale in the summer.

But what is less clear is whether it will satisfy users' demands for privacy, with Huawei under intense suspicion by Western intelligence chiefs who fear the company works as a front for the vast Chinese spy apparatus.

Richard Yu, the Executive Director, CEO of the Consumer Business Group, presented the new Huawei Mate X smartphone at the Mobile World Congress (MWC), on the eve of the world's biggest mobile fair in Barcelona

The Mate has a foldable screen which wraps around the outside of the product, allowing users to view the screen when closed

The new Huawei Mate X device unfolded (left) and folded over (right). Unfolded, the Mate X's screen is 8 inches diagonally, making it the size of a small tablet

At the glitzy Barcelona launch of the device Mr Yu said Huawei engineers spent three years working on the device's hinge, which doesn't leave a gap when shut

Unveiling his company's latest brainchild, Mr Yu asked: 'How can we bring the more big innovation to this smartphone industry?'

The Mate X us his answer. The screen wraps around the outside so users can still view it when it's closed, unlike its competitor, the Galaxy Fold, which has a screen that folds shut.

Unfolded, the Mate X's screen is 8 inches diagonally, making it the size of a small tablet.

Mr Yu said Huawei engineers spent three years working on the device's hinge, which doesn't leave a gap when shut.

The Mate X will retail for £1,996 (2,299 euros or $2,600) when it goes on sale by midyear. The latest iPhone costs around £1,000 and more than Samsung's recently revealed Galaxy Fold, another folding smartphone, which is priced at 'only' $2,000.

Huawei CEO Richard Yu displays the new Huawei Mate X foldable 5G smartphone at the Mobile World Congress, in Barcelona

But consumer who do choose to fork over the price of a second-hand car for the new Chinese phone may be getting more than they bargain for.

The firm, which is also involved in the upgrade of the telecoms network itself, is at the centre of a global row about cybersecurity with multiple Western spy chiefs concerned its technology creates a back door allowing the Beijing regime to listen in on Western conversations.

Senior MPs have called for Britain to ban Huawei from working on the 5G mobile internet upgrade completely.

Conservative MPs Julian Lewis and Bob Seely urged the government to follow the UK's 'Five Eyes' intelligence partners Australia and New Zealand and stop the firm from working on critical infrastructure projects. However, a Huawei spokesperson responded that the New Zealand government `turned down a single 5G proposal submitted for review by one carrier, but the regulatory process was still ongoing'.

Dr Lewis told MailOnline: 'What we have to remember is despite their protestations of independence, there is no such thing as an independent enterprise under a Communist regime.

'And until such time as China ceases to be a dictatorship of the Communist party in China then there can be no meaningful claim to independence by enterprises. We should definitely follow Australia's and New Zealand's example.'

And Mr Seely, a Tory MP and defence expert, warned China may be able to discover the UK's vulnerabilities if its firms are given the crucial contracts.

Their intervention came after Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said he had 'grave concerns' about Huawei.

Julian Lewis (pictured left) and Bob Seely (pictured right) urged the government to follow its Five Eyes intelligence partners Australia and New Zealand and stop the firm from working on critical infrastructure projects.

Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has expressed 'grave' concerns at the prospect of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei being involved in the UK's new 5G network

Mr Williamson said: 'I have grave, very deep concerns about Huawei providing the 5G network in Britain. It's something we'd have to look at very closely.

'We've got to look at what partners such as Australia and the US are doing in order to ensure that they have the maximum security of that 5G network and we've got to recognise the fact, as has been recently exposed, the Chinese state does sometimes act in a malign way.'

Huawei said it was not banned from current or future networks, and the GSCB clarified that the telco could still work with Huawei to address the security risk.

Only last month Dr Ian Levy, technical director of the cyber arm of the UK’s electronic surveillance organisation, , GCHQ, said Huawei still has not produced a ‘credible plan’ to address security concerns.

He said: 'Last year we said we found some worrying engineering and security issues. As of today, we have not seen a credible plan. That’s the reality of the situation unfortunately.’

And Ciaran Martin, head of the National Cyber Security Centre, said he had separate concerns that the company fell short on security standards for its product, regardless of any possible link to Chinese spying.

President Donald Trump signaled on Tuesday that he might reverse a ban which currently prevents Huawei selling phones in the USA as part of a larger China trade deal, tweeting that the U.S. shouldn't win the 5G mobile arms race by 'blocking out currently more advanced technologies'

Trump tweeted less than 90 minutes after Huawei boss Ren Zhengfei s declared in a TV interview that his copmany was not involved in espionage

Huawei phones are currently banned in the US, which considers the Chinese giant's technology a security threat, and only last August President Trump signed into law a bill reaffirming the embargo.

The cloud over Huawei also includes U.S. criminal charges filed last month against the company and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who U.S. prosecutors want to extradite from Canada.

They accuse her of fraud and say the company stole trade secrets, including technology that mobile carrier T-Mobile used to test smartphones.

But in what may be a signal of a forthcoming policy shift, the president tweeted on Thursday that he wants the U.S. 'to win through competition' rather than by blocking out technologies which are currently more advanced.

Allowing Huawei's mobile phone equipment back into U.S. markets could be a carrot for Beijing as Trump's negotiators hash out a new trade framework with the world's second largest economy.

Huawei Technologies is trying to raise its profile in the fiercely competitive smartphone market. Almost everyone with a smartphone has heard of Apple and Samsung, the top device makers, and Google, the creator of the software on Android phones.

Huawei, a Chinese company with a name many people in the West don't know how to pronounce ('HWA-way'), is jockeying for a seat at the top table. Last year it was third in global smartphone sales, behind Apple and Sansung in pole position.

Huawei is making its push at a time that both Samsung and Apple are struggling with declining smartphone sales amid a lull in industry innovation that is causing more consumers to hold on to the devices until they wear out instead of upgrading to the latest model as quickly as they once did.

It remains to be seen whether Britain's savvy consumers will decide £2,000 - plus the risk of their private conversations being overheard by Chinese spies in windowless Beijing listening posts - is a price worth paying for the latest shiny tech toy.

The broad swath of the Trump-hating media that has participated in what has amounted to an unconstitutional attempt to overthrow the government are reduced to reporting the events and revelations of the scandal in which they have been complicit, in a po-faced ho-hum manner to impart to the misinformed public that this is as routine as stock market fluctuations or the burning of an American flag in Tehran.

For more than two years, the United States and the world have had two competing narratives: that an elected president of the United States was a Russian agent whom the Kremlin helped elect; and its rival narrative that senior officials of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and other national intelligence organizations had repeatedly lied under oath, misinformed federal officials, and meddled in partisan political matters illegally and unconstitutionally and had effectively tried to influence the outcome of a presidential election, and then undo its result by falsely propagating the first narrative. It is now obvious and indisputable that the second narrative is the correct one.

The Greatest Constitutional Crisis Since the Civil War

The most immense and dangerous public scandal in American history is finally cracking open like a ripe pomegranate. The broad swath of the Trump-hating media that has participated in what has amounted to an unconstitutional attempt to overthrow the government are reduced to reporting the events and revelations of the scandal in which they have been complicit, in a po-faced ho-hum manner to impart to the misinformed public that this is as routine as stock market fluctuations or the burning of an American flag in Tehran.

For more than two years, the United States and the world have had two competing narratives: that an elected president of the United States was a Russian agent whom the Kremlin helped elect; and its rival narrative that senior officials of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and other national intelligence organizations had repeatedly lied under oath, misinformed federal officials, and meddled in partisan political matters illegally and unconstitutionally and had effectively tried to influence the outcome of a presidential election, and then undo its result by falsely propagating the first narrative. It is now obvious and indisputable that the second narrative is the correct one.

The authors, accomplices, and dupes of this attempted overthrow of constitutional government are now well along in reciting their misconduct without embarrassment or remorse becausein fired FBI Director James Comeys formulationa higher duty than the oath they swore to uphold the Constitution compelled them. Orin fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabes wordsthe threat was too great. Nevermind that the nature of the threat was that the people might elect someone he and Comey disapproved of as president, and that that person might actually serve his term, as elected.

A Long List of Offendersand Offenses

The extent of the criminal misconduct of the former law enforcement and intelligence chiefs is now notorious, but to make the right point here, it has to be summarized. The fact that the officially preferred candidate lied to federal officials about her emails and acted in outright contempt of Congress and the legal process in the destruction of evidence, was simply ignored by the FBI director, who announced that she would not be prosecuted, though he had no authority to make that determination.

The dossier of salacious gossip and defamatory falsehoods amassed by a retired British spy from the lowest grade of intelligence sources in Russia, commissioned and paid for by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, was circulated to the media by high public officials and cited in illegal and dishonest applications to authorize surveillance of the campaign of the other presidential candidate. A special counsel was empowered on the false pretext of the necessity to get to the bottom of Trump-Russian collusion in the election, of which there was and remains no evidence, because it did not occur and was a complete partisan fabrication.

The special counsel then packed his staff with militant Clinton partisans, and acted very late and only when his hand was forced by the media to remove two officials who referred in texts to each other to the Bureaus ability to smear and provoke the impeachment of the winning candidate as an insurance policy against his filling the office to which he was elected.

Large sections of the media colluded with the Democratic campaign and produced the doctrine that anything was justifiable, no matter how dishonest, to destroy the incoming presidents reputation and damage him in public opinion polls to legitimize attempts to remove him from office. Large sections of the media deliberately deluged the public with stories they knew to be false about the new president and referred to him in terms of unprecedented vituperation in what purported to be reportage and not comment.

This unorganized but widespread campaign of defamation was taken up by a great number of ordinarily newsworthy celebrities and was accompanied by false, unresearched stories denigrating President Trumps supporters, such as the false claims about Catholic school students treatment of an elderly native American and the false claim that actor Jussie Smollett had been beaten up and reviled by Trump supporters. The former intelligence chiefs of the nation under President Obama repeatedly have accused this president of treason, the most heinous of all crimes, and have asserted with the authority of their former positions that the Russians determined the result of the 2016 presidential election. They knew this to be entirely false.

Distracting Public Attention

The special counsel has failed to find any evidence of the collusion and electoral interference that was the justification for establishing his inquiry, and the Democrats are already expressing disappointment in his failure to produce such evidence when the leading Democratic members of congressional investigative committees still robotically claim to have at least prima facie evidence of such collusion.

The dishonest attempt of much of the opposition and what even left-leaning media-monitoring organizations record as 90 percent of the national media, continued for more than two years to try to condition the country to believe that the president had committed the high crimes and misdemeanors required by the Constitution for impeachment and removal from office.

The special counsel, apart from smearing the president, distracted public attention from or tended to justify the ever more evident misconduct of the presidents enemies. And we now know that Comey, despite his higher duty, lied to the president about his not being a target of an FBI investigation, illegally leaked to the New York Times the contents of a self-serving memo he purloined from the government, and lied to Congress by claiming 245 times in one sitting to be ignorant of recent matters that no one of sound mind could have forgotten.

And now we have Andrew McCabes proud confirmation that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein not only continued the illegal counterintelligence investigation of President Trump, but actively discussed methods of securing his removal from office by deliberate misuse of a variety of laws, including the Emoluments Clause, the 25th Amendment to deal with mental incompetence, and the Logan Act of 1799, which has never been used successfully and has not been tested in 150 years.

Make Those Responsible Pay at the Polls

This entire monstrous travesty is finally coming apart without even waiting for the horrible disappointment of the special counsels inability to adduce a scrap of evidence to justify his replication of Torquemada as an inquisitor and of the Gestapo and KGB at rounding up and accusing unarmed individuals who were not flight risks. The collapse of this grotesque putsch, under the irresistible pressure of a functioning attorney general and Senate committees that are not hamstrung by NeverTrumpers, will cause a revulsion against the Democratic Party that will be seismic and prolonged.

The disgrace of their misconduct is profound and shocking. Richard Nixon, against whom there is no conclusive evidence that he broke any laws (although a number of people in his entourage did) never did anything like this. J. Edgar Hoover in 47 years at the head of the FBI and its predecessor organization, never tried to meddle in a presidential election. Those responsible will pay for this, including at the polls.

Without realizing the proportions of the emergency, America has survived the greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War. All those who legitimately oppose or dislike the president, including traditional high-brow Republicans who find him distasteful, should join in the condemnation of this largely criminal assault on democracy, and then, if they wish, go out and try to beat him fair and square, the good old-fashioned way, in a free election. But they must abide by the elections result.

Facebook investor Roger McNamee was one of the tech industry’s biggest optimists — cheerleading the boom of Facebook as an early mentor to Mark Zuckerberg. But in the last two years, he’s transformed into a champion for the Washington lawmakers and regulators trying to rein in Big Tech.

The author of “Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe” spent decades in tech investing, with a front-row seat to the rise of top companies. But in 2016, he also had a close-up view of how the social network giant failed to swiftly respond to concerns it was being manipulated by Russia during the presidential election.

Since then, McNamee has emerged as an unlikely activist — regularly advising Washington policymakers on the inner workings of Silicon Valley.

“When I first began talking to people at the [Federal Trade Commission] and members of Congress about these issues in the summer of 2017, we were still in the last days of a 50-year period where there was no reason to regulate tech,” McNamee told me. “What we have now is a dark side has emerged, essentially full-grown out of nowhere, and Washington has to get up to speed.”

McNamee and I spoke yesterday about his book and the action he wants to see from policymakers. Here's our conversation, edited for length and clarity.

Technology 202: What misconceptions did you previously have about how Washington works and approaches regulating business?



McNamee: There is a misperception in Silicon Valley that government can only harm the economy, it can’t help. That is a ridiculous belief. In a capitalist system, the government plays an essential role as the setter and enforcer role. We have forgotten that.

If we look at the way we live today, government doesn’t set the rules and doesn’t enforce them. The tech industry sets the rules and enforces them. Our lives are more governed by the algorithms and the code of companies like Google and Facebook than they are by the law. And yet tech platforms like Google and Facebook were never elected, they are not accountable to anyone, and they show no understanding of the responsibilities that come with the power they have. If they were benevolent dictators, they would be more sympathetic. But as dictators who seem to prioritize only their own short-term best interests, they represent a threat to a lot of the values that are most basic to Americans.

""Zucked"" by Roger McNamee. (Penguin Press)

Tech 202: Is Washington equipped to take on Silicon Valley and rein in these tech companies?

McNamee: It is not only capable of it, but it will do a great job. There are two reasons I think that’s true. The first is that Washington regulates industries far more complex than technology very effectively. I always point to banking, health care and defense.

When you look at tech, we didn’t even know there was something to regulate until the fall of 2017. The products that we’re talking about are products that every member of Congress — with only a handful exceptions — use to some degree or another. All their constituents use them.

Time favors this really strongly. Congress will get younger and more tech literate, and it’s just not that complicated.

Tech 202: What do you think of the recent report that Facebook and the FTC are negotiating over a multibillion fine in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal?

McNamee: If the only thing that happens is a fine, then Facebook will dismiss it as a cost of business. There has to be a second part of any solution, which is we have to change the incentives.

Tech 202: These companies are global, and we’re seeing regulators in Europe scrutinizing the tech giants more and more. Are you also communicating with European regulators and policymakers as they’re looking into Facebook?

McNamee: I have communicated with people in Europe and would be available to help them in any way possible. They seem to have it under control. I look at whether it’s the Global Data Protection Regulation, whether it is the German law that would radically alter the profiling done by Facebook and by others who have similar techniques, whether it is the United Kingdom’s parliamentary report that branded Facebook and its executives as “digital gangsters,” those are all very positive steps.

I don’t think any of these things is the perfect answer. I would prefer to move away from the GDPR or California model of penalties after the fact and go to preventing the kinds of behaviors that cause the problems in the first place, and that would be data related to people’s most private activities, like financial transactions and location. But every one of those laws increases the pressure on the technology platforms and data economy participants to reform their behavior and accept they owe a responsibility to society to do no harm.

Tech 202: What do you think needs to be included in a national privacy law as Congress considers legislation?

McNamee: If you want to protect people’s privacy, the most important thing is to eliminate the exploitation of their most private data. It’s hard to get the genie back in the bottle on the data itself. It’s very straightforward to eliminate use cases. Eliminating the use of personal financial data without explicit permission on a per transaction basis is the most obvious place to start.

BITS, NIBBLES AND BYTES

The Federal Trade Commission in Washington on Jan. 28, 2015. (Alex Brandon/AP)

BITS: Lawmakers on Capitol Hill and privacy advocates say the Federal Trade Commission's investigation into Facebook is a test of the agency's ability to rein in Silicon Valley giants, The Washington Post's Tony Romm reported. “The FTC is speaking to the whole industry in what it does here. Its audience is well beyond Facebook and that company's customers. It’s to the whole world and the entire tech industry, that finally it means business in protecting privacy,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said. The FTC is negotiating with the social network on a fine that could reach billions of dollars and would settle a probe by the agency into Facebook's privacy practices.

Some critics have claimed that the agency has not been tough enough with tech firms that don't abide by their legal agreements about privacy issues with the FTC. “The Facebook inquiry is a basic test of the credibility of the FTC to be an effective privacy enforcement agency,” William Kovacic, a former Republican FTC commissioner who now teaches at George Washington University, told Tony. “Anything other than a significant penalty will be seen as a form of policy failure and will really impede the agency’s ability to function in the future.”

NIBBLES: Disinformation efforts are targeting several candidates or potential contenders for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election, Politico's Natasha Korecki reported. The disinformation campaign, which uses memes and hashtags and misrepresents the candidates' positions, appears aimed at undercutting the contenders as they are still in the early days of their presidential bids. Those efforts have mainly targeted Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who have officially announced their candidacies, as well as former congressman Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.), who is weighing a presidential run.

Some signs suggest that part of the disinformation efforts are coordinated and bear similarities with the Russian troll farm Internet Research Agency's tactics, but this activity has not been definitely attributed to specific actors. Moreover, not all of those disinformation efforts are the result of a coordinated effort. “Recent posts that have received widespread dissemination include racially inflammatory memes and messaging involving Harris, O’Rourke and Warren,” Politico reported. “In Warren’s case, a false narrative surfaced alleging that a blackface doll appeared on a kitchen cabinet in the background of the senator’s New Year’s Eve Instagram livestream.”

BYTES: Several companies have paused advertising on YouTube after a video blogger reported material sexually exploiting children on the site, the Wall Street Journal's Patience Haggin and Suzanne Vranica reported. Companies that have removed ads from the video platform include Nestlé, McDonald’s, Epic Games, which makes the video game Fortnite, Canada Goose and other firms. For a brand to be associated with that kind of content can damage their reputation, according to ad buyers, the Journal noted. A spokeswoman for YouTube said the company took quick action against the material after it found out about the issue.

“The advertisers’ withdrawals come after video blogger Matt Watson posted a video on YouTube on Sunday that showed inappropriate user comments about videos featuring underage girls, including some that identified precise segments where children appear in compromising positions,” according to the Journal. “The video, which had received over 1.7 million views as of Wednesday afternoon, said YouTube’s recommendation algorithm leads users to similar content.”

— Pinterest stopped showing results for searches on terms related to vaccination in an effort to crack down on unsubstantiated anti-vaccination content on its platform, the Wall Street Journal's Robert McMillan and Daniela Hernandez reported. The company made the change late last year and has also started to police content about unreliable cancer therapies. Pinterest has said its decision to block searches on vaccination is temporary. “Most shared images on Pinterest relating to vaccination cautioned against it, contradicting established medical guidelines and research showing that vaccines are safe, Pinterest said,” according to the Journal. “The image-searching platform tried to remove the antivaccination content, a Pinterest spokeswoman said, but has been unable to remove it completely.”

— Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) wants Amazon to open headquarters in Newark after the tech company abandoned plans to do so in New York amid local opposition, Cheddar's Jim Roberts reported. “We want HQ2,” Booker told Cheddar in an interview. “We’ve sent that message out already. And everybody from the Governor to the Mayor to local leaders have been reaching out to Amazon.” Booker, a former mayor of Newark, also suggested that the city could be able to address concerns about gentrification. “We are growing and booming as a city,” he said. “But we are making sure that we have a pathway for all of Newarkers to prevent the ills that are often evident in gentrification and make sure that things work on our terms.” (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P.

— A conservative group called Job Creators Network placed a billboard in Times Square scolding Rep.

A powerful Tory backbencher and future leadership contender last night set himself on a collision course with Theresa May over her hardline stance on immigration.

Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, let rip in a coded assault on the PM at the spring gathering of the party’s grassroots officials.

In a plea not to clamp down on Britain’s borders after Brexit, he said the UK must be ‘more open’ in order to attract the brightest immigrants.

In a withering attack, he said: ‘I was struck when in India recently, when I heard time and again that some of the best students weren’t coming to Britain.

‘They were going to Australia and New Zealand, to the United States and Canada to study there… because their countries are open.

'They are more engaged, more willing to accept students from around the world. Instead of looking open, too often we have been closed.

‘If we are going to play our part in the world, we need to change that.’

His rebuke comes after one of the three MPs to quit the Conservative Party last week claimed that Mrs May’s desire to end freedom of movement from Europe was a key reason behind why they left.

Anna Soubry said she was ‘really worried’ that the Prime Minister has a ‘problem with immigration’.",Tory backbencher Tom Tugendhat goes head-to-head with Theresa May on immigration,Daily Mail,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6738169/Tory-backbencher-Tom-Tugendhat-goes-head-head-Theresa-immigration.html

THE BIG IDEA: Barack Obama opposed reparations for the descendants of slavery when he ran for president. He warned the NAACP in 2007 that they would be used as “an excuse for some to say we’ve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work” of enforcing anti-discrimination laws, improving public education, rehabilitating young men coming out of prisons and lifting people out of poverty.

In 2016, neither Hillary Clinton nor Bernie Sanders supported reparations for the black community as a redress for slavery. Even as he promised a revolution of democratic socialism that would include tuition-free college and Medicare-for-all, Sanders said paying reparations to African Americans was a bridge too far. “First of all, its likelihood of getting through Congress is nil,” he said. “Second of all, I think it would be very divisive.”

But this is not your father’s Democratic Party, and it’s not 2016 anymore.

Four declared Democratic presidential candidates have signaled support for some form of reparations to specifically benefit African Americans: Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Julián Castro and Marianne Williamson. This puts more pressure on the rest of the crowded field to endorse race-conscious policies and could provide fresh fodder for President Trump to portray his 2020 challengers as outside the mainstream.

In the modern political sense, the term “reparations” is a little like “socialism.” It means very different things to different people, and the devil is in the details. Many think of direct cash payments to African Americans when they hear the word. Others think more broadly of investments that are specifically made by the government to lift communities of color. What one person calls reparations someone else might just describe as strengthening the social safety net. The fact that candidates are willing to use the term at all after generations of Democratic standard-bearers have seemed allergic to it reflects a sea change.

Like other issues where the Democratic Party is lurching leftward lately, such as the widespread embrace of the Green New Deal, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is once again driving the pace car. She expressed support for exploring the idea of reparations last month, using the pulpit that has come with her celebrity to move the issue to the front burner. “People think reparations is reparations for slavery, but really, economically speaking, reparations are for the damage done by the New Deal and redlining because that is where we saw a compounding of the existing inequity from the legacy of slavery, where we drew red lines around black communities,” Ocasio-Cortez said.

-- Warren (D-Mass.) on Thursday became the latest candidate to jump on the reparations bandwagon. “We must confront the dark history of slavery and government-sanctioned discrimination in this country that has had many consequences, including undermining the ability of black families to build wealth in America for generations,” the senator said in a statement to the New York Times. “We need systemic, structural changes to address that.”

-- Castro expressed openness to reparations in an interview with the Root, a publication that caters to an African American audience, that also published yesterday. “I have long thought that this country would be better off if we did find a way to do that,” said the former secretary of housing and urban development. “I don’t find the notion challenging. What I do find challenging is the best way to do that.”

-- Harris (D-Calif.) said “yes” last week when asked explicitly whether she supports “some form of reparations for black people.” “Well, look, I think that we have got to address that,” the senator said during an appearance on “The Breakfast Club,” a radio show popular with African Americans. “Again, it goes back to the inequities. … We have got to recognize that and give people a lift up. And there are a number of ways to do it.”

Harris mentioned a bill she’s introduced called the LIFT Act to help people making less than $100,000 a year. “What I want to do about rent is the same thing,” she added. “What we need to do around education and understanding disparities. What we need to do around [historically black colleges and universities]. But we have a history of racism in America.”

-- The Democrat who has been most specific is Williamson, a spiritual guru who is waging a spirited long-shot campaign for the nomination that’s been capturing more attention recently. “Williamson traces many of our nation’s psychic wounds to slavery, for which she believes we need to make reparations in the form of a $100 billion, 10-year investment disseminated by a panel of black leaders across fields,” Anna Peele writes in a profile that will run in our magazine this Sunday.

“When I wonder, sitting at a table in a Los Angeles neighborhood where the average home sells for $1.66 million, how she will enact her plan for reparations without seeming like a well-meaning white lady, Williamson crosses her arms and starts clomping the heel of her left foot like a dressage horse,” Peele reports. “‘I am a well-meaning white lady,’ she says, utterly exasperated. ‘Why should I apologize for being a well-meaning white lady? What is going on in this world today? I shouldn’t apologize for being white any more than you should apologize for being black.’ (I am not black, just another well-meaning white lady.) ‘I’ve been leading ritualized apologies — prayers of apology — from whites to blacks for over 20 years. I wrote a book [‘Healing the Soul of America’] on this topic. This is not something that I just came new to. I was talking about this long before it was trending.’”

-- “Other Democratic 2020 candidates … either did not respond to requests for comment or stopped short of an endorsement of reparations. Instead, several laid out policies that, though not intended as a redress for slavery, would benefit black Americans,” Astead Herndon writes in today’s Times. “Senator Cory Booker’s ‘baby bonds’ policy aims to help poorer children by giving them a government-funded savings account that could total up to $50,000 for the lowest income brackets. … And Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has endorsed a proposal to allow Americans without checking accounts to bank at the local post office; a disproportionate percentage of America’s unbanked population are people of color.

“The Warren campaign declined to give further details on [her statement endorsing reparations], but it came amid her calls for the federal government to provide special home-buying assistance to residents of communities that were adversely affected by ‘redlining,’ the discriminatory practice of denying mortgages, usually in poor and nonwhite areas. She also announced a sweeping universal child-care proposal that could strongly benefit minority communities that often have limited early childhood services.”

As people noted how relatively vague the quotes were from Harris and Warren, Herndon tweeted that he “made it clear to campaigns that ‘policies that help black people’ did not count as reparations, but would have to be intentionally race-specific and meant to address past harms – not lift all boats.” He added that the Harris campaign did nothing to walk back her comments on “The Breakfast Club.”

“We have to be honest that people in this country do not start from the same place or have access to the same opportunities,” Harris said in a statement. “I’m serious about taking an approach that would change policies and structures and make real investments in black communities.”

-- Overwhelming majorities of Americans have consistently been opposed to the concept of reparations. Polling analyst Emily Guskin notes that the most recent survey she could find, a Point Taken-Marist poll from 2016, found that 68 percent said the U.S. government should not pay the descendants of slaves and that 72 percent said the U.S. should not pay African Americans in general. Racial differences were significant: 81 percent of whites opposed giving any monetary compensation to descendants of slaves, compared with 35 percent of African Americans and 47 percent of Latinos. A Kaiser-CNN poll from 2015 found 77 percent said the U.S. should not pay descendants of slaves, also with large differences by race.

Even when the questions were worded slightly differently, the findings have been relatively similar and stayed somewhat consistent over the past few decades. A 2002 survey by Gallup, CNN and USA Today found 81 percent said the government should not make cash payments to black Americans who are descendants of slaves. A 1997 ABC poll found 77 percent believed the federal government should not pay black Americans whose ancestors were slaves.

-- Bottom line: Get ready to hear the r-word a lot on the campaign trail over the next 20 months, mainly from Republicans who will use it to try painting Democrats as far-left and out-of-touch extremists.

Offering a taste of what’s sure to come, Tucker Carlson devoted an entire segment of his show on Fox News last night to ripping Democrats over reparations. The host even quipped that Warren might be endorsing the idea because she is “under the influence of peyote,” a drug associated with Native Americans.

His guest, conservative commentator Mark Steyn, went further. He said it’s “disturbing” that the idea is becoming a “mainstream” position. “Slavery was abolished a century and a half ago,” Steyn said on Fox. “Nobody alive today has a grandparent who was a slave. And, in that sense, I think you reach a point where you need to move on. The reparations thing eventually, as the decades goes by, becomes ridiculous.”

-- Based on the polls and the mood of the country, it seems like a safe bet that any Democrat who endorses the concept of reparations right now – however generically – will face immense political pressure to walk back their comments – at least somewhat – in the context of a general election.

-- During an interview in his final year as president, Obama expounded at length on why endorsing reparations is bad politics. “It is easy to make that theoretical argument,” Obama told Ta-Nehisi Coates, an outspoken advocate for reparations, during an interview that appeared in the Atlantic. “But as a practical matter, it is hard to think of any society in human history in which a majority population has said that as a consequence of historic wrongs, we are now going to take a big chunk of the nation’s resources over a long period of time to make that right.

“You can look at examples like postwar Germany, where reparations were paid to Holocaust victims and families, but they lost the war,” Obama added. “Small population, finite amount of money that it was going to cost. Not multiple generations but people, in some cases, who are still alive, who can point to, ‘That was my house. Those were my paintings. Those were my mother’s family jewels.’ If you look at countries like South Africa, where you had a black majority, there have been efforts to tax and help that black majority, but it hasn’t come in the form of a formal reparations program. You have countries like India that have tried to help untouchables, with essentially affirmative-action programs, but it hasn’t fundamentally changed the structure of their societies. So the bottom line is that it’s hard to find a model in which you can practically administer and sustain political support for those kinds of efforts.

“And what makes America complicated as well is the degree to which this is not just a black/white society, and it is becoming less so every year,” the then-president continued. “So how do Latinos feel if there’s a big investment just in the African American community, and they’re looking around and saying, ‘We’re poor as well. What kind of help are we getting?’ Or Asian Americans who say, ‘Look, I’m a first-generation immigrant, and clearly I didn’t have anything to do with what was taking place.’ And now you start getting into trying to calibrate. …

“I’m not so optimistic as to think that you would ever be able to garner a majority of an American Congress that would make those kinds of investments above and beyond the kinds of investments that could be made in a progressive program for lifting up all people,” he concluded. “So to restate it: I have much more confidence in my ability, or any president or any leader’s ability, to mobilize the American people around a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment to help every child in poverty in this country than I am in being able to mobilize the country around providing a benefit specific to African Americans as a consequence of slavery and Jim Crow. Now, we can debate the justness of that. But I feel pretty confident in that assessment politically.”

-- The White House announced that the United States will leave behind 200 “peacekeeping” troops in Syria for an unspecified amount of time beyond the planned withdrawal of American forces this spring. Karen DeYoung and Missy Ryan report: “A U.S. official ... said that the 200 would be 'split down the middle' between Syrian Kurdish-controlled areas in the northeast of the country, and the Tanf garrison in southeast Syria. The official said the total might rise slightly. The decision was a partial reversal of President Trump’s order, announced in December, that all 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria would leave, since their mission to destroy the Islamic State caliphate, in his view, had been achieved. Complete withdrawal was expected by the end of April. ... Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) praised the move Thursday and said that the residual U.S. force would 'ensure that ISIS does not return and that Iran does not fill the vacuum that would have been left if we completely withdrew.' It also ensures, he said, that Turkey and the Syrian Kurds 'will not go into conflict.'""

Mark Harris testifies Thursday during a hearing on voting irregularities in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District. (Travis Long/Raleigh News & Observer/AP)

-- North Carolina elections officials ordered a new contest in the 9th Congressional District after a months-long investigation into alleged ballot tampering. Amy Gardner reports: “The board voted unanimously to throw out the November results between Republican Mark Harris and Democrat Dan McCready after Harris, an evangelical minister from Charlotte, admitted under oath that he was mistaken in his testimony earlier in the day. Harris blamed the error on a recent sepsis infection that he said caused two strokes and affected his memory. … Harris was under scrutiny for hiring a political operative, Leslie McCrae Dowless, who allegedly assembled a crew of election workers to illegally collect, fill out and forge mail-in ballots in two rural counties in the 9th District. …

“Thursday’s abrupt bipartisan conclusion to what had been a deeply rancorous process offered hope to some who believe the kind of fraud alleged in the 9th District often goes undetected and unprosecuted — leaving rural and often impoverished communities without fair elections or representation. … Later, the board will set a date for a new election, probably including primaries. McCready has begun preparing for a new election and is expected to run again. It appeared less likely that Harris, who had led in unofficial returns by 905 votes, would do so.”

-- Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said he has nothing to apologize for and plans to run for reelection despite the controversy over his history of racist remarks that has gotten him stripped of his committee assignments in Congress. The Des Moines Register’s Tony Leys reports: “King confirmed that he will run for re-election in 2020, despite drawing three challengers for the Republican nomination. He offered a message to voters in his northwest Iowa district: ‘Don’t let the elitists in this country, the power brokers in this country, tell you who’s going to represent you in the United States Congress.’

“King blamed his troubles on media outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, which he accused of twisting his words and ‘weaponizing’ the language. ‘If you would just hold these publications to what is true, there is no story whatsoever,’ he said. ‘… There’s no part of me that believes in anything that’s advocated by folks that identify themselves as white nationalists or white supremacy.’”

The congressman also said he doesn’t think being on a committee matters much since the House is controlled by the Democrats: “‘If there’s ever going to be a time not to have committee assignments, this time with Nancy Pelosi as the speaker of the House is the time,’ he said.”

Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta waits for President Trump to speak at the White House. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)

-- A federal judge in Florida ruled that a 2007 plea deal between Jeffrey Epstein, a politically connected billionaire accused of molesting dozens of young girls, and federal prosecutors in Miami, including Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, violated the law. Mark Berman reports: “The ruling was a stinging rebuke for prosecutors and how they behaved in a grim, high-profile case that has drawn increased scrutiny in recent months. A Miami Herald investigation last year highlighted the allegations and Acosta’s role in cutting a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein, while a Justice Department office said it is exploring whether the federal prosecutors who reached the deal committed ‘professional misconduct.’ ...

“District Judge Kenneth A. Marra was blunt, ruling that prosecutors had acted improperly in reaching the agreement with Epstein — which stopped federal action in exchange for him pleading guilty to a state charge — without telling the victims. Marra, based in West Palm Beach, Fla., wrote in a 33-page ruling that the actions violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), which entitles victims to know about significant events in their cases. Marra wrote that he was ‘not ruling that the decision not to prosecute was improper,’ noting he was ‘simply ruling that, under the facts of this case, there was a violation of the victims rights under the CVRA'”

Acosta’s spokesman at the Labor Department pointed to the Justice Department’s long-standing defense of how prosecutors handled the case. “For more than a decade, the actions of the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida in this case have been defended by the Department of Justice in litigation across three administrations and several attorneys general,” the spokesman said. “The office’s decisions were approved by departmental leadership and followed departmental procedures.” The U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of Florida, which Acosta led between 2005 and 2009, declined to comment.

-- Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who is flirting with a challenge to Trump in 2020, accused the Republican National Committee of taking “unprecedented” steps to shield the president from primary challengers. Ovetta Wiggins reports: “Hogan, who is being courted by Republican dissidents seeking an alternative to Trump, told Politico in an interview that he was disgusted by RNC efforts to close ranks around Trump and troubled by reports that Republicans in South Carolina were considering scrapping their primary altogether. ‘I’ve never seen anything like it, and I’ve been involved in the Republican Party for most of my life,’ Hogan told Politico reporter Alex Isenstadt. ‘In my opinion, it’s not the way we should be going about our politics.’”

Why you should take this seriously: Hogan will take over as chairman of the National Governors Association during its meeting in D.C. this weekend. That gives him a bigger platform when he travels to Iowa early next month, where he’ll probably hold meetings with activists and political types. The governor’s spokeswoman also confirms Hogan plans to make a springtime visit to New Hampshire.

A DIVIDED AMERICA:

-- Coast Guard Lt. Christopher Hasson, who was allegedly plotting a domestic terrorism attack, was caught after he conducted suspicious searches using government computers to study the manifestos and methods of mass shooters. He was arrested at work last Friday after being detected by an internal Coast Guard program that watches for any “insider threat.” Lynh Bui, Dan Lamothe and Michael Miller report: “The program identified suspicious computer activity tied to Hasson, prompting the agency’s investigative service to launch an investigation last fall, said Lt. Cmdr. Scott McBride, a service spokesman. ... He researched how to carry out sniper attacks, [prosecutors] contend, and whether rifle scopes were illegal. … As he built an arsenal, prosecutors contend, Hasson read manifestos by the Unabomber, the Virginia Tech shooter and the Olympic Park bomber among other domestic mass shooters, and also looked for guidance to the plot of right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik, who in 2011 unleashed two attacks in Norway that killed 77 people. … And all the while, investigators assert, he was amassing a cache of weapons.” He also had a secret-level clearance.

“Hasson’s federal public defender, Julie Stelzig, said … there was ‘no actual indication of any plan.’ She said that Hasson had no prior record and that the number of weapons he had were ‘modest at best’ for average gun collectors. ‘It’s not a crime to think negative thoughts,’ Stelzig said ... ‘It’s not a crime to think about doomsday scenarios.’”

-- Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R) acknowledged that he wore a Confederate uniform as a student at Auburn after a picture emerged from his 1980 college yearbook. Lee confirmed to the Tennessean newspaper that he wore the uniform at an “Old South” party. ""‘Although I have never acted to intentionally hurt anyone, I have the benefit of 40 years of hindsight to see that participating was insensitive and I’ve come to regret it,’ Lee said. A Lee spokesman added that the governor has never worn blackface,” Felicia Sonmez reports.

-- “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett faces up to three years in prison for allegedly staging a fake attack on himself and filing a false police report. Bethonie Butler, Sonia Rao and Alex Horton report: “Smollett’s bond was set at $100,000 at a court hearing Thursday afternoon, during which Cook County Circuit Court Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. also directed Smollett to surrender his passport. … Prosecutors have identified the [two men Smollett allegedly paid to attack him] as brothers Abimbola ‘Abel’ Osundairo and Olabinjo ‘Ola’ Osundairo. They say Smollett and Abel Osundairo were close friends who worked together on ‘Empire,’ where Abel was a stand-in for a love interest of Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon. Prosecutors also say Abel had been ‘a source of designer drugs’ including molly, a form of MDMA, for Smollett since spring 2018. They say Smollett met Ola Osundairo, who appeared as an extra on ‘Empire,’ ‘on several occasions through Abel.’

“At a media briefing Thursday morning, Chicago police said Smollett concocted the story of a brutal hate crime because he was ‘dissatisfied with his salary’ on the Fox drama. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the department has a $3,500 check Smollett paid the men to help him stage the fake attack after a crude, threatening letter he sent to the ‘Empire’ set in Chicago failed to get attention. Johnson was remarkably forceful in his remarks about the case, which has gained widespread media attention since Smollett told police he was attacked in the city last month. Johnson, a black Chicago native, said the actor ‘took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.’ ...

“Prosecutors allege that Smollett, 36, was the guiding force behind the staged attack — right down to the intersection where it took place. They say Smollett told the Osundairo brothers, who are of Nigerian descent, to call his attention by yelling racial and homophobic slurs, and say, ‘This is MAGA country.’ They also say Smollett provided a $100 bill for supplies including rope, ski masks, gloves and red baseball hats resembling the ‘Make America Great Again’ hats associated with [Trump’s] campaign. According to prosecutors, Smollett coordinated the plan around a trip the brothers had planned to Nigeria.”

-- Trump said Smollett “insulted” his supporters with the fake attack. “@JussieSmollett - what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA,” the president wrote in a tweet.

-- Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.) said Smollett’s allegedly fake attack made it harder for real hate-crime victims to be believed. Felicia Sonmez reports: “Late last month, when Smollett first told Chicago police that he was attacked, Rush sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray asking for a hate crimes investigation into the incident. On Thursday, the Illinois Democrat said that it is now clear that the attack ‘was a total and complete lie.’ ‘I am beyond disappointed and extremely infuriated at Smollett’s brazen, devious, and disgraceful behavior,’ Rush said in a statement. … ‘I hope that Smollett is aware that his stunt has made it harder for real victims to be believed and has caused them to relive their victimization, both from being attacked and from having their stories called into question,’ he said.”

-- Smollett’s case put some 2020 candidates in a tight spot after they quickly decried what they at first thought was a homophobic, hate-filled attack. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: “After Smollett reported the alleged attack to police in January, weighing it with political import by claiming his assailants chanted President Trump’s campaign slogan, Democratic Sens. Kamala D. Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand quickly decried what they deemed a clear hate crime. Smollett’s case, Harris and Booker said in separate tweets, was an attempted ‘modern day lynching,’ while Gillibrand called it ‘a sickening and outrageous attack. But as questions began to emerge about Smollett’s account, the three Democratic contenders faced uncomfortable questions about whether they were too quick to make a judgment and utter words of condemnation.""

-- Despite his arrest, Smollett was back at work on “Empire” last night. The New York Times's John Koblin reports: “There are still two episodes left to be shot over the next month for the show’s fifth season ... When Mr. Smollett returned to work on Thursday he was prepared to film scenes from the season’s second-to-last episode ... It is still an open question whether Fox will use the footage when the episodes ultimately air. 'Empire' has not yet been renewed for a sixth season, so its ultimate fate still hangs in the balance. ... Complicating matters is the fact that 20th Century Fox Television — the studio that produces 'Empire' — is weeks away from being folded into the Walt Disney Company after Disney’s deal to purchase many of Fox’s entertainment assets finally closes. How Disney feels about Mr. Smollett will become a more urgent question in the weeks ahead.""

Roger Stone leaves a courthouse in D.C. on Thursday after a federal judge imposed a full gag order. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)

THERE’S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- Gagged: A federal judge ordered longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone to no longer speak publicly about the case against him. Rachel Weiner and Manuel Roig-Franzia report: “Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington said it would be ‘foolhardy’ to wait for Stone to transgress again in the wake of an Instagram post that appeared to show her photo near crosshairs. … ‘I’m not giving you another chance,’ Jackson told Stone. ‘I have serious doubts whether you’ve learned any lesson at all.’ If he violates the order in any way, Jackson warned, she will order him to jail. The judge, who sounded flabbergasted by Stone’s explanations, rejected his claim that the image was not meant to be threatening. ‘Roger Stone knows full well the power of words and the power of symbols. There is nothing ambiguous about crosshairs,’ she said. …

“Stone took the stand during the hearing to apologize for the post … ‘Thank you, but the apology rings quite hollow,’ she said. … Both Jackson and prosecutor Jonathan Kravis grilled Stone on how he found the image and why he posted it. Stone gave inconsistent answers, saying first that it was posted by a volunteer and then that a volunteer sent him the image but he posted it himself. He said he can’t remember who gave him the picture or the names of everyone who has access to his phone. ‘How hard is it to find an image without crosshairs?’ an incredulous Jackson asked Stone. … Jackson also repeatedly asked Stone why, if he immediately regretted the posting, he went on to defend it in media interviews. … Stone said the apology was drafted by his attorneys and signed by him during a doctor’s appointment and that he had not read it carefully.”

-- An IRS analyst was charged with leaking government documents on financial transactions made by Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen. Devlin Barrett reports: “John Fry, an investigative analyst with the IRS in San Francisco, was charged with the unauthorized disclosure of suspicious-activity reports, or SARs. Such reports are meant to flag potentially unlawful financial conduct to government investigators but do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing. According to the court documents, unsealed in federal court in San Francisco, Fry is accused of sharing the reports’ contents with Michael Avenatti … Court records show [Fry] appeared briefly in court Thursday and was released on a $50,000 bond. … Avenatti, who made the information public by posting it on social media, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. He said on Twitter that he did nothing wrong.”

-- Special counsel Bob Mueller’s report on his probe, which is expected to be delivered in the coming weeks, could serve as a “road map” for investigations by House Democrats, Obama’s former acting solicitor general Neal Katyal writes in the New York Times: “The report is unlikely to be a dictionary-thick tome, which will disappoint some observers. But such brevity is not necessarily good news for the president. In fact, quite the opposite. … The president’s bashing of Mr. Mueller may induce him to issue a more limited, by-the-book report, which will spawn further investigation. And the bashing may have encouraged Mr. Mueller to turn matters over to other investigators who have not been subject to the same sorts of public attack.”

-- A year after Trump was sworn in, his inaugural committee drafted a document to address building questions about how it raised and spent a record amount of money. Bloomberg News’s Caleb Melby reports: “One question was particularly tricky. ‘What did Rick Gates have to do with [the Presidential Inaugural Committee]?’ staffers wrote in a late January draft. ‘[Need answer.]’ The draft document … shows how the group prepared to defend its work as questions intensified about its reported $107 million haul. According to nine inaugural staffers and others familiar with the committee’s efforts, the process of planning for Trump’s big week was chaotic and opaque, dominated by staff culled from Colony Capital, the real estate firm founded by [Chairman Tom] Barrack, and by ex-Trump campaign chairman [Paul] Manafort’s circle of associates.”

-- Members of the inaugural committee expressed concern about several vendors’ budgets in the weeks before Trump’s swearing-in. The Wall Street Journal’s Rebecca Davis O’Brien and Rebecca Ballhaus report: “Less than a month before the inauguration, in an email to colleagues, Heather Martin, the committee’s budget director, questioned the budget submitted by a top vendor, event-production company Hargrove Inc. The company, she wrote, was using ‘wildly different pricing’ from its work on previous inaugurals. She noted ‘redundancy’ and ‘excessively high’ prices for labor, centerpieces and even bike racks. It was one of several vendor budgets—including one submitted by WIS Media Partners, a firm run by Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former adviser to first lady Melania Trump—that was questioned by inaugural organizers, according to the records reviewed by the Journal.” Federal prosecutors are probing the committee’s communications with vendors.

-- Republicans on the House Oversight Committee accused Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) of making “extremely unfair and unsupported accusations” in a letter to the White House Counsel’s Office. Tom Hamburger reports: “In that letter, Cummings said that lawyers for [Trump] ‘may have provided false information’ to federal ethics officials about the president’s reimbursements to [Cohen] for payments Cohen had made to an adult film actress. The Republicans complained Thursday that Cummings had misinterpreted documents he obtained from the Office of Government Ethics and, as a result, unfairly accused the lawyers of misrepresenting facts about the Cohen payments.”

-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) penned a Post op-ed calling on his Republican colleagues to criticize Trump for contributing to “the decline in public confidence in our institutions.” He writes: “Many of you have acknowledged your deep misgivings about the president in quiet conversations over the past two years. You have bemoaned his lack of decency, character and integrity. You have deplored his fundamental inability to tell the truth. But for reasons that are all too easy to comprehend, you have chosen to keep your misgivings and your rising alarm private. That must end. The time for silent disagreement is over. You must speak out.”

-- California’s public pension fund was one of the biggest investors in the National Enquirer’s parent company during the 2016 election. The LA Times’s Matt Pearce reports: “Through an investment managed by a New Jersey hedge fund, California’s public pension fund appears to have owned as much as one-third of [American Media Inc.] in 2016. It is not clear whether CalPERS continues to hold a major stake in the tabloid publisher.”

-- The Trump White House has directed interns to sign nondisclosure agreements while warning that leaking to the media could result in severe legal and financial consequences. The Daily Beast’s Asawin Suebsaeng reports: “Interns were also told that they would not receive their own copies, [people familiar with the process] said. This was all a standard facet of the Trump intern orientation process, billed as an ‘ethics training’—underscored by implicit legal threats from [Trump’s] in-house lawyers. … To veterans of other administrations, the act of compelling interns to sign these types of NDAs would seem odd, if not downright unenforceable or legally dubious.”

-- A lobbying firm run by former Trump advisers is representing a Russian-backed U.S. energy company that has connections to a Chinese aluminum production company. From NBC News’s Brian Schwartz: “Turnberry Solutions, a lobbying group run by former Trump campaign advisor Jason Osborne, has signed American Ethane as a client, according to a new lobbying disclosure form. The filing was posted on the Senate lobbying disclosure website on Tuesday. The document shows that Osborne and Ryan O'Dwyer, who previously was a special assistant to the secretary of Agriculture and a senior public liaison to Trump's inaugural committee, will be the lobbyists representing American Ethane on trade and energy issues. American Ethane touts a contract it signed with the Nanshan Group, an aluminum production company based in China. The development also comes as the Trump administration is engaged in high-stakes trade talks with the Chinese government.”

THE IMMIGRATION WARS:

-- The dwindling number of migrants trying to cross the southern border has had a severe impact on American farmers, who rely on undocumented immigrants for cheap labor. Kevin Sieff and Annie Gowen report: “To fill those positions, employers have turned to temporary visa programs that recruit workers in Mexico and Central America. Since 2016, the number of U.S. agricultural visas has grown from 165,000 to 242,000, a record high, according to the Labor Department. Amid an intractable debate over immigration and border security, America’s labor force is quietly being transformed, as many employers see no choice but to shift from illegal to legal labor. … Despite his claim that immigrants take jobs away from Americans, [Trump] has touted the guest worker program, acknowledging the difficulty in finding American manual laborers and pledging to make it easier for farmers to hire workers legally.”

-- The Trump administration is advancing plans to withhold work permits from the spouses of high-skilled visa holders. The San Francisco Chronicle’s Tal Kopan reports: “At issue are work permits for nearly 100,000 immigrants who are here with spouses working on a high-tech visa and seeking a green card. … In 2015, the Obama administration created the H-4 employment authorization document, or H-4 EAD as it’s commonly known, to allow those spouses to work until the family can get green cards. … Since going into effect, there have been more than 90,000 immigrants approved for work permits under the program. [Trump] pledged early on to rescind the H-4 permit program, but the administration has been delayed in doing so.”

-- Fact check: Trump tweeted a video of construction at the border as evidence of his wall being built. But the video shows the replacement of existing fencing at the border. The New York Times’s Michael Tackett reports: “The money for the steel-slatted barrier came from a congressional appropriation in 2017, not from newly authorized spending in the recent deal that averted a government shutdown, or from money the president is seeking to take from other federal projects under his national emergency declaration from last week.”

-- The end of an immigration relief program means hundreds of Liberians living in the U.S. will have to choose between becoming undocumented or going back to Liberia, leaving their American children behind. Orion Donovan-Smith reports: Liberian immigrants “were given temporary permission to stay in the United States in 1999, when President Bill Clinton implemented ‘deferred enforced departure.’ DED was routinely extended by previous administrations but is set to end under Trump’s effort to terminate programs for immigrants without permanent status … Without a change of heart from the president — or new legislation from Congress — Liberians living in the United States under DED will lose their work authorization and become subject to deportation. Instead of self-deporting, many are expected to stay in the United States in hopes of getting a hearing in immigration courts, a process that could take years.”

-- The ACLU wants the Trump administration to determine how many children were separated from their parents at the border, a request White House lawyers said would be hard to comply with. Maria Sacchetti and Tony Perry report: The lawyers “said it would be extremely difficult to retrace the steps of all children who were separated but then released to parents or vetted sponsors. Justice Department lawyer Scott Stewart said that reuniting the 2,700-plus children, who were in federal custody when he ordered the Trump administration to find their parents, had taken eight months. Going back to a larger group, he said, would ‘blow the case into some other galaxy of a task.’”

Federal judge Dana M. Sabraw, who last summer ordered the White House to return all separated children in federal custody to their parents, did not immediately rule on the request. But he said it's critical to know where every child went: “Government officials urged Sabraw in court filings to deny the ACLU’s request, saying the children separated before his order already have been released from federal custody to a legal sponsor. Those children are ‘in a different legal position’ than those covered in the ACLU lawsuit, the government argued in court documents, adding that Sabraw should not allow the ACLU to ‘move the goal posts at this late date.’ ‘The government has worked hard and in good faith over the last eight months to comply with the Court’s orders and to facilitate the reunification process for class members,’ the Justice Department said in a court filing.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Opposition leaders in Venezuela predict violence to break out tomorrow, when volunteers are expected to try to break President Nicolás Maduro’s blockade of international relief. Anthony Faiola and Rachelle Krygier report: “Maduro on Thursday ordered the closure of the border with Brazil and weighed sealing the border with Colombia ... as his government scrambled to respond to the planned Saturday operation. … A month after opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared Maduro a usurper and claimed to be Venezuela’s rightful leader, the government’s enemies were in the midst of a risky gambit. By bus, car, boat, plane, motorbike and foot, thousands of Venezuelans, including Guaidó, were already mobilizing and heading toward the borders. Their plan: to force open Venezuela’s doors by force of numbers.”

-- Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Venezuelan troops have started disobeying Maduro’s orders. “Saturday’s a day when we’re going to find a lot about the Maduro regime,” Rubio said of the planned aid delivery this weekend. “I have reason to believe that rank-and-file military are not going to violently suppress aid workers.” (Bloomberg News)

-- Venezuela's former chief of military intelligence declared his support for Guaidó, telling Maduro, ""It's been more than enough."" The Wall Street Journal's Ryan Dube and Kejal Vyas report: “Hugo Carvajal, a retired general and current congressman for the ruling Socialist Party, called for authorities to allow into Venezuela the humanitarian aid that the U.S. is stockpiling on the Colombian border. ... Mr. Carvajal, who spent more than three decades in Venezuela’s military, also had a sobering message for active troops, many of whom have been appearing in propaganda videos meant to rile up nationalist sentiment against what the Maduro regime says is an imminent U.S. invasion.”

-- The vice president will travel to Colombia on Monday to meet with Latin American leaders about the deepening crisis in Venezuela. Anne Gearan reports: “Pence’s office said he would ‘voice the United States’ unwavering support for [Guaidó] and highlight the Venezuelan people’s fight for democracy over dictatorship.’ The address to a diplomatic consortium known as the Lima Group comes as Guaidó has promised a weekend mobilization against Maduro and in support of delivery of food and medical supplies to Venezuelans facing severe shortages and hunger.”

-- An American detained in Russia on spy charges will be held for an extra three months. Amie Ferris-Rotman reports: “A Moscow court on Friday extended by three months custody of Paul Whelan, an American citizen charged with espionage, meaning he will stay behind bars through late May. The request came from Russia’s security services, who detained the 48-year-old former Marine in late December, seizing him at his Moscow hotel room during what his family described was a personal trip to see friends. Whelan’s lawyer, Vladi­mir Zherebenkov, had previously said his client was unwittingly handed a flash drive containing a 'state secret,' but no other official details have emerged in a case that has been dogged by murkiness and delays in standard procedure.”

-- A U.S.-born woman who joined the Islamic State and who the president said is not welcome back in America must be allowed to return home, a lawsuit filed on her behalf states. Isaac Stanley-Becker reports: “The lawyer suing the U.S. government for her return says Hoda Muthana, 24, deserves more than a letter announcing her denaturalization. 'And certainly,’ said Charles Swift, a former Navy commander and the director of the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America, 'more than a tweet.'""

-- China used American expertise from a Yale researcher and a Massachusetts firm to create a system of surveillance that uses DNA to track down its own people. The New York Times's Sui-Lee Wee reports: “China wants to make the country’s Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group, more subservient to the Communist Party. It has detained up to a million people in what China calls 're-education' camps, drawing condemnation from human rights groups and a threat of sanctions from the Trump administration. Collecting genetic material is a key part of China’s campaign, according to human rights groups and Uighur activists. They say a comprehensive DNA database could be used to chase down any Uighurs who resist conforming to the campaign. ...

“China’s campaign poses a direct challenge to the scientific community and the way it makes cutting-edge knowledge publicly available. The campaign relies in part on public DNA databases and commercial technology, much of it made or managed in the United States. In turn, Chinese scientists have contributed Uighur DNA samples to a global database, potentially violating scientific norms of consent.” Human rights groups are accusing the Chinese government of reportedly collecting other DNA samples through free medical checkups, a claim the government denies.

-- In advance of another round of trade talks with China, Trump tweeted that he wanted “5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible.” Brian Fung explains whether 6G is even a thing: “If you have to ask, you are not alone: Searches for ‘6G’ spiked on Google in the moments after Trump’s tweet. The short answer is, 6G is likely what we’ll call whatever advanced data networks come after 5G. And 5G is what carriers are currently building as the next generation after 4G LTE. But so far, 6G exists largely as a theoretical concept and is a long way from being deployed in the real world.”

-- Mitch McConnell has pressed Trump to nominate Kelly Craft, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, as the next U.N. ambassador. Axios’s Jonathan Swan reports: “Like McConnell, Craft is from Kentucky, where she and her husband, billionaire coal CEO Joe Craft, rank among the state's highest-profile Republican donors. She previously served as an alternate delegate in the U.S. delegation to the UN during the George W. Bush administration, specializing on the issue of U.S. engagement in Africa.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders refused to call Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro a dictator. (Andrew Harnik/AP)

MORE ON 2020:

-- Florida Democrats criticized Bernie Sanders over his refusal to call Maduro a dictator. From Politico's Marc Caputo: “Sanders also would not say whether he considered [opposition leader Guaidó] ... the nation’s interim president, which is the position of the United States and a majority of Latin American [and] European countries. ... 'He is not going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party. He has demonstrated again that he does not understand this situation,' [said] Rep. Donna Shalala, a Miami Democrat who represents Venezuelan exiles ... Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and former Vice President Joe Biden, however, have clearly stated they consider Maduro a dictator and Guaidó the legitimate leader of Venezuela. And [Elizabeth Warren] said that she believed Maduro was a dictator.""

-- Warren demanded to know how U.S.-made weapons were reportedly transferred from American allies to al-Qaeda-linked fighters, Iranian-backed rebels and hard-line Salafi militias on the ground in Yemen. Warren, a member of the Armed Services Committee, made the request in a letter to acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, CNN's Eliza Mackintosh reports.

-- Bigger picture: The winner of the crowded Democratic primary could determine the trajectory of liberalism for years to come, Molly Ball and Philip Elliott write in a cover story for Time magazine: “The party’s very identity is up for grabs, as a vast and historically diverse crop of candidates brings big, new ideas to a demanding, divided base. … Fittingly, it’s women, minorities and younger candidates who have jumped into the race early, while many white male hopefuls remain on the sidelines, gauging the terrain. … As much as they would like to move away from white male dominance, some rank-and-file Democrats worry that doing so would hurt the party’s chances against Trump. They fear that a woman or nonwhite candidate would be damaged by Trump’s sexism and race-baiting. And to the party faithful, winning is everything.”

-- Barack Obama’s political group, Organizing for Action (OFA), is merging with the National Redistricting Action Fund, a group aimed at giving Democrats an edge in the redistricting process run by former attorney general Eric Holder. The Hill’s Reid Wilson reports: The merger will give the newly created group “control of the vaunted list of supporters, donors and volunteers that Obama and his team built over more than a decade. … While the merger represents a transfer of one of the most valuable commodities in American politics, Holder said he would be legally precluded from using it for his own political purposes. Holder is still considering a run for president, a decision he said he would make in short order, and he said the merger is not an indication that he is leaning one way or the other.”

-- New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), another potential presidential candidate, has turned against Amazon since the company reversed its decision to open a second headquarters in Queens, taking an offensive posture that could aid his potential presidential bid. The New York Times’s William Neuman and J. David Goodman report: “Taking a highly visible stand against a big corporation and its phenomenally wealthy chief executive, Jeff Bezos, could score points with the energized Democratic activists on the left who are likely to vote in primaries. It gives him a platform to discuss corporate behavior and income inequality, one of his core progressive issues. It provides an avenue for Mr. de Blasio to position himself on the campaign trail as a mayor who stood up to Amazon — even if he once stood alongside them.” Bezos owns The Post.

-- As they head into 2020, Democrats are seeking to recruit congressional candidates with fresh faces, interesting backgrounds — and short legislative records. From Paul Kane: “In the 2018 midterms, House Democrats had a smashing success with dozens of first-time candidates coming from the military, intelligence agencies and prosecutors’ offices. … Democrats, in reviewing recent elections, privately contend that authenticity is the most important trait for victory, pointing to three incumbents who won in what should have been very tough races last year: Sens. Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and Jon Tester (Mont.). When it comes to flipping seats, however, Democrats have largely done so with relative newcomers.”

-- All 2020 candidates except for Trump promised they will not use stolen data in the campaign. From the Daily Beast’s Sam Stein, Jackie Kucinich and Scott Bixby: “Nearly three years after hacked materials upended the 2016 presidential campaign, every Democratic candidate running for the White House has pledged not to knowingly use such material should they end up being published during the current election cycle. … The Daily Beast asked each presidential campaign either up-and-running or in its exploratory phase whether they would commit to not knowingly using or referencing hacked material that appears online on grounds that it may have been obtained illegally. Each Democratic candidate responded with some form of commitment to not used hacked materials.”

-- Howard Schultz didn’t vote in this month’s Seattle school levies, a no-show vote that is in line with the former Starbucks CEO’s pattern of ignoring elections despite urging Americans to become civically involved. From the Seattle Times’s Jim Brunner: “Schultz was asked about that record during an appearance in Seattle last month … He responded: ‘I travel all over the world. It’s not an excuse, but I have not been as engaged locally.’ Asked Wednesday why he didn’t vote on the latest school levies, even after facing scrutiny on the issue, Schultz, who was traveling in California, issued a brief statement through a spokeswoman. ‘It would have been great to vote in every election, and I commend all of the Seattleites who have a 100% voting record. I didn’t vote in every local election, but I am proud of Sheri’s and my civic record in this community,’ the statement said, referring to his wife.”

-- The New Jersey Senate approved a bill to keep Trump off the 2020 ballot unless he releases his tax returns. This is the second time Democrats in the state's Senate have tried to pass the controversial measure to block candidates from appearing on the ballot unless they make their returns public. The last time, then-Gov. Chris Christie (R) vetoed it. (NorthJersey.com)

GOOD READS:

-- Yahoo News, “The Soviets wanted to infiltrate the Reagan camp. So, the CIA recruited a businessman to bait them,” by Zach Dorfman: “Beginning in 1975, a big black limousine with diplomatic plates would pull up once a month to the no-parking zone outside John Greenagel’s office in the handsome Merchants Exchange Building in downtown San Francisco. A man would exit the car, paper bag in hand, and ascend the stairs to Greenagel’s public relations firm. The man would hand Greenagel, then in his mid-30s, the paper bag, which always contained stale Cuban cigars and a bottle of Stolichnaya without a tax stamp. 'Compliments of Mr. Pavlov,' the man would say, and walk out. Yuri Pavlov was a diplomat based at the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco and an undercover KGB officer ... after the Soviet bag man left, Greenagel would call his CIA handler, who would pop over to his office; and they’d laugh and drink the Stoly, smoke the old Cubans and talk about Greenagel’s deepening friendship with Pavlov, which was entirely manufactured. ... Greenagel was acting as an 'access agent' — providing the CIA with key insights about Pavlov’s psychological and personality profile.”

-- Vanity Fair, “‘She Never Looks Back’: Inside Elizabeth Holmes’s Chilling Final Months at Theranos,” by Nick Bilton: “Since Theranos’s collapse, observers have wondered how Holmes kept the company going for so long—how she was able to convince those scientists, investors, and colleagues that her quixotic idea for a portable, revolutionary blood-testing technology could somehow come to fruition. Recently, I posed a similar question to a former Theranos board member: how did the board of directors, composed of such accomplished people, not stop her.”

-- New York Times, “The Rise of the WeWorking Class,” by Gideon Lewis-Kraus: “Most of us have serious reasons to worry about the future of work, and it’s easy to object to WeWork’s thin consolations on the basis of aesthetic or moral principle. Once you get accustomed to the basic product, however, it’s hard not to find it ... pretty nice. Over the course of about a year, I stopped into locations in six or seven cities, and in each of them I sat in front of my computer alongside other people in front of their computers and felt at once marginally more productive and slightly less unmoored.”

-- “‘Something told me to check the vehicle one more time’: How a state trooper saved an infant trapped underwater,” by Allison Klein: “It was the middle of the shift for Oklahoma Highway Patrol Trooper Cody Enloe when he got a call for a car accident on Highway 259, deep in the rural part of the state. A pickup truck had flipped over, and the driver and her children were trapped inside. … Emergency responders and bystanders breathed a sigh of relief once the two children were out, Enloe said, and some started to walk away from the scene. ‘I kind of reverted back to my training, and something told me to check the vehicle one more time,’ Enloe said. ‘I crawled back into the truck.’ Using his flashlight, he saw another car seat, a third one — but this one was partially submerged, and he realized the baby’s face was underwater. There was no sound.”

HOT ON THE LEFT: “Facebook decided which users are interested in Nazis — and let advertisers target them directly,” from the LA Times: “Facebook makes money by charging advertisers to reach just the right audience for their message — even when that audience is made up of people interested in the perpetrators of the Holocaust or explicitly neo-Nazi music. Despite promises of greater oversight following past advertising scandals, a Times review shows that Facebook has continued to allow advertisers to target hundreds of thousands of users the social media firm believes are curious about topics such as ‘Joseph Goebbels,’ ‘Josef Mengele,’ ‘Heinrich Himmler,’ the neo-nazi punk band Skrewdriver and Benito Mussolini’s long-defunct National Fascist Party. Experts say that this practice runs counter to the company’s stated principles and can help fuel radicalization online. … Facebook said that it would remove many of the audience groupings from its ad platform.” HOT ON THE RIGHT: “After a high school is forced to end its ‘Big Booty’ and ‘Big Boobie’ awards, ACLU demands reform,” from Deanna Paul : “When Tremper High School holds its annual cheerleading banquet next month, awards such as ‘most improved’ and ‘hardest worker’ seem likely to reappear. Other accolades from years past face a less-certain future. The 2018 ‘Big Boobie’ award, for example, was given to the cheerleader who accomplished ‘a feat’ by maneuvering ‘through cheer routines with her enormous boobs,’ according to a video provided to the American Civil Liberties Union, which became involved in the matter after concerned parents and a former employee of the Kenosha, Wis., high school contacted it. … The ACLU accused the district of enabling sexual harassment in its school system in violation of federal nondiscrimination and equal protection laws, and threatened to sue if officials fail to take immediate action.”

New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh arrives for a caucus meeting in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, February 27, 2019. REUTERS/Chris Wattie

Preliminary results showed Jagmeet Singh won a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia.

Singh captured just under 40 percent of the vote.

A practicing Sikh, Singh made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau’s chances become.

“This staves off all the talk that Singh would have to quit ... at least for the moment he is vindicated,” said Richard Johnston, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia.

Johnston said in a phone interview that Singh would still need to overcome unhappiness with his leadership.

Singh, 40, a former legislator in the province of Ontario, had no experience in federal politics when he took over from former leader Thomas Mulcair.

He has clashed openly with senior members of parliament on a number of issues. A quarter of the 44 NDP legislators who won seats in the 2015 election have either already quit or announced they are not running again in October.

And in a further sign of challenges ahead, in another special election on Monday, the NDP lost the Montreal seat Mulcair had held to the Liberals.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News last week put the Liberals at 34 percent public support and the right-leaning official opposition Conservatives at 35 percent. The NDP was far behind at 17 percent.

The Liberals are stumbling amid allegations that officials in Trudeau’s office leaned on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help a major construction company avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges.

And so one day after markets perplexingly closed in the red, US markets are set for a higher open, following similar moves across the world.

Following a mixed session in Asia, European stocks, bonds and FX markets traded near session highs in anticipation of more optimistic headlines from top-level trade talks between America and China, while ignoring the latest disappointing German data, where all February IFO survey components (business confidence, current assessment, expectations) fell from prior month, and missing forecasts while Germany's final Q4 GDP of 0.0% was unrevised from the preliminary print.

Mining and technology shares led the advance in the Europe Stoxx 600 Index as Bloomberg’s industrial-metals subindex headed for its highest level since October, as positive earnings from companies drove big stock swings as European markets opened, with traders now awaiting European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s a speech later Friday.

In the final Euro-area CPI data, both core (1.1%) and headline (1.4%) were unrevised from preliminary readings. More notably, ECB's Nowotny said the central bank has no conclusions yet on TLTROs, and expects a decision on targeted loans to come later than March, adding that the Governing Council has until summer to reach a decision. Over in Sweden, central bank head Ingves says risks are now mostly on the downside, noting that if risks were to materialize Riksbank policy would need to be adjusted.

Across the Atlantic, futures on the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes all climbed, even as Buffett darling Kraft Heinz plunged to the lowest on record after announcing a $15.4 billion writedown late Thursday. The S&P is now up 8 of the past 9 weeks

Emerging-market stocks rose for a fifth day, the longest streak since May, and a gauge of smaller Chinese stocks entered a bull market. Japanese shares slipped,

Earlier in Asia, shares were buoyed by a late rally in Chinese shares, with the Shanghai Composite closing 1.9% higher. Chinese shares had faltered earlier amid concern about slowing domestic growth and indications that China would cut its benchmark interest rate only as a last resort to boost the economy. Japan’s Nikkei ended 0.2% lower after data showed core consumer inflation accelerated in January but remained far from the central bank’s 2 percent target. Elsewhere, Australian shares gained 0.5 percent and Seoul’s Kospi ended up 0.1 percent.

As Bloomberg summarizes the narrative that has prevailed every day for weeks, markets were cautiously optimistic as U.S. President Donald Trump was set to meet with China’s top trade negotiator in Washington Friday, with the two sides facing a March 1 deadline to avoid a further escalation in tariffs. Optimism for an accord between the world’s economic superpowers combined with a less-hawkish stance from some of the biggest central banks has sent an MSCI global gauge of stocks surging 15% in less than two months. Still, concerns about global growth persist.

“Central banks will take center stage in March, and we believe their appetite to continue with tighter monetary policy will be scaled back,” Nedbank Group Ltd. strategists Mehul Daya and Walter de Wet said in a note. “Once again the global economy and especially financial markets cannot endure tighter monetary policy and would have to rely on policy makers to stimulate economic growth. These are symptoms of a fragile global economy and financial system.”

Still, it's all about trade, as trade talks and a growing number of policy U-turns by global central banks have propped up equities in recent weeks. Trade talks between U.S. and Chinese negotiators continued in Washington, with little more than a week left before a U.S.-imposed deadline expires, triggering higher tariffs. Reuters reported on Wednesday the two sides were drafting language for six memoranda of understanding on proposed Chinese reforms, progress that had helped to lift investor sentiment.

Meanwhile, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday, the White House said. “Given that enough headway seems to have been made to warrant a meeting between Trump and the Chinese negotiator today, it appears more likely that the U.S. will not raise the levies, which should help high-beta currencies and equities push higher,” said Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS.

In FX, the Australian dollar recovered after falling more than 1% on Thursday, when Reuters reported the Chinese port of Dalian had banned imports of Australian coal indefinitely. China’s foreign ministry said on Friday coal imports continued but customs had stepped up inspections environment and safety checks on foreign cargoes. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe cautioned against seeing restrictions as being directed at Australia, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the ban does not indicate a souring relationship between the countries. Separate comments by Lowe that a rate increase may be appropriate next year also helped to boost the Aussie dollar. It was last up 0.35 percent at $0.71120.

Elsewhere, the dollar gained for a third day as traders awaited the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks and a series of speeches from Fed policy makers; the euro was 0.1 percent higher at $1.1346, nearing a two-week high. German business morale fell for a sixth time in a row, to its lowest in over four years, a survey showed. European Central Bank policymakers asked for swift preparations to give banks more long-term loans, minutes of its last meeting showed on Thursday.

New Zealand’s dollar weakened against all its major peers after the central bank said proposals to increase lenders’ capital requirements could eventually lead to an interest-rate cut. Sweden’s krona advanced versus all Group-of-10 peers after minutes of the Riksbank’s February meeting showed that “some board members discussed the recent depreciation of the krona and Deputy Governor Martin Floden even suggested that a weaker currency could play a part in him advocating for another rate increase already in two months

In rates, Italian government bond yields crept up on Friday, reflecting caution among investors before a Fitch ratings review. US Treasurys were generally unchanged, with the 10Y TSY trading at 2.68%.

The dollar and gold were flat, while West Texas oil traded rose above $57 a barrel in New York. Brent (+0.5%) and WTI (+0.5%) prices were firmer after a lacklustre overnight session, ahead of US President Trump meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. Goldman Sachs revised their 2019 US oil supply growth expectations to 1.4mln BPD from 1.2mln BPD. Looking ahead, we have the Baker Hughes rig count which last week saw oil rigs increase by 3 to 857, as such the total rig count figure was 1051 from the prior 1049. Gold (U/C) has been largely unchanged taking the lead from an uneventful dollar ahead of multiple key Fed speakers today, including Federal Reserve Vice Chair Clarida.

No major economic data are expected today, while several Fed representatives are due to speak. Cabot Oil, Magna International and Royal Bank of Canada are among companies reporting earnings

Asian stocks were mixed following the weak lead from their peers in the US where all US major indices declined and the Nasdaq snapped its 8-day win streak, with sentiment weighed by uninspiring data. ASX 200 (+0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) were mixed with the Australian benchmark resilient as participants took a breather from the recent deluge of earnings and as financials remained afloat, but with upside capped by weakness in Energy following similar underperformance by the sector stateside and with Woodside Petroleum shares down by over 4% as it traded ex-dividend. Conversely, Japanese stocks were lacklustre after the recent flows into the JPY, while Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.9%) initially conformed to the indecisive tone but with losses in the mainland eventually reversed after a tepid liquidity injection by the PBoC and as focus remained on US-China trade talks with President Trump set to meet China Vice Premier Liu He later today. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially underpinned by the weak risk sentiment and BoJ’s presence in the market for a total JPY 685bln of JGBs, but then pared a majority of the gains after hitting resistance at 153.00 and as the regional stock markets bounced off intraday lows.

Swedbank CEO Still Has Board’s Support Amid Laundering Shock

In FX, AUD,NZD,SEK More volatile trade down under, as the Aussie receives a welcome reprieve from China that has now categorically refuted reports that it blocked coal imports having initially claimed no knowledge rather than issuing a firm denial. However, Aud/Usd still seems top heavy amidst recent more dovish RBA calls, even though the Kiwi has been rattled by similar RBNZ impulses, and from the horse’s mouth as it were given comments from Bascand overnight about proposed rises in bank capital requirements heightening easing prospects, in time. Aud/Nzd has rebounded further from sub-1.0400 lows in response, as Nzd/Usd reversed through 0.6800 to circa 0.6760 at one stage. Conversely, Eur/Sek is around 10.6000 in wake of Riksbank minutes and accompanying statements from Governor Ingves in the main, playing down weaker than forecast Swedish inflation in January and keeping guidance for H2 tightening in place, albeit conditional on economic developments and unless downside risks (largely due to external factors) do not materialise.

EUR,GBP The single currency and Sterling remain relatively rangebound on the 1.1300 and 1.3000 handles vs the Dollar respectively, but both currencies are getting indirect support from the Greenback’s failure to muster/sustain any positive momentum of its own. Eur/Usd continues to hit resistance above 1.1350 and a downbeat German Ifo survey has not helped, while Brexit is a constant weight for the Pound along with related fall-out on the domestic political front. From a tech perspective, 1.3000 is obvious support, especially as the 200 DMA is just 2 pips below, while for Eur/Usd a decent 1.6 bn expiry at the 1.1300 strike may underpin vs a 1.1362 Fib and the 30 DMA in close proximity at 1.1369.

CAD, JPY Not much action in the Loonie or the Japanese currency, though the former is marginally benefiting from gains in the oil complex, mostly driven by market sentiment. Similarly, risk appetite has marginally weakened the JPY, with USD/JPY currently residing just below the top of the 110.65-90 intraday range. Back to the CAD, retail sales may spur some action in the Loonie with the headline expected at -0.3%, up from the prior -0.9%.

In commodities, Brent (+0.5%) and WTI (+0.5%) prices are firmer after a lacklustre overnight session, ahead of US President Trump meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at 19:30GMT. Of note Goldman Sachs have revised their 2019 US oil supply growth expectations to 1.4mln BPD from 1.2mln BPD. Looking ahead, we have the Baker Hughes rig count which last week saw oil rigs increase by 3 to 857, as such the total rig count figure was 1051 from the prior 1049. Gold (U/C) has been largely unchanged taking the lead from an uneventful dollar ahead of multiple key Fed speakers today, including Federal Reserve Vice Chair Clarida at 17:00 GMT. Elsewhere, recent newsflow has seen China’s foreign ministry denying reports that some ports in China have halted Australian coal imports; stating that Chinese customs are quality and environmental checks surrounding coal. Barrick Gold is reportedly considering a hostile bid for Newmont Mining Corp, at around USD 19bln in stock; which has the possibility of being one of the largest mining-deals ever

DB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap

I got home from Frankfurt yesterday to find windows open and duvets abandoned. Summer has temporarily arrived. However we forgot to close the window after dark and it was freezing going to bed. As could have easily been predicted, my eyes and nose have started to react horribly to the change in weather. Hay Fever is showing its ugly head again with a vengeance. One of the rare side effects of taking too many of my prescribed anti-histamines is apparently hair growing in usual places. For me that would mean my head. So if the corporate picture of me on this email looks different on Monday you’ll know what’s happened. Before the heatwave continues here in Europe over the weekend, a reminder that you can download our new podcast series “Podzept” on sites like Spotify. More details on this page http://www.dbresearch.com/podzept . This series includes one from me on what the history of populism can teach us.

Before you plug in your headphones for the weekend, markets have lost a bit of momentum over the last 24 hours. Indeed equity markets traded lower yesterday as a slew of mostly negative economic data, some signs of more intense trade disruptions, and a slight hawkish lean from the ECB combined to weigh on sentiment. The S&P 500, DOW, and NASDAQ fell -0.34%, -0.40%, and -0.39%, respectively, and the moves had a distinctly defensive tinge to them, with S&P 500 utilities and consumer staples (+0.75% and +0.28%) rising. In Europe, the STOXX 600 retreated -0.28% and Sweden’s OMX Stockholm 30 index underperformed sharply after Swedish regulators opened a money laundering investigation of its banking system. Swedbank (-9.34%), Nordea (-4.49%), and SEB (-4.04%) led declines.

Despite the mild selloff in equities, safe havens failed to rally much either. Treasury yields rose +4.1bps and bunds were up +2.7bps. Gold fell -1.15% and the dollar was close to flat. In fact, some of the only assets to rally yesterday were peripheral European spreads, which tightened -5.4bps, -3.5bps, and -2.5bps in Italy, Spain, and Portugal.

Data didn’t help yesterday with the big story being the flash February PMIs in Europe. To be honest we’ve had easier PMIs to summarise. In a nutshell a big jump in the services data more than offset a worrying decline in the manufacturing sector. The dilemma for markets is that modern economies are far more serviced based but asset prices tend to be correlated more to the manufacturing cycle - something that rung true yesterday.

In aggregate the Euro Area composite nudged up a bit more than expected, by +0.4pts to 51.4 (vs. consensus forecast for 51.1). The services reading jumped +1.1pts to 52.3 (vs. 51.3) however the flip side was the manufacturing print sliding below 50 and to the lowest in 68 months at 49.2 (vs. 50.3 expected and 50.5 previously). The data throws open the question of which way the gap may be closed – up to the services reading or down to the manufacturing reading?

Yesterday’s divergence was most stark in Germany. The services reading jumped +2.1pts to 55.1 (vs. 52.9) and the highest in five months while the manufacturing fell -2.1pts to 47.6 (vs. 49.8 expected) and the lowest in 74 months. The gap of 7.5pts between the two is the biggest since 2009. Like the broader Euro Area reading, the surprising increase in the services component did help the composite lift to 52.7 from 52.1. As our economists put it however, the overall data in Germany did little to provide any evidence of a normalization let alone a rebound. Indeed they note that on the contrary, the weak development in the industrial component points to negative GDP growth in Q1.

On the trade front, news was mixed, as Secretary of State Pompeo said in an interview that “real progress” is being made by negotiators. A subsequent report by Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail said that the two sides are making “the most significant progress yet toward ending a seven-month trade war.” That progress reportedly includes an offer from China to increase its imports of US agriculture products by $30 billion, which would be substantive but insufficient since the US is pushing for more commitments on intellectual property and other non-trade issues. Overnight, Bloomberg has reported that the US President Trump plans to meet China’s Vice Premier Liu He today afternoon (US time) while, the FT reported that the US and China negotiators are attempting to resolve disputes involving semiconductor companies – Micron and Fujian Jinhua - as part of the larger trade agreement as solid agreements on long-running commercial disputes may help the US sell a broader trade deal. The FT report further added that other measures being discussed include easing China’s restrictions on US polysilicone imports and final approval by the PBOC for Visa and MasterCard to provide domestic payment services in China.

Despite the more positive headlines on trade overnight, Asian markets are largely heading lower following Wall Street’s lead with the exception of China – the Shanghai Comp (+0.19%) is up while the Nikkei (-0.28%), Hang Seng (-0.34%) and Kospi (-0.26%) are all down. Elsewhere, futures on the S&P 500 (-0.07%) are trading flattish.

Somewhat related to trade, Reuters reported yesterday that China has blocked all coal imports from Australia at its Dalian port. While not a major destination for Australian coal (around 2% of exports), it may indicate that China is coercively flexing its trade power, and the Australian dollar weakened -1.05% (trading flat this morning). Separately, Maersk, the world’s largest shipping firm, announced a very low profit forecast for 2019 of $4bn, versus consensus estimates for $4.77bn. The CEO cited trade disruptions and macro slowdown as key factors, and the company’s shares slide -10.12% in Copenhagen.

To wrap up the PMIs, the data in France was a bit less exciting but all the same we did see the composite nudge up to 49.9 from 48.9, boosted also by an increase in the services reading of +2pts to 49.8 (vs. 48.5 expected), as the effect of the ‘Yellow Vest’ protests fades. The manufacturing reading rose +0.2pts to 51.4 (vs. 51.0 expected). So some big divergence across countries and sectors in the Europe PMIs which is only going to make it harder to build an ECB consensus. Next month’s meeting should be an interesting watch.

The PMIs weren’t the only developments in Europe yesterday with the ECB minutes and comments from Rehn and Nowotny also garnering attention. On the former, the minutes highlighted that “technical analyses” is required to prepare policy options for future liquidity operations and that this is needed to “proceed swiftly”. That reinforces the clearly converging sense of urgency amongst governing council members and is clearly no longer the big secret that it once was. The minutes also flagged that policy makers will assess the growth outlook “in more depth” in March when new forecasts are available.

As for Rehn’s comments, given his position as a contender to succeed Draghi later this year, it was notable to hear his use of the famous phrase “whatever it takes” which would clearly signal some form of policy continuity. Meanwhile Nowotny was at the margin a bit hawkish, saying specifically that “I personally can’t identify a need for additional liquidity”. DB’s Mark Wall did make the important point however that “no further liquidity” could just be consistent with a TLTRO2 solution that allows existing net exposures to be rolled over. Indeed, that policy option was explicitly referenced in a later MNI report, citing eurosystem sources, that policymakers are considering an extension of existing TLTROs for up to two years, with less generous terms than prior facilities. Overall, that would be toward the less-accommodative end of the spectrum of policy options.

Over on the other side of the Atlantic, the US chose not to be outdone on the data front. Of particular note was the plunge in the Philly Fed survey in February by 21.1pts to -4.1 (vs. +14.0 expected). That was the largest single month drop since August 2011 and notably new orders were also very soft (-2.4 vs. +21.3 previously). The good news was that the six-month ahead component was a lot more positive which perhaps lends an argument to the government shutdown impact. In better news, the latest jobless claims reading declined 23k to 216k. That followed three straight weeks of >235k prints so we were running out of time to blame the shutdown. As for the December orders data, ex transportation (+0.1% mom vs. +0.3% expected) and core capex orders (-0.7% mom vs. +0.2% expected) both missed which is significant for Q4 GDP, while the flash February PMIs also diverged (as with elsewhere around the world) with services +2pts to 56.2 and manufacturing -1.2pts to 53.7. Finally the January leading index (-0.1% mom vs. +0.1% expected) and existing home sales (-1.2% mom vs. +0.2% expected) data both missed.

Over to Brexit and the UK Parliament vote was confirmed for the 27th. In all likelihood the newsflow suggests that the vote won’t be on a new withdrawal agreement according to DB’s Oli Harvey and so therefore remains to be seen what May can offer MPs to stave off a Boles/Cooper revolt which would force the government to extend Article 50 (though the amendment is now technically called Letwin-Cooper). So a delicate few days of negotiation ahead at home and in Brussels but it seems any concession from the latter isn’t going to come ahead of next week so for May’s strategy to work she seemingly needs to take Parliament with her well into March. Challenging!! Moreover, Bloomberg has reported that the EU sees PM May asking for a three-month extension to Brexit assuming that a deal is reached in March to give the UK parliament enough time to pass necessary legislation related to its departure from the EU while adding that both sides are keen to avoid an extension of longer than three months as it would put the UK under pressure to take part in European elections on May 23-26. Elsewhere, the Telegraph reported yesterday that a group of 100 conservative lawmakers have signed a letter addressed to Julian Smith, the chief whip of the party, indicating that they’d vote against May to force her to delay Brexit and take no deal off the table in case she is not able to reach a deal and have called for a free vote next week on a backbench bid to take no deal off the table. In part this gives more legs to the Letwin/Cooper amendment. Sterling finished -0.11% weaker yesterday.

In other news, CNN reported that the US Justice Department is preparing to announce as soon as next week the completion of Mueller’s Russia investigation. On this, Bloomberg reported yesterday that Democrats were seeking to potentially subpoena Mueller if the results aren’t publically released. Expect this to be a big topic next week.

Finally to the day ahead where this morning we get the final Q4 GDP revisions in Germany. A reminder that the preliminary reading came in at +0.02% qoq and therefore implied that Germany had avoided a recession by the thinnest of margins. As we stated last week it was a margin roughly equivalent to the EuroMillions winner’s cheque from last week. So even the smallest of downward revisions could see Germany tip into a technical recession with Q1 also not looking great so far (see earlier). Also due out will be the February IFO survey in Germany before we get the final January CPI revisions for the Euro Area and February CBI survey in the UK. There’s no data due in the US, however it is a busy day for Fedspeak with Bostic, Williams, Daly, Clarida, Potter, Bullard, Harker and Quarles are scheduled to speak. The ECB’s Draghi is also due to speak at a ceremonial event this afternoon.","""Sea Of Green"" Across World Markets As Trade Talk Optimism Storms Back",Zerohedge.com,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-02-22/sea-green-across-world-markets-trade-talk-optimism-storms-back

Operator

Good morning. My name is Joanna and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Lucara Diamond Q4 2018 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]

Thank you. Ms. Eira Thomas, you may begin your conference.

Eira Thomas

Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Lucara's 2018 year-end call. My name is Eira Thomas and I am a founder and CEO of the Lucara Diamond Corp. I will be making some forward-looking-statements and this cautionary statement from slide two is available on our website for your review at any point.

Moving on slide three. The year-ended December 31, 2018 was really a transformative year for Lucara. The investments we made in our business this year resolved the waste stripping bottleneck that emerged in ‘17, advanced and significantly derisked our plans for underground expansion at Karowe and bought us a complementary new technology business that in time has the potential to generate cash flow comparable to those coming from our mine.

Safety remains foundational to our business and how we work. And I'm pleased to report that in 2018, we did not record a single LTI at the mine, and we ended the year, 587 days or 5.5 million man hours LTI-free.

We also closed out the year strong operationally, having met or exceeded budget and guidance with respect to ore and waste mined, carat production and cost, and within 2% in respect of revenues, even closer if you consider the inventory that was set aside for the ramp-up of Clara. It was also a banner year for the recovery of Specials, so diamonds in excess of 10.8 carats. And in completing our 2018 Resource update, we confirmed that our main orebody, the South Lobe is becoming higher grade with depth. This bodes well for our underground feasibility study, which is well underway and scheduled for completion in the second half of the year.

At Clara, we completed our inaugural sale in December and a second follow-up in January. Both were successful and demonstrated that Clara can achieve higher prices for rough diamonds over historical tenders, all the while delivering better margins for manufacturers. In 2019, we are excited to be steadily ramping up on sales, and we are expecting that third-party rough production to the platform before year-end.

As for our balance sheet, reinvestment in our business in support of future growth was an important priority for the Clara in 2018. However, we were still able to protect the balance sheet and return over CA$30 million in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividend. It is our intention to pay out our first quarterly dividend for 2019 of CA$0.025 on April 11.

Moving on to the diamond market. 2019 got off to a rather slow start, and rough diamond markets are quite quiet still, smalls and cheaper goods do remain out of favor. I think, volatile soft markets, fears of the trade war, the U.S. government shutdown, and some slowing of Chinese GDP certainly are impacting wider sentiment. Financing also for the middle market continues to shrink as profitability in this part of the pipeline really is on the decrease.

Prices for large rough however a big value driver in the Lucara sales appear to be resilient, having dropped only a few percentage points since December. And the good news is that we are seeing polished markets in February stronger with suppliers selling at somewhat lower prices really to get that liquidity going. So, we are optimistic. And of course, the fundamentals of our business remain very strong, looking at the graph out to 2020 and beyond as we see a number of large producers nearing end of life, and we remain very optimistic about diamond prices longer term.

In terms of our diamond sales, we did our final sale of the year in December, achieving $40.6 million in proceeds. For the full-year, we sold approximately 351,000 carats, which is well in excessive guidance and achieved $176.2 million. Included in that were 829 specials, a record for the mind.

John will speak more on the subject of diamond price in a moment. But at $502 per carat for 2018, the result was lower than in previous years for two principal reasons. Firstly, average price was diluted by the recovery of a higher volume of small diamonds that resulted from improved plant performance. And as the analysts will be aware, diamond prices for small diamonds were weaker in 2018. So, this had an extra knock on effect to our average price achieved. Secondly, and despite the fact that we had a banner year with respect to recovery of large diamonds, we had an atypical year in respect to the quality of some of our larger stones. Notably absent were single stones in the $5 million to $10 million U.S. range. Natural variability in the recovery of these diamonds is to be expected. But other contributing factors include increased diamond damage and possibly security. We have redoubled our efforts to investigate, understand and mitigate against both of these variables for 2019.

It is important to note that one of the most successful ways to manage and minimize diamond damage is by maintaining steady throughput in the mill. And I am pleased to report that since late in the third quarter 2018, operations at Karowe have been stable; plant reliability has never been better. And with the waste stripping campaign largely complete, we are successfully addressing opportunities to drive efficiencies, reduce costs, and maximize our revenues.

Further, 2019 is off to a strong start with the recovery of several 100-carat high-quality gem diamonds which will be offered for sale at our first tender of the year, scheduled to close March 7, 2019.

I would now like to turn it over to Dr. Armstrong, who's going to take us through a brief operational update and a review of our current organic growth initiatives.

John Armstrong

Great. Thank you, Eira. And good morning and good afternoon to everyone.

If we can have the next slide, please? And yes, I'll briefly touch base on a number of items here. With this particular slide, you can see on the left hand a portion of the image -- photograph of the Karowe open pit looking from north to south. I would caution people, this image is from a few years ago, and there's been -- as Eira noted, significant progress has been made on both waste striping and ore mined. And those benches of South Lobe ore that you see in the far end of the pit, have actually gone to the plant as of now. And the mine is located in the north central district of Botswana within the Orapa, Kimberlite field. Karowe is now a well known and established large diamond producers with a solid production profile of desirable goods across all sizes. The use of technology and state of the arts XRT bulk sorting allows Karowe to efficiently recover the full range of the diamond population from the mine, and in particular in the coarse portion of the size frequency distribution.

Next slide please? What we're going to see on this next slide is that roughly 70% of the revenue from Karowe is recovered from about 5% of the production, it’s predominantly in the larger songs, +10.8 carats. For 2018, the average price per carat was lower due to higher volume of smaller diamonds, which as Eira mentioned, were under downward market pressures, and this has been observed and felt by all our fellow producers. During 2018, we sold one diamond for greater $10 million, which is a significant outcome. I’d like to remind people how rare these particular diamonds are. And what we did see was the lack of diamonds in the $5 million to $10 million range, which is a significant contributor to the lower average price. And although it was a banner year with respect to these +10, 20 carat diamonds, the revenue that drive from those diamonds was lower than previous year’s combination of natural and processing related factors such as, as Eira alluded to security and diamond damage.

Now, color, inclusion density and inclusion distribution and shapes are natural attributes of the diamond population over which we have no control. However, factors such as diamond damage and security concerns can be mitigated. Operationally, attention is focused on these aspects over which we have control, and we’ve addressed these in a very serious manner since the latter part of 2018.

And we could see from the numbers on the right hand side of the image that the mine has a well-established track record of producing +10.8 carat diamonds in line with the Resource Model and the continued recovery of high value diamonds. This continuity is further witnessed by the recent recoveries that have been disclosed like probably over the last month or so, including the 127 carats, the 223 and the 240 carat diamonds.

Next slide, please? Now, to sort of put a little bit of context around average price in a global context. The next image will show the average price per carat achieved for a number of primary diamond deposits around the world where we see an average price of approximately $140 to $150 a carat. And we can see, the Karowe has close to 5 times the world average. And sitting next [technical difficulty] we're seeing the average prices of [technical difficulty] production, which includes the sale of very large, plus 900 carat and extremely high value stone sitting at plus $40 million. And you can see, there are very few large stone producers and the significance of those big stones stores to our average price.

Next slide, please? We should be coming up to slide number nine. And this next set of slides will cover organic growth opportunities and projects through Lucara. First one that we'll start discussing is the underground feasibility study and project that is currently underway. And this looks toward the potential of an underground mine at Karowe. So, we see the mine life extend upwards to 2036 and potentially beyond, after the completion of the open pit mine in 2026.

Following on from the positive PEA, which was released in late 2017, we launched a technical program during 2018 that was designed at the feasibility level, the targeted gaps and risks identified in the PEA. And the technical program has successfully derisked several key aspects, number one being hydrogeology. We investigated the potential for deep aquifers at Karowe, and we encountered no deepwater strikes, which was identified as a significant risk, and we can check that box off but we haven't seen evidence for deep hot saline brines at Karowe. We're in the process of completing a 2,000-meter geotechnical drill program that is providing the required information to inform the mining method selection. Methods under consideration include a top-down sublevel cave scenario where we’d start a sublevel cave or sublevel retreat below the open-pit and mine downward or a bottom up block cave scenario where we would go down to the bottom of the resource and initiate a block cave and propagate that cave upward.

The budget for the 2019 program is currently at $14.8 million. Critical data collection will be complete by early Q2 of this year. Geotechnical drilling program is in the process of winding down and they’re demobilizing some of the drill rigs with just a few holes remaining, including an in-pit drill hole we're going to measure the [indiscernible] stress of the South Lobe Kimberlite at various elevations throughout the potential other sublevel cave or block cave. And we're looking to have the feasibility study completed in the second half of 2019.

Next slide, please? This next slide, some people will be familiar with these images. But fundamentally, a key driver for the underground feasibility study was a successful conversion from inferred to the indicated category of the resource between 600 and 400 meters above sea level.

Another significant outcome of the resource update was through detailed core logging of both the new and historic holes along with other detailed studies sessions petrography and then other studies. There was a recognition that the higher grade and EM/PK(NYSE:S) units shown in blue on the image on the left of the slide that the EM/PK(S) becomes volumetrically the most significant pipe infill at depth within the South Lobe. And we can demonstrate that the EM/PK(S) has produced some of the mine’s largest and high-value stones such as the Constellation and Lesedi La Rona. But, I would like to remind everybody that it’s very important not to forget the EM/PK(S) shown in green here is also host to large and high value diamonds as demonstrated by previous year’s production and recoveries and most recently by the recovery of the 240 carat top white diamond recovered in January of this year, which we know is coming from the EM/PK(S). So, both units within the South Lobe had demonstrably core size distribution, and had a track record of producing high value stones. And we anticipate and expect that to continue as we go forward. [Technical difficulty] resource update were very positive to support the ongoing feasibility studies.

Next slide, please? Now, we're going to shift gears a little bit and we're going to talk about something that Eira mentioned at the beginning, and that is that in early 2018 just about a year ago, the Lucara acquired Clara Diamond Solutions. And Clara is the opportunity for us to disrupt the existing diamond supply chain. It unlocks value across the supply chain and provides manufacturers with rough diamonds that they require for their polished orders on a stone by stone basis.

And it's not an understatement to say that Clara had a very busy year, starting off with and very importantly negotiating, assigning an exclusive collaboration agreement with Serene Technologies. And we're going to continue to foster and grow that relationship as Clara progresses and becomes more and more important in the diamond supply chain. And then, this effort went into the commercialization of Clara and went from a concept right to completion of its first sale, which was done in early December of 2018.

Next slide, please? This inaugural sale through the Clara platform, as I said took place in early December of 2018. It involved seven vertically integrated jewelry houses and global manufacturers that Clara had on-boarded through Q3 and the beginning of Q4 of 2018. The results of the first sale were encouraging, extremely encouraging with approximately $660,000 worth of material moving through the platform. And recognizing that this is a trial sale, something that we communicated very much to the seven people that we had on -- manufacturers that we had onboarded. There was a concerted effort to provide and ask for feedback from the participants. And that feedback was extremely positive. And we were able to use that feedback to inform the second cycle sale, and the results of which were also very positive. And we saw wider selection of diamonds being sold in the second sale. Total sales -- total value of the two sales is over $1.5 million, and margins above market and reserve of between 8% to 15%. We're right on our target and well within our expectations. And now, with the diamonds moving through the manufacturing pipeline, we anticipate and will receive additional feedback from the manufacturers. And what we can say now is that the feedback that we received has been extremely positive from the participants.

And as we move forward, in 2019, the focus is going to be on the continued onboarding of manufacturers. We get contacted on a regular basis from people who want to know more about Clara, they want to become active participants on the Clara platform. There are discussions with third party global rough producers. We have a goal of onboarding those additional producers to Clara over the course of 2019.

I will now hand the call over to Zara Boldt, who is Lucara's CFO. And she'll present the financial highlights. Thank you.

Zara Boldt

Thanks very much, John. Good morning and good afternoon everyone.

Eira and John have spoken to the record year that we had in terms of diamond recoveries, particularly the recovery of Specials and the reasons for the lower average price per carat achieved in 2018. That leads into a discussion of our financial results for 2018. Total revenue for the year-ended December 31, 2018 was $176.2 million, earned from the sale of approximately 351,000 carats at an average price of $502 per carat. Total revenue is slightly below our revised guidance of $180 million to $190 million for the year for the reasons noted by Eira and John earlier.

At the end of the year, inventory set aside for sale on Clara had an estimated realized value of about $2.3 million. Total revenue of $220.8 million in 2017 includes proceeds of $53 million from the sale of historic 1,109 carat with Lesedi La Rona. After adjusting for the sale of Lesedi, comparable revenues in 2017 were $167.8 million, from the sale of about 260,000 carats at an average price of $647 per carat.

Looking forward to 2019, our guidance for revenue of $170 million to $200 million is consistent with that of 2018. The significant range in our guidance accounts for the natural variability in the orebody, which consistently produces stones in excess of 10.8 carats. High-quality Specials such as the ones recovered in the first few weeks of 2019 are included in that range and represent a strong start for us in 2019.

Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $60.5 million compared to $65.9 million in 2017, excluding the Lesedi. Looking forward to 2019, we expect adjusted EBITDA to improve. With the waste bottlenecks substantially completed in 2017 and 2018, the total number of tons mined, which is a key driver of cost for us, is expected to decrease significantly. This, combined with continued operational efficiencies from the plant, should have a positive impact on adjusted EBITDA and cash flow in 2019.

Cash flow per share was $0.11 in 2018 from an operating cash flow of $45 million. Our operating cost per ton processed was $40.93 for 2018, which was within guidance. Despite the unplanned change in the mining contractor midyear, we saw a return to strong production numbers in the last half of 2018, and this improved productivity has continued into 2019.

In 2019, we anticipate that our total operating cost per ton processed will be in the $32 to $37 range, which is much closer to the ranges that we had observed prior to the major waste stripping campaign undertaken in 2017 and 2018. Increases in the mining cost per ton are partially mitigated by decreases in our cost per ton process resulting from efficiencies realized following the appointment of a new contractor for the processing plant in late 2017.

We earned $0.03 per share in 2018 on net income of $11.7 million. Net income was impacted by higher costs in 2018 and was significantly impacted by depletion and amortization expense of $31.4 million, which is a non-cash item. Significant investments in the plant over the last two years totaled of $51.3 million combined with capitalized waste stripping for the same period of $46.2 million have resulted in record carat recoveries, a steady increase in plant availability and substantial completion of the waste bottleneck. One impact of these investments has been an increase in the yearly depletion and amortization expense, which has and will continue to impact our net income and earnings per share. In 2019, we expect this noncash expense will be about $45 million, based on anticipated carat recoveries of $300,000 to $330,000.

Turning now to some highlights from operations at the Karowe Diamond Mine. Operational performance in 2018 ended on a very positive note. We met or exceeded guidance for ore and waste mined, or processed and carats recovered. Importantly, for 2019 and beyond, we were able to work through a majority of the waste bottleneck, which will reduce the number of tons of waste that we are required to mine in 2019 and beyond, reducing our strip ratio significantly in about the third quarter of 2019.

Cash costs are expected to decrease to the $32 to $37 per ton range of ore processed. We expect tons of ore processed to be between 2.5 million and 2.8 million tons in 2019 as compared to 2.63 million tons processed in 2018.

In 2018, we mined 3.1 million tons of ore and 15 million tons of waste at a cost of $3.46 per ton. In 2019, we expect this unit rate to increase to between $4 and $4.50 per ton, but total tons mined will decrease. In 2018, we processed 2.6 million tons of ore at a cost of $13.14. In 2019, we expect to process between 2.5 million and 2.8 million tons of ore at an estimated processing cost between $12 and $13.

Looking at our results for the three months ended December 31, 2018. Carats recovered and sold continued to be significantly higher than the same period in 2017, although not quite at the record levels that we achieved in the third quarter of this year. Our production numbers for Q4 2018 were consistent with our expectations.

Moving now to our guidance for 2019. There were no changes to the guidance that we announced earlier this year. Productivity in both mining and processing activities at site continues to the same levels achieved in the latter part of 2018, and we are realizing strong carat recoveries including the recovery of 3 +100 carat high quality gem diamonds that will be sold shortly in our first tender sale of the year. Although we expect sales to Clara to ramp up in 2019, we do expect to provide guidance for Clara later in the year, once we have additional participants and a higher volume of transactions on the platform.

We ended the year with the strong balance sheet with cash of $24.4 million, working capital of $48.8 million, and $10 million of debt drawn from our working capital facility. With the significant waste stripping campaign substantially complete, we expect our cost in 2019 will come down. We expect to pay the CA$0.10 annual dividend from free cash flow, and the first quarterly payments will be April 11th to shareholders of record on March 22nd.

In 2019, we are actively pursuing opportunities to drive efficiencies, reduce costs and maximize revenue in addition to organic growth opportunities from the completion of the feasibility study looking at the potential for underground development and further ramp-up of sales on Clara.

Thank you very much for your time today. We'll now open the floor to questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Des Kilalea from Canaccord. Please go ahead.

Des Kilalea

Good morning, team. I wondered if I could just kind of get a little bit more clarification on the breakage and the security issue. Maybe kind of address each one separately. Security seems to have kind of risen at another listed diamond mine just recently. And just wondering, have you actually seen evidence of maybe syndicates involved or whether are you actually seeing and what do you plan to do, if you can talk about it? And just on the breakage, where do you think the breakage is occurring?

Eira Thomas

Sure. And maybe what I'll do, Des, is I'll start by addressing the security and then I'll turn it over to John to just talk a little bit about diamond value preservation, which is an issue we continue to work very hard. On the aspect of security, Des, listen, it's a difficult thing. Every single diamond mine obviously has been challenged by this particular issue. For Lucara, it’s obviously, I think an issue which is really even more pronounced or potentially pronounced because of the value or the concentrated value that resides in our large stones, these type two stones. So, listen, we're not suggesting that we have uncovered something nefarious here in the last year. It's really just looking to our systems and processes. And I'm looking at what we recovered. So, we have made a decision to really drill down and focus on this in a way that's a little bit different than what we've done in the past. And that effort started in Q3. And while it’s too early to definitively say it's bearing fruit, I think, obviously, our recoveries for 2019 giving us encouragement that we're on the right path.

Des Kilalea

Could I just follow up on this, perhaps something John could comment on? Within the size frequency distribution, other than the quality issues which you mentioned, are there noticeable gaps in the size frequency from the South Lobe in particular that might give into some security issue?

Eira Thomas

No. And John, maybe you want to jump in there. I think that we're very comfortable with the quantum of diamonds that we're recovering. What we -- what was absent in 2018 was the higher quality goods that make up those larger stones. John, do you have anything you want to add there?

John Armstrong

Yes. Sure. I'll answer -- I think you answered Des’ question on the presence of the stones in the SFD. I mean, the other thing to bear in mind is that that as we know, these stones don’t come on a regular basis out of the size distribution, just given how they're distributed within the deposit. So, I mean that becomes tricky. They drop onto the size distribution over time as you aggregate and aggregate more and more diamonds out of the deposit. So, it's a bit tricky to say that over this span we should have seen this particular size or type of diamond. So, we look more at the volume and then get into the individual stone counts by size class.

And then, in terms of the breakage question, I guess I have few comments about breakage. I mean, if you break a diamond, you can certainly remove a lot of value from that particular diamond. But, you don't necessarily need to break the diamond to lower its value. Impacts and inducing cracks into diamonds also have a big detrimental effect on the overall value of the stone. And in terms of identifying where we feel we're seeing diamond damage take place, we have always been concerned about it and always been tracking it. But certainly, over the course of last year, we paid a lot more attention to it and sort of have done -- from the pit all the way through the whole process, looking at areas where we can see potential damage happening, specifically referencing back to what we saw in the goods themselves. And we’ve identified a number of areas where we think we can have some pretty quick and early wins. And these come down to kind of operational procedures with respect to levels within the bins, controlling what's happening at transfer points, stockpile levels and the things of that nature. And we paid a lot of attention to that through the last part of the year. And I think we're starting to see some of that come through with the goods that we’ve seen. I mean, the 240 carat stone is I would say over 95% intact. There's a few little chips off one side and likewise for the 127. 127, we don’t think we can see any particular damage to it at all. So, I think that we’ve seen some early wins come through, and we’re just going to continue to press the point. And where we see the potential, we're going to mitigate.

Eira Thomas

And Des, the comment I made before about getting our plant running in a reliable way is really, really helpful in being able to manage diamond breakage.

Operator

Thank you. Your next question is from Richard Hatch from Berenberg. Please go ahead.

Richard Hatch

Thanks. And good morning. And first question is just on Clara. So, you guys gave us what your results were for the first Clara sales, 8% over market and 15% over reserve. You kind of said that the second results were more consistent. But are you able to put a number on it? Was it about the same, or was there a little bit of normalization in what you got there? That’s my first one.

Eira Thomas

Yes. Richard, listen, they're comparable and we can argue that we did a little bit better in the second sale. But, I think what's really important here and what we're trying to emphasize that it’s not about percentages that we at the end of the day that we achieve for Karowe goods on Clara, it's about demonstrating that there is upside, by selling rough diamonds through Clara, as we know part of our business strategy. And really what’s fundamental for the business strategy is in bringing on third-party volume to the platform. That's the real business driver for us. So, we wanted to demonstrate to our solid producers that there is a price by selling your diamonds on Clara. But equally important is the fact that these manufacturers are able to achieve better margins. And ultimately this is their preferred way of buying. So, it's really a combination of lifting and it's a volume story. So, it's not about saying we're doing 8% better for our Karowe goods. At the end of the day, it's going to be about third party volume that we put through the platform and that's going to be important.

Richard Hatch

Just a follow-up question on that is the volumes that you put through on the second tender, were they comparable to the first or were they bit smaller? And then my second was, you kind of alluded to the comment that you’d like to bring on third party volumes. Are you talking -- do you think those volumes will come on from listed diamond producers or private diamond producing companies?

Eira Thomas

Listen, we're talking to a number of potential producers. So, I would say both. I mean, we're really targeting both. We're talking to everyone, but we've got a couple of producers that we're in advanced discussions with. And we'll say more about that in the coming weeks and months.

Richard Hatch

Okay. And the volumes?

Eira Thomas

Oh, the volumes were comparable, yes, I'd say for the two sales. And really, the other thing -- sorry Richard?

Richard Hatch

No, no, go ahead.

Eira Thomas

I was just going to point out that our goal with Clara is to move into continuous sales. So, these first two sales have really been designed to provide feedback to us. So, all of our participants have been -- have committed to providing us with feedback that can help us understand how the design is working and whether it's meeting all their expectations. And so, we're kind of in that fine tuning stage. It's not to say, every sale is going to be of that size. Certainly, it's about making sure that we ramp up appropriately, based on demand and supply that's available.

Richard Hatch

Okay. Thank you. Next one is just on mix. Congrats on the recovery of some lovely stones over the last weeks and months. Just notwithstanding those, are you seeing an improvement in the mix versus what you sold over the last couple of quarters? I'm just kind of looking at your guidance and I just want to make sure that comfortable with -- like, the mix as it stands or do you think the average price will be more HT weighted to the better average prices and it's a bit weaker first half?

Eira Thomas

John, do you want to tackle that one? And then, I'll jump in.

John Armstrong

Yes. I think we're comfortable in the numbers that we've put out Richard in terms of what we anticipate for revenue. Notwithstanding the three stones that we have provided the market with information on. I mean, we will be offering 31 individual stones for sale in the tender, which starts on -- viewings start on Monday, which is really in line with what we have done over the course of the last 4 or 5 tenders where we had in the plus 30 single stones to sell. And the rest of the blend of goods is comparable to what we've seen. But, I think that what we are seeing this time around is that the quality of the single stones is better than the quality of the stones that we sold through the fourth quarter last year, which is why we're confident in revenue numbers that we've presented.

Richard Hatch

Okay. Thanks, John. And then, my last one is just on the balance sheet. So, I was kind of a bit surprised to see some debt put on the structure. But, I appreciate it's working cap. Dividends, I mean, just how are you thinking around the dividend? Because, if you are consuming cash at the moment, you appreciate you'll be free cash flow positive on your basis on your forecast for this year. But, if your mix doesn't improve or you don't get that mix benefit and your revenues come off down at the bottom end of your range, plus you've got your CapEx in the back of your mind on the undergrounds, how are you thinking around the dividend? Do you -- I mean, because it kind of feels that this quarter you basically drew debt to pay the dividend. So, what's the thought process on that?

Zara Boldt

Eira, would you want me to…

Eira Thomas

Yes. You can start that, Zara, and I fill in at the end. Thank you.

Zara Boldt

So, Richard, you are correct. We did draw on the facility for working capital. What we saw at the end of December was just higher volume of expenses following the transition with the mining contractor, a number of different changes, that is the purpose of the working capital facility. As you’ve noted, our sales quarterly. So, we do -- we will be using the facility from time-to-time to smooth those out. In terms of our ability to pay the dividend, we are very confident in that. And we're confident in our projections. And we think 2019 is going to be a good year from an operating perspective. The investments that we've made over the last couple of years with respect to the waste stripping campaign and improvements in the plant are really -- are literally paying dividends right now. And we're comfortable that the balance sheet and our cash flow can support the payment of a $0.10 Canadian annual dividend.

Eira Thomas

And Richard, I’d just maybe add on the feasibility question that you had. We will have -- we're aiming to have that feasibility study out the latter part of 2019. And our investments for the underground will start at the earliest in 2020.

Richard Hatch

Okay. Thank you very much for your time.

Operator

Thank you. Your next question is from Scott Macdonald from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.

Scott Macdonald

Hi. Good morning, guys. Just a few questions for me. Firstly, just following up on Des’ question about the breakage. Is there any indication that the breakage issue has been more prominent in 2018 versus in prior years, say in 2015, when you had particularly good average prices?

John Armstrong

I think that there is a couple of ways to answer the question. We did see some increased breakage through 2018. And like I indicated in my response to Des that we saw the potential, we kind of had a pretty good feeling to where that was happening and we mitigated. I would say that in 2015 we also did same exercise in late August of 2015. We identified that we broke some stones that came through -- that would have been fairly large. And we put in place some changes to the SOPs at that time which to my mind, led to, and enhanced our ability to recover the 813 carat Constellation and the 1,109 Lesedi La Rona. So I think that’s part of the story.

The other part of the story is that those particular stones recovered in 2015 were extremely unique in terms of their size and their quality. I mean, they are the kind of the ultimate outliers in any diamond population, and enhance we try to roll them out. And they're not included in our price models going forward. So, in both the 2015 -- to summarize I guess, in 2015, we identified we were breaking some bigger goods. We put in place procedures to mitigate. And we saw the net results of that was recovery of some of the world's largest rough diamonds that people have ever seen. And then, in 2018, we saw evidence of breakage in the early part of the year. As you look at the image of the 474 carat top light brown that recovered. I mean there is some damage to that particular stone. And through the course of the year we put in place some studies and we acted on those studies in the latter part of the year. And I think we'll see the fruit of that as we go forward, as we have previously.

Scott Macdonald

Okay. That's helpful. And just quick follow-up sort of related to that. When you say the quality of the larger stones you've gotten in 2018 were maybe not as good as you had in prior years. Is that -- are you speaking mainly about the shape or the clarity or which sort of component is that kind of thing that could be impacted by breakage?

John Armstrong

No. I mean, the things that I think were -- that really contributed to the overall lower revenue that came from the big stones were natural attributes. And we have no control over that. And that would be basically color and how piqued the stone was in addition to the how piqued it was is where those piques sat in the stone. And those are natural attributes. We’ve demonstrated that we put in place the systems and process to recover those big stones, and that we can control and we will control.

Scott Macdonald

Okay. That's helpful. Moving on just to the Q4 sales. I was a little surprised to see the revenue number coming in below your guidance that you revised in November, and particularly because at that point you would have had probably most of the stones that you ended up selling in Q4, on hand already. So, I'm just trying to understand what happened there that was that you didn't expect or why the number was lower?

Eira Thomas

Scott, I think, it was just higher -- again higher volumes of finer diamonds which have been under pressure from a pricing perspective. And back again to the quality of the single stone Specials that -- it just wasn't there. So, we were very quite disappointed.

Scott Macdonald

Okay. But, I guess…

Eira Thomas

Some of our larger stones, Scott, I think it's important to point out from John's previous comments and your questions that the overall quality of our diamond population is not changed and we're consistent over the last seven years. It's really a value component in the larger stones this year that just wasn't there. And as John has rightfully pointed out, that can absolutely be natural variability. However, we do know that we damage some of those stones as well and those -- that was a disappointment. Those larger stones in the fourth quarter just didn't carry the same quality as we're used to seeing from all prior years.

Scott Macdonald

Okay. But, I guess sort of part of my question sort of referring to the fact that at the time you gave the guidance, you probably would have known the quality of the stones you were selling for the most part because it was -- you gave the guidance in November, I think your production cut off would have been right around then?

Eira Thomas

Yes. It's a combination of things. Listen, we make estimates, we bring in diamonds from the mine. They all have to go through cleaning. It's a big process to sort that volume of goods. And as Zara pointed out, the contribution of those smaller diamonds and the diluting effect on average prices was definitely a factor. But, you're right, it was miss; it was 2%. We also had diamonds that we set aside to Clara, which impacted that. So, we're very close. But, we certainly had hoped to have done better than that.

Scott Macdonald

Okay. Thanks for that. Just one final one on Clara, if I may. Your third sale you're having in March, are there any sort of lessons learned from the first two sales, anything you're going to be doing differently? And then, sort of related, what do you think you can go to continue sales after that, or are you still not at that point to making that decision?

Eira Thomas

Listen, I think what we learned, which was really encouraging is that the design of the platform is very user friendly. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. I think, the key learning for us is just is managing the pace and making sure that we have the good competition on the platform, the right variety of orders and the right volume of goods. I have every confidence that when we’re up in continuous sales and steady state production and we've got bigger volumes going through the platform, this will find a natural stasis. But we just have to manage that onboarding process carefully. And that's why we have not -- we've not gone out and made some very -- some prognostications on how much volume we’ll be doing, for example in Q1 versus Q2. We're still in that ramp-up phase. But each sale gives us more information and greater confidence. And of course, for our manufacturing partners, as every single one of them is back and placing more orders, and each time they come back, the variety of orders -- the number of orders have improved and increased. So, it is an iterative process. And we will continue to update the market with that, and as we go along in 2019. But, I think we have been very conservative in our projections and that we have not ascribed any value to revenues coming through Clara in 2019. And based on the way things are going today, I think we will certainly be in a position to report some revenues before end of the year.

Operator

Thank you. Your next question is from Paul Zimnisky from PZDA. [Ph] Please go ahead.

Unidentified Analyst

Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I know it's hard to analyze, but generally speaking regarding the gem quality exceptional. Did you notice any price change on a like for like basis in 2018? And then, kind of following up on that. Who are you seeing as the top end consumer markets for the gem quality exceptional? And then, just lastly, I believe you guys have a 10% stake in Tsodilo which holds the BK16 asset. I'm just wondering if Lucara still sees that asset as offering potential synergy, given the proximity to Karowe?

John Armstrong

So, I'll handle the first part of that question, Eira. I guess, -- thanks for the question, it’s a good question. And the answer is going to be pretty straightforward and probably not very satisfying. But, we can't do the like for like comparison between years with these exceptional stones, because each one of them is entirely unique. They're unique in their weight, they're unique in the potential polished outcomes. So, it's not like the unit comparison a 10 carat [indiscernible] where the solution is pretty straightforward. When you get into -- even plus 50, plus 100 carat gem quality stone, number of solutions are very much driven by what the manufacturer sees in there and what he has lined up for potential consumer. So, it's extremely difficult to do a like for like comparison. That being said, I think that the pricing we see has been pretty consistent year-on-year. And for diamond to achieve rough price, a white diamond of an excess of $50,000 a carat in a rough. It's an exceptional stone and it's very difficult to do comparisons between.

Eira Thomas

The one thing I’d add Paul is that -- yes I would just say, the only thing I'd add to that is that certainly this is the most price resilient part of the market. And it’s less I guess volatile or vulnerable than other segments of the market. So, that's obviously very helpful. And the fact that 70% of our revenues come from these stones, really insulates Lucara from some of the vagaries that we see happening in other parts of the market.

As far as Tsodilo BK11, we’re always supportive and enthusiastic about exploration efforts that are going on in our neighborhood. And we certainly understand the challenge of finding diamond deposits. And I think that the efforts that have been going on there have certainly progressed that project. And I don't think we’ve answered all the questions there yet. But certainly, we're keen to follow on with next steps and see what happens there.

Unidentified Analyst

Thank you. And just again on the end consumer markets for the gem quality exceptionals. Are you seeing any variability on -- who would you say are the top three end consumer markets? I guess, by nation, if you had to.

Eira Thomas

Well, the U.S. obviously continues to dominate, lesser degree China, and China has been weaker for obvious reasons, but the USA continues to certainly dominate. Our particular goods for large stone market is much more global, I would say, and we see demand coming from all parts of the world for those types of diamonds.

Unidentified Analyst

Okay, great. And congrats on the recent recoveries. Thank you.

Eira Thomas

Thank you very much, Paul.

Operator

Thank you. The next question is a follow-up from Richard Hatch from Berenberg. Please go ahead.

Richard Hatch

Just on the debt, can you just -- are you able to give a bit of statement on what your thoughts are on and how -- whether you are going to keep this debt sitting on the balance sheet or whether you are going to pay it down or is it a fluid situation that depends on sales results?

Eira Thomas

Yes, Richard. It depends on sales results; it's a working capital facility.

Richard Hatch

Okay. And then, the second one is just on VAT receivables. I see they've built in the last couple of quarters. Is there anything going on there that I should be -- we should be reading into, or is everything okay?

Eira Thomas

Yes, everything is okay. There are no collectability issues. And we've actually received a significant chunk of that in the last few weeks. With the sliding scale tax regime in Botswana, we need to make estimates of our corporate tax payable each year. And to a certain extent the government will withhold that refund, the Government of Canada, to a certain extent does similar things, until they're comfortable that the assessment as a corporate tax is correct and the payments have been received. So, it's really a tiny difference. No collectability issues.

Richard Hatch

Okay. So, that flows back in -- or much of that VAT receivable flows into the Q1 number?

Eira Thomas

Yes.

Richard Hatch

And then, the last one is just on CapEx. The Q4 CapEx came in a little bit higher than what I was looking for and I think perhaps a bit higher than guidance. Is there anything in there that -- what was the driver of that?

Eira Thomas

We had spending on the underground, which was as expected. That one was below guidance. So, I'm not quite sure what you're referring to.

Richard Hatch

Okay. So, your acquisition and disposition of plant equipment net was $17.1 million. So, I take that as your sustaining CapEx number with obviously the mineralized property expenditure in this capitalized strip running below it. But, I think your guidance was 11 and the Q3 number was 9.2. So, it's like -- it's another $8 million or so in Q4. And I think your guidance was $11 million sustaining CapEx. So, was there any reason why that was a bit lumpy in the fourth quarter or…?

Eira Thomas

No particular reason. No.

Richard Hatch

Okay. Thanks.

Operator

Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. You may proceed.

Eira Thomas

It's Eira here. Sorry. I just had myself on mute. Listen, thank you very much. I’d just like to reiterate that Lucara has successfully come through a very big year of change having stabilized the business, advanced two very-high potential organic growth opportunities that we're excited about, and we protected the dividend. We feel very good about the direction that we're going in 2019. And I’d just like to acknowledge really the hard work and the dedication of this largely new executive leadership team as well as our senior leaders on the ground in Botswana and all of our employees for their big efforts. And thank you very much for participating today.

186,Empty,2019-02-21T15:00:31Z,Canadians have come to think the whip system of party discipline is a near-sacred tradition. But it’s largely avoided in most countries.,"Sometimes I’m not convinced Canadians are particularly committed to democracy.

We think we are, though. Especially in contrast to our powerful neighbour to the south, whose polarized politics both entertains and outrages us.

But there is an argument to be made that the U.S. — as well as Britain, Australia, Germany, Ireland, Japan, and a host of other advanced nations — have political systems that are more democratic, accountable and transparent than those in Ottawa and the provinces.

And that is not necessarily because some of those nations have a version of proportional representation (which four in 10 British Columbians chose in last fall’s referendum). There is little doubt that proportional representation, as the name suggests, provides voters with fairer “representation” and leads to more collaboration between parties.

But there is another rarely discussed aspect of Canada’s federal and provincial political system that needs reform, because it also renders our governments unusually weak in regards to democratic values. And that is party discipline, particularly the “whip system.”

It turns most MPs and MLAs into little more than often-disparaged “trained seals.”

The office of the government whip, which enforces conformity on parliamentary votes, represents a lost opportunity for independent thinking. Worse, it encourages Canada’s prime ministers and premiers to make themselves into what one analyst rightly calls “friendly dictators.”

Canadians have become used to such leaders: The ones who smile for the cameras while speaking softly. Meanwhile, these same prime ministers and premiers use the office of the whip to carry an incredibly big stick, which they use to smash fresh ideas and challenges.

LISTEN: This week on the In The House podcast, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the 2019 provincial budget. Did the B.C. NDP present a prudent plan or did government miss a key opportunity to fulfill its agenda?

Since proportional representation is done and dusted for probably another generation in B.C., maybe we could take a stab at updating the draconian whip system, which renders most Canadian MPs and MLAs (and in many cases even cabinet ministers) virtually useless.

Backbenchers have become almost entirely beholden to their leader and his or her cabal of inner-circle advisers. Witness the extreme secrecy around the machinations by Justin Trudeau over Huawei, SNC-Lavalin, and demoted justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Witness the enormous power wielded by B.C.’s Christy Clark and John Horgan, even if the latter, with his minority government, has been forced to collaborate with Green party leader Andrew Weaver.

Canadians have come to think the whip system is a near-sacred tradition, and necessary to run government. But it’s largely avoided in most countries, because it does not allow for the robust sharing of views.

Anybody tracking Britain’s Brexit debates will have noted the intense criticism of Conservative and Labour leaders by backbenchers in their own parties. In the U.S., Republican and Democrat politicians often speak with more freedom than do Liberals, Conservatives and the NDP.

Australian prime ministers are also often forced out because of the intense scrutiny of their own caucus. Japanese prime ministers come and go frequently as well, ousted by party members. All of these advanced countries continue to have strong cultures and economies. Canada is the outlier.

“Most of the world’s parliamentary nations — whether they use first-past-the-post elector systems or some variant of proportional representation — have that culture of constant accountability,” writes Christopher Moore in this month’s edition of Policy Options.

Over time in Canada, argues Moore, caucus members have “surrendered their power to control their leaders, (allowing) the boss to govern single-handedly. … MPs get to say ‘Aye’ and give the boss standing ovations. But policy is mostly made by consultants in the leaders’ offices.” Most back-benchers in this country who speak their minds, and even many cabinet ministers, are summarily terminated.

Related

Sean Holman, an associate professor of journalism at Mount Royal University in Calgary and a former investigative reporter covering B.C. politics, has added his voice to the cause of reform by creating a revealing documentary titled Whipped: The Secret World of Party Discipline.

Whipped exposes the private humiliation experienced by B.C. backbenchers, who describe their “soul-destroying” role as puppets. The documentary makes clear a caucus member who dissents not only pays for it during their time in office, but for the rest of their careers. The party ostracizes them for disloyalty.

Citing some B.C. political history, Holman, who uses the term “friendly dictators,” said he seemed to be one of the few who found it healthy in 2010 when a group of 13 NDP MLAs decided to question the leadership of Carole James.

By all accounts, James, who is now finance minister, is a woman of integrity, but she had already lost two elections by that time. Holman did not find it surprising that caucus members challenged her leadership, even while others were treating the MLAs as treasonous and James as feeble for putting up with it. Now, virtually all those backbenchers are gone from the B.C. NDP caucus.

The power of the office of the whip has grown even more extreme in recent years, says Holman. Public relations departments now dictate government marketing strategies, and there is relentless pressure for everyone to avoid veering from the leader’s canned message.

“What do we, the public, really want (from our elected officials)?” Holman asks. “Do we want efficiency? Or do we want democracy? We should be honest about our choice.”

Maybe I’m a glutton for lost causes, given the failure of proportional representation, but I wonder if we could mount public pressure for the easing of Canadian party discipline, for giving back-benchers a chance to really take part each day in parliamentary democracy.

It will be up to citizens to take on the conformist political culture. The leaders aren’t going to do it. Moore suggests “we need to reject pundits who tell us unaccountable leadership is the nature of parliamentary democracy and who see rebellion, disloyalty, and weak leadership when back-benchers dissent. Above all, we can teach the representatives we elect, federal and provincial, that their job as parliamentarians is to represent all Canadians, not their leaders.”

That is a fine vision. But I admit it’s hard to feel optimistic about it. I am skeptical about whether Canadians care that much about democratic principles within government. It’s easier to just feel superior to Americans and their political dramas, ignoring that their system often allows some individuality that ours does not.

I don’t expect many Canadians will speak up for the rights of back-benchers. We’ve probably become used to smiling dictators and their public relations machines.

But are we comfortable with believing democracy requires little more than casting a ballot once every four years?

187,Empty,2019-02-25T19:00:57Z,Democratic candidates for the 2020 nomination must come out against the filibuster.,"It would take decades before senators realized that without such a motion, there was no way for a simple majority to forcibly end debate, what we now call “cloture.” It was possible for a single member to block anything he opposed, and it took unanimous consent to stop him.

The filibuster was born. But the small size of the Senate and informal rules around deliberation meant it wasn’t used in earnest until the late 19th century, as American politics became more polarized around party and ideology, and informal rules around speaking and debate could not accommodate the increased pace of activity in the chamber.

The modern filibuster began to take shape in 1917, when President Woodrow Wilson used war demands to pressure the Senate into adopting cloture and a supermajority threshold for ending debate (at the time, it required two-thirds of the Senate ). But even with reform, the filibuster remained a powerful tool for “tedious delays” and “contemptible compromises of the public good.”

In the 20th century, recalcitrant senators used the filibuster to block or delay anti-lynching laws, bans on poll taxes, bans on literacy tests, and other civil rights laws. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was nearly killed by a filibuster. In recent decades, routine use of the filibuster has made it difficult for presidents to pursue their agendas and for Congress to pass major legislation. In turn, it has obscured democratic accountability and made voters feel less efficacious — when voting majorities to power isn’t enough to change the way things are, it’s fair to wonder if electoral politics is worth the trouble.

We are long past the days of large, bipartisan majorities for ambitious, far-reaching legislation. Just three Republican senators backed the 2009 stimulus and not one voted for the Affordable Care Act. Critics see this as evidence these laws were too liberal, but in truth it reflects structural change in American politics. The parties are polarized and ideologically coherent; they offer fundamentally different visions for the direction of the country. A President Booker or Klobuchar might seek Republican support for their agendas, but they won’t likely find it. The legislative path for their policies — to say nothing of a Green New Deal or universal child care — will go entirely through the Democratic Party.

As it stands, Democrats would be lucky to win a Senate majority in 2020, much less the supermajority needed to end a filibuster. For the party to have any hope at actually implementing its agenda, the filibuster needs to be either reformed or eliminated. And the first step toward that is litigating the issue in public to help voters see the cost of preserving this rule, which could put pressure on other senators if a movement forms to end it.

The Senate was built to govern, not to spend its time in endless deliberation, and the legislative filibuster makes that difficult, if not impossible. It does so in ways that typically disadvantage progressives and reformers, and which will cripple the next Democratic administration, as it nearly did the previous one. Any potential political danger — Republicans could easily attack an anti-filibuster push as the first step toward taking away our cars, cows and airplanes — is outweighed by the power that comes with being able to credibly connect the election outcome to a particular policy. Give me the votes, and I’ll give you this plan.

If Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand or any of the other Democratic candidates are actually serious about their policy agendas, the only choice they have is to abandon their attachment to this arcane procedure and lead their party to a firm consensus against a rule that was never supposed to exist.

She made a point of thanking her more critical questioners, including Dale Swanson, a founder of the local conservative women’s coalition, for their presence and their questions.

“If you’re only walking into comfortable spaces and comfortable rooms,” she added, “you’re probably not doing your job.”

But Ms. Spanberger said she has had conversations with colleagues in more solid blue districts about the impact of both hard-line liberal policy and the tone of opposition, which have prompted her to emphasize in town halls, sometimes unprompted, that she is “absolutely not a socialist.”

“When people say things in snarky ways or disrespectful ways or flippant ways, that creates an issue in districts like ours,” she said. “It’s real easy to be kind of snarky in the majority.”

At a pair of town halls last week in the deeply Republican suburbs of Salt Lake City, Mr. McAdams, an affable and mild-mannered former Salt Lake County mayor, fielded pointed questions about whether he supports the Green New Deal and socialism. More broadly, constituents worried how their moderate congressman might fare in the same caucus as the liberal bomb throwers. Richard Hansen, a Republican county commissioner and one of the two dozen constituents who attended the town hall in Nephi, a mountain town of 6,000, shared a wish with the Utah Democrat: “I hope they don’t corrupt you.”

“They won’t,” Mr. McAdams pledged. “There have been some articles about this, a little bit of tension on the Democratic side: Are we going to veer to the far left or are we going to stay in the center?

Trump believes he has a winning hand with the economy and frequently touts a low unemployment rate, strong growth and stock market gains since his 2016 election victory.

Democrats, who won ground in gubernatorial elections in 2018, are looking for ways to convert the messages that worked in those state contests into victory in the presidential election in 2020.

Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, who defeated incumbent Republican Scott Walker in one of the biggest upsets last year, said the unemployment rate in his state did not reflect the struggles faced by voters.

“Yes, we have a 3 percent unemployment rate, but we also have 800,000 families that are struggling just to put food on the table. ... We have a long way to go,” Evers said in Washington, where he attended a weekend meeting of Democratic and Republican governors from across the country.

Trump won Wisconsin by a close margin in the 2016 presidential election, and it is a major target for Democrats in 2020.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, elected last year in a state that only narrowly voted Democratic in the 2016 presidential election, said voters in his state are concerned about corporate gains not flowing down to workers.

“There is no doubt that Minnesotans and Americans are working harder and (are) more productive, but most of that gain has not been seen in the middle class,” Walz said.

Walz has endorsed U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a fellow Minnesotan, for the Democratic presidential nomination.

New Mexico’s governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, also elected last year, said Democrats needed to counter Trump’s message by talking about how low wages, expensive health insurance and rising costs are squeezing middle-class voters.

She said she was concerned about Democrats’ ability to articulate an effective message on the economy and show voters how their own policies encourage investment and well-paid jobs.

“I do worry. ... If Democrats around the country, including me, are not talking about those precise strategies ... I think we won’t get attention for the economic efforts that we’re making,” she said.

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, who has endorsed U.S. Senator Cory Booker, also of his state, for president, said Democrats should not abandon their message about social issues to talk about the economy.

“We don’t make economic progress without social progress, and likewise, you don’t make social progress without economic progress,” Murphy said.",U.S. Democrats seek ways to counter Trump's economic message,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-democrats-idUSKCN1QD0ZP

“It takes movements like ours to push parties to prioritize what the base wants and what the values of the party are,” Mr. Shahid said. “That is the role of our movement, to give a policy vision for this country to a party that often lacks a clear policy vision.”

A spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House Democrats, said its focus remained on defeating President Trump and expanding the current House majority. (The committee has announced a slate of 32 seats held by Republicans it intends to challenge.) Mr. Cuellar, asked last month about Justice Democrats’ challenge, reminded reporters that this would not be his first round beating back a primary opponent.

“What happened to the Democratic Party being a tent?” Mr. Cuellar said as he described a moderate Democratic constituency in his district, which stretches from the Mexican border to the suburbs of San Antonio. “An outside group that thinks they know southwest Texas politics better than I do are going to find out.”

Both supporters and opponents of Justice Democrats say that with the 2018 election barely in the rearview mirror, it is too early to assess how primary challenges might disrupt the Democratic field. But in a presidential year, when turnout in the primaries is often much higher than in midterm election seasons, Justice Democrats has the potential to be far more disruptive than it was in 2018, and the group and its allies are in a fighting mood.

“We should absolutely be allowed to contest what it means to be a Democrat,” Mr. McElwee said in an interview. “You can’t have a tent that includes both people of color and people who work to undermine the rights and humanity of people of color.” He pointed to Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, who defeated a more progressive Democrat, Tom Perriello, in the primary, only to be consumed in scandal for his use of blackface in the 1980s.

Senegal has witnessed a flurry of inaugurations of ambitious, big-budget projects in the last few months, including a new train line, a new bridge and the imposing Museum of Black Civilisations.

Happily snipping the ribbons has been President Macky Sall, who is seeking a second term in office in elections on Sunday.

""I will be voting for the first time and my choice is Macky Sall,"" said Mouhamad Thiam speaking to the BBC at a campaign rally in support of the president in the town of Kaolack, about 225km (140 miles) east of the capital, Dakar.

""I think his record is positive, his programme is positive, his accomplishments are positive.""

But while the 57-year-old, who has been in office since 2012, is lauded by some for pulling off these schemes, many of which were initiated by his predecessors, others are more cynical about a more general lack of development.

These frustrations, and concerns that the electoral process is flawed, mean the incumbent may be surprised to see himself voted out of office.

Backlash

Many have criticised the Constitutional Council's decision to bar two main opposition candidates from running.

Both Khalifa Sall, the popular former mayor of Dakar, and Karim Wade, the son of the former president, were deemed ineligible to run because of corruption convictions.

As a result of the decision, neither of their two parties - the Socialist Party and Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) respectively - which have dominated the country's political landscape since independence, have candidates in the upcoming election.

""The process is fraudulent because there are candidates who have been put in prison for political reasons which aren't in the interests of the Senegalese people - meaning that our justice system has been manipulated.""

The government denies those charges. But it is not the only criticism it has faced.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Ousmane Sonko is one of four challengers to President Sall

There was a backlash after a law was passed in 2018 requiring candidates to have a certain number of signatures from voters to be able to run.

As a result, only five candidates have been deemed eligible for the 24 February vote, compared to 12 in the last election.

The two top contenders apart from the incumbent are:

Idrissa Seck, a former prime minister who enjoys the backing of Mr Sall, Dakar's former mayor

Ousmane Sonko, a former tax inspector who is popular with the young

The remaining two candidates are El Hadji Issa Sall, who has a following among more religious and conservative voters and Madicke Niang, a former minister, who was once a close ally of former President Abdoulaye Wade, who lost the 2012 election.

Mr Wade has called on voters to boycott the vote, alleging it has been fixed in advance in favour of the incumbent.

The 92-year-old, who has been a leading political figure in the country since the late 1970s, is now calling on voters to attack polling stations, burn their voter cards and electoral rolls.

In the first round, Mr Wade had polled 34.8% and Mr Sall came second with 26.6%. But most of the other 12 candidates backed Mr Sall in the second round, securing his victory.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) On Tuesday, House Republicans will take a crucial vote that will mark what the party is becoming at this crossroads in American history. President Donald Trump has invoked national emergency power to secure federal funds for a wall that Congress refused to pay for. He has done so based on an alleged crisis at the border that almost no reputable expert agrees is real.

""The President's actions are at odds with the overwhelming evidence in the public record, including the administration's own data and estimates,"" proclaimed 58 prominent ex-national security officials who oppose what the President is trying to do. They made this assertion -- to be entered into the Congressional Record -- in a 13-page joint statement issued Monday.

Even some Republican loyalists understand that if President Trump takes this step to finance a border wall, future presidents in both parties will have sufficient justification to enact policy to tackle their goals, including initiatives on climate change, without congressional support.

Congress has the power to stop President Trump if it wants to; it doesn't need the courts to step in. If the House and Senate vote for a resolution revoking this use of emergency power, with sufficient votes to override an expected presidential veto, Trump has to back down. Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976 , Congress gave itself the power to restrain the president.

But President Trump is tweeting out warnings to his fellow Republicans. ""I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,"" he tweeted Monday morning. In a follow up , he asked: ""Why on earth would any Republican vote not to put up a Wall or against Border Security. Please explain that to me?""

The good news for President Trump is that the odds are on his side. Most Republicans won't go along with Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Although a handful of Republicans have indicated they opposed the emergency declaration, most have not. The Democratic-controlled House is expected to pass legislation reversing Trump's emergency order, but it is not even likely that the resolution will make its way through the Senate, where the Republicans hold power.

This vote is the latest in a series of critical moments since January 2017 in which congressional Republicans have shown themselves to be the foundation of the Trump presidency rather than passive bystanders. Republicans have made active decisions that strengthened the President's hand or allowed him to use his authority in unprecedented fashion because it seemed to serve their political interest.

When Republicans did not censure President Trump after his stunning failure to fully condemn the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, the party showed that it had the President's back . When the party ended his controversial first year by voting in favor of Trump's massive corporate tax cut, it handed him a crucial legislative victory at a key point in his presidency -- one that greatly improved his standing with the Republican electorate.

When then-House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes released a memo making pointed accusations about the motives of the FBI, he and the Republicans on his committee joined in on the President's ongoing assault on law enforcement institutions -- an apparent attempt to discredit the investigations into his campaign and presidency.

Most recently, the Republicans allowed President Trump to shut down the federal government for the longest period in American history , even though the Senate had reached an agreement over the budget, so that the administration could score political points with the base. Government workers went without pay so that the party could start setting up for the 2020 campaign.

In announcing the deal to reopen the government, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced his support for the President turning to emergency power -- only days after expressing his staunch opposition to such a move.

This week's vote might be the most important of all these enabling moments. If the Republicans don't vote to stand between Trump and this aggressive use of presidential power, they are giving consent to the President to unilaterally siphon money from programs that Congress has funded into a program that Congress refused to support.

It’s a marriage that reached its peak during the presidency of Barack Obama.

She isn’t the only Democrat running for president with a critique of Big Tech. In fact, every major 2020 Democratic presidential candidate has issued some form of statement critical of the industry or introduced legislation that would crack down on its most abusive practices.

“For too long the big tech companies have been telling you, ‘Don’t worry! We’ve got your back!’ while your identities are being stolen and your data is mined,” Klobuchar said.

When Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) announced her candidacy for the 2020 Democratic Party presidential nomination, she did something that would have been unheard of in previous election cycles: She explicitly criticized Silicon Valley’s big technology companies.

Stephen Maturen via Getty Images Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) criticized the tech industry when she announced her bid for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.

Obama was the first president who really got Silicon Valley ― and Silicon Valley got him. He brought tech insiders to Washington to bring their new ideas into government and streamline inefficient and outdated government technology infrastructure. And political hands went through the revolving door to work for those same tech companies.

Hillary Clinton, Obama’s first secretary of state and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, made technology and the internet a central part of her foreign policy, advocating that tech adoption would advance democracy. Her presidential campaign’s tech policy was a “love letter to Silicon Valley,” according to Recode.

“Now, that’s over,” said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, an anti-monopoly think tank that has called for the government to break up Google, Facebook and Amazon. “Nobody thinks Big Tech is generally good ― or everybody has to at least acknowledge that they’re a problem. Nobody can say we need more Google in government.”

The Democratic Party’s diversion from Silicon Valley veneration to pointed criticism has coincided with a so-called “Techlash” ― the public backlash against tech industry abuses of user privacy, consumer protection and, most importantly, their market position.

Congress has spotlighted these abuses in a series of hearings over the past two years. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives faced questions from lawmakers about a range of issues, from foreign countries using their platforms to manipulate U.S. political sentiment to the failure to protect user privacy to whether or not the companies constituted monopolies.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), one leading Democratic presidential candidate, was out ahead of the pack in 2016 with a stinging critique of Big Tech.

She criticized Google, Apple and Amazon for using their platforms as “a tool to snuff out competition” and compared the tech giants to “too big to fail” financial institutions at an event at the New America Foundation, the Google-funded think tank whose then-chairman was ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The speech launched a row where Google complained to the think tank about the speech and eventually led to the expulsion of antitrust scholars there who would go on to found the Open Markets Institute.

Warren’s call for greater antitrust scrutiny of giant tech companies helped inform the Democratic Party’s adoption of anti-monopoly policies in its 2018 campaign platform. And many of her fellow candidates have since echoed her concerns.

Klobuchar has led on these anti-monopoly issues in the Senate from her perch as the ranking member on the antitrust subcommittee. She introduced legislation in 2017 that would ban companies with market capitalization above $100 billion from making any new acquisitions. While not specifically targeting Silicon Valley, the market cap limit in her bill would include the Big Four tech giants ― Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who announced his presidential bid on Tuesday, previously released a set of videos featuring Stacy Mitchell, an antitrust expert at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, explaining the impact of Amazon’s monopoly power.

Even 2020 candidates with strong tech ties like Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) have changed their tone. Booker has close ties to the industry from his time at Stanford University, raised $100 million in charitable donations from Facebook’s Zuckerberg to the Newark public school system, and previously ran a tech start-up. But he is now calling for regulators to consider breaking up companies like Google and criticized Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods.",It Won’t Be A Lovefest For Democrats And Silicon Valley in 2020,Huffpost.com,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democrats-2020-silicon-valley_n_5c6dd969e4b0e37a1ed48ff7

The discussion about moving American politics beyond the two-party system needs to become much more serious.

This thought is spurred by two factors: The decision by Grant Woods not to run for U.S. Senate. And the unappetizing choice the two parties are likely to offer for president in 2020.

Woods has been a close personal friend for five decades. Politically, however, we disagree at least as much as we agree. These days, probably more. So, this isn’t a brief that Woods should be our next senator.

But he is an appealing political persona, as evidenced by having been elected attorney general while in his 30s. Woods is a gifted orator, as the country learned from his eulogy for John McCain. And his comic skills are worthy of a professional.

His policy positions are best described as eclectic. He doesn’t have an ideological lens through which he views issues. He sort of picks and chooses as he goes along.

There are moments, and this may be one of them, when that fits the mood of the electorate. Woods would have a realistic chance of winning a general election for U.S. Senate.

But he does not have a realistic chance of winning either a Republican or Democratic primary for such.

Independent candidates aren't the solution

CLOSE The current system produces candidates that don't reflect what most voters want. That's a problem, azcentral columnist Robert Robb says. Diana Payan, The Republic | azcentral.com

He could run as an independent. That’s a steep hill. And a serious independent challenger in any race means that whoever wins will undoubtedly receive less than a majority of the votes.

Being governed by a plurality rather than a majority erodes legitimacy. More independent candidates isn’t a solution to the structural problem of a nominating system that precludes candidates voters might prefer.

Former Phoenix Mayor Paul Johnson, who also finds himself in no-man’s land in the two-party system, has championed the idea of a top-two primary. All candidates of all parties, and of no party, would run against each other in the primary. The top two vote-getters would run against each other in the general election. Someone like Woods would have a chance to make it to the finals in such a system.

Unfortunately, Johnson, so far, hasn’t been willing to go whole-hog and make the system entirely non-partisan, without party labels on the ballot. If there are party labels on the ballot, parties should have a say in who gets to run under their banner.

It’s more difficult to envision a way out of the two-party trap at the national level.

National choices are even more unappetizing

Unless the Mueller investigation turns up more than expected, Trump will undoubtedly be the Republican nominee.

It seems inevitable that the Democrats will nominate someone who proposes adopting European-style social democracy in this country. That means a gigantic expansion of the welfare state and massively greater government intervention in the economy.

A continuation of Trump or European-style social democracy probably isn’t the choice a majority of voters would like to see.

Starbucks honcho Howard Schultz is mulling an independent run. He professes to be economically conservative but socially liberal. That’s the largest voting bloc that doesn’t fit comfortably in either party.

Schultz could throw the election to the House

I think that Schultz has the potential to be more than just a spoiler, siphoning off anti-Trump votes from the Democratic nominee. In this crazy political environment, and with what the Democrats are likely to offer, an independent candidate has a chance to be a contender.

But if Schultz could actually win some states, that would mean, realistically, that no candidate would obtain an electoral college majority. That would throw the election into the House of Representatives. Which in turn means that the presidential race would actually be decided by the outcome in swing congressional districts.

Wouldn’t that be lovely.

I’ve ruminated about a multiparty national system with a French-style runoff election. But it’s difficult to envision how to get from what we have to that or any other alternative.

Such visioning needs to start occurring, with some urgency. What we have isn’t working.

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said Monday that he would support Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and the founder of Bloomberg LP, if he were to run for president.

Buffett made the comments on Monday morning in an interview on CNBC's Squawk Box.

Both men are among the richest people in the world.

Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, said Monday that he would support Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and founder of Bloomberg LP, if he were to announce a 2020 presidential bid.

""If Mike Bloomberg announced tomorrow that he was a candidate, I would say, 'I'm for him,' and I think he would be a very good president,"" he said in an interview with CNBC's Becky Quick.

""He and I disagree on some things, but I think that he knows how to run things. I think that he's got the right goals for America, he understands people, he understands the market system, and he understands the problems of people that don't fit well into the market system.""

Buffett, who on Saturday released his annual letter to shareholders, told CNBC that he wasn't a Democrat through and through, though over the last three decades he's voted for more Democrats than Republicans.

""I'm not a card-carrying Democratic, but I never have been,"" Buffett said. ""I've voted for a fair number of Republicans, I've given money to Republicans.""

Both Buffett and Bloomberg are among the richest people in the world, according to Forbes. Buffett's net worth, as of Forbes' 2018 ranking, was $84 billion, while Bloomberg's was $50 billion.

While it's long been rumored that Bloomberg would run for the highest US office, he told the Associated Press in early February that he would decide by the end of this month if he would enter the race. He officially registered as a Democrat — again — last October.

Bloomberg has rejected the notion that he likely wouldn't enter the 2020 presidential race if Joe Biden, the former vice president, announced a bid.

""My decision doesn't depend on what other people are going to do,"" Bloomberg told the AP. ""My decision depends on whether or not I think I can make a difference.""

In his interview with CNBC Buffett also voiced his displeasure about Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, announcing he would consider running for president in the upcoming election.

""If he ran as an independent, I think he would take votes away from any Democrat, including Bloomberg, if he were running, so I think it would be a real mistake for him to run,"" Buffett said. ""I think, generally, third-party candidates, they're going to hurt one side or the other, and they're more likely to hurt the side that they actually favor, because they're closer to that view.""

He added: ""I hope no third-party candidate runs that pulls any significant amount of votes. I mean, there will always be a couple of people that file, but I think third-party candidates can thwart, actually, the will of the people.""

199,Empty,2019-02-25T13:35:03Z,Britain's parliament last month demanded Prime Minister Theresa May renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal that the other members of the European Union say they will not reopen.,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s parliament last month demanded Prime Minister Theresa May renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal that the other members of the European Union say they will not reopen.

With just 32 days until the United Kingdom is due by law to leave the EU, the options include a disorderly Brexit, a delay to Brexit or no Brexit at all.

May is pursuing a renegotiated deal, but faces a growing threat that she will need to choose to delay Brexit or be forced to do so by British lawmakers.

Below is a summary of what is due to happen next:

“HIGH NOON”- FEB. 27

On Tuesday, May will make a statement updating lawmakers on her progress and lawmakers will have an opportunity on Wednesday to debate and vote on the way forward.

Several lawmakers in May’s Conservative Party, including some ministers, have indicated this will be the last chance they give her to find a way through the impasse.

Opposition Labour Party lawmaker Yvette Cooper plans to use that debate to seek lawmakers’ support for legislation that would force the government to decide between leaving without a deal or extending the Article 50 negotiation period if it has not had a deal approved by March 13.

VOTE ON A REVISED DEAL - BY MARCH 12

May has promised to bring back a revised deal to parliament and hold a vote on whether to approve it by March 12.

Before a vote on the exit agreement in January, which May lost heavily, parliament held five days of debate. It is not clear whether there would be another lengthy debate this time.

May is required by law to get parliamentary approval for any exit deal.

EU SUMMIT - MARCH 21-22

EU leaders are due to meet in Brussels. This could be an opportunity for an eleventh-hour deal or it would be the last chance to agree an extension of the Article 50 negotiation period and delay Brexit to avoid no-deal disruption. If the summit goes badly and there is still no deal in sight then May will have to decide whether to delay or go for a no-deal Brexit.

LAST WEEKEND - MARCH 23-24

If a deal is seen as viable at the summit, officials could work through the weekend to nail down the details with a final deal - and a possible extension to June 30 conditional on British parliamentary approval - announced on Sunday, March 24-Monday, March 25.

FINAL WEEK - MARCH 25-29

If a deal could be clinched, then the British parliament could vote on it, possibly on March 26. The European Parliament could ratify the deal that week.

EXIT DAY - MARCH 29?

If May does not get a deal approved by parliament by March 29, Britain faces a disorderly exit or may be forced to seek an extension of Article 50 to give more time to reach an agreement. It is not certain the EU would agree to this.

Some lawmakers, including opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, have said it is now “inevitable” that the government will have to seek an extension, as there will not be enough time to pass the legislation for Britain’s exit before March 29.

The leader of Britain’s lower house of parliament, Andrea Leadsom, has said the date might need to be pushed back by a couple of weeks.

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS

The bloc will vote to elect a new European Parliament on May 23-26. The new chamber would sit from July 2, a date that is shaping up to be the EU’s limit for any extension of Article 50.

The EU says Britain would have to organize European Parliament elections on its soil if it were to delay Brexit beyond that as otherwise its people would be deprived of their democratic representation while still being in the EU. The bloc fears Britain would not do that.

Some in the EU also fear that, should Britain vote, it would elect a staunchly eurosceptic representation to the European Parliament that is already expected to have a larger contingent of EU critics influencing the bloc’s policies.

The main centre-right group, whose leaders include German Chancellor Angela Merkel, could also lose its place as the biggest in the European Parliament; UK Labour seats could help the European Socialists overtake the People’s Party, from which British Conservatives broke away to sit separately.

DELAYED BREXIT - JUNE 30 OR LATER

If a Brexit extension is sought, one date being talked about in Brussels is June 30, the Sunday before the new European Parliament sits at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) on July 2. Some argue for an exit before May 23, the day Britain would otherwise be due to hold an EU election.",Factbox: Through the Brexit Looking Glass - What happens next?,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-whatnext-factbox-idUSKCN1QE1P3

According to …","How bold is Pete Buttigieg willing to go? Joshua Lott/Getty Images

Pete Buttigieg is having a hard time getting noticed. One month after launching his presidential campaign, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, remains little more than a hard-to-pronounce afterthought in a field that is getting deeper by the week. According to the most recent polling from Morning Consult, 62 percent of Democrats say they’ve never heard of Buttigieg, while nearly half of those who do know his name say they haven’t heard enough to form an opinion. The top-line numbers are more daunting still: Buttigieg polls at 0 percent—as in zero, nada, nothing—among Democrats, both nationally and in the early nominating states.

This problem is not unique to Buttigieg, as everyone from former Rep. John Delaney to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand can attest. The former launched his presidential campaign 18 months ago and, like Buttigieg, fails to crack the margin of error in most national polls. The latter is a powerful senator from New York and yet sits at just 1 percent in the Morning Consult survey and no longer even merits a mention on RealClearPolitics’ 2020 aggregate page that runs nearly a dozen names deep. Everyone outside of the top tier faces the same immediate problem: How do you stand out in a year when the Democratic field is both so deep and so wide?

Buttigieg’s predicament is particularly illustrative. If elected, the former Rhodes scholar and Navy veteran would become both the nation’s youngest president and its first openly gay one, but he’s hardly the only candidate with such history-making potential. In the past, calling for a radical reimagination of the U.S. economy would surely get you noticed; this year, even the self-styled pragmatists in the race are willing to talk about it. Buttigieg is arguably best known for the fact that most everyone mangles his name, but even on that quality he has plenty of competition among the 2020 field.

Buttigieg, though, may have found the tiniest of openings this week—perhaps by accident.

During an event Tuesday in Philadelphia, an audience member asked him whether, if elected, he would be willing to pack the Supreme Court with liberal justices in response to the high court’s recent shift rightward. “I have not reached a considered position on the question of court-packing,” Buttigieg said over a few nervous-sounding laughs in the crowd. “Although I don’t think we should be laughing at it. Because in some ways it’s no more a shattering of norms than what’s already been done to get the judiciary to where it is today.”

It was an off-the-cuff, noncommittal answer, and yet it generated small but noticeable excitement in some corners of the internet. The 1/20/21 Project, a court-packing campaign with the backing of people like Harvard law professors Laurence Tribe and Mark Tushnet, celebrated the answer, as did NARAL president Ilyse Hogue. Progressive outlets like Common Dreams and Daily Kos likewise reacted positively, and ThinkProgress even went as far as to declare that Buttigieg had proved himself the only Democrat in the race who “seems serious about governing.”

Yes, @PeteButtigieg DID say that he is open to court packing! #PackTheCourts pic.twitter.com/JDJTQajCpu — Pack The Courts (@PackSCOTUS) February 20, 2019

A few tweets and effusive blog posts won’t turn Buttigieg into a national figure, but they do suggest that, even in a field that is proposing bold policies on everything from day care to climate change, there’s still room for a candidate to go big in other, less obvious areas. Buttigieg’s full answer, which didn’t make it into the clip originally shared online, points to a few such directions he might consider:

So, I have not reached a considered position on the question of court-packing—although I don’t think we should be laughing at it. Because in some ways it’s no more a shattering of norms than what’s already been done to get the judiciary to where it is today. I will say some of things I have decided I am prepared to advocate for are in the spirit of acknowledging bold reforms are needed—not just getting money out of politics, which we gotta do, not just redistricting, which we gotta do, but things that might require constitutional action, which interestingly, the court-packing would not, but things like, questioning whether it really makes sense to have an Electoral College that twice in my lifetime has overruled the American people. Asking whether it makes sense to continue to go on with fellow American citizens in places like D.C. and Puerto Rico denied full political representation. And the reality is you might not be able to end Citizens United without constitutional action. The reason I think it’s important to bring things up like this—part of this is maybe just a Hoosier streak, that 50 years ago, my home state senator, Birch Bayh, was authoring several constitutional amendments: The 25th amendment, which might come in handy one day, the lowering of the voting age, the Equal Rights Amendment, which sadly did not make it but should have. And we need to set that as the level of intellectual and policy ambition that we have, which does not come naturally to our party lately. So I haven’t reached a considered opinion on that one yet, but I do think very bold, very ambitious ideas deserve a hearing right now.

That’s a long answer bookended by I-have-no-official-position-on-court-packing caveats, but in between Buttigieg brings up the possibility of abolishing the Electoral College and granting statehood to Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. He’s “just asking” whether doing either “makes sense,” but if he’s ever ready to answer those questions in the affirmative, his campaign would instantly become impossible to ignore. Support for deciding the presidency by popular vote, for instance, has been on the rise since 2000, and one major poll from last summer found 81 percent of Democrats prefer that system to the Electoral College. Packing the courts or adding states to the union would be tougher sells, but they both have a sizable group of supporters—something Buttigieg hopes he can say for himself someday.",Pete Buttigieg May Have Just Found a Way to Get Noticed in the Crowded Democratic Primary,Slate.com,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/pete-buttigieg-court-packing-electoral-college.html

The election trolls have logged on. Except, despite the cleanup efforts of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube following the 2016 campaign, they never really logged off, with coordinated disinformation campaigns still trying to sow confusion on social media during the 2018 midterms. But now they’re getting ready for the big show. With 12 Democratic candidates already vying for the White House and more to come, memes and misinformation that appear to be coordinated and possibly connected to foreign propaganda efforts are already afflicting the race. According to a report Wednesday in Politico, Democratic contenders have been the targets of online propaganda aimed at sensationalizing missteps and promoting falsehoods. If these troll campaigns share a goal with the efforts of 2016 and 2018, then the point may be to widen societal divisions already prominent in American life and, in particular, weaken the Democratic Party. In particular, they seem intent on weaponizing a productive moment in our politics in which public figures are finally being held to account for their past actions, and Democrats are sometimes asking other Democrats to resign. The trolls want Democrats to eat each other.

So far, we don’t know the source of this activity—it’s not clearly linked to the Internet Research Agency, the Russian disinformation factory that was behind thousands of accounts stirring unrest during the 2016 and 2018 elections. Wherever it’s from, what has been found so far does appear to be coordinated and bears many of the traits of past foreign operations. Politico analyzed data collected by a group called Guardians.ai, a firm that specializes in protecting pro-democracy groups from cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns. Guardians.ai analyzed a network of 200 Twitter accounts that were active “in one of the largest influence operations of the 2018 cycle” in churning out extreme and divisive content, some of which displayed signs of automation. Looking at those same accounts again, the group found that since the start of this year, the network pivoted to focus on Sens. Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren as well as former Rep. Beto O’Rourke. The researchers found that over the course of 30 days this year, between 2 and 15 percent of all Twitter mentions of the four Democratic politicians originated from this network. In other words, a group of trolls that stirred the pot during the midterms is very, very busy once again.

Take one recent rumor that was boosted by the apparent troll network on social media, accusing Warren of having a piece of racist memorabilia on top of her kitchen cabinet. The meme was a blurry screenshot from a Warren Q&A on Instagram Live that posters claimed contained a Sambo figure biting into a piece of watermelon. The allegation was promoted by right-wing pundits on Twitter and Facebook—until it was debunked. It turns out the knick-knack wasn’t a racist memento at all, but rather “an ordinary reproduction of a Greek vase,” according to Snopes. The false allegation was shared on the New York City Republicans Facebook page in a now-deleted post, according to PolitiFact. The meme later traveled far enough that Warren’s campaign felt the need to debunk the claim on her campaign website. The intent was obvious, and it dovetailed with Warren’s cringe-worthy attempts to prove her Native American ancestry last year: The trolls didn’t just want Warren to look like she’s tin-eared on race, but like an actual racist.

This example of disinformation appears to have been initially promoted on the anonymous, anything-goes message board 4Chan—often an early stop of any effort to spread misinformation online—though it’s not clear who planted the meme or what their motivation was, other than adding to a narrative that paints Warren as racist. Right now, candidates on the left are particularly susceptible to such character attacks—if they are true, after all, they might be disqualifying. Beto O’Rourke was also targeted on Twitter by an account that had only tweeted once since it was created in May 2018. That one tweet, however, carried the allegation that the Texas politician once left a message on an answering machine in the 1990s that contained racist language. The single missive was quickly amplified by other accounts and reached as any as 1.3 million people, Politico reported.

These troll efforts aren’t only trying to smear candidates using issues of concern to the left—sometimes they’re just sexist and racist. Sen. Harris appears to be a favorite early target, according to Guardians.ai, which found that Harris attracted more activity on Twitter than any other Democratic presidential candidate in the 30-day period it studied. Days after Harris announced her candidacy, former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown wrote a terse op-ed for the San Francisco Chronicle admitting that he dated Harris, apparently because reporters had been calling him about it. That was on Jan 26, but even now, weeks later, chatter about their decades-old relationship is still proliferating on social media. On Facebook, videos made about their relationship have racked up hundreds of thousands of views, and on Twitter, replies to Harris’ tweets are saturated with lewd comments accusing Harris of using sex as a ladder to success.

Trolls of both foreign and domestic vintage helped make the 2016 election the cacophony we remember. Now, as candidates struggle to differentiate themselves at a time when voters on the left may punish a candidate who has crossed ethical lines, it’s safe to expect trolls on social media to play every misstep up to its fullest—potentially as part of another propaganda effort to ensure victory for Donald Trump. Even if a meme you see that disparages a Democratic candidate is based on truth, it’s important to remember that its goal might be to simply weaken Democrats by making candidates toxic for swaths of the left, and ultimately make 2020 a repeat of 2016.

""If Mike Bloomberg announced tomorrow that he was a candidate, I would say I'm for him,"" Buffett told Becky Quick in a ""Squawk Box"" Interview from Omaha, Nebraska. ""I think he would be a very good president.""

Buffett said he's never been a card-carrying Democrat, pointing out that he's voted for Democratic candidates and Republican candidates over the years. He said neither party has an edge on virtue.

Without elaborating, Buffett said he and Bloomberg disagree on some things.

However, he added, ""I think that he knows how to run things. I think he's got the right goals for America. He understands people. He understands the market system. And he understands the problems of people"" not in the market.

Bloomberg, 77, is seen as a possible 2020 candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Bloomberg ran as an independent during his last successful campaign, when was re-elected mayor for a third term in 2009. He was a Republican in his first two terms. Bloomberg switched his party affiliation from independent to Democrat in October.

In a recent email to CNBC, top Bloomberg advisor Howard Wolfson hinted at how much his boss would look to invest into his own potential campaign.

""Mike spent more than $100 million in his last mayor's race. Last time I looked, NYC is a fraction of the size of the country as a whole,"" Wolfson said.

For years, Bloomberg had flirted with an independent run for president. But he now believes it would be a mistake. In a January statement, after former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz floated a possible third-party run, Bloomberg said, ""In 2020, the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the president. That's a risk I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford to run it now.""

In Monday's interview, Buffett said he agrees with Bloomberg that a Schultz third-party would take votes away from any Democrat.

Making no evaluation of Schultz as a potential candidate, Buffett added, ""I think generally [that] third-party candidates, they're going to hurt one side or the other, and they're more likely to hurt the side that they actually favor, because they're closer to that view, and so they pull more people away that would otherwise go with the second-best with that view.""

""So I hope no third-party candidate runs,"" he added. ""I think third-party candidates can thwart, actually, the will of the people.""

Buffett was interviewed from the floor of the Berkshire-owned Nebraska Furniture Mart, following Saturday's release of his widely read annual shareholder letter.

Correction: This story was revised to correct when Bloomberg registered as a Democrat. It was last year.

Ms Ocasio-Cortez addressed criticism she has faced from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress at a New York Hall of Science event.

“You know what? I don’t care anymore, because at least I’m trying and they’re not,” she said.

“I just introduced the Green New Deal two weeks ago and it’s creating all of this conversation, why? Because no one else has even tried.”

Her comments came during a discussion with Girls Who Code founder Reshma Saujani and young women of colour who have designed apps which address social issues.

Critics have claimed the Green New Deal resolution is too extreme and unworkable, with Donald Trump incorrectly suggesting it would “permanently eliminate all planes, cars, cows, oil, gas and the military”.

Ms Ocasio-Cortez added: “So people are like ‘Oh it’s unrealistic, oh it’s vague, oh it doesn’t address this little minute thing’ and I’m like ‘You try! You do it!’ Because you’re not, so until you do it, I’m the boss, How about that?”

The resolution, which has been proposed by Ms Ocasio-Cortez and senator Edward J Markey, sets out broad changes to American society which aim to reduce the effects of climate change.

It includes key goals of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero over 10 years and 100 per cent renewable energy in the US by 2030.

The proposal currently has the support of major Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand.

Senator Amy Klobuchar has said she would vote for the non-binding resolution but suggested she would oppose certain elements of the proposal when it came to the details of legislation.

Former vice president Al Gore and former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon have also supported the idea in principle.





However, the resolution has faced opposition from fellow Democrats, such as California senator Dianne Feinstein.

Ms Feinstein was recently filmed arguing with a group of school children over the proposal, saying she could not support it because “there’s no way to pay for it”.

“I’ve been doing this for 30 years. I know what I’m doing,” she said.

“You come in here and you say it has to be my way or the highway. I don’t respond to that.”

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has said he intends to bring forward a vote on the Green New Deal, which would force Democrats to formally decide whether to back the proposal.

The resolution is not expected to pass the Senate, which is controlled by a Republican majority, and the planned vote has been criticised by Democratic leader Chuck Schumer as a ""cynical ploy"" to split the party.",Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez delivers impassioned response to critics: 'I'm the boss.

205,Empty,2019-02-21T16:55:00Z,The challenges for his campaign are very familiar ones.,"That could muffle the contest’s impact: Though Scala, like many strategists already working on the race, considers it highly likely that New Hampshire will settle the competition between Sanders and Warren, if other candidates, the media, and voters in subsequent states downplay the New Hampshire results, that would dilute the state’s traditional role in winnowing the field. And that would increase the odds that three or more candidates could remain viable well into the primary process—a dynamic Democrats have not experienced since the 1980s.

But for all his influence, Sanders still faces huge obstacles in his second bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Key among them is a history of resistance in 2016 from core groups in the party, including African Americans and voters who identify as partisan Democrats.

Read: Bernie Sanders is the Democratic front-runner

Sanders this week quickly demonstrated his greatest asset as a candidate: a passionate grassroots following that includes a massive base of small-dollar online donors. On Wednesday he reported that, in the first 24 hours after his announcement, he raised nearly $6 million online, far more than any of his rivals did after entering the race. He’s in a stronger position than in 2016, too, in the internal party debate. As Sanders noted in his announcement-day interview with CBS, more of the Democratic Party’s leaders, including several of his 2020 competitors, have moved toward positions he took in the last presidential campaign, supporting a single-payer health-care system and free four-year public college. “All of those ideas and many more are now part of the political mainstream,” Sanders crowed during the interview.

It’s unquestionable that more Democrats are supporting those ideas than when Sanders aired them in 2016. But all the policies remain contested: Klobuchar, for one, has already rejected both single-payer and free tuition. Other potential candidates targeting more moderate voters, such as Biden and several former governors eyeing the race, would be almost certain to follow. (It’s also worth noting that the Democratic-controlled House is unlikely to pass legislation on either matter.) Even some of the candidates who have echoed Sanders’s overall goals are likely to challenge some of his specific proposals as unaffordable or excessive, as Booker has done by rejecting Sanders’s call to virtually eliminate private health insurance.

In other words, Sanders hasn’t won the war of ideas in the party nearly as much as he’s suggested. In fact, he’s virtually certain to face tougher scrutiny over his agenda than he did in 2016, when Clinton made the misguided strategic choice not to criticize his proposals as undesirable or unaffordable, but only as unlikely to pass Congress. Sanders probably won’t receive such deference again.",Bernie Sanders Will Hit Huge Obstacles in 2020,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/bernie-sanderss-impact-2020-presidential-race/583321/

Near Baghouz (Syria) (AFP) - US-backed forces evacuated over 40 truckloads of people from the Islamic State group's last Syria redoubt on Monday, as they sought to clear out civilians before a final push to crush the jihadists.

The Syrian Democratic Forces has slowed down its offensive on the final pocket due to the presence of civilians, with just a scrap of the IS ""caliphate"" remaining from a territory that once spanned Syria and Iraq.

An AFP correspondent saw at least 46 trucks crammed with men, women and children approaching an SDF outpost, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of the jihadist bastion.

One vehicle was packed with women clad in black and men who covered their faces. Wounded people were also among the latest evacuees.

Holdout IS fighters and civilians, mostly relatives of jihadists, are trapped inside less than half a square kilometre in the village of Baghouz near the Iraqi border.

The Kurdish-led SDF evacuated nearly 5,000 men, women and children from the jihadist redoubt on Wednesday and Friday, but none over the weekend.

Earlier on Monday, SDF spokesman Mustefa Bali, said thousands remained inside the IS pocket.

""According to what we heard from those who have left, there are nearly 5,000 people still inside,"" Bali told AFP.

At the SDF screening point outside the village, SDF fighters expressed hopes Monday's arrivals would be the last.

""We want it to be over,"" one of them, 29-year-old Mazloum, told AFP.

""Every day we say today is the day but we hope it will all end today and not tomorrow,"" he said.

- 'Potent threat' -

Kurdish foreign affairs official Abdel Karim Omar said the SDF would announce the end of the IS proto-state ""in the next few days"".

""But this does not mean that we have eliminated terrorism, which must be eradicated at the roots,"" he said.

Beyond Baghouz, IS still has thousands of fighters and sleeper cells across several countries.

In Syria, it retains a presence in the vast Badia desert, and the jihadists have claimed deadly attacks in SDF-held territory.

Iraq's President Barham Saleh warned Monday the jihadist threat remains high, despite gains made against IS over the past year.

""We've seen in the past that the mission is yet to be accomplished,"" Saleh said in a Paris speech, evoking the infamous 2003 Iraq claim by former US president George W. Bush.

""You have many, many extremists in many pockets in Syria, causing a potent threat to Syria, Iraq and the Western world,"" he said.

- Secret transfers -

Thousands of suspected IS fighters have attempted to blend in with civilians fleeing the crumbling ""caliphate"".

According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, around 46,000 people, including thousands of jihadists, have streamed out of the Baghouz pocket since early December.

The SDF screens those exiting at an outpost outside the village to weed out potential IS fighters.

After being vetted, women, children, and men not suspected of belonging to the extremist group are transported north to the Kurdish-run camp of Al-Hol, while suspected jihadists are sent to SDF-held detention centres.

""The international community is not currently taking responsibility towards the large number of people leaving the last IS pocket, especially children,"" said Omar, describing Al-Hol as overwhelmed by the arrivals.

At least 78 people, mostly children, have died on the way to the camp or shortly after arriving in recent weeks, according to the International Rescue Committee.

The Observatory on Monday said 1,400 people, mainly IS relatives, were secretly transported from orchards on the outskirts of Baghouz to neighbouring Iraq during the past 24 hours.

Kurdish foreign affairs official did not confirm the transfer, but denied the SDF was responsible.

""In principle, we do not hand over any person passing through our territories to Iraqi authorities or any other party,"" Omar said.

Such transfers can only happen if they were trucked from Baghouz ""by another party"", he explained, without specifying.

Baghdad on Sunday said the SDF have transferred 280 Iraqi nationals accused of fighting alongside IS to Iraqi authorities.

The Iraqi president said Monday his country's courts would prosecute 13 suspected French jihadists, who were turned over to Iraq after being captured by the SDF.",Syria force carries out major evacuation from last IS holdout,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/syria-force-carries-major-evacuation-last-holdout-162952545.html

So far it has mostly been used to create altered pornographic clips featuring celebrity women’s faces but once the techniques are perfected, deepfake revenge porn purporting to show people cheating on their partners won’t be far behind.

But more than becoming a nasty tool for stalkers and harassers, deepfakes threaten to undermine trust in political institutions and society as a whole. The White House recently justified temporarily banning a reporter from its press conferences using reportedly sped up genuine footage of an incident involving the journalist. Imagine the implications of seeing ultra-realistic but artificial footage of government leaders planning assassinations, CEOs colluding with foreign agents or a renowned philanthropist abusing children.

So-called fake news has already increased many people’s scepticism towards politicians, journalists and other public figures. It is becoming so easy to create entirely fictional scenarios that we can no longer trust any video footage at face value. This threatens our political, legal and media systems, not to mention our personal relationships. We will need to create new forms of consensus on which to base our social reality. New ways of checking and distributing power – some political, some technological – could help us achieve this.

Fake scandals, fake politicians

Deepfakes are scary because they allow anyone’s image to be co-opted, and call into question our ability to trust what we see. One obvious use of deepfakes would be to falsely implicate people in scandals. Even if the incriminating footage is subsequently proven to be fake, the damage to the victim’s reputation may be impossible to repair. And politicians could tweak old footage of themselves to make it appear as if they had always supported something that had recently become popular, updating their positions in real time.

There could even be public figures who are entirely imaginary, original but not authentic. Meanwhile, video footage could become useless as evidence in court. Broadcast news could be reduced to people debating whether clips were authentic or not, using ever more complex AI to try to detect deepfakes.

But the arms race that already exists between fake content creators and those detecting or debunking disinformation (such as Facebook’s planned fake news “war room”) hides a deeper issue. The mere existence of deepfakes undermines confidence and trust, just as the possibility that an election was hacked brings the validity of the result into question.

While some people may be taken in by deepfakes, that is not the real problem. What is at stake is the underlying social structure in which we all agree that some form of truth exists, and the social realities that are based on this trust. It is not a matter of the end of truth, but the end of the belief in truth – a post-trust society. In the wake of massive disinformation, even honest public figures will be easily ignored or discredited. The traditional organizations that have supported and enabled consensus – government, the press – will no longer be fit for purpose.

Blockchain trust

New laws to regulate the use of deepfakes will be important for people who have damaging videos made of them. But policy and law alone will not save our systems of governance. We will need to develop new forms of consensus, new ways to agree on social situations based on alternative forms of trust.

One approach will be to decentralize trust, so that we no longer need a few institutions to guarantee whether information is genuine and can instead rely on multiple people or organizations with good reputations. One way to do this could be to use blockchain, the technology that powers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Blockchain works by creating a public ledger stored on multiple computers around the world at once and made tamper-proof by cryptography. Its algorithms enable the computers to agree on the validity of any changes to the ledger, making it much harder to record false information. In this way, trust is distributed between all the computers who can scrutinize each other, increasing accountability.

More democratic society

We can also look to more democratic forms of government and journalism. For example, liquid democracy allows voters to vote directly on each issue or temporarily assign their votes to delegates in a more flexible and accountable way than handing over full control to one party for years. This would allow the public to look to experts to make decisions for them where necessary but swiftly vote out politicians who disregarded their views or acted dishonestly, increasing trust and legitimacy in the political system.

In the press, we could move towards more collaborative and democratized news reporting. Traditional journalists could use the positive aspects of social media to gather information from a more diverse range of sources. These contributors could then discuss and help scrutinisz the story to build a consensus, improving the media’s reputation.

The problem with any system that relies on the reputation of key individuals to build trust is how to prevent that reputation from being misused or fraudulently damaged. Checks such as Twitter’s “blue tick” account verification for public figures can help, but better legal and technical protections are also needed: more protected rights to privacy, better responses to antisocial behavior online, and better privacy-enhancing technologies built in by design.

The potential ramifications of deepfakes should act as a call to action in redesigning systems of trust to be more open, more decentralized and more collective. And now is the time to start thinking about a different future for society.

In the U.S., there’s a lack of services and programs for adults with autism, a problem that looks to only get worse:

“About half a million people on the autism spectrum will legally become adults over the next decade, a swelling tide for which the country is unprepared. When they turn 21, these people leave behind all the programming and funding they received under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act and enter a labyrinth of government services that vary wildly from state to state. Although people with other disabilities face similar problems, the staggering rise in diagnoses of autism creates a distinctly troubling dilemma in how to ensure that these people receive proper care.”

For more than 150 years, scientists such as Tim Caro have been puzzled about one of the most distinctive animal features: zebra stripes.

“Some researchers have suggested that the stripes act as camouflage—they break up zebras’ outlines or resemble fields of tree trunks. But that can’t be true: Amanda Melin of the University of Calgary recently showed that lions and hyenas can’t even make out the stripes unless they get very close. Another hypothesis says that the black stripes heat up faster than the white ones, setting up circulating air currents that cool the zebras. But a recent study showed that water drums cloaked in zebra pelts heat up just as much as those covered in normal horse skins.”

209,Empty,2019-02-22T17:58:53Z,"Republicans in Utah, Michigan, Wisconsin and elsewhere didn't like what voters chose last year, so they're simply undoing it.","Last Election Day, 555,651 Utahns ― 53 percent of voters ― backed a measure to expand Medicaid to low-income adults in the state. Last Monday, 79 Republicans made it clear they don’t care what those voters wanted.

All but four GOP members of the Utah legislature voted to repeal the voter-approved initiative and replace it with a more limited plan. Their plan will cover an estimated 90,000 people instead of the approximately 150,000 who would have received health benefits under the ballot initiative. This action came soon after the Utah legislature also weakened a voter-backed policy allowing the use of medical marijuana in the state.

Republican state legislators voted to pass the final version of the Medicaid bill last Monday, and Gov. Gary Herbert (R) signed it hours later. Though Utah Republicans backed away from an earlier version of the legislation that could have resulted in no expansion at all, they nevertheless decided to overturn the will of their constituents almost immediately after convening for the 2019 legislative session.

Citizen activists who spent countless hours knocking on doors and gathering signatures to get Medicaid expansion on the ballot in Utah are, unsurprisingly, upset, said Chase Thomas, the executive director of Alliance for a Better Utah, a Salt Lake City-based government watchdog group. The organization was among the many in the state that endorsed the Medicaid expansion and participated in the campaign to get it before the voters.

“It’s been all over our Facebook page, our Twitter: People saying, ‘How does my vote even matter if they’re allowed to do this?’ saying, ‘What’s the point?’” Thomas said. “That’s completely understandable. I even feel that way, like, why even have an initiative process if the legislature’s allowed to gut it right afterwards?”

This sort of thing is becoming a habit for Republicans when elections don’t go their way.

As events in Utah demonstrate, elected Republicans don’t always let voters have the last word. And what’s happening in the Beehive State is part of a pattern for Republican elected officials across the country, a pattern that also includes changing the rules when members of their party lose elections, which has included erecting barriers to voting and other anti-democratic measures.

It all amounts to a sustained campaign by one of the nation’s two major political parties to shield itself from citizens, entrench its own power and use every tool at its disposal to disenfranchise the rival party and its voters.

The action in Utah came after the state legislature hemmed and hawed about Medicaid expansion for years without resolving the question. In Utah and four other states in 2017 and 2018, hundreds of volunteer and paid canvassers, supported by state and national political and business organizations, took matters into their own hands in response to inaction by state policymakers and organized campaigns to make change via the ballot.

Voters did the rest, approving Medicaid expansion initiatives in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah last year, following a successful campaign in Maine in 2017. A similar Medicaid expansion initiative failed in Montana last year.",The GOP Keeps Changing The Rules After It Loses Elections,Huffpost.com,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-gop-keeps-changing-the-rules-after-it-loses-elections_n_5c6f0cede4b0f40774cd7232

Wealthy donors were a big part of how Barack Obama became president. Employees of Goldman Sachs were rivaled only by those of the University of California in powering his record-breaking fundraising totals in 2008. As the insurgent candidate wrestled control of the Democratic Party from the establishment—including frontrunner Hillary Clinton—that year, his inspiring speeches and consistent opposition to the Iraq War were obviously defining elements of a historic candidacy. But so were the eye-popping donations. He broke and then broke again the records for fundraising in a given month, setting the tone for the general election against John McCain with a $66 million haul in August of that year. And while small-dollar donors and the activist base they symbolized were instrumental in his success, Obama also glad-handed at plenty of fancy, exclusive receptions for rich donors both during and after his 2008 victory.

For Democrats hoping to follow in his footsteps, that path toward victory now looks a lot less appealing.

When Bernie Sanders ran for president four years ago, he made a point of largely shunning traditional high-dollar fundraisers, insisting he didn't need or want billionaires' money. It also might have been true that he couldn't get it: The self-declared democratic socialist from Vermont wanted to break up big banks like Goldman, hike taxes on the rich, and dismantle some of the late capitalist infrastructure that he argued was behind soaring income inequality and a broken, for-profit healthcare system. Sanders actually did have the occasional supporter on Wall Street, but with populist anger at Obama's failure to prosecute bankers behind the financial crisis still raging, and the lingering effects of the mortgage crisis and Great Recession still tangible, Sanders could forgo the most lucrative fundraising events and rely on a steady stream of mostly online support from fans. That strategy already seems to be panning out for him this go-around: Sanders raised nearly $6 million in the first 24 hours after announcing his 2020 candidacy last week.

Now Elizabeth Warren is making a point of joining him on the high road. As the New York Times reported Monday, the 2020 contender announced she would skip private, VIP-style fundraisers. She also plans to avoid the ""call time,"" the term for the common practice of politicians working the phones to plead for money from rich people.

""That means no fancy receptions or big money fund-raisers only with people who can write the big checks,” Warren said in an email to her fans. “It means that wealthy donors won’t be able to purchase better seats or one-on-one time with me at our events.""

This makes sense given that Warren has for years positioned herself as opponent of the ultra-wealthy and Wall Street.

""Her ceasing VIP fundraisers with mega donors is consistent with the messaging she's been using in campaign, and at this early point in the race, the energy is focused on generating excitement from the base and distinguishing each candidate's campaign from the rest of the pack,"" said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the influence watchdog the Center for Responsive Politics.

As Krumholz noted, it's also fair to assume she isn't actually passing on all that much money here; the party's wealthiest donors might be predisposed to back, say, Kamala Harris, or Kirsten Gillibrand, or Cory Booker, or (if and when he gets in) Joe Biden. All of them have been dinged by the left for relatively neoliberal stances on some issues, even if they have also inched leftward and embraced policies like Medicare for all and the Green New Deal to stay abreast of activist orthodoxy. (Gillibrand also declared she wasn't going to take money from corporate PACs, though she'll apparently still take money from individuals connected to the finance industry.)

Which brings us to what this is really about: Warren is sending a message, like the one Sanders has been sending for years now, to the party's most engaged partisans. After all, her move came just a week after the Times reported that a coterie of her rivals, including Amy Klobuchar, Sherrod Brown, and Cory Booker, ""auditioned"" before super-wealthy Obama donors, hoping to win their support.

It remains to be seen how much the larger universe of Democratic voters actually cares about who a candidate's donors are. But polling for years now has tended to find large majorities of Americans think the government is too focused on the needs of the rich and not enough on the poor and middle-class, and that money holds too much sway in their democracy.

Warren and Sanders are helping lay down a marker for their competitors, who will have to defend their own practices of holding fundraisers and taking money from industries the Democratic base isn't a fan of. Fundraising has been a consistent issue among those involved in Democratic politics, with a contentious fight over donations from the oil and gas industry unfolding last year in the Democratic National Committee. (The DNC ultimately decided to accept such donations.) In 2008, Obama made a show of skipping out on corporate PAC and lobbyist money, though he obviously wasn't actually missing out on all that much. In 2016, Clinton seemed to be on the side of accepting donations from anyone who would give them, leading to attacks from Trump about her family foundation's work and her paid speeches before audiences of bankers—even as he soaked up dark money donations from self-interested financial titans.

Whether Trump's attacks were fair, this time around the Democratic nominee may be someone who rejects the whole system of donors that Clinton was enmeshed in. If nothing else, the party is set for a real debate—with Warren and Sanders in particular poised to pressure their rivals—about who gets a voice in their government, and how much that voice costs them.

""It's a battle,"" Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, VICE contributor, and critic of the party's coziness with entrenched financial power, said in an email when I asked if Warren's move meant Obama donors were losing control of the party. ""To paraphrase Churchill: It isn't the beginning of the end, but it is the end of the beginning.""

From her ‘Green New Deal’ proposal to combat climate change to her clapbacks against Trump and her critics, here’s how AOC danced her way into the spotlight. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took on what her life could be like in another world, in another time where Donald Trump was not the president.

While appearing on the premiere of Showtime's new talk show ""Desus & Mero,"" Ocasio-Cortez was asked what she would have done if she hadn't decided to run for Congress, joining a large pool of women who ran in the midterms in direct response to Trump winning the 2016 election.

Mero asked if Trump hadn't become president, ""would you have run for Congress?""

""I don’t know!"" Ocasio-Cortez told the pair. ""I could just be like teaching in high school right now.""

She continued: ""But you know, times of great challenge can also bring out the best in people, too, and so I think that's what we're really seeing, even though things are hitting the fan right now, we're seeing people activate and educate themselves.""

Before running for Congress in New York's 14th district and beating out 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley, Ocasio-Cortez worked as a bartender at a restaurant. Her upset victory against Crowley gained national attention and put Ocasio-Cortez and some of her socialist policies, including a large hike in taxes on the wealthy and an ambitious idea to fight climate change, in the limelight.

Republicans have denounced the policies as radical and repeatedly pointed to socialist countries like Venezuela, which are failing and corrupt. They have pointed out the high taxpayer cost for her policies, including Medicare for All, and said her ideas seem to a glimpse at the future of the Democratic party.

She also joined the hosts in making fun of some of the memes that are often sent to her, dubbing them ""so weak.""

""It's like how do you have a computer that runs both Windows 95 and Twitter at the same time?"" she said, sparking laughs in the audience.

The party was ""broken"" and had been taken over by the ""hard left"", he told the Express & Star newspaper.

""The Labour Party has been my life, so this has been the hardest decision I have ever had to take, but I have to be honest and the truth is that I have become ashamed of the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn.""

Chris Christie blocked by issuing a scathing veto — that would prohibit candidates for president and vice president from appearing on the ballot unless they make their tax returns public.

Similar legislation has been introduced in at least 30 states but never enacted, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, meaning New Jersey would be the first to impose such a disclosure requirement if its measure is also approved by the Assembly and signed by Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat.

A spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, D-Middlesex, said the speaker would consult with his caucus about holding votes on the bill. Murphy’s office declined to comment when asked about the governor's position on the measure.

New Jersey's bill and the others like it, introduced in most cases by Democratic lawmakers angered by Trump's refusal to disclose information about his personal finances, have touched off a heated national debate over the constitutionality and appropriateness of such a law.

Supporters say states have room under the U.S. Constitution to create ballot access requirements and argue that voters should be able to review candidates’ tax returns in deciding whom to send to the White House.

“It is so obvious with this president that had voters known some of what seem to be his business interests, he may not have been elected president,” said state Sen. Loretta Weinberg, D-Bergen, a sponsor of the bill.

But critics say such a measure would be struck down by the courts and could lead to more demands on candidates in the future.

“Today we require tax returns, but what would be next?” former Gov. Jerry Brown of California, a Democrat, wrote in vetoing a similar measure in his state in 2017, according to The Associated Press. “Five years of health records? A certified birth certificate? High school report cards? And will these requirements vary depending on which political party is in power?”

“It’s just political pandering,” said John Carbone, an attorney specializing in election law at the Ridgewood firm Carbone & Faasse.

“They can impose no requirements for a candidate for federal office, let alone president,” Carbone added, referring to state lawmakers. “They’re thinking like Alabama Democrats during the Civil War: What can we do to get Lincoln?”

Trump’s tax returns have been a target of his opponents since the 2016 campaign. Trump, a Republican, broke with decades of precedent in refusing to release his taxes and has cited a “continuous” IRS audit when challenged on his insistence on withholding them.

Although they are not required to do so by law, presidential candidates in the past have released their tax returns as a matter of transparency so voters could learn about their financial status, business dealings and potential conflicts of interest.

Democrats who now control the U.S. House of Representatives are reportedly studying a century-old provision in the federal tax code to gain access to Trump’s tax returns and make them public. Separately, Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-Paterson, has introduced legislation to require presidents and presidential candidates to release their 10 most recent federal income tax returns.

The Democrats who control New Jersey’s Legislature are eyeing a different mechanism to force the disclosure, threatening to keep off the New Jersey ballot any candidate who does not share his or her five most recent tax returns at least 50 days before the 2020 general election.

The bill, S-119, would also prohibit New Jersey electors from voting for a non-compliant presidential or vice presidential candidate as part of the Electoral College process after a general election.

Whether that would hurt Trump is another story: New Jersey has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988.

Thursday's vote in the Senate was 23-11 and fell largely along party lines. One Democrat, Sen. Bob Andrzejczak of Cape May County, was opposed, while one Republican, Sen. Kip Bateman of Somerset County, was in favor.

The bill must still be approved by an Assembly committee and the full chamber before it can head to the governor's desk for final approval or a veto.

In his veto message in 2017, Christie, a Republican, blasted an earlier version of the bill as a “transparent political stunt” and said if lawmakers were really concerned about transparency, they would end the disclosure exemption for legislative records under the state’s Open Public Records Act. Democrats did not take Christie up on his suggestion.

In a similar spirit, state Sen. Joe Pennacchio, R-Morris, sought to amend the latest bill during Thursday’s Senate voting session to make it apply to all gubernatorial, state Senate and Assembly candidates as well as presidential and vice presidential candidates.

“What’s good for the goose is what’s good for the gander,” Pennacchio said in a statement explaining the move. “If this really is about making sure voters are well-informed, then common sense dictates that S-119 should apply to all of us.”

Democrats blocked the amendments.

214,Empty,2019-02-22T10:00:00Z,The Bulwark is on a mission to name and shame President Trump's most high-status supporters.,"Sykes admits that some of these early targets have constituted “low-hanging fruit.” But in the coming months, he tells me, The Bulwark will home in on a specific class of “grifters and trolls”—those opportunistic Trump enablers who still get invited on Meet the Press and write for prestigious newspapers. To Sykes, these are the true sellouts, and he wants to ensure that their public flirtations with Trumpism leave a stench on them.

“A lot of folks have had a free shot to get in bed with some of the most disreputable [people] out there, and they still have a veneer of respectability,” Sykes says. “We want to raise the opportunity cost.”

Asked for examples of prospective targets, Sykes doesn’t have to think long before rattling off a list of high-status commentators (Marc Thiessen, Hugh Hewitt), think tankers (Henry Olsen, Victor Davis Hanson), and politicos (Bill Bennett).

“The Sean Hannitys to me are not that offensive,” Sykes says of the Fox News Trump booster. “Because Sean Hannity is dumb as a box of rocks—he doesn’t know any better.” (Through a spokesperson, Hannity responded, “If Charlie and the rest of the sore-loser, establishment Never Trumpers had their way, Hillary would be president … I wish them well supporting the next radical socialist that runs for president.”)

Sykes says he is much more bothered by the writers and thinkers he used to respect—and he holds out hope that they can still be “salvaged.”

“This sounds naive, but I quite frankly feel they know better,” he tells me. “And at certain points of moral clarity, I could see them coming back to the faith of their fathers.”

Yet when I ask if he really believes The Bulwark’s coverage could be the catalyst that leads them back to the light, Sykes seems to second-guess himself.

“For me to think I’m going to psychologically change them … ” he pauses, and then shrugs wearily. “I don’t know. They may double down.”

Originally, The Bulwark was meant to be a simple news aggregator, a sort of Never Trump Drudge Report that compiled headlines and links from around the web. But that changed in December, when The Weekly Standard—the venerable conservative magazine that had emerged as a leading voice of the anti-Trump right—was abruptly shut down. Phil Anschutz, the Republican billionaire who owned the publication, had reportedly grown frustrated with its constant needling of the president.

Recognizing a void left in the conservative-media landscape, the Standard co-founder Bill Kristol—who had tried unsuccessfully to save the magazine—charged Sykes and a handful of laid-off writers and editors with beefing up The Bulwark with original content.

Kristol told me that he didn’t want to build a “Weekly Standard 2.0.” For all its esteem, it also carried a certain amount of baggage. “I think being a fresh upstart website, and not a magazine with years of relationships, has been a real asset,” he said. “At The Weekly Standard, we didn’t want to look like we were sniping too much at individuals … We didn’t want to waste our readers’ time worrying about various grifters. We liked to think we were publishing more important stuff.” In retrospect, Kristol conceded, “that may have been a mistake.”",The New Outlaws of Conservative Media,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/bulwarks-quest-shame-high-profile-trump-backers/583354/

Donna Shalala (D-FL) tells Politico","Florida Democrats are condemning Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for refusing to call Venezuela's socialist President Nicolás Maduro a dictator.

Sanders, the self-described ""democratic socialist,"" has not revealed whether he considers Venezuela's opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as the nation's interim president, which is the view of the U.S. and a host of European and Latin American countries.

Florida Democrats, according to new report from Politico, believe that Sanders' position will benefit President Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the Sunshine State. The president held a rally in Miami on Monday, where he denounced Maduro and socialism, in an attempt to appeal to the state's Venezuelan-American voters heading into the 2020 election. As Politico noted, many Venezuelans, who have experienced socialism first-hand, have moved to Florida as the country's economic and humanitarian turmoil worsened under Maduro.

Following Trump's Monday event, Democrats in Florida have expressed concern that Trump's attempt to solidify his Latino support could help him grab support from an otherwise-reliable Democratic voting block in the country's biggest swing state, where presidential races have been famously decided by razor-thin margins. They were quick to reject Sanders' comments.

""He is not going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party. He has demonstrated again that he does not understand this situation,"" Rep. Donna Shalala, a Miami Democrat who represents Venezuelan exiles, told Politico. ""I absolutely disagree with his imprecision in not saying Maduro must go."" (Shalala formerly served as secretary of Health and Human Services under former President Bill Clinton.)

Sanders did not embrace Maduro in his Tuesday interview with Univision's Jorge Ramos, who mentioned Guaidó being declared the interim president of Venezuela by the country's National Assembly following Maduro's contested election. However, when the Vermont Independent was asked whether he recognized Guaidó as the legitimate leader of the country, he answered, ""No.""

""There are serious questions about the recent election,"" Sanders added. ""There are many people who feel it was a fraudulent election.""

In a follow-up question, Ramos asked Sanders if he thought Maduro was a dictator who should step down. Sanders would not answer either ""yes"" or ""no.""

""I think clearly he has been very, very abusive,"" Sanders replied. ""That is a decision of the Venezuelan people, so I think, Jorge, there's got to be a free and fair election. But what must not happen is that the United States must not use military force and intervene again as it has done in the past in Latin America, as you recall, whether it was Chile, or Brazil, or the Dominican Republic or Guatemala.""

Sanders added that he believes ""the United States has got to work with the international community to make sure that there is a free and fair election in Venezuela.""

Meanwhile, Florida's Democratic Party has made its position on Maduro clear.

""Florida Democrats have been unequivocal: We recognize Juan Guaidó as the President of Venezuela, denounce the legitimacy of the Maduro regime and his efforts to remain illegally in power,"" the group said in a statement.

Christian Ulvert, one of the state's top Democratic consultants for Hispanic outreach, called Sanders comments ""extremely ignorant"" in an interview with Politico. He reportedly wrote to the Democratic National Committee chairman concerning the location of the party's 2020 presidential convention, noting that Trump was trying to make strides with South Florida's Hispanic community with his anti-socialism message, while Sanders was muddling that message.

""This helps Trump and it makes our job harder as Democrats,"" Ulvert said, according to Politico. ""What this will do is whip into a frenzy South Florida’s Hispanic community on both sides of the aisle. It’s an unnecessary distraction.""

The U.S. was the first to recognize Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela last month – and has suggested that it could use military force to ensure aid delivery or protect U.S. business interests. About 64 other nations have followed the U.S. in supporting Guaidó. The United Nations continues to recognize Maduro, although it has called for talks, as roughly 50-member nations have vowed to support Maduro, including U.S. political foes China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Syria.

The issue has entered the 2020 Democratic primary for president, with most candidates revealing their positions.

Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, along with former Vice President Joe Biden and former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland have affirmed their support of Guaidó as the legitimate leader of Venezuela. Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said ""Maduro is obviously a dictator"" and suggested she approved of the ""diplomatic part"" of Trump's support of Guaidó, although she criticized his ""saber rattling."" And Hawaii's Democratic Congresswoman and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard said the U.S. should not ""go in and choose who should be the leader of Venezuela. That is not something that serves the interests of the Venezuelan people.""

South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio did not reveal their views on recognizing Guaidó but called for free and fair elections in Venezuela. Sen.

In January, Greece ratified an agreement with the newly renamed Republic of North Macedonia. There are some who argue this is the first step towards recognising the existence of a Macedonian language and ethnicity - and yet Greece has denied the existence of its own Macedonian minority for decades, says Maria Margaronis. Will something now change?

Mr Fokas, 92, stands straight as a spear in his tan leather brogues and cream blazer, barely leaning on the ebony and ivory cane brought from Romania by his grandfather a century ago. His mind and his memory are as sharp as his outfit.

A retired lawyer, Mr Fokas speaks impeccable formal Greek with a distinctive lilt: his mother tongue is Macedonian, a Slavic language related to Bulgarian and spoken in this part of the Balkans for centuries. At his son's modern house in a village in northern Greece, he takes me through the painful history of Greece's unrecognised Slavic-speaking minority.

Mr Fokas takes care to emphasise from the start that he is both an ethnic Macedonian and a Greek patriot. He has good reason to underline his loyalty: for almost a century, ethnic Macedonians in Greece have been objects of suspicion and, at times, persecution, even as their presence has been denied by almost everyone.

Most are reluctant to speak to outsiders about their identity. To themselves and others, they're known simply as ""locals"" (dopyi), who speak a language called ""local"" (dopya). They are entirely absent from school history textbooks, have not featured in censuses since 1951 (when they were only patchily recorded, and referred to simply as ""Slavic-speakers""), and are barely mentioned in public. Most Greeks don't even know that they exist.

That erasure was one reason for Greece's long-running dispute with the former Yugoslav republic now officially called the Republic of North Macedonia. The dispute was finally resolved last month by a vote in the Greek parliament ratifying (by a majority of just seven) an agreement made last June by the countries' two prime ministers. When the Greek Prime Minster, Alexis Tsipras, referred during the parliamentary debate to the existence of ""Slavomacedonians"" in Greece - at the time of World War Two - he was breaking a long-standing taboo.

The use of the name ""Macedonia"" by the neighbouring nation state implicitly acknowledges that Macedonians are a people in their own right, and opens the door to hard questions about the history of Greece's own Macedonian minority.

When Mr Fokas was born, the northern Greek region of Macedonia had only recently been annexed by the Greek state. Until 1913 it was part of the Ottoman Empire, with Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia all wooing its Slavic-speaking inhabitants as a means to claiming the territory. It was partly in reaction to those competing forces that a distinctive Slav Macedonian identity emerged in the late 19th and early 20th Century. As Mr Fokas's uncle used to say, the family was ""neither Serb, nor Greek, nor Bulgarian, but Macedonian Orthodox"".

In the end, the Slav Macedonians found themselves divided between those three new states. In Greece, some were expelled; those who remained were pushed to assimilate. All villages and towns with non-Greek names were given new ones, chosen by a committee of scholars in the late 1920s, though almost a century later some ""locals"" still use the old ones.

In 1936, when Mr Fokas was nine years old, the Greek dictator Ioannis Metaxas (an admirer of Mussolini) banned the Macedonian language, and forced Macedonian-speakers to change their names to Greek ones.

Mr Fokas remembers policemen eavesdropping on mourners at funerals and listening at windows to catch anyone speaking or singing in the forbidden tongue. There were lawsuits, threats and beatings.

Women - who often spoke no Greek - would cover their mouths with their headscarves to muffle their speech, but Mr Fokas's mother was arrested and fined 250 drachmas, a big sum back then.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Macedonian villagers in Greece in 1947

""Slavic-speakers suffered a lot from the Greeks under Metaxas,"" he says. ""Twenty people from this village, the heads of the big families, were exiled to the island of Chios. My father-in-law was one of them."" They were tortured by being forced to drink castor oil, a powerful laxative.

When Germany, Italy and Bulgaria invaded Greece in 1941, some Slavic-speakers welcomed the Bulgarians as potential liberators from Metaxas's repressive regime. But many soon joined the resistance, led by the Communist Party (which at that time supported the Macedonian minority) and continued fighting with the Communists in the civil war that followed the Axis occupation. (Bulgaria annexed the eastern part of Greek Macedonia from 1941 to 1944, committing many atrocities; many Greeks wrongly attribute these to Macedonians, whom they identify as Bulgarians.)

When the Communists were finally defeated, severe reprisals followed for anyone associated with the resistance or the left.

""Macedonians paid more than anyone for the civil war,"" Mr Fokas says. ""Eight people were court-martialled and executed from this village, eight from the next village, 23 from the one opposite. They killed a grandfather and his grandson, just 18 years old.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A Greek protester wears a Balkan War uniform to oppose the agreement on ""North Macedonia""

Mr Fokas was a student in Thessaloniki then - but he too was arrested and spent three years on the prison island of Makronisos, not because of anything he'd done but because his mother had helped her brother-in-law escape through the skylight of a cafe where he was being held.

Most of the prisoners on Makronisos were Greek leftists, and were pressed to sign declarations of repentance for their alleged Communist past. Those who refused were made to crawl under barbed wire, or beaten with thick bamboo canes. ""Terrible things were done,"" Mr Fokas says. ""But we mustn't talk about them. It's an insult to Greek civilisation. It harms Greece's good name.""

Tens of thousands of fighters with the Democratic Army, about half of them Slavic-speakers, went into exile in Eastern bloc countries during and after the civil war. About 20,000 children were taken across the border by the Communists, whether for their protection or as reserve troops for a future counter-attack.

Many Slavic-speaking civilians also went north for safety. Entire villages were left empty, like the old settlement of Krystallopigi (Smrdes in Macedonian) near the Albanian border, where only the imposing church of St George stands witness to a population that once numbered more than 1,500 souls.

In 1982, more than 30 years after the conflict's end, Greece's socialist government issued a decree allowing civil war refugees to return - but only those who were ""of Greek ethnicity"". Ethnic Macedonians from Greece remained shut out of their country, their villages and their land; families separated by the war were never reunited.

Mr Fokas's father-in-law and brother-in-law both died in Skopje. But, he points out, that decree tacitly recognised that there were ethnic Macedonians in Greece, even though the state never officially recognised their existence: ""Those war refugees left children, grandchildren, fathers, mothers behind. What were they, if not Macedonians?""

It's impossible accurately to calculate the number of Slavic-speakers or descendants of ethnic Macedonians in Greece. Historian Leonidas Embiricos estimates that more than 100,000 still live in the Greek region of Macedonia, though only 10,000 to 20,000 would identify openly as members of a minority - and many others are proud Greek nationalists.

The Macedonian language hasn't officially been banned in Greece for decades, but the fear still lingers. A middle-aged man I met in a village near the reed beds of Lake Prespa, where the agreement between Greece and the North Macedonian republic was first signed last June, explained that this fear is passed down through the generations. ""My parents didn't speak the language at home in case I picked it up and spoke it in public. To protect me. We don't even remember why we're afraid any more,"" he said. Slowly the language is dying. Years of repression pushed it indoors; assimilation is finishing the job.

And yet speaking or singing in Macedonian can still be cause for harassment. Mr Fokas's son is a musician; he plays the haunting Macedonian flute for us as his own small son looks on. He and a group of friends used to host an international music festival in the village square, with bands from as far away as Brazil, Mexico and Russia.

""After those bands had played we'd have a party and play Macedonian songs,"" he says. ""None of them were nationalist or separatist songs - we would never allow that. But in 2008, just as we were expecting the foreign musicians to arrive, the local authority suddenly banned us from holding the festival in the square, even though other people - the very ones who wanted us banned - still hold their own events there.""

Greece's position

The Greek government officially recognises only one minority - the Muslim minority of Thrace

It has historically regarded the Macedonian Slavs of Greek Macedonia as a linguistic rather than a national group, referring to them as Slavophone Greeks or bilingual Greeks

A document issued in the early 1990s, says that ""almost all the bilingual inhabitants of the area whose national consciousness was not Greek moved to neighbouring states"" in the first half of the 20th Century - by implication, any bilingual people who remained possessed Greek national consciousness

The Prespa agreement says the nationality of the people of North Macedonia is ""Macedonian/citizen of the Republic of North Macedonia"" - which, as the Greek government emphasises, makes no presumption about the existence of a Macedonian ethnicity

At the last minute, the festival was moved to a field outside the village, among the reeds and marshes, without proper facilities - which, Mr Fokas's son points out, only made Greece look bad.

""And do you know why the songs are banned in the square but not the fields outside?"" his father adds. ""Because around the square there are cafes, and local people could sit there and watch and listen secretly. But outside the village they were afraid to join in - they would have drawn attention to themselves by doing that.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Protests against the agreement on the name of North Macedonia became violent

The ratification of Greece's agreement with the Republic of North Macedonia - and, as some argue, its implicit recognition of a Macedonian language and ethnicity - is a major political breakthrough which should help to alleviate such fears. But the process has also sparked new waves of anger and anxiety, with large, sometimes violent protests opposing the agreement, supported by parts of the Orthodox church.

An election is due before the end of the year. Greece's right-wing opposition has been quick to capitalise on nationalist sentiments, accusing the Syriza government of treason and betrayal. For Greece's Slavic-speakers, who have long sought nothing more than the right to cultural expression, the time to emerge from the shadows may not quite yet have arrived.

President Donald Trump on Friday blamed the “radical left” for Amazon’s decision last week to pull out of its plan to build a second headquarters in New York, calling it a “big loss” for his hometown.

“I think if you look at the deal, the deal was not a great deal from the standpoint of they could have made a better deal than that — a much better deal — but still, I think it's a loss to New York City,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

Trump has had his fair share of brush-ups with Amazon, frequently attacking the company and its founder Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post.

Amazon last week announced that it would no longer go forward with its so-called HQ2 project in Queens after liberal activists charged the development would exacerbate economic disparities in the area and decried Amazon’s aversion to employing union-backed workers.

Freshman Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became a poster child for the deal’s opposition, arguing that Amazon received too many incentives as part of the deal, which would have created 25,000 jobs.

She’s been criticized for saying that there were better ways for New York to invest the $3 billion in tax breaks Amazon would’ve received for the project, with many pointing out that amount was not equivalent to the state handing over a check.

Trump repeated that criticism Friday, taking the opportunity to bash the Democratic Party as a whole, despite the collapse of the deal splintering state party officials.

“The $3 billion wasn't a check. It was a form of taxes over a period of time that now they'll never see,” he said. “They were going to take in a lot of jobs, take in a lot of taxes. So I think it's a big loss for New York City. It's the kind of thinking that our country is going to on the left, on the radical left, but ultimately it's not good for jobs and it's not good for the economy.”

He added: “I come from New York City. I love New York City. I think it was a big loss for New York City.”

Bernie Sanders jumps into the race, raises $6 million and immediately mixes it up with the president.","Welcome to 2020 Vision, the new Yahoo News column covering the presidential race. Reminder: There are 348 days until the Iowa caucuses, and 619 days until the 2020 presidential election.

It was a big week for Bernie Sanders. The Vermont independent senator formally launched his 2020 Democratic presidential campaign on Monday. On Tuesday, the Sanders campaign said it raised nearly $6 million in its first 24 hours, or roughly four times as much as Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., raised in the first 24 hours of her campaign’s much-heralded launch.

The same day, the Daily Beast reported that Sanders had hired Faiz Shakir, national political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, to serve as his campaign manager. “Shakir, 39, is almost certainly the first campaign manager of a major presidential campaign who identifies as a Muslim,” the Daily Beast noted.

Jeff Weaver, Sanders’s 2016 campaign manager and longtime friend, had been eyeing a different role for Sanders’s second run and will likely serve as a senior adviser.

Then on Thursday, Sanders announced his campaign’s four national co-chairs, who together with Shakir fill out a diversity full house: former Ohio State Sen. Nina Turner, U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz and Ben & Jerry’s co-founder Ben Cohen.

“To win this election and build a movement to defeat Donald Trump, we must bring together a team prepared to fight for economic, social, racial and environmental justice,” Sanders said. “And that’s exactly what Nina, Ro, Carmen and Ben have been doing their entire lives.”

But Sanders wasn’t the only 2020 candidate to make staffing moves this week. Harris named three women of color to her presidential campaign: Emmy Ruiz, who served as Barack Obama’s Nevada state director in 2012 and Hillary Clinton’s state director in Nevada and Colorado in 2016, to be a senior adviser; Missayr Boker, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee’s director in 2018; and Julie Chávez Rodriguez, granddaughter of civil rights leader Cesar Chávez. The women will serve as Harris’s national political co-directors.

Meanwhile, the Trump campaign named its communications team, tapping veteran GOP operative Tim Murtaugh as communications director; Mark Lotter, a former aide to Vice President Mike Pence, as director of strategic communications; and Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany as national press secretary.

Trump’s ‘robust’ primary challenge

President Trump may be happy to handicap the 2020 Democratic presidential field, but there’s been a lot of talk in recent days of a possible Republican primary challenge — the first serious one to a sitting president since Ted Kennedy tried to wrest the Democratic nomination from President Jimmy Carter in 1980.

Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told Yahoo News’ Alex Nazaryan that he believes Trump will face a “robust challenge” for the GOP nomination. And that, Steele said, is as it should be.","2020 Vision: Bernie Sanders launches, like a rocket",Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/2020-vision-bernie-sanders-launches-like-rocket-192320064.html

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) announced his first ever presidential run, more than three-quarters of the electorate had no idea who he was.

Sanders, of course, went on to give former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton a run for her money in the 2016 Democratic party primaries. His rallies attracted both enormous crowds and a healthy supply of young voters, for whom he articulated — in a thick Brooklyn accent — a vision of a government that he said would work for everybody, not just millionaires and billionaires.

Four years later and after much speculation, Sanders announced he is officially entering the 2020 Democratic primary. Now, according to Gallup, he is the rare candidate who is almost universally known.

In the time between these two primary seasons, much ink has been spilled in the service of chronicling the way Sanders has transformed the Democratic Party, where the key policy ideas of his 2016 run — such as Medicare for All, free college tuition, and a $15 minimum wage — have become more widely embraced and more deeply rooted among its members. Much less attention had been paid, however, to the way that 2016 race has transformed Sanders.

But people close to Sanders say that in the past few years, the senator has endeavored to learn from his first foray into presidential politics. He has begun to think more about racial justice and its connections to his economic message. He’s become much more comfortable with the daily work of campaigning and has bought into the value of polling. Moreover, he’s spent a considerable amount of time building bridges with longtime political operatives and activists outside of his inner circle, they say.

The 2016 campaign, as one former aide told ThinkProgress, was like “putting the plane together as we flew.” This year the campaign won’t be as improvisatory. Rather, there will be a comprehensive plan that runs “through Iowa, beyond New Hampshire, past Super Tuesday, all the way until the general election,” said the former aide, who, like several others, requested anonymity to speak freely about Sanders. The Sanders campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

One sign of Sanders’ growth as a candidate is his selection of Faiz Shakir to serve as campaign manager, said former aides and advisers. Hiring Shakir, who most recently was national politics director for the American Civil Liberties Union and previously was the editor of ThinkProgress, demonstrates a fresh dedication to a more expansive campaign platform and a more diverse team than in 2016, they said.

The early going hasn’t been free of stumbles, however. Sanders, in an interview with Vermont Public Radio on Tuesday, rankled many progressive activists and former Clinton backers when he said, “We have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender and not by their age. I mean, I think we have got to try to move us toward a nondiscriminatory society which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for.”

Sanders has also had to provide assurances that his rebooted campaign will be more professionally structured after a number of former staffers came forward with allegations of sexual harassment at the hands of a top Sanders staffer during the 2016 campaign. In the wake of the allegations, Sanders went on CNN in January promising to “do better next time.” To that end, he announced that his 2020 campaign would have strict rules to prevent workplace harassment.

“We are going to have the strongest protocols to protect women and anybody else against any form of harassment,” he told CBS. “We are going to be training every employee who works for us, and we’re going to give people who feel they’ve been harassed the opportunity to talk to people outside of the campaign.”

One adviser told ThinkProgress that Sanders recently offered an apology to to members of his inner circle for the way he micromanaged certain aspects of the 2016 campaign. That adviser said the candidate has grown more open to listening, particularly on issues like race.

Sanders has changed in other ways, according to former aides. For instance, he used to bristle at having to discuss polling but now sees its value. And he has worked hard to sharpen his foreign-policy chops — an area in which he repeatedly stumbled in 2016 debates — and plans to articulate an expansive, progressive worldview, one former aide said.

That change is apparent in these early days of Sanders’ campaign. While his 2016 campaign website did not even have a foreign policy section, Sanders went so far as to touch on foreign policy in his presidential announcement, touting his work to end the United States’ involvement in Yemen.

Perhaps the starkest difference between Sanders’ first presidential campaign and this one comes in the form of money: In the 24 hours after his announcement, he raised close to $6 million, blowing his early rivals for the Democratic nomination out of the water. Not only does the initial cash haul demonstrate Sanders’ overwhelming name recognition, it demonstrates that he’s an immediate contender, rather than the dark-horse candidate he was last time around.

But for those close to Sanders — and for many of his most ardent supporters — the most exciting aspect of his entrance into the 2020 race are all the things that will stay the same. And they’re hopeful that despite Sanders’ elevation in the pecking order, he will continue to play the role of the outsider and pull the rest of the field — and the national conversation about public policy — even further to the left than he already has.

“I think his policies… are going to be the gold standard against which these other campaigns are going to be measured,” one former aide said, noting in particular Sanders’ work on economic and environmental issues. “He’s the only one generating real new ideas. To the extent that [the rest of the candidates] have new ideas, they’re all sort of watered down versions of his — not to put too fine a point on it.”",Bernie Sanders’ 2016 run changed politics.

Near Baghouz (Syria) (AFP) - US-backed forces evacuated over 40 truckloads of people from the Islamic State group's last Syria redoubt on Monday, as they sought to clear out civilians before a final push to crush the jihadists.

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have slowed down their offensive on the final pocket due to the presence of civilians, with just a scrap of the IS ""caliphate"" remaining from a territory that once spanned Syria and Iraq.

An AFP correspondent saw more than 46 trucks crammed with men, women and children, approaching an SDF outpost, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of the jihadist redoubt.

One vehicle was packed with women clad in black and men who covered their faces. Wounded people were also among the latest evacuees.

Holdout IS fighters and civilians, mostly relatives of jihadists, are trapped in less than half a square kilometre in the village of Baghouz near the Iraqi border.

The Kurdish-led SDF evacuated nearly 5,000 men, women and children from the jihadist redoubt on Wednesday and Friday, but none over the weekend.

Earlier on Monday, SDF spokesman Mustefa Bali, told AFP that thousands remained inside the IS pocket.

""According to what we heard from those who have left, there are nearly 5,000 people still inside,"" Bali said.

At the SDF screening point outside the village, SDF fighters expressed hopes that Monday's arrivals would be the last one.

""We want it to be over,"" Mazloum, a 29 year-old SDF fighter told AFP.

""Every day we say today is the day but we hope it will all end today and not tomorrow,"" he said.

- 'Secret' transfers -

Kurdish foreign affairs official Abdel Karim Omar told AFP on Monday that the SDF will announce the end of the IS proto-state ""in the next few days"".

""But this does not mean that we have eliminated terrorism, which must be eradicated at the roots,"" he said.

Beyond Baghouz, IS still has thousands of fighters and sleeper cells across several countries.

In Syria, it retains a presence in the vast Badia desert, and the jihadists have claimed deadly attacks in SDF-held territory.

Thousands of suspected IS fighters have attempted to blend in with civilians fleeing the crumbling ""caliphate"".

According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, around 46,000 people, including thousands of jihadists, have streamed out of the Baghouz pocket since early December.

The SDF screens those exiting at an outpost outside the village to weed out potential IS fighters.

After being vetted, women, children, and men not suspected of belonging to the extremist group are transported north to the Kurdish-run camp of Al-Hol, while suspected jihadists are sent to SDF-held detention centres.

The Observatory on Monday said that 1,400 people, mainly IS relatives, were secretly transported from orchards on the outskirts of Baghouz to neighbouring Iraq over the past 24 hours.

Kurdish foreign affairs official did not confirm the transfer, but denied that the SDF was responsible.

""In principle, we do not hand over any person passing through our territories to Iraqi authorities or any other party,"" Omar said.

Such transfers can only happen if they were trucked from Baghouz ""by another party"", he explained, without specifying.

Baghdad on Sunday said the SDF have transferred 280 Iraqi nationals accused of fighting alongside IS to Iraqi authorities.

Fourteen suspected French jihadists were among those transferred, an Iraqi government source told AFP on Monday.

Hisham al-Hashemi, an Iraqi expert with intimate knowledge of the issue, said the transfer had taken place in coordination with the US-led coalition fighting IS.

- Criticism of international response -

The mass outpouring of men, women and children from the IS foothold has overwhelmed the Kurdish-run Al-Hol camp, six hours north of Baghouz.

""The international community is not currently taking responsibility towards the large number of people leaving the last IS pocket, especially children,"" Omar said.

The International Rescue Committee said Friday that new arrivas had pushed the camp's population to over 45,000, exacerbating already dire conditions at the crammed facility.

At least 78 people, mostly children, have died on the way to the camp or shortly after arriving in recent weeks, the IRC said.

A warehouse fire on Friday caused by a gas cylinder explosion ""destroyed 200 family tents"" and five larger ones and injured 16 workers, it said.

The UN's humanitarian coordination office OCHA on Friday warned the camp was struggling to keep up with the flood of evacuees.",Syria force carries out major evacuation from last IS holdout,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/syria-force-carries-major-evacuation-last-holdout-144732631.html

Jay Inslee’s long-shot position in the Democratic presidential field. | David Ryder/Getty Images 2020 elections Dem operative launches super PAC backing Inslee for president The super PAC, Act Now On Climate, is run by former Democratic Governors Association political director Corey Platt.

Close allies of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee have created a super PAC to support his presidential campaign, with Inslee expected to jump into the 2020 Democratic primary soon.

The unlimited-money group, called Act Now On Climate, was formed by veteran Democratic operative Corey Platt, former political director of the Democratic Governors Association. Inslee chaired the governors group in 2018, when he traveled the country campaigning for Democratic governors and introducing himself in key states. Platt also served in the role when Inslee ran for reelection in Washington in 2016.

Story Continued Below

The super PAC’s launch illustrates Inslee’s long-shot position in the Democratic presidential field — and how he will focus on the environment to make a mark in the campaign. The primary is already full of candidates who have disavowed big donors and support from outside groups, but Inslee is much less known than many of his 2020 rivals and he does not have the same broad grassroots donor base that candidates like Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, making a super PAC a more alluring option.

Platt told POLITICO the super PAC will not accept corporate PAC money, and he added that the group will remain active in the 2020 race even if Inslee does not kick off a campaign.

""We hope Jay Inslee runs, because he has been the leading champion of solving climate change in the Democratic Party,"" Platt said. ""If he doesn’t, we will continue to work to make sure Democratic presidential candidates make this issue the priority.""

Act Now On Climate has also brought on Christy Setzer as a communications adviser. Setzer is a veteran Democratic consultant who has worked for the Service Employees International Union and former Sen. Chris Dodd’s 2008 presidential campaign.

Inslee has made clear in public comments that he has been “actively considering” a run for president, and he told POLITICO in 2018 that Democrats had to nominate a climate-change fighter in 2020. Inslee has taken steps to limit carbon emissions in Washington and was a major backer of a 2009 federal ""cap and trade"" bill when he was in the House.

In recent weeks, Inslee has taken additional steps toward the presidential race.

Inslee visited New Hampshire in January, telling an audience at Saint Anselm College that “we’ve got about 10 or 12 years to act in this regard or basically it will be too late to stop catastrophic climate change,” the Concord Monitor reported. Inslee added: “We have one chance to defeat climate change, and it’s right now.”

Behind the scenes, Inslee’s political team has been soliciting résumés for digital and fundraising staff, while Inslee himself has been prospecting for donor support for a 2020 bid.

Inslee has also retained political aides who would form the nucleus of a presidential campaign. Jamal Raad, a veteran Democratic strategist who has worked for Inslee and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), is handling communications for the governor.

Inslee’s political group, Vision PAC, has also paid vendors including Newman Partners, a longtime fundraiser for Inslee, and former Inslee campaign manager Aisling Kerins’ consulting firm in Seattle.

Act Now On Climate will start the presidential campaign with little super PAC company.

House Democrats will vote next week on a resolution to block the national emergency declaration issued by Donald Trump in order to access billions of dollars Congress refused to give him to build a wall along the border with Mexico.

“The president’s act is lawless and does violence to our constitution and therefore to our democracy,” House speaker Nancy Pelosi said on a conference call, announcing that the chamber would vote on Tuesday. “Not only is he disrespecting the legislative branch and the constitution of the United States, he is dishonoring the office in which he serves.”

Though the effort is unlikely to succeed, it sets up a highly charged confrontation between the legislative and executive branches of government over the separation of powers outlined in the constitution. The move will also put pressure on Republicans who are uncomfortable about the precedent such a declaration might set – and the long-term consequences for Congress.

The one-page resolution was authored by Texas congressman Joaquín Castro, a Democrat and the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who called Trump’s action an “unconstitutional power grab”.

“This is an historic power grab,” Castro said. “It will require historic unity by members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, liberal and conservative, to counteract the president’s parasitic movement.”

He added: “The president is declaring a national emergency to fulfill a campaign promise, not because there is an actual emergency on the United States border.”

The resolution, which states that Trump’s emergency declaration “is hereby terminated”, has at least 226 co-sponsors, Castro said. Despite an effort to attract bipartisan support, so far only one Republican has signed on: Justin Amash, a libertarian from Michigan. Democrats will work to add more ahead of the vote, which is expected on Tuesday.

Trump declared a national emergency on the border with Mexico last week, after signing legislation to avert a second government shutdown which provided far less than he demanded to build his wall along the border.

In his run for the White House, the president promised to build the wall and have Mexico pay for it. Neither part of the promise has been fulfilled.

Congress has approved nearly $1.4bn to build 55 miles of new fencing and barriers along the border in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley. Trump previously triggered a 35-day shutdown – the longest in history – after Congress rebuffed his demand for $5.7bn to begin construction on more than 200 miles of barriers.

The national emergency declaration allows the administration to transfer money from the defense department and other federal agencies. Trump has said that will give him access to an additional $6.6bn.

The action is being challenged in federal courts, including one case brought by a coalition of 16 states with Democratic attorneys general. Pelosi said the relevant House committees were studying alternative legal options but said Democrats’ focus at the moment was on passing the resolution.

With more than half of the members of the House signed on, the resolution will all but certainly pass. But the effort is likely to fall short in the Senate, where only a few Republicans have expressed interest, or to a Trump veto. It is unlikely either chamber could gather enough support to override a presidential veto.

Even so, the resolution is likely to put pressure on Republicans running for re-election next year in districts and states where Trump is unpopular.

Several Republican lawmakers have expressed concern that Trump’s action could set a precedent for a future Democratic president to declare a national emergency related to climate change or gun violence.

Susan Collins, a moderate Republican senator from Maine who is up for re-election in 2020, was the first in her party to publicly state support for a resolution blocking the emergency declaration.

With Republicans in the majority in the Senate, at least three more GOP senators would have to join her, if all of the Democrats voted for the resolution, for it to succeed.",Democrats file resolution to block Trump's 'unconstitutional power grab',Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/democrats-file-resolution-block-trump-170750684.html

They will also choose a future aligned with Europe or one aligned with Russia.","For many here, the EU represents a vision of how they wish their country would function: The bloc is seen as a largely transparent, rules-based society where leaders work for the people’s interests and where opportunities are available for those who put in the effort. The EU has steadily expanded eastward, and the possibility of joining can encourage significant reforms and better behavior from prospective member states.

But the failures of pro-European parties in power since 2009—not to mention the EU’s own struggles, from the aftermath of the eurozone debt crisis to the near exit of Greece from the bloc—have dulled that enthusiasm. Moldova currently ranks 117th in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, down from 89th in 2009, while support for continuing on the path toward the European Union dropped from 65 percent in 2010 to 40 percent in 2016, according to public-opinion polls conducted by the Institute for Public Policy, an independent research group based in Chisinau.

Despite Sandu’s conviction that Moldova should remain focused on attaining EU membership—admittedly an unlikely prospect anytime soon—surveys of Moldovan voters now put support for closer ties with the EU neck and neck with backing for Russia, if they had to choose just one (a significant number also say they don’t know which they prefer).

“I haven’t decided who I will vote for,” says Ilian, a detergent seller in Chisinau’s sprawling open-air market, where much of the population still comes to buy their groceries. The 33-year-old, who declined to give his last name, continued: “If there’s a space where you can say that you don’t support any candidate, I will tick that box.”

On the opposite end of the spectrum from Sandu sits Dodon, the former leader of the Socialist Party, who has been president since December 2016. Moldova’s presidency is meant to stand apart from party politics, and so Dodon is not officially campaigning in these elections, but his views are clear. While running for president, Dodon said that he would be ready to call a referendum on whether to extricate Moldova from its EU agreement, in favor of membership in the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union. (His rhetoric since taking office has been more nuanced, but he was nevertheless temporarily suspended by Parliament in January 2018 for vetoing a bill aimed at stopping Russian news broadcasts in Moldova, one of several occasions that legislators have taken such action against him.)

Critics say Dodon has been pursuing a pro-Russian path, but he maintains that he is simply rebalancing the country’s alignment after a decade of what he described as anti-Russian rhetoric. “I think the greatest mistake is to make a choice,” he told me in an interview in his oversized office in the heart of Chisinau. “Moldovan society is split into two parts; one half wants to be friends with Russia, and the other half wants to be friends with Europe … We need good relations with Europe and all those agreements, and we need Russian sales markets for our goods. This is the only way out—any other option is internal destabilization and problems.”",A Global Geopolitical Crisis Comes to Moldova,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/02/moldova-elections-voters-europe-russia/583351/

Votes are being counted in Nigeria's closely-fought general election, with voting hours extended in some places following delays in the morning.

The main challenger to President Muhammadu Buhari, 76, is the former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, 72.

Whoever wins will have to address power shortages, corruption, security threats, and a sluggish economy.

The election had been due to take place a week ago but was delayed at the last minute for logistical reasons.

President Buhari cast his ballot in his hometown of Daura in the northern state of Katsina. Asked if he would congratulate his rival if he lost, he said: ""I will congratulate myself.""

Reported attacks

About two hours before polls were due to open on Saturday, residents of the town of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state in the country's north-east reported hearing several blasts and gunfire.

State police said in a statement that there was no threat to public safety. ""The gunfire were not targeted at members of the public but was for security purposes,"" the statement said.

Borno is the birthplace of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which had said it planned to disrupt the elections.

In the north-eastern state of Yobe, suspected Islamist militants attacked the town of Geidam, forcing people to flee, the Reuters news agency reported.

Why was the election delayed?

The initial vote was rescheduled in a dramatic press conference in the early hours of Saturday 16 February, just five hours before polls were due to have opened.

Image copyright AFP Image caption President Muhammadu Buhari (l) is expected to face a strong challenge from Atiku Abubakar (r)

The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) has given several reasons for the delay, including attempted sabotage and logistical issues such as bad weather and problems with delivering the ballot papers.

Inec has said that everything is in place for the poll to take place this time round.

How will the election work?

The candidate with the most votes is declared the winner in the first round, as long as that person gains at least 25% of the votes in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states.

There are 73 registered candidates in the presidential election, but campaigning has been dominated by the two political giants and the established party machines behind them.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The ballot paper has to be extra long in order to fit on all 73 presidential candidates

The president's All Progressives Congress (APC) has promised to take the country to the ""next level"", arguing that in his first four-year term Mr Buhari has done a lot of ""foundational work"" that may not be immediately obvious.

Mr Abubakar and his People's Democratic Party have pledged ""to get Nigeria working again"", saying that the president has wasted the last four years.

Both men are from the mainly Muslim north of the country. While they are in their 70s, more than half of Nigeria's 84 million registered voters are under 35.

What are the main issues?

Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer but corruption and a failure to invest the proceeds from the industry have hampered development in the country.

It slipped into a recession in 2016 and a slow recovery has meant that not enough jobs have been created to cope with the large number of young people coming into the employment market. Currently nearly a quarter of the working age population is unemployed.

Mr Buhari has quelled a militant Islamist rebellion in the north-east of the country, but Boko Haram remains active. There has also been an upsurge in violence in the country's Middle Belt as traditional herders and more settled farmers have clashed.

Up until 1999 Nigeria was governed by either short-lived civilian administrations or military rulers. But this year marks 20 years since the return of democracy.

The DA faces a resurgent ruling African National Congress (ANC) under new President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has also vowed to root out graft and boost growth in Africa’s most industrialized economy..

The ANC has comfortably won every parliamentary election since it swept to power under Nelson Mandela at the end of apartheid in 1994 and the DA has made ruling South Africa a long-term ambition.

Still, corruption is perceived as a weakness for the ANC after years of rule by former President Jacob Zuma, who was removed from the presidency last year by the ANC after years of corruption probes. He denies any wrongdoing.

“The South Africa I want to build will have no place for corruption and corrupt politicians,” DA leader Mmusi Maimane told supporters at the party’s manifesto launch in Johannesburg.

He said his party would have “zero tolerance for corruption” and wanted to see corrupt politicians spend 15 years in jail.

The DA, which has roots among white liberals from the anti-apartheid era, elected its first black leader in 2015 to widen its appeal among voters, and improved its national credentials by winning control of three major cities in 2016.

Maimane also outlined manifesto pledges to create jobs by offering tax incentives to encourage new business and maximize the manufacturing, agriculture and tourism sectors to build the economy.

“If we can put a job in every home we can transform our society,” said Maimane

The first New Hampshire Democratic Primary Poll since Sen. Bernie Sanders announced he’s running for president finds Sanders at a slight advantage with 27% of the vote, former Vice President Joe Biden with 25% and Sen. Kamala Harris at 12%. No other candidate clears double digits. The NH poll was conducted February 21-22 of registered voters, the Democratic primary ballot test had a sample of n=405, +/-4.8%.

Among voters ages 18-34, Bernie Sanders has a large lead with 44% of the vote. Joe Biden follows at 11%, Elizabeth Warren has 9%, and Kamala Harris is tied with Beto O’Rourke with 8% apiece.

Voters 35-54 years old prefer Biden (30%), then Sanders (26%). Harris takes 14%, Sen. Amy Klobuchar takes 10%, and Warren receives 7% of the vote.

Among voters aged 55-74 years, Joe Biden leads with 30%, followed by Sanders (18%) and Harris (13%), with Warren and Klobuchar tied in fourth with 8% apiece.

Among voters aged 75 and older, Biden leads with 39%, followed by Warren (18%), Klobuchar (11%), Sanders (10%) and Harris with 8%.

Republican Primary

While President Trump has a 52% disapproval and 43% approval in the Granite State, he has an 80% approval and 14% disapproval among GOP primary voters. This would help explain why in the ballot test between Trump and former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld, Trump has 82% of the vote and Weld has 18%. The Republican primary ballot test had a sample of n=328, +/-5.4%.

In a potential US Senate match up for 2020, current Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D) is tied with Governor Chris Sununu (R) at 44% each, with 12% of voters undecided. Shaheen leads among independents 44% to 39%. The NH poll had a sample of n=910, +/-3.2%.

2020 Ballot

President Trump trails in all his head-to-head matchups against potential Democratic nominees, his toughest opponents being Biden and Sanders, who both lead Trump 55% to 45%. When Trump is up against Warren he trails 52% to 48%, but when Howard Schultz is added to the ballot, Trump takes a 2-point lead (45% to 43%) with Schultz at 12%.

To a lesser extent, Schultz also tightens a race between Trump and Sanders from a 10-point lead to 6 points, 48% to 42%, with 10% voting for Schultz.

Ideal Candidate

Voters were also asked about which characteristics they seek in an ideal candidate. The most highly prioritized characteristic is truthfulness, as cited by 42% of respondents, followed by being on the same side of the issues at 25%. Experience (14%) and authenticity (13%) were the third and fourth most highly prioritized characteristics.

Caller ID

The New Hampshire Emerson College poll was conducted February 21-22, 2019 under the Supervision of Professor Spencer Kimball. The sample consisted of registered voters, n=910, with a Credibility Interval (CI) similar to a poll’s margin of error (MOE) of +/- 3.2 percentage points. The data was weighted based on 2016 voter model, age, party affiliation,. It is important to remember that subsets based on gender, age, party breakdown, ethnicity and region carry with them higher margins of error, as the sample size is reduced. Data was collected using both an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system of landlines only (n=605) and an online panel provided by Amazon Turk and Dynata (n=305).

227,Empty,2019-02-25T06:42:23Z,Elections are the hinge connecting social dynamics to India's liberal democratic structures.,"The paradox of the coexistence of democracy and mass poverty is deeper in India than in many other societies. Some of the common reasons why democracies do not care for their poor do not hold true for India.

First of all, the institutional design of Indian democracy (parliamentary system, asymmetrical federalism, flexible Constitution amendment) is not “demos-constraining” in that it does not put significant obstacles to the democratic popular will. There are not too many veto points that might account for the failure of floor-securing social policies to be legislated and implemented.

Some of the common reasons why democracies do not care for their poor do not hold true for India.

Second, the party system is intensely competitive with very high electoral volatility. The first-past-the-post system accentuates the effect of voters’ volatility into dramatic change in seats and government formation. Though the level of volatility has come down in this decade as compared to the previous one, a ruling party in an Indian state has just about a 50% chance of coming back to power. Parties cannot afford to be complacent and overlook issues that might concern a significant proportion of population.

Third, the state capacity in India is higher than most comparable poor countries; it still commands the force to impose its will and is not crippled by absence of resources to meet some of its key projects. All this makes it even more intriguing that the ruling parties/coalitions should not (be able to) muster adequate political will to carry out anti-poverty policies.

Finally, what makes it truly intriguing is that the poor have not opted out of democratic politics in India, at least not from routine participation in electoral politics.

…

Why elections have gained primacy in Indian democracy

Across countries in terms of the impact of the electoral system, the structure of political choices offered by the party system, the social basis of political preferences, agenda-setting and public opinion formation, the invisible role of issues and ideologies, interests and identities are seen to be the keys to making sense of elections.

Yet we simply assume that elections perform the same role everywhere. The end result of this similarity is that the experience of electoral politics in societies like India is interpreted in the light of the narrow historical experience of Western Europe and North America.

Hence the need to understand the distinctiveness of the Indian experience of elections.

One of the first things that strikes any observer of Indian elections is their centrality in India’s political life. Banners, posters, and crowds fill the streets; massive processions and rallies are a norm; the media is full of election news and every street corner is buzzing with political gossip. Though on a steady decline of late, this kind of visibility in Indian elections symbolises the pivotal role elections have come to play in Indian politics.

If tension between pre-existing social form and borrowed legal-political structure provides the basic frame for understanding Indian democracy, the history of Indian politics is an attempt by millions of ordinary people to write their own political agenda in an alien script.

An election is an occasion for the transfer of energy and resources from the “unorganised” to the “organised” sector of democracy.

An encounter such as this, if it is to lead to meaningful outcomes, requires bridges or hinges that connect the two different worlds.

The institution of elections came to perform this crucial role in India. It became the hinge that connected the existing social dynamics to the new political structures of liberal democracy, allowing for reciprocal influence. An election is often the site for a fusion of popular beliefs and political practices with high institutions of governance.

Thus an election is an occasion for the transfer of energy and resources from the “unorganised” to the “organised” sector of democracy. This is the moment when the legal-constitutional order of liberal democracy makes contact with the messy social and political reality of India. The “formal” sector is highly visible, it leads a legal-constitutional existence, it involves “civil society” groups and NGOs or a certain segment of political parties, it speaks a familiar modern language, mobilises secular identities and is easy to incorporate into a global register of democracy, even if it draws modest energy and participation.

Every political actor is aware of another “informal” sector, often seen as a source of embarrassment. Political organisations and movements that inhibit this sector speak a homespun hybrid language and fall back upon identity-based mobilisation. Though political practices in this sector lead an invisible, often paralegal, existence below the radar, this sector remains the most happening political site in terms of popular mobilisation and energy. The chasm that separates the two worlds and the absence or non-functioning of the other possible bridges has resulted in the unusual salience of the institution of elections.

This unique role is what accounts for the continued dynamism of the electoral process in India, while a number of other imported institutions and processes are floundering.

A festival of collective identity

Elections in India perform many more functions. For a postcolonial country like India, successful elections are still a symbol of a national political community, something of a festival of collective identity. For the poor and the marginalised, who are excluded from the normal functioning of the state, elections are an affirmation of their citizenship and are seen as a sacred ritual of political equality. Notwithstanding a robust media that routinely uses public opinion polls, elections are still the principal site for the dissemination of political ideas and information and also the only reliable method to gauge public opinion on the big issues facing the country.

Elections force political parties to consider ideas, interests, and entities that do not lend themselves to easy aggregation through instrumentalities of the “organised” sector. Thus, elections often appear as the only bridge between the people and power, as the only reality check in the political system.

Elections often appear as the only bridge between the people and power, as the only reality check in the political system.

Elections are also an occasion for settling, unsettling or resettling local equations of social dominance and the arena of struggles for social identity and dignity. Elections are a site for contestation for social dominance in a locality, leading to assertion by dominant social groups and protests by subaltern groups.

Attempts by clever political entrepreneurs to manufacture a social majority often involve building a local coalition of castes and communities. This often leads to an invention of community boundaries and sometimes the jerrymandering of settled boundaries. In a micro as well as macro setting, elections are an occasion for distribution and redistribution of resources. This is the time for patronage distribution as well as the occasion for the ordinary citizens to collect their “dues” from the political class.

All this accounts for the festival-like character of the Indian elections and the fierceness with which they are contested here. At the same time, this compression of multiple decisions into a single act also results in an under-emphasis on the representational functions of elections.

Democrats’ embrace of sweeping progressive ideas like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal is about to get its first reality check on Capitol Hill — as both parties make huge bets about which message will sway voters in 2020.

For liberal Democrats, proposals to provide universal health care, combat climate change and create a fairer economy represent the kind of bold agenda they will need to unseat President Donald Trump, a candidate unafraid to make his own brash moves on trade and immigration. But Republicans are seizing on the same proposals to paint Democrats as socialist radicals, while trying to widen the ideological splits already emerging among Trump’s would-be challengers.

Story Continued Below

Senate Republicans plan to force a vote as early as next week, S.J. Res. 8, on progressives’ Green New Deal climate resolution, which has drawn support from almost all of the chamber’s declared and potential Democratic presidential hopefuls. House Democrats, meanwhile, are set to unveil legislation guaranteeing government-funded health care for all Americans — amid conflicting poll numbers about voters’ willingness to upend the existing health insurance market.

It’s the beginning of what promises to be a series of high-stakes tests that both parties insist will work to their advantage.

“The Republicans are misreading the moment,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), an outspoken liberal on issues like climate change. “We have never been more fired up.”

In fact, some progressives have invoked Trump’s upset 2016 win as an argument for taking a bold strategy into 2020 — evidence that Democrats should focus more on articulating popular core values and less on worrying about the practicalities. In the same way Trump fired up his base with pledges to build the wall and make America great again, progressives believe Democrats can piece together an even bigger coalition by branding themselves as the party of universal health care and economic equality.

“You could actually credit Donald Trump for this,” said Faiz Shakir, the new campaign manager for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2020 run. “The kind of not giving a crap what others think, or what his critics think, and just plowing ahead with a vision has made progressives hungrier for a version of, well, what would that look like [on the left]?”

But top Republicans say they see Democrats veering off a socialist cliff — citing the Green New Deal, H. Res. 109 (116), and S. Res. 59, co-authored by New York freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a prime example.

“It’s entirely fantasy, it’s unrealistic. These are just talking points designed to appeal to the fringe of their party,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). He added, “It’s ended up causing quite a headache for our colleagues across the aisle who’ve tried to explain exactly what they’re trying to do and how they’re trying to do it.”

The debate in Congress’ opening months follows more than two years of arguments by progressive activists that Democrats need to be more than just the anti-Trump party to succeed in 2020. They say transformative policies are also increasingly necessary to counter major crises like a changing climate and the growing power of the super-rich.

“The center of energy in the Democratic Party is with these kinds of bold, progressive, populist ideas around transforming our economy and democracy,” said Waleed Shahid of Justice Democrats, a group inspired by Sanders’ 2016 run and crucial to the rise of Ocasio-Cortez. “We’re making change happen pretty fast.”

Yet it’s also generated unease among party moderates. And while progressives point to strong polling in support of Medicare for All and aggressive climate action, the GOP is eager to spend the next several months chipping away at it.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s call for a vote on the Green New Deal is aimed purely at driving a wedge through the Democratic Party, forcing liberal senators and vulnerable centrists alike to weigh in on a proposal that envisions remaking the U.S. economy in just a decade. Already, moderate Democratic senators like Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Joe Manchin of West Virginia have groused publicly about the plan as moving too far, too fast.

Republicans in the House, meanwhile, are pressing for a series of hearings on Medicare for All, certain that enthusiasm for single-payer health care will plummet as voters study the details and trade-offs.

“Democrats’ Medicare for All proposal would force over 150 million Americans to lose their employer or their union-sponsored insurance,” said Oregon Rep. Greg Walden, the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “You want to talk about sabotage? That’s what we should be having a hearing on.”

Democrats’ liberal wing vows to meet that challenge head on. And they’re expecting the party’s growing list of presidential candidates to stand with them through the long, bruising 2020 campaign.

Already, all six Democratic senators running for president have co-sponsored the Green New Deal, and five signed on last year to Medicare for All legislation. Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have sought to further separate themselves from the pack — Sanders is running as a democratic socialist in favor of free college and a break-up of the big banks, while Warren has rolled out plans for a wealth tax and universal child care.

In Congress, House progressives next week are rolling out a detailed road map to single-payer health care — even as party leaders urge a focus on the more immediate, incremental health issues that sparked their midterm electoral wave just months ago.

“What we’re proposing is really a transformation of the health care system to get out the pieces that are so embedded in it that it continues to make health care costs equivalent to 19 percent of GDP,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), a Congressional Progressive Caucus leader who’s penning the Medicare for All bill. “The majority of the American public believes we should have what almost every other industrialized country in the world has.”

Still, Democrats acknowledge they’re inviting intense scrutiny of such transformative proposals — and the reckoning that’s in store if they miscalculate voter enthusiasm for policies that would upend broad swaths of the economy.

One presidential contender, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), faced immediate blowback for suggesting at a CNN town hall in January that she would support eliminating private health insurance as part of a Medicare for All system. Similarly, the Green New Deal drew an early wave of confusion and gleeful GOP attacks after Ocasio-Cortez’s staff mistakenly distributed a document that included principles not endorsed by the resolution’s supporters — including phasing out nuclear energy and building high-speed rail “at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.”

And some moderate Democrats have privately pointed to House progressives’ difficulties securing 100 co-sponsors for their single-payer health care bill as evidence the party’s vocal left wing is overstating support for its policy ideas.

Some 2020 contenders are consciously tacking toward the center in the meantime. On Monday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar cast the Green New Deal as “aspirational” despite her endorsement of it, and Medicare for All as something to shoot for down the road — positioning herself instead as a more pragmatic candidate.

“It could be a possibility in the future,” Klobuchar said of single-payer health care. “But I’m looking for what’s working now.”

That’s a balancing act that several Democrats in Congress say they hope the party can strike — aligning with the progressive rhetoric that’s resonated with voters, while pursuing more incremental policies.

“It’s a great conversation starter,” Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, a freshman Democrat facing a tough reelection in 2020, said of the Green New Deal. “What’s proposed in there is a little too aggressive and a little too far right now, but we have got to have a conversation about climate change and what we’re doing to this planet.”

Democrats are similarly warning against litigating the details of moving to a single-payer health system, for fear of bogging down their advantage on health issues and giving Republicans new avenues of attack.

“What’s important is to get your values and your core principles out there,” said Democratic pollster and strategist Celinda Lake. “It’s classic for Democrats to jump right into the middle of the policy.”

Liberals, though, are chafing at the suggestion they limit their ambitions. They contend the GOP will try to paint all Democrats as left-wing firebrands anyway, so there’s little reason not to lean into big solutions that the public finds popular.

“This is actually politicians catching up to the people and the economic realities that they live in,” said former Virginia Rep. Tom Perriello, a Democrat who lost his seat in 2010 after backing Obamacare and a cap-and-trade proposal on climate change. “Taking a good idea and cutting it in half used to make it more popular. Now it sounds tone deaf.”

Indeed, the super PAC aligned with House GOP leadership is already targeting moderate freshmen Antonio Delgado of New York and Colin Allred of Texas over the Green New Deal — even though neither signed onto the resolution.

Those are divisions Republicans aim to exploit in the coming weeks on climate and health care, marking the first in what’s likely to be a string of tough tests for 2020 Democrats grappling with the left’s newfound power and heightened expectations.

“We’ll really see in the 2020 presidential campaign who is actually committed to prioritizing and fighting for these policies,” Shahid said, ""and who just wants to be part of the hashtag.""",2020 Democrats’ progressive gamble is about to get real,Politico,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/23/2020-democrats-progressive-gamble-is-about-to-get-real-1198006

This is a week replete with challenges for President Donald Trump.

He faces a second summit with North Korea’s leader, a Democratic challenge to his emergency border declaration and public testimony from a key figure in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into alleged Russian election meddling, which could be nearing completion.

Mueller: Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer who has said the president directed him to make illegal hush money payments, is set to testify on what he knows about the 2016 campaign. Border: House Democrats have set a vote for tomorrow on a resolution to block Trump’s emergency declaration to build a wall on the southern U.S. Border with Mexico. The measure will force Republicans to take a stand on whether the president exceeded his authority over federal spending. Summit: The president said yesterday he doesn’t expect to lift sanctions on Kim Jong Un’s regime, as he prepares for a summit with the North Korean leader this week on U.S. demands that Pyongyang end its nuclear program.

Another pressing issue has already been punted. Trump said late yesterday that he’ll extend Friday’s deadline to raise tariffs on Chinese goods, citing “substantial progress” in the latest round of trade talks in Washington.

Global Headlines

Venezuela standoff | U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will meet opposition leader Juan Guaido in Bogota today and plans to announce new actions against Venezuela that may include forms of economic or diplomatic pressure, according to an administration official. Guaido’s efforts to deliver aid convoys to Venezuela from Colombia this weekend were violently quashed by forces loyal to Nicolas Maduro, but nothing has really changed on the ground. The nation is still hungry, scared and wondering what comes next.

Raising the stakes | Theresa May again put off a final parliamentary ballot on her Brexit agreement, this time until March 12, as she seeks concessions from the European Union. But the delay risks further angering ministers who fear the premier’s strategy is pushing the country to the brink of a catastrophic no-deal departure. They’ll have a chance to force her hand on Wednesday, when lawmakers are due to vote on an amendment to delay Brexit to avoid the economic damage of crashing out.

War and peace | Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might declare a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War during their summit this week in Vietnam, South Korea said. While the move may help fulfill the U.S. leader's pledge to cease “endless wars,” it also risks undercutting arguments for maintaining the American troop presence on the Korean Peninsula.

Taking a hit | Italian Deputy Premier Luigi Di Maio’s Five Star Movement suffered another blow in a regional vote, this time on the island of Sardinia, where exit polls showed the party’s support tumbled. That's bad news for the stability of the alliance with the League because of growing pressure on Di Maio to increase his influence and prove Five Star is getting something out of the governing coalition.

New direction | China’s Politburo laid out a broad outline on how the nation’s more than $40 trillion finance sector should transform itself through supply-side reform – and by further opening up the industry. The government's push to control risk appears to be giving way to a desire to support its economy, as signaled by comments President Xi Jinping made at the gathering of China’s 25 most senior leaders.

What to Watch Today

Nigeria’s electoral commission plans to start announcing state-by-state results from the tight presidential race between the incumbent Muhammadu Buhari and his main challenger, Atiku Abubakar.

And finally ... Algerians have been protesting against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s decision to seek a fifth term in elections in April. In response to the peaceful rallies – which started Friday and are the biggest in the North African oil producer in years – the new head of the ruling FLN party, Mourad Bouchared, said God had sent the president, now in his 80s and ailing, to look after the country and reform it. Social media pundits saw the humor and the TweetCommeMouad hashtag appeared.

MIAMI — Miami fears the fix is in.

Local Democrats increasingly believe that the Democratic National Convention in 2020 will be sited in Milwaukee, Wis., a conclusion that’s led Florida politicians, donors and insiders to mount a final lobbying blitz to turn the tide.

Story Continued Below

The last-ditch effort began in earnest in recent days as speculation mounted that Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez would pick Milwaukee, where he has both family ties and the pressure of the Democratic governors of Wisconsin and Illinois weighing on him to go with a Midwestern location.

Perez has denied making up his mind or favoring any of the three finalist cities, a shortlist that includes Houston.

Still, the state’s Democratic congressional delegation has been pressed into service to persuade him. Hotel worker unions are also making a pitch to choose Miami — labor has a greater presence in the hospitality industry here than in Milwaukee.

Miami’s stable of Democratic donors — many of whom have hosted President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton multiple times and are already being hit up by numerous Democratic presidential hopefuls — are applying their clout to the city’s bid. Some of them say they’re already leaning on potential 2020 candidates — they won’t say which ones — to get them behind Miami’s convention bid.

Underpinning Miami’s pitch: It’s the heart of the largest Democratic county in the nation’s biggest swing state. Losing Florida — which is worth 29 Electoral College votes, compared to Wisconsin’s 10 — would likely cost President Donald Trump his reelection.

“We’re making a final effort to convince the DNC that Miami is the best place to go, that this could be a boost to the nominee,” said Chris Korge, the top financier of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and a co-chair of Miami’s convention effort.

Florida Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on what's hot, crazy or shady about politics in the Sunshine State. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.

Korge said he was limited in what he could say due to a DNC request that the discussions not be made public.

Behind the scenes, the convention site selection has been a proxy fight over how the presidential campaign could play out, pitting the Rust Belt, and the white working-class voters there who deserted the party in 2016, against a diverse coastal megalopolis, where minority voter turnout will be essential to Democratic hopes in 2020.

Milwaukee officials play up their heartland connections and mild summers, contrasting those with Miami and the risk of hurricanes. It’s a talking point that irks Miami officials so much that they’ve researched historic storm data to make the case that hurricanes are a rarity in early July, when the convention would be held.

Miami officials have made a quality-of-life argument as well by claiming the accommodations in Milwaukee are so limited that California’s large delegation can’t fit in a single hotel in the city — an issue the Miami convention boosters expect to raise with California’s best-known politician, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, to curry her support.

Midwest Democrats are approaching the decision with something of a chip on their shoulder. They contend Clinton snubbed Wisconsin and Michigan, and that the party needs to repair its relationship with the Midwest.

“Florida is a swing state. But we’re a swing region. The Midwest sticks together, and a convention has not been in the Midwest since 1996,” one Wisconsin official involved in the convention discussion said. “We are isolated from natural disasters. We don’t get tornadoes. We don’t get hurricanes. We don’t get earthquakes.”

As for Miami’s paranoia about Milwaukee, the official said, “they’re more confident than we are. It’s a jump ball ... it seems to change every day.”

There’s a sense among Democratic insiders that Houston is out of the picture, a victim of muggier summers than Miami, a relatively small Democratic delegation and concerns about the specter of oil money funding a convention for a party that believes in climate change and scaling back fossil fuel use.

In the run-up to the final decision, the mayors of Miami and Miami Beach have reached out to each of Florida’s 13 Democratic members of Congress in Florida to get them engaged. Some have called Perez already. Rep. Donna Shalala of Miami, who was Perez’s boss when she was President Bill Clinton’s health secretary, personally spoke to him about the Miami bid at a dinner hosted by former U.S. Ambassador to Belgium, Paul Cejas, a major Democratic donor. A former Justice Department colleague of Perez, former South Florida U.S. Attorney Willy Ferrer, has chimed in as well.

The singer-songwriter couple Gloria and Emilio Estefan have also lent their star power and former New York Yankee Derek Jeter, now a part-owner of the Miami Marlins, has been “very eager” to help make his new club’s baseball stadium available for the convention, said a source.

Joe Falk, a major South Florida donor involved in supporting Miami’s bid, said Miami should be able to sell itself because it’s multi-ethnic, gay-friendly and a place where donors are much more likely to open their wallets than Milwaukee.

“How do you get the donor to dig deeper? Show him a good time,” Falk said. “The donors are here and we know how to treat donors. We have the facilities to make those incredibly wealthy people comfortable. And we know how to throw a good party.”

Another top Democratic donor from Miami who didn’t want to be identified said he’s already being besieged by presidential hopefuls for contributions. And he’s making sure to press the issue of Miami’s convention bid.

“If you want Florida’s support, you should support Florida. It’s a simple message,” the donor said. “You hear people say ‘Florida, Florida, Florida.’ They don’t say ‘Wisconsin, Wisconsin, Wisconsin.’ There’s a reason for that.”

But it’s not just stars, ambassadors and high-rollers helping out. UNITE HERE, a hotel-worker union, is calling Perez, DNC members and other top Democrats to boost Miami’s efforts.

“For our union in particular, it’s a no-brainer,” said Wendi Walsh, a UNITE HERE international vice president. “For this DNC, we’ve got almost 4,000 union hotel rooms here in South Florida compared to zero in Milwaukee.”

Wisconsin officials note, however, that they have a far-more union-friendly state than Florida.

Walsh, who said the public employee union AFSCME is also being engaged, said there’s a purely political dimension to the effort: “Florida matters a lot, and we want to win Florida.”

The convention would help inject a sense of energy into South Florida that could help cure the liberal bastion’s longtime turnout problems, which have led Democrats to lose recent statewide elections by about a percentage point or less, according to a Wednesday letter to Perez written by Christian Ulvert, a top Democratic consultant who has advised Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber and his predecessor, Philip Levine, a co-chair of the convention effort with Korge.

Ulvert noted that Trump on Monday campaigned in Miami as part of an outreach effort to court voters of Venezuelan heritage and shore up support among Cuban-Americans.

“Republican strategy has been to maximize gains outside of South Florida and erode our support here,” Ulvert wrote. “Florida is ground zero for presidential elections — Miami-Dade is clearly ground zero for Florida.”",Miami makes last-ditch convention pitch,Politico,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/21/miami-democratic-national-convention-bid-1176840
231,Empty,2019-02-22T11:00:00Z,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the wunderkind congresswoman from New York, has been getting most of the credit for the Green New Deal, an ambitious plan to fight global warming that has become increasingly popular among Democrats. But Howie Hawkins wants to set th…","The question is whether the public will listen. Once widely accused of spoiling a presidential election that led to two wars, the Green Party has been mostly relegated to a political punchline, thanks in part to the foibles of its former leader Jill Stein. Now, the Green New Deal—which helped to differentiate the eco-socialists Greens from the Democrats—has been coopted. The Democrats are even warming to socialist ideas. So does America even need a Green Party anymore? Or does America need it now more than ever?



The Green Party barely registered notice in 1996 when it fielded its first presidential candidate, who only made it onto the ballot in 22 states. But four years later, nominee Ralph Nader qualified in 43 states and won about 2.7 percent of the popular vote nationwide. Because he drew 95,000 votes in Florida, the famously decisive state in that election, he was accused of handing the presidency to George W. Bush. Nader and his supporters—among others—reject the argument that he spoiled the election, but there’s no denying that the 2000 election established the Greens’ legitimacy and influence as a third party.

Nearly two decades later, the Green Party has lost some of both—though it might still have enough support to tip the results of a presidential election. The party’s two-time nominee, Jill Stein, received just .4 percent of the vote in 2012, but 1.1 percent in 2016. The latter was “enough votes to tip the scales for Donald Trump in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,” claimed Vanity Fair. (More accurately, her vote total in the three key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania was higher than Trump’s margin of victory, but there’s no evidence that Stein’s supporters would have voted for Clinton otherwise. They may have chosen no one at all.) Stein also potentially compromised her party’s legitimacy with her connection to multiple scandals related to the Russia investigation—not to mention her curious comments on vaccines and the health affects of Wi-Fi.

Stein has suggested she won’t seek the party’s nomination in 2020, so there’s potential for a new Green voice. But it’s not yet clear who that will be. Aside from Hawkins and Schlakman, only 12 people have officially declared their candidacy for the Green Party nomination. It’s hard to tell which are serious. Kanye Deez Nutz West most likely is not. But Dario Hunter is, and he’s about as diverse as candidates come: black, gay, Iranian, and Jewish. He’s also an ordained rabbi, a former environmental attorney, and a school board member in Youngstown, Ohio. These qualities all make him an ideal new voice for the party, he said. “If we want to cut through the lack of attention given [to Greens], we need someone who has a loud and clear voice and a tough skin,” he said. “It takes a tough skin to be an openly gay black son-of-an immigrant Jewish rabbi.”

Why should there be attention given to Greens, though, now that Democrats have embraced the Green New Deal? Simple, said Hunter: “This Democratic version of the Green New Deal is watered down. It pales in comparison to ours.”",Will the Democrats Kill the Green Party by Stealing Its Best Idea?,Newrepublic.com,https://newrepublic.com/article/153127/will-democrats-kill-green-party-stealing-best-idea

Twitter’s favorite large adult son, Donald Trump Jr., produced one of his most thought-provoking self-owns earlier this month, when he attempted to impugn the patriotism of the Democratic women of Congress. On February 6, Trump tweeted a post–State of the Union photo of a white-clad group of congresswomen huddled around Nancy Pelosi with the superimposed caption “NOT ONE AMERICAN FLAG PIN AMONG THEM.” Ironically, Trump also wrote that the photo “speaks for itself and no one is at all surprised.”



At the top of his replies, above the cracks about the Trump family’s preference for Russian flags or the gallery of Republican politicians wearing flag pins in mugshots, were a pair of photos from that same SOTU. One was of the Trump children. The other was a crowd shot of the Republican side of the speech audience. Not a flag pin in sight in either picture.

Junior’s posting may have been just another attempt to rile his father’s dwindling base, but he unwittingly may have exposed a noteworthy zeitgeist shift. Could the decades-long rule of the flag pin finally be over?

Pins depicting Old Glory first made their way into politics on lapels of Republican candidates during the 1970 congressional race, according to an old Time piece—a subtle counterpoint to the anti-Vietnam War protestors who were then regularly burning the flag at the time. But it was Richard Nixon who helped usher the accessory to True Patriot shibboleth status. As biographer Stephen E. Ambrose wrote, the president began to wear flag pins after the idea had been suggested to him by his chief of staff H. R. Haldeman, “who had seen it done in a movie called The Candidate.” Nixon would wear the pin throughout his presidency, including while lying to the American public about his involvement in Watergate, and later while resigning from office.



The flag pin returned with a vengeance after 9/11, when grand displays of patriotism were requirements for both Democrats and Republicans alike. This political science phenomenon of increased patriotism in times of crisis is fittingly known as the ""rally 'round the flag effect."" Even the media participated in the hawkish theatrics of the time. Some pushed back and caught plenty of flak for it: When ABC continued to uphold its longstanding anti-pin policy after 9/11, it resulted in chain emails urging boycotts of the network and its sponsors along with claims the network had instituted a new policy to ban the pins and patriotism itself.

While other outlets pontificated on the ethics of allowing anchors to wear pins, Fox News went all in from the jump. ""Why would it ever be inappropriate?"" asked Fox News’s Brit Hume. ""It doesn't stand for the Bush administration or for a certain party or even the government. It stands for the country. Why is wearing a symbol of the country of which you're a citizen a problem?""

The problem, some people said, was that the flag pins could stand for not just patriotism but also an uncritical view of the US government at a time when the country was marching toward what turned out to be a disastrous war in Iraq. Those attitudes may have even pushed Americans to seek impartial reporting from foreign outlets. Greg Dyke, the director general of the BBC at the time, noted the increased American audience for his channel’s coverage of the Iraq war and said that “many US networks wrapped themselves in the American flag and swapped impartiality for patriotism,” and in doing so, “misjudged some of their audience.”

By 2007, the Iraq War was no longer being viewed so positively, and a few Democratic politicians began to toy with the idea of discarding the flag pin. One of those was Senator Barack Obama. That October, when asked why he was not wearing a pin on his lapel, the presidential candidate told KCRG-TV in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that while he wore the pins after 9/11, he had stopped during the Iraq War after noticing they’d become a substitute for “true patriotism, which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security.” He added that he hoped telling Americans what he believed would make the country great would be an adequate “testament to his patriotism.”

This prompted such a huge outcry that Obama changed course and went on to wear a flag pin for the rest of his candidacy and presidency. Stupidly, that did not end the controversy: Subsequent racist urban legends popped up about him sometimes wearing his pins upside-down as a Carol Burnett ear-pull to his Muslim Brotherhood friends.

Seeing Obama attacked for such farcical reasons pushed many on the left to start challenging the flag pin. “New Rule: Show me a man wearing an American flag pin in his lapel, and I'll show you an asshole,” Bill Maher snarked in Salon after the original Obama pin scandal. “Make wearing a flag pin the 28th amendment,” John Roland Martin facetiously suggested in a CNN article about all the hand-wringing.

By the 2016 presidential election cycle, major cracks had emerged in flag pin dogma. The press was again openly challenging the practice and, though the right was still mostly committed to the bit, the Democratic primary debates were nearly pinless, save for Martin O’Malley. And after Donald Trump's election-night upset, the flag pin tradition seems to have sputtered out entirely.

From the administration’s first days, it became clear that the flag pin reverence of the Bush era was long gone. While covering John Kelly’s confirmation hearing, Washington Post reporter Robert Costa overheard a friend of the general suggest he put on a pin, to which the general replied “I am an American flag.” This bucking of orthodoxy earned Kelly praise from Ann Coulter. A year later, Sean Spicer’s accidental upside-down flag pin during one press briefing spawned jokes about how he was sending a distress signal. Cheapening the brand further was Donald Trump Junior, who was mocked for wearing a flag pin with “deplorable” written across the middle to the 2018 White House Easter Egg Roll.



Brandon Lenoir, a political science professor at High Point University, told VICE it was only a matter of time before this shift happened. ""We are now many years removed from 9/11, even though we're still a nation at war, people are not as engaged,"" he said. ""That's why I think we're seeing a loosening of the expectation that every elected official will be wearing an American flag.""



That said, Lenoir doesn't see Republican politicians ditching the baubles any time soon.



""We really do have a divide in the political ideologies of the parties with patriotism,"" he explained. ""For some, that means an outward expression of wearing the flag, while others think upholding the Constitution and fighting for the issues that are important to them is more patriotic.""

The flag pin's decline might simply show that certain symbols inevitably fall out of favor—these days, conservatives instead stick flag emoji to their Twitter profiles. But it also shows a fundamental change in discourse. Prior to the Trump administration, the Republican Party had largely favored dog whistles rather than coming out with their ugliest views. Attacking Obama over his flag pin was an easy way to target him as alien and un-American without saying that the black son of a Kenyan was plotting to destroy the US. The GOP's new figurehead, Trump, is both unwilling and unable to participate in that approach. He always says the quiet part loud, and only occasionally wears a pin.

The current government wants closer EU integration and warns of catastrophe if the country falls back into Russia’s sphere of influence.

But corruption scandals and worries over the health of its democracy have tarnished the country’s image and weakened the appeal of the pro-Western political class.

The opposition Socialist Party, which favors closer ties to Moscow, took a slight early lead at 29.5 percent, with 30 percent of votes counted. The ruling pro-Western Democratic Party trailed with 28.8 percent, while an opposition bloc called ACUM, campaigning to fight entrenched corruption, was third with 22 percent.

A clearer picture of the final tally will emerge on Monday.

An inconclusive election or one marred by allegations of fraud could tip the country back into instability just as it has recovered from a $1 billion banking scandal in 2014 and 2015.

If the results are split, it could set the stage for weeks of coalition talks or another election.

“If no one has a parliamentary majority, I think that there will be attempts to form it, but the risk is high that it could come to a snap election in the coming few months,” President Igor Dodon told reporters.

On Saturday, Dodon, the former Socialist Party chief, called the campaign “one of the dirtiest in our entire history”. He and leading opposition figures have threatened to launch street protests and raised concerns about vote-buying.

“If the elections are rigged even more than they have already been rigged to this day, we will come out to protect our vote,” ACUM leader Maia Sandu said.

POISONED POLITICS

The campaign has already been dogged by controversy.

In the past few days alone, ACUM’s leaders said they were being poisoned on the orders of the authorities, which the Democratic Party swiftly dismissed as a “strange accusation”.

Russia’s interior ministry announced an investigation into Democratic Party leader Vladimir Plahotniuc, accusing him of involvement in organized crime, prompting Plahotniuc’s party to accuse Moscow of election meddling.

The Democratic Party had already been accused of trying to bend the electoral system in its favor by introducing changes in 2017 on how votes are cast.

Previously, Moldovans voted on party lists, but the Democratic Party introduced a mixed system of party lists and first-past-the-post constituency races, against the advice of European rights experts. The Democratic Party rejects suggestions it benefits most from the new voting system.

It has in turn accused Dodon of colluding with Russia to put the Socialists in power, which the president denies.

“Moldova has the potential for development, it’s only necessary that the authorities not be corrupt, that they should think about the people, and not only about their own pockets,” said Alexandra Ciorescu, a 72-year-old pensioner.

BELIEVING IN THE FUTURE

The EU forged a deal on closer trade and political ties with Moldova in 2014 but has become increasingly critical of Chisinau’s track record on reforms.

One of Europe’s poorest countries, which is squeezed between Ukraine and EU member state Romania, Moldova plunged into crisis in 2014 and 2015 after $1 billion was pilfered from three banks.

The EU froze aid after a court struck down the victory in the Chisinau mayoral race of one of ACUM’s leaders, Andrei Nastase, on a technicality last year. The European Parliament declared it “a state captured by oligarchic interests”.

Plahotniuc’s party has trumpeted the achievements of its government under Prime Minister Pavel Filip. The economy is growing, the banking system has stabilized and cooperation with the International Monetary Fund resumed.

“I believe in the future of Moldova,” Filip said after casting his vote. “We are ready to continue reforms and all social programs, the implementation of which will change the lives of Moldovan citizens for the better.”

Dodon and the Democratic Party have clashed over issues ranging from relations with Russia to ministerial appointments. But some Moldovans suspect that the Socialists and Plahotniuc collaborate behind the scenes to carve up the state between themselves - a suggestion rejected by Dodon in a Reuters interview in January.",Moldovans vote for new government amid talk of protests and poisoning,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-moldova-election-idUSKCN1QD03K

WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Liberal Democratic presidential contenders' rush to embrace the left's most ambitious proposals has some Democrats worried there could be a price to pay when they try to defeat President Donald Trump next year.

Party activists have been energized as Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and other candidates endorsed plans to provide Medicare coverage to every American, some form of tuition-free college, a national $15 minimum wage and the so-called ""Green New Deal"" advocated by U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

But Trump and his allies in the Republican Party have seized on those stances to attack the Democratic 2020 field as outside the American political mainstream — a claim the president plans to make throughout his re-election campaign, according to sources with knowledge of his strategy.

Some Democrats fear the argument has potency. They worry the primary may produce a nominee who will not appeal to centrist working and middle-class voters who voted for Trump in 2016 but whom Democrats believe they can win back.

""The big progressive programs are popular in a caucus or primary electorate, but probably don't move the needle among voters who want to find someone who will change Washington by tilting the system to favor people in the middle — not the very rich or the very poor,"" said Jeff Link, an Iowa Democrat who worked for former President Barack Obama's campaign.

A person familiar with the president's thinking told Reuters that Trump had been looking for a ""big contrast issue"" to help power his 2020 bid.

His last Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, was widely known to the voting public before her campaign. This time, Trump may face someone new to the national stage, and he is looking to brand that candidate before she or he emerges as the nominee.

In recent speeches, including his State of the Union address and again this week in Florida, a key 2020 battleground, Trump used the crisis in Venezuela to equate Democrats with socialists.

""There's no question this is a deliberate strategy on his part,"" said Matt Bennett, a political analyst with Third Way, a Democratic centrist think-tank. ""It is a bit scary to think about what it could do to us in a close, tough election next year.""

GOING GREEN

Democrats have already seen the risks of catering to progressives.

Senators Booker of New Jersey, Harris of California, Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts almost immediately backed Ocasio-Cortez's push earlier this month for the Green New Deal, a sweeping 10-year blueprint for combating climate change that involves reducing carbon emissions and retrofitting infrastructure.

Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democratic socialist who announced this week he is running for president a second time, plans to introduce his own version of the climate plan.

Ocasio-Cortez, who has enjoyed disproportionate influence for a first-term congresswoman because of her social media presence, was forced to backtrack when an information sheet contained policy goals not in the plan, including doing away with nuclear power and airplanes and providing income to Americans ""unwilling to work.""

That didn't stop Trump and other Republicans from treating those goals as fact, suggesting that Democrats want to destroy air travel and expand the welfare rolls.

Republicans also jumped on Ocasio-Cortez's proposal to hike the marginal tax rate to 70 percent as a way to finance her environmental initiative. Even so, Warren followed by suggesting a ""wealth tax"" on Americans with large fortunes to help finance her child-care plan.

Democrats are ""afraid to tell their base what is practical"" and instead are offering policies that have little chance of being enacted, said Bryan Lanza, a former campaign aide to Trump who regularly defends the president on cable news.

Recent Democratic presidential nominees such as Clinton, Obama and John Kerry ran as centrists. This is the first election in the modern era, Lanza said, in which progressives ""are sucking up all the oxygen and energy.""

Democrats as a whole, however, have been moving in a more leftward direction for years. According to Gallup polling, the number of Democrats who identify themselves as ""liberal"" has risen from 32 percent in 2001 to 46 percent as of 2018.

That shift has largely been among white, highly educated Democrats. African-American and Hispanic voters remain more moderate — which could present a challenge as the party tries to mobilize those groups to vote in greater numbers.

So far, the moderate wing of the party is under-represented in the 2020 field. Some Democratic strategists are concerned the party did not heed the lesson from last year's congressional elections, when it took power in the U.S. House of Representatives largely through moderate candidates who won over suburban voters by focusing on ""kitchen-table"" issues such as coverage for preexisting medical conditions.

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota is one of the few Democrats in the presidential field to push back at the progressive agenda. At a CNN town hall this week, she called the Green New Deal ""aspirational"" and suggested Medicare for all was only a potential long-term goal.

John Delaney, a former Maryland congressman and a centrist who has gotten little traction as a presidential contender, this week said the 2020 primary ""is going to be a choice between socialism and a more just form of capitalism.""

Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist in the early primary state of South Carolina, said candidates must soon balance sweeping agendas with more pragmatic proposals.

""It has to be a mixed bag of what makes sense and will not cause us long-term political damage,' he said. (Reporting by James Oliphant; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Cynthia Osterman)

Stephen Biegun, named Donald Trump’s special envoy for North Korea six months ago, flew to Hanoi ahead of the Feb. 27-28 meeting in the Vietnamese capital where Trump hopes to get closer to his goal of persuading Pyongyang to give up a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States.

In meetings with his North Korean counterpart, Biegun, a 55-year-old former Ford Motor Co executive, aims to hammer out a joint summit statement showing concrete progress beyond vague commitments agreed by Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at their first meeting in June.

It’s a tall order, even for someone accustomed to tough assignments.

Before joining Ford as head of international government relations, Biegun was handed the job of giving Sarah Palin a crash course in foreign policy when she was John McCain’s 2008 presidential running mate.

Such experience could prove helpful in explaining what is achievable to Trump, who came into office similarly lacking in diplomatic experience and has set his sights on North Korea as one issue he can tout as a major success that has eluded his predecessors.

While Biegun worked for decades as congressional staffer and as a White House foreign policy aide under President George W. Bush, his latest appointment was initially greeted with skepticism, given he was primarily a Russia specialist with little exposure to the complex North Korea problem.

But several North Korea experts who have since advised Biegun told Reuters they have been struck by how methodical he was in taking the time to talk to as many of them as possible and described him as a quick learner.

Nuclear expert Siegfried Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos weapons laboratory in New Mexico who is among those who has met Biegun, said was encouraged by the way Biegun had made up for his lack of specialist knowledge by seeking out the right people.

“What he’s been doing is learning and gathering things. I’m impressed by what he’s done - he’s got good advisers.”

A 16-member team Biegun took with him to Pyongyang for three days of talks earlier this month included missile experts, nuclear experts and specialists in international law.

A Capitol Hill staffer whose Democratic Party has been critical of Trump’s personal approach to North Korea, said Biegun’s attitude appeared “much more realistic than what we’ve heard from the administration thus far.”

“He really stands head and shoulders above the rest ... and comes to this a with a relatively fresh set of eyes, and as someone who isn’t making old assumptions but also who isn’t making the wrong assumptions.”

Biegun has also won admirers in South Korea, where one former senior diplomat said he clearly had experience in handling complex issues and knew how Washington works. “Among all the nuclear envoys I’ve seen for decades, he must be the weightiest,” he said.

However, it will take more than intelligence, gravitas, an open mind and political savvy to convince North Korea to abandon a nuclear weapons program its ruling family has long seen as essential to its survival.

Biegun has avoided formal media interviews, but did deliver a wide-ranging speech at Stanford University on Jan. 31, when he admitted that despite months of U.S.-North Korea talks, the two sides still had no agreed definition of the term “denuclearization.”

And in spite of Trump’s declaration after the last summit that the nuclear threat from North Korea was over, the country has yet to agree to freeze production of fissile material and its missile program, despite a de facto moratorium on nuclear and missile testing since 2017.

Biegun has said he will be seeking both in Hanoi and will also be looking to agree a roadmap for a possibly lengthy post-summit negotiation process.

INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, MILITARY DOUBTS

Yet neither the U.S. intelligence community, nor regional military commanders believe North Korea will agree to give up all of its nuclear weapons.

While welcoming an easing of tensions, critics worry the Trump administration - Biegun included - is now following Pyongyang’s playbook by dropping past demands for complete denuclearization before any concessions.

Trump and U.S. officials insist North Korea’s complete and verified denuclearization remains the ultimate goal, but experts say the mechanics of a negotiated process mean this could take many years - if it happens at all.

Trump’s close involvement could prove a mixed blessing for Biegun.

Unlike predecessors, Biegun has had significant direct contact with Trump, including involvement in White House talks with North Korean officials and an Oval Office meeting with the president in December.

But Trump has sometimes demonstrated a tendency to ignore advisers and act on impulse.

Biegun, according to a veteran American North Korea hand,” is a prisoner ... of a president who has no interest in the substance of the issues.” “The president’s priority is himself - his brand,” the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Biegun is also beholden to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a trusted Trump aide with a reputation for following the president’s marching orders and for rarely contradicting him.

While Pompeo has overall control of North Korea policy, Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, known for hawkish views on a range of global issues, has appeared to fade into the background on North Korea since his calls for the nation’s rapid disarmament nearly derailed the first summit.

The extent of Bolton’s involvement in the Hanoi meeting remains unclear.

Analysts say that for Biegun’s methodical approach to prevail he will need to deliver a semblance of progress in Hanoi. They warn Trump’s taste for a showy moment and apparent lack of patience with the sort of detailed drawn-out haggling any lasting deal will require could complicate Biegun’s task.

Toby Dalton, of the Nuclear Policy Program at Washington’s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who was among Biegun’s advisers, noted he had left himself ample leeway in his Stanford speech for a reason.

237,Empty,2019-02-22T20:15:37Z,Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker is traipsing into a very different fundraising environment when he touches down in Silicon Valley this weekend for three events.,"He is the intermittent faster, the Tim Ferriss podcaster, the first-generation tweeter, the startup founder, the college pal of Reid Hoffman and other Stanford graduates of the early ’90s who built the modern Internet.

If any Democratic presidential candidate has tapped into the Silicon Valley zeitgeist over their careers, it is Cory Booker. And in 2019, that could be as much a political liability as it is a financial asset.

Booker, long the darling of the tech industry and some of its marquee leaders, is traipsing into a transformed Silicon Valley when he touches down in town this weekend for his first fundraising trip here since he announced he was running for president. Friday lunch guests at the San Francisco home of David Shuh, Friday dinner guests at the 9,300-square-foot Piedmont home of Ali Partovi, and Saturday evening guests at the Atherton home of Gary Lauder (an heir to the Estée Lauder beauty empire) are paying up to $2,800 each to rub shoulders with Cory Booker.

Then again, most have probably met him before. The presidential candidate has collected half a million dollars from the internet industry over his five years in the Senate, from people like LinkedIn’s Hoffman, Salesforce’s Marc Benioff, Google’s Eric Schmidt, Emerson Collective founder Laurene Powell Jobs, and early Facebook exec Sean Parker.

Why? He is culturally of this place, donors say.

But times have changed, and Silicon Valley is no longer merely an ATM for Cory Booker.

Twitter is no longer primarily a place to find an elderly man snowtrapped in his home in Newark, like Booker once did — it is now also a cesspool of hate and misinformation. Mark Zuckerberg is no longer a hero brandishing a $100 million check in a well-meaning attempt to save Newark’s schools, like Booker once described him — he is a bogeyman who badly mishandled our last election and is now as divisive as any of the people running for president.

Silicon Valley is itself a minefield that in some ways sums up the broader political challenge for Booker in 2020: He’s running as a liberal on issues including tech regulation, but the progressive left holds him in suspicion — and he could face more as he begins to court tech money more openly.

Booker’s tightrope walk needs to capitalize on his decades of coziness with tech elites and corporate America while not offending the liberal base that has them in its crosshairs.

“Cory Booker is the Manchurian candidate of Silicon Valley. I believe they have cultivated him and groomed him,” said Jamarlin Martin, a 41-year-old political activist who runs a collection of digital media sites serving black audiences. “He’s going to run into problems as the public becomes more aware that he’s in bed with our generation’s Big Tobacco.”

Cory Booker’s super PAC bind

Democrats have dramatically soured on Silicon Valley over the last year: They’re now about evenly split on whether social media companies are good for democracy, for instance. That’s a far cry from a decade ago, when Silicon Valley epitomized the modern, progressive, cool mores of Barack Obama’s Democratic Party.

Cory Booker thought it did, too. Now, he appears less sure.

“The problem we have right now in America,” he told Recode in 2017, “is it is a perversion of the free market where corporate villainy is reigning.”

To understand Booker’s love/hate relationship with Silicon Valley, look no further than how he’s handling the Bay Area’s most prominent outside group so far this primary: the super PAC set up by his Stanford classmate, Steve Phillips.

Phillips and I are sitting in a corner of The Battery, the posh hangout for the tech elite in San Francisco. Phillips isn’t in tech — he’s a lawyer by trade, and a political operative by practice — but he is a key Booker emissary to the world of tech’s mega wealthy.

He’s introduced Booker to the likes of billionaire Salesforce chief Democratic donor Marc Benioff (at Obama’s second inauguration) and to Google super-executive David Drummond. And while Phillips has his detractors in the Democratic fundraising world who think him more flash than substance, according to some Democratic sources, he’s got the ability to raise big money thanks to his marriage into the family of Herb Sandler, one of the Democratic Party’s biggest donors in recent cycles. He’s prioritized mobilization above persuasion, working on behalf of candidates of color like Obama, Stacey Abrams, and even Kamala Harris.

His new group, Dream United, is the only candidate-specific super PAC up and running so far in the 2020 primary. Phillips claims $4 million in commitments to back Booker.

“[Booker] was seen as the senator of Silicon Valley”

“He was seen as the senator of Silicon Valley,” Phillips argued. “There’s this cultural connection that’s a little bit deeper with him.”

But here’s the thing: Just like Booker isn’t totally sure how he feels about Silicon Valley big money, one gets the sense that Booker isn’t totally sure how he feels about his old friend Steve Phillips, either.

Booker has ruled out taking money from corporate PACs, but he’s been hard to pin down on what he thinks should be done with Phillips’s group.

Booker has predictably been asked about how he feels about an outside group that can take millions from billionaires — and his protestations have not been effusive. His campaign has said he opposes super PACs “aiming to support his or anyone’s candidacy for president.”

But when asked last week specifically whether Phillips’s group should be shut down, he would only tell reporters, “I urge anyone and everyone not to have super PACs in this race.” Of course, candidates can’t coordinate with super PACs, so Booker can’t issue instructions to them on how to spend the money — but he’s not exactly washing his hands of them, either.

One tech donor close with the New Jersey senator told me that the word he has gotten from inside the Booker operation is to not cooperate with Dream United. But it’s a hazy instruction, and maybe intentionally so: Booker’s looking for rhetorical cover in a political climate in which super PACs have transformed from a financial necessity into a public-relations vulnerability; Phillips has enough rhetorical cover, too, to claim he hasn’t been totally disavowed.

Phillips said the criticisms of his group are merely “political gamesmanship” and that other Democratic contenders are eagerly accepting max-out $2,800 checks — and “not from waitresses or bus drivers,” as Phillips put it. But Phillips said he doesn’t need Booker’s permission to do the organizing work he has long done in the black community, and that he’s not shutting anything down just because of the moment’s politics.

“The perception of what a super PAC is is a convenient bogeyman. I get that,” he said as he held court in The Battery, where it was hard not to notice that he was one of the only African Americans in the room. “But if there’s a rich person who wants to support black-voter mobilization in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, why would I turn that down?”

Another possible super PAC donor, Los Angeles billionaire surgeon Gary Michelson, who got close with Booker, a fellow vegan, after the senator headlined an animal-welfare banquet in Los Angeles in late 2016, said he was eager for the campaign to clarify its position on the super PAC. Despite Phillips’s claim that Michelson is a financial supporter of Dream United, Michelson told Recode he was willing to donate up to $1 million to the super PAC but had said he wouldn’t make any commitments until he got more information.

“You’re reading the same signals I’m reading. It’s going to have to be better than that,” said Michelson. “I’d have to make sure that this would not go against Cory’s interests or his wishes. I don’t want to hurt someone by helping him.”

Booker’s love affair with Silicon Valley

That, in many ways, sums up Booker’s bind: How can he tap Silicon Valley’s largesse without being caricatured as the candidate of the neoliberal rich?

“The internet happened — and it happened where he went to college at the time he went to college”

Take a look at Booker on policy that matters to tech: He was once a champion of education reform, the cause célèbre of tech donors, but has grown quieter on that issue over time. He has targeted wealthier families with higher taxes as part of a plan to give poor kids money and attack the racial wealth gap, but it’s not as extreme as the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wing of his party.

And while tech policy drives relatively few tech donors, he has similarly tried to walk a fine line.

On the one hand, in a race where presidential candidates are harshly calling out the perils of big tech in their announcement speeches, some tech donors take comfort in the idea that Booker is fundamentally optimistic about their industry. The next president will have wide latitude about how much they actually want to take Silicon Valley to task.

“There are lots of politicians on both sides of the aisle that seem to welcome throwing punches at employers,” Carl Guardino, who has hosted fundraisers for Booker and is the head of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, told Recode. “Cory Booker will never do that.”

But on the other, the politics of tech have changed drastically since Booker first joined Twitter a decade ago, and Booker has spent the last few years grappling with things he might have missed.

Booker has taken a more aggressive stance toward big tech than the unbridled reverence he expressed for it in his early years. On an episode of Recode Decode in 2017, he cast a glaring eye on Amazon, Google, and Facebook — companies that he has long wooed and, if things had played out differently, that he might’ve worked at.

Booker advocates in the Valley are hopeful that his new punchiness toward big tech will insulate him from critiques on the left that he is too close with the players here.

Look at Matt Stoller, a leading Washington voice against the monopoly power of companies like Facebook and Google. You’d expect him to rake Booker over the coals for being in bed with big tech. I did when I called him.

But nope.

“It’s reasonable to consider his relationships with people in Silicon Valley,” Stoller told me. “But he spoke out in 2017 when very few people did.”

Those relationships, though, run deep. In the eyes of many donors here, he is, in their words, “one of us.”

A Stanford man at the dawn of the internet

Booker’s love affair with Silicon Valley began three decades ago when he arrived as a freshman at Stanford. A year behind Hoffman and a year ahead of Peter Thiel, the backup tight end Cory Booker got a little lucky.

“The internet happened — and it happened where he went to college at the time he went to college,” said Gina Binachini, a college friend of Booker’s who is a longtime entrepreneur in the Valley.

Those Stanford connections paid off with introductions. Booker, bursting with potential and ambition, got to know venture capitalists like Lauder, Ron Conway, and Ted Schlein as he was building a national profile in Newark.

Schlein, who met Booker before he became mayor, told me that he’s introduced him to some CEOs out here and has held sessions for him to learn about different parts of tech. Schlein later hosted a fundraising event for Booker at the Rosewood, Silicon Valley’s see-and-be-seen hotel on Sand HIll Road.

And for a young, camera-loving, media-savvy politician, technologies like Twitter were catnip. In 2009, Binachini recalls Booker spending a day at LinkedIn under Hoffman’s tutelage, meeting executives from places like Apple and Facebook, drinking it all in. Now, when every Democratic politician has highly paid digital strategists who can turn Luddites into Snapchat sensations, it’s easy to forget how agile Booker was on these platforms when they were still young.

He was genuinely impressed with these people.

From green tech to social media: inspiring meetings today. Incredible Silicon Valley leaders who are literally changing/empowering the world — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) May 29, 2009

His tightness with the Valley has already given him one buzz-saw experience: Booker was actually a startup co-founder, at a video company called Waywire, and his role at the startup blew up into a controversy during his 2013 Senate race when opponents labeled it a conflict of interest. (Booker eventually donated his shares.) That experience drew him closer to the Valley, though, helping him appreciate just how hard it is to build a successful company, one person who worked with him at the time said.

But Booker’s posture toward Silicon Valley in those early years looks almost naive in the rearview mirror.

Take the now-famous story of how Booker convinced Mark Zuckerberg to invest $100 million into Newark schools in 2010. It was brokered through a venture capitalist, Marc Bodnick, the brother-in-law of Sheryl Sandberg, at the elite media-deals conference in Sun Valley, the so-called “summer camp for billionaires.” The Newark mayor and the Facebook chief found common ground on a walk that Idaho summer. Zuckerberg at that point had never been to Newark. The infusion of cash was announced with glitz and glam on the set of another billionaire, Oprah.

At best, the project had mixed results. Booker’s bet that a tech billionaire could throw enough money at a problem and fix it sounds very quaint in 2019.

Still, all those those controversies, startup travails, Sun Valley visits, and reunions at his alma mater have given Booker a range of possible donors that are the envy of the Democratic field.

But the general sense gleaned from interviews with top Democratic givers and fundraisers in Silicon Valley is that the emphasis right now — above all else — is on a candidate who can win. Booker’s politics are more mainstream than the Elizabeth Warrens of the world, And tech donors, predictably, are technocratic, data-driven, and less convinced that the class warfare waged by the furthest-left candidates is a winning strategy.

“That is the single No. 1 important criterion. Consider the alternative,” said Lauder, Booker’s host this weekend. “If I didn’t think that Cory had a chance, I wouldn’t be doing this.”

It’s important not to overstate Booker’s immediate financial support. I reached out to about two dozen top Democratic donors and fundraisers in the Valley, including some who had backed Booker in previous races, and asked if they planned to endorse him this cycle. It’s hard to find committed donors right now.

Former eBay CEO John Donahoe, a top giver in recent cycles? He’s met with Booker and says he’s “impressed.” But an endorsement? “It’s way too early.”

Kleiner Perkins kingmaker John Doerr told me through a spokesperson, “It’s too early in the process for him to have a sense of who he will support.”

Even Schlein, Doerr’s partner at Kleiner Perkins who has known Booker since before he was mayor, said it’s “very early to endorse anyone yet.”

Silicon Valley’s big donors are torn. But do they even matter anymore?

It’s not a Booker-specific problem. Democratic donors across the country are generally pushing the brakes on early exclusive endorsements of candidates this cycle, in a jump-ball field and with the decisions of several donor-friendly candidates — like Beto O’Rourke, Joe Biden, and even Mike Bloomberg — still to be determined.

Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz — the new hot money in Silicon Valley Democratic politics — is not expected to make any early endorsements in the primary. Hoffman, despite his decades-long relationship with Booker dating back to Stanford, is expected to write $2,800 checks to as many as six Democratic primary candidates but is not going to be using his billions to sway the process, according to a person close to him. That might surprise some Booker supporters who were hoping for Hoffman to advocate for him more publicly.

It is Kamala Harris, leading Democratic fundraisers in the Valley say, who represents the clearest challenge to Booker in the money world here. Her ties to Silicon Valley are less cultural than Booker’s and more rooted in organizational power as an incumbent senator and, before that, a Bay Area politician.

One early get was Susie Tompkins Buell, a close associate of Hillary Clinton and one of her top bundlers, who surprised the Silicon Valley set with her early Harris endorsement this month. Harris is also close with Benioff, who has known her for 30 years, but he’s likely to back several candidates this cycle.

“Kamala is one of the highest-integrity people I’ve ever met and is a phenomenal prosecutor,” Benioff told me. “She is truly an impressive leader with a strong legal and public service background.”

Marc Benioff: “Kamala is one of the highest-integrity people I’ve ever met”

Another person making their preferences public: Ron Conway, a venture capitalist and an influential Democratic powerbroker, listed Harris and Booker as the two candidates he’s backing this cycle.

Booker and Harris “have the greatest understanding of Silicon Valley and have cultivated the deepest relationships,” Conway told me. “Though they won’t always agree with the tech sector’s perspective, they’re generally both allies and each ‘gets it.’”

But times have changed in an era in which Bernie Sanders can raise $6 million within 24 hours of his launch from small donors (more than Phillips has claimed, for instance). How deep the Moskovitzes and Hoffmans and Benioffs and Conways will give during the general election will matter to the nominee. But there is an ascendant belief in the world of Democratic money that the personal preferences of the bagmen matters less than it once did, especially in primaries.

While the well-networked bundler who can collect more max-out contributions will still be in demand, there are not many outside groups for Silicon Valley’s billionaires to back if they’re hoping to give beyond the $2,800 maximum campaigns can accept.

What Sanders showed two elections ago, and O’Rourke one election ago, is that Democrats can be competitive with big-money machines merely with good old-fashioned viral marketing.

“We used to have this invisible primary where reporters would closely follow fundraising numbers,” said Shomik Dutta, an Obama fundraiser who recently joined Harris’s national finance committee. “The first litmus test of strength is now content.”

238,Empty,2019-02-21T16:56:43Z,His 2016 campaign proved to be more than a campaign — it became a movement,"After months of contemplating whether or not he would be entering the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has officially declared, “I’m Bernie Sanders. I’m running for president.” The Vermont senator and self-described “democratic socialist” will have a lot more competition this time: instead of primarily debating Hillary Clinton, Sanders will be up against everyone from Sen. Kamala Harris to Sen. Elizabeth Warren to Sen. Amy Klobuchar (and possibly former Vice President Joe Biden as well if he decides to run). But regardless of whether or not he ultimately receives the Democratic nomination, Sanders’ decision to enter the race is a positive development.

Some of Sanders’ critics in the Democratic Party have painted him as a spoiler who, in 2016, undermined Clinton’s chances of defeating Republican nominee Donald Trump—which is nonsense. Sanders endorsed Clinton, aggressively campaigned for her in the general election and ruled out the possibility of an independent or third-party campaign. But the fact is that Sanders was a major plus for the 2016 Democratic primary because he brought liberal and progressive issues to the forefront. His presidential campaign proved to be more than a campaign—it became a movement. And as journalist Matt Taibbi pointed out in a December 2018 article for Rolling Stone, even Sanders himself was taken aback by the amount of support he received in 2016.

Here are some of the vitally important issues Sanders will likely be addressing during his 2020 Democratic presidential campaign.

1. Climate change

The 2018 blue wave wasn’t exclusively liberal/progressive. Plenty of centrist Democrats were victorious as well, from Sen. Kyrsten Sinema in Arizona to Rep. Abigail Spanberger (a former CIA operations officer) in Virginia. But liberalism enjoyed a larger seat at the table in 2018 with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and all the other left-of-center Sanders allies who won. One of AOC’s top issues is what she describes as a “Green New Deal,” and the “New Deal” part is important because it underscores the influence that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal of the 1930s has on Sanders’ “democratic socialist” movement.

Trump has been vehemently anti-environment, promoting fossil fuels at every turn and pulling the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement. But scientists all over the world realize how dire a threat climate change is, and the Green New Deal will no doubt be one of Sanders’ top issues in the months ahead.

2. Universal health care

In 2016, universal health care was one of Sanders’ top issues: Sanders pushed a Medicare-for-all program, while Clinton favored expanding and reforming the Affordable Care Act of 2010, a.k.a. Obamacare. It was an important debate for Democrats to have, and it will be an important debate for them to have in 2019 and 2020. Sanders and the decidedly centrist Klobuchar have very different views on how to achieve universal health care, but they can agree that Trumpcare would be a disaster. And a robust discussion on the ways in which other major developed countries have increased life expectancy and insured all of their citizens is badly needed.

3. Affordable college tuition

Millennials are not old enough to remember a time when most recent college graduates weren’t burdened with six-figure debts, but the 77-year-old Sanders remembers that time well—and as he runs against Harris, Warren, Sen. Cory Booker and others, he will no doubt have much to say about the exorbitant costs of college education. Sanders, however, also realizes that education doesn’t necessarily have to mean college. Blue-collar trade schools (from electrical work to plumbing to construction) are crucial to the economy as well, and Sanders recognizes the value of both blue-collar education and white-collar education.

4. The federal minimum wage

The United States’ federal minimum wage peaked in terms of buying power in 1968, but in recent years, it hasn’t kept up with the high cost of living: the last federal minimum wage increase in the U.S. was in July 2009, when it reached its current rate of $7.25 per hour. And according to Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data from 2015, the federal minimum wage of 1968 was equivalent to $10.90 per hour in 2015 dollars.

Sanders favors a national minimum wage of $15 per hour, which Republicans claim would bankrupt the country. But then, the GOP said the same thing when the United States’ first federal minimum wage was enacted as part of FDR’s New Deal in the 1930s and all employers had to start paying at least 25 cents per hour. The idea behind the minimum wage was that while all Americans won’t be living in luxury, they shouldn’t starve or be homeless either—and Sanders sees a $15 per hour minimum wage as a key element of revitalizing the New Deal.

5. Voting rights

Voter suppression has a been a high priority for Republicans in recent years, especially when it comes to Americans of color—and Sanders has been stressing the need for Democrats to fight them every step of the way. But he not only sees the need to protect voting rights; the senator also sees the need to promote greater voter participation. And encouraging more, not less, voting is vitally important for Democrats in 2019 and 2020.

6. Banking reform

In October 2018, Sanders introduced a bill to break up the United States’ six largest banks: Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup. As Sanders sees it—and certainly, Sen. Elizabeth Warren as well—there isn’t nearly enough competition in the banking sector. Sanders’ bill was merely symbolic: he obviously knew that a Republican-controlled Senate under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s leadership wouldn’t pass such a bill. But Sanders, by introducing the bill, acknowledged an ongoing threat: if megabanks are “too big to fail,” they’re bad for the economy. And along with Warren, Sanders is easily the most proactive candidate when it comes to addressing the too-big-to-fail crisis.",6 issues Bernie Sanders will bring to the forefront of the Democratic presidential primary,Salon.com,https://www.salon.com/2019/02/21/6-issues-bernie-sanders-will-bring-to-the-forefront-of-the-2020-democratic-presidential-primary_partner/

Three years after he handily won the first-in-the-nation primary against Hillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., leads the Democratic primary field in a newly released survey.

Sanders, who announced his second bid for the presidency last week, received 27 percent of the vote in a survey from Emerson College. The self-identified democratic socialist beat out the reigning 2020 polling champion, former Vice President Joe Biden, by 2 percentage points. Biden is still undecided on a run.

The next three candidates weren't even close: California Sen. Kamala Harris at 12 percent; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 9 percent; and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 8 percent.

The polling breakdown from Emerson also shows Sanders is a stronger liberal candidate than Warren in a general election match up against President Trump.

Although both Sanders and Warren beat Trump in a head-to-head contest, throw in former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering an independent campaign, and only Sanders emerged victorious. He beat Trump 48 percent to 42 percent in that scenario, with Schultz taking 10 percent. Warren dropped below Trump -- 44 percent to Trump's 45 percent -- but was within the margin of error.

The poll also found Trump would trounce former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld by 66 percentage points in a GOP primary contest, fueled by an 80 percent approval rating among Republican voters in New Hampshire. Weld announced earlier this month that he formed an exploratory committee for the Republican nomination.

Some findings that could work against Sanders present themselves in a breakdown of what New Hampshire voters seek in their ideal candidate. Sanders, whose platform includes far-left ideas like ""Medicare for All"" and tuition-free college, could frustrate the 85 percent of respondents who agreed the president should make an effort to work with the other party.

Polling also found that a plurality of New Hampshire voters -- 40 percent -- put their ideal candidate somewhere in the 50s age range. Sanders is 77. By comparison, Trump is 72, Biden is 76, Warren is 69, Harris is 54, and Klobuchar is 58.

Trump's standing among all Granite State voters shows some vulnerability as 52 percent disapprove of him while 43 percent approve.

The entire poll was conducted Feb. 21-22 among 910 registered voters, contains a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points, and its data was ""weighted based on 2016 voter model, age, party affiliation.""

Sanders declared his candidacy on Monday and raised roughly $6 million in the first 24 hours, outpacing his 2020 Democratic rivals. Sanders told The Young Turks he would look for a running mate ""who is maybe not of the same gender that I am, and maybe someone who might be a couple of years younger than me,"" which would please the 38 percent of New Hampshire voters who think a woman should be either president or vice president.

A RealClearPolitics average of Democratic primary polls puts Sanders in second place at 16.8 percent, behind Biden's 27.5 percent.

SACRAMENTO — The California Republican Party, battered by the 2018 midterms and anemic voter registration, has chosen Jessica Patterson, the first woman in its history, as chairwoman following a combative election Sunday that pitted loyalists of President Donald Trump against those from the party establishment.|

The election of Patterson, 38, a Latina mother of two and an ally of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), to lead the nation’s largest state GOP operation into the 2020 election cycle came at the close of a raucous three-day party convention that drew a record 1,500 grassroots delegates to Sacramento.

Story Continued Below

Patterson was the overwhelming choice of elected officials in the state. The CEO of California Trailblazers, a party recruitment and training program for candidates, she won the spot after a tense contest against two grassroots conservative activists who are both vocal backers of Trump: former Assemblyman Travis Allen and Steve Frank, a longtime party insider.

Speaking to delegates after winning a solid 54.6 percent of the votes on the first ballot, Patterson delivered a feisty call for unity — and a promise of future victories — to hungry members of the state GOP, which has been reduced to third-party status in California.

“Today, we are starting the next chapter in our party history,’’ she said. “We’re going to be about one thing: winning. We’re going to take the fight to Democrats. … We’re going to fight them in the precincts and we’re going to beat them in elections.”

In a nod to state Republicans calling for more diversity in their ranks, delegates on Sunday also elected Peter Kuo, an East Bay businessman who is an immigrant from Taiwan, to be its vice chairman and Greg Gandrud, who is openly gay, as its treasurer.

With Patterson’s victory, California Republicans will now be led by a roster of women: Marie Waldron heads the Assembly Republican caucus and Shannon Grove was recently named minority leader in the state Senate.

The dramatic shift in party leadership was cheered by Republican women, who said it signaled a much-needed boost for a party in decline.

“It gave me chills,” Beth Miller, a veteran communications consultant and a former press secretary in the administrations of Gov. Pete Wilson and President George H.W. Bush, said after Patterson’s victory. “She won decisively, and that means that a lot of people want a new direction. She’s come up through the party, and I’m so proud we have elected the first woman, a Latina, a millennial.”

Cassandra Pye, a former adviser to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, said: “I’m really excited … the board looks like California. We have to accept the fact that if we want to attract young voters, we’ve got to have young people at the front. She’s a young mom, she’s got a lot of energy. I love the optics.”

With the latest polls showing two-thirds of Californians disapproving of Trump’s job performance, state Republicans over the weekend wrestled with the question of how much to embrace the President — or hold him at arm’s length and emphasize California-based issues.

Patterson, who says she voted for Trump in 2016, urged the party to steer away from “national issues’’ and to focus in the next election cycle on matters like California’s high housing costs and taxes.

After her election, Patterson sidestepped questions from reporters about whether she would invite the president to California to campaign or raise money. “We’ll have to see how it works,” she said.

Even with the powerful backing of McCarthy, and the lion’s share of California elected officials and party leadership on her team, Patterson faced a weekend of attacks by activists on the far right who charged that she was as part of the failed “establishment” and “elite” in the GOP, which now has fewer registered voters than Democrats or those who have declared “no party preference.”

The tense atmosphere extended to the streets outside, where a altercation between “Make America Great Again” supporters and liberal activists occurred Saturday night outside a “Build the Wall” dinner sponsored by Tea Party activists a few blocks from the convention. Police moved in after demonstrators gathered outside, some wearing bandanas and some chanting, “We welcome immigrants here.”

And across the street from the convention on the steps of the California State Capitol, speakers in support of Allen’s grassroots campaign who wore “Trump 2020” gear and #MAGA hats mingled with members of the extremist and nationalist group Proud Boys as officers on horseback looked on. Speakers railed against “Communist” Democrats running the state, led chants of “Lock her up!” and sung along to a “Build the Wall’’ hip hop tune as rally participants waved signs urging Republicans to “Take Back California.”

Throughout the weekend, tensions also boiled over inside as candidates made impassioned pitches to activist delegates. “My friends told me it’s pretty ugly out there,” said Jim Brulte, the outgoing state party chairman.

Opponents of Patterson’s candidacy shouted “Drain the Swamp” and booed after she delivered a speech touting her endorsements from elected officials; a Frank proponent suggested that Patterson’s supporters had been “paid.” In his speech backing Patterson, San Diego talk show host Carl DeMaio accused Allen of being an “egomaniac” making lofty but undeliverable promises about his ability to lead Republicans in the next cycle.

Patterson, even while urging Republicans to reject divisive politics, repeatedly employed red-meat rhetoric in an effort to corral many of conservatives still on the fence.

“I know who the enemy is … they’re about 500 yard away, in that big white building,’’ she told one caucus, pointing to the Democratic-dominated State Capitol across the street. “Every single day, they come up with silly ideas. … They’re trying to take away our freedoms,’’ she added.

Former Rep. Darrell Issa, whose 49th Congressional District seat flipped to Democrat Mike Levin following his retirement last year, backed Patterson — and acknowledged the challenges facing the withered California GOP in a state where the president is historically unpopular.

The problem today, he told POLITICO, is that “as soon as you say you’re a Republican, you’re at a disadvantage.”

“So you’ve got to position it,’’ he said. “We want to show the party is much more inclusive … that we’re the party that is pro-business, that does not attack people of faith. If we make the party all about who’s in Washington … then, no.”

But Issa said the stakes were high regarding the leadership of the nation’s largest state Republican organization.

“It’s important nationally who our party chairman is,” he said. “We may be blue for a long time, but we’re still an economic engine. And if we’re not represented by both parties, Washington writes you off.”

Despite a consensus among Republican political consultants that Trump’s low approval ratings fueled across-the-ballot losses in November, support for the president was pervasive among party activists. John Cox — the 2018 Republican gubernatorial candidate, who didn’t vote for Trump, yet rode a Trump endorsement into the general election before enduring a historic loss — opened his speech to delegates by predicting to cheers that the president would win a second term.

Supporters of both Allen and Frank said they saw a vote for Patterson as an endorsement of inept party officials that had brought California Republicans to their current nadir, including McCarthy, a Bakersfield Republican.

But Demaio, the talk show host, said it was long past time for California Republicans to focus on California issues — and what he called the state’s mismanagement by Democrats in power — instead of Trump.

“You can go anti-Trump all you want, but at some point, don’t you have to hold the supermajority Democrats accountable here?’’ he said. “The chairman of the California Republican Party has to reinvent the Republican brand … at a time when the brand is also influenced by national politicians. There is a national party, there are national personalities, and we need to get back to issues facing our state.”

Democrats watching the scene rejoiced in the disarray and internecine warfare of the rival GOP, which holds no statewide offices and has been reduced to a minority in both houses of the state Legislature. They said the California GOP’s road to revival heading toward 2020 was blocked by the current occupant of the White House, no matter who was in charge of the state party.

“It’s the political Donner Party of the 21st Century,’’ said Bob Mulholland, a veteran Democratic campaign consultant. “Whether they like it or not, Trump is their national leader and that makes trouble for them. He’s too dominant to hide from.”

So does America even need a Green Party anymore? Or does America need it now more than ever?



The Green Party barely registered notice in 1996 when it fielded its first presidential candidate, who only made it onto the ballot in 22 states. But four years later, nominee Ralph Nader qualified in 43 states and won about 2.7 percent of the popular vote nationwide. Because he drew 95,000 votes in Florida, the famously decisive state in that election, he was accused of handing the presidency to George W. Bush. Nader and his supporters—among others—reject the argument that he spoiled the election, but there’s no denying that the 2000 election established the Greens’ legitimacy and influence as a third party.

Nearly two decades later, the Green Party has lost some of both—though it might still have enough support to tip the results of a presidential election. The party’s two-time nominee, Jill Stein, received just .4 percent of the vote in 2012, but 1.1 percent in 2016. The latter was “enough votes to tip the scales for Donald Trump in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,” claimed Vanity Fair. (More accurately, her vote total in the three key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania was higher than Trump’s margin of victory, but there’s no evidence that Stein’s supporters would have voted for Clinton otherwise. They may have chosen no one at all.) Stein also potentially compromised her party’s legitimacy with her connection to multiple scandals related to the Russia investigation—not to mention her curious comments on vaccines and the health affects of Wi-Fi.

Stein has suggested she won’t seek the party’s nomination in 2020, so there’s potential for a new Green voice. But it’s not yet clear who that will be. Aside from Hawkins and Schlakman, only 12 people have officially declared their candidacy for the Green Party nomination. It’s hard to tell which are serious. Kanye Deez Nutz West most likely is not. But Dario Hunter is, and he’s about as diverse as candidates come: black, gay, Iranian, and Jewish. He’s also an ordained rabbi, a former environmental attorney, and a school board member in Youngstown, Ohio. These qualities all make him an ideal new voice for the party, he said. “If we want to cut through the lack of attention given [to Greens], we need someone who has a loud and clear voice and a tough skin,” he said. “It takes a tough skin to be an openly gay black son-of-an immigrant Jewish rabbi.”

Why should there be attention given to Greens, though, now that Democrats have embraced the Green New Deal? Simple, said Hunter: “This Democratic version of the Green New Deal is watered down. It pales in comparison to ours.”",The Democrats Stole the Green Party’s Best Idea,Newrepublic.com,https://newrepublic.com/article/153127/democrats-stole-green-partys-best-idea

While the level of funding falls short of what President Donald Trump has demanded for his long-promised wall, it’s still a sizable amount that Democrats and Republicans have agreed to spend in two areas of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.

The bipartisan deal allows for the use of any barrier materials previously used, such as steel slats or levee wall systems. It bars the use of new designs, such as the concrete prototypes commissioned by the Trump administration, which continues to push for an extensive border wall but faces legal and congressional challenges after the president declared a national emergency to build it.

And see: How Trump wants to pay for the border wall after invoking a national emergency

The new 55 miles of barriers in Hidalgo and Starr counties likely will get built by companies with previous experience in this type of work, and these companies range from a privately held Texas firm to publicly traded Israeli contractors, according to experts. The firms have a history of giving money mostly to Republican politicians.

“Galveston contractor SLSCO is building some of the current sections in the RGV. If I had to guess, they would be likely to get future contracts as well,” said Reece Jones, author of the book “Violent Borders” and a professor of geography and environment at the University of Hawai‘i.

SLSCO, founded by brothers Todd, Billy and Johnny Sullivan, scored a $166.8 million contract for a border-security project in December, as well as a $145 million deal in November.

Montana-based Barnard Construction Co., given its past experience, also could get a chance to build some of the 55 miles of barriers, according to James R. Phelps, a consultant, author and professor who teaches courses on homeland security at universities such as Nova Southeastern in Florida. Barnard in November won a $172 million contract to build 32 miles of replacement wall in Arizona.

Firms such as SLSCO and Barnard could be “go-to companies” for Customs and Border Protection, the agency that will award contracts for the work, Phelps said. “They know what they’re doing. They can get it done relatively quickly,” he said. CBP is expected to have companies compete for contracts for the 55 miles of barriers, as happened for past border projects. The agency declined to comment, and SLSCO and Barnard didn’t respond to requests for comment.

SLSCO’s three founders contributed significant amounts to individual Republican candidates’ committees or groups tied to the GOP during the 2018 election cycle, giving about $68,000 in total, according to Federal Election Commission filings. One of the founders, Johnny Sullivan, also donated $2,700 to longtime Texas Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee’s campaign committee.

Meanwhile, Barnard Construction founder Tim Barnard contributed about $82,000 to individual Republican candidates’ committees or groups tied to the GOP during the last cycle, according to FEC filings. He also gave $6,000 to three trade groups’ political action committees.

Roles for tech companies and concrete

Companies focused on high-tech border security look particularly well positioned, said Henrietta Treyz, director of economic policy research at investment adviser Veda Partners.

“That’s probably the only place where money is going to actually be rolling out the door, and that’s a huge boon to the companies who are concentrating there,” she said. Democrats appear inclined to keep funding investment in video surveillance, drones and other “smart” tools, and the Trump administration has been promoting high tech, Treyz added.

Such companies include Elbit Systems of America, which has built high-tech border towers in Arizona. The U.S. subsidiary of Israel-based Elbit Systems Ltd. ESLT, -0.21% last month said it’s eager to construct towers in Texas and other border states, according to a Fort Worth Star-Telegram report. In the 2018 cycle, Elbit Systems of America CEO Raanan Horowitz contributed about $12,000 to individual Republican candidates’ committees or groups tied to the GOP, along with $1,000 to Illinois Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider’s committee.

Israel-based Magal Security Systems MAGS, -0.19% , which provides “perimeter intrusion detection systems,” also might get involved. “Magal Security has built much of Israel’s Gaza wall and has been mentioned as a possible contractor for the U.S. wall,” the University of Hawai‘i’s Jones said. The company, listed in Israel and the U.S., has talked up building a “smart” fence along the U.S.-Mexico border, and its shares rallied after Trump’s election but have since pulled back.

The six companies that constructed wall prototypes in 2017 still might end up involved in upcoming border projects given they’ve gone through a traditional bid process and have the feel of “vetted, secure builders,” said Treyz of Veda Partners. They probably would propose “different barriers than we’ve seen thus far,” in part because their designs all reportedly failed key tests, she added. Those six companies were Texas Sterling Construction Co., Fischer Sand & Gravel Co., KWR Construction Inc., Caddell Construction Co., W.G. Yates & Sons Construction Co. and ELTA North America, whose parent company, Israel Aerospace Industries, is on track to have its stock floated on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.

Concrete companies such as Texas-based U.S. Concrete Inc. USCR, +2.25% , Alabama-based Vulcan Materials Co. VMC, +2.10% and North Carolina’s Martin Marietta Materials MLM, +2.09% also might get business from the 55 miles of barriers, even if the barriers are largely made of steel slats or pipes, said Phelps, the professor of homeland security.

“The pipes are actually set in concrete,” he told MarketWatch. “While we may not put a concrete wall above ground, you can’t just stick pipes in the ground and tamp the dirt in around them.”

U.S. Concrete, Vulcan and Martin Marietta didn’t respond to requests for comment. In 2017, U.S. Concrete CEO Bill Sandbrook signaled that his company was interested in bidding for wall-related work.

Bernstein Research in 2016 predicted that Cemex CX, +0.10% , a big seller of cement, concrete and other materials, was best positioned to benefit from Trump’s proposed wall. Phelps, however, was downbeat on the Mexican heavyweight’s prospects when it comes to the $1.375 billion promised for new barriers.

“Trump has been adamant about keeping money in the United States,” he said. “Even though Cemex has a huge U.S. component to their business, the fact is they’re a Mexican company.”

The U.S. provides 25% of Cemex’s annual revenue, above Mexico’s 22% and more than any other country.

The National Ready Mixed Concrete Association, a trade group whose leadership includes executives from U.S. Concrete, Vulcan, Martin Marietta and Cemex, contributed about $433,000 to federal candidates or party committees during the 2018 election cycle, with Republicans receiving 89% of the money.

That’s according to data from OpenSecrets.org, a website tracking money in politics that’s run by a nonpartisan research group, the Center for Responsive Politics. Vulcan and its affiliates contributed about $390,000 to candidates or party groups, with 58% of that going to the GOP and 42% to Democrats, while OpenSecrets.org’s figures show zero or minimal donations by the other two U.S. concrete companies. Cemex’s PAC gave $289,000 to federal candidates, with 83% of that going to Republicans and 17% to Democrats.

244,Empty,2019-02-21T13:15:00Z,A state hearing is entering its fourth day as state officials consider whether to call a new election.,"North Carolina state investigators laid out in detail last week an “unlawful,” “coordinated,” and well-funded plot to tamper with absentee ballots in a US House election that remains uncalled more than three months after Election Day — finally bringing clarity to one of the most bizarre election scandals in recent memory.

The state election board, after hearing four days of evidence indicating fraud and an attempt to conceal the scheme from state investigators, then voted to order a new election. Republican candidate Mark Harris has announced he won’t run in the upcoming campaign.

Now Leslie McCrae Dowless, the local political operative contracted by Harris’s campaign whose activities were at the center of the investigation, has been indicted on three counts of obstruction of justice, two counts of conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice, and two counts of possessing an absentee ballot in violation of state law, according to the Wake County prosecutor’s office.

During last week’s hearing, state investigators established their theory of the case — that Dowless directed a coordinated scheme to unlawfully collect, falsely witness, and otherwise tamper with absentee ballots — and workers who said they had assisted him in the scheme delivered damning testimony. The hearing’s first day ended with Dowless, under the advice of his attorney, refusing to testify before the election board.

In the following days, a top political consultant for Harris’s campaign and the candidate’s own son gave remarkable testimony of their own about the decision to hire Dowless. The consultant, Andy Yates, and John Harris both insisted Harris did not know what Dowless was doing and proved too trusting about the operative’s claims. Yet John Harris did say he warned his father that Dowless’s prior work on absentee ballots seemed like it could be illegal, a warning that went unheeded by the candidate. As his son closed his testimony with a few kind remarks about his parents, Mark Harris was in tears.

The proceedings lasted four days, with Harris taking the stand on the final day.

But before he did, the board revealed that Harris’s campaign had produced new evidence the night before Harris was to testify: previously undisclosed contacts between the candidate and Dowless. Harris’s attorneys said they had misunderstood the extent of the investigation’s request. Democratic attorney Marc Elias referred to the documents as “explosively important.” He asked the court to consider the way in which the evidence was released as “adverse interference” by the Harris team.

Harris then spent most of the final day being grilled about his relationship with Dowless, before he made the stunning admission that the evidence demanded a new election be held. He had been the apparent winner on Election Night over Democrat Dan McCready, by less than 1,000 votes.

The election board — made up of three Democrats and two Republicans — had finally reconvened after Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper named new members amid an unrelated legal dispute. They reviewed the evidence in the case over two days and then voted to call for a new election at the hearing’s conclusion.

Under state law, the board was able to call a new election if the basic fairness of the election was tainted. It didn’t matter whether the number of votes in dispute would have been enough to swing the outcome.

There will first be a new primary election, required by a recently passed state law, that will determine the Democratic and Republican candidates. The timing for the new elections will be announced soon.

What we’ve learned about the alleged ballot tampering at the state hearing

It’s important to remember two things about absentee ballots in North Carolina: Anybody can request one, and at the end of every day before the election, state officials publish a file of which voters requested an absentee ballot by mail and whether they have returned it to be counted.

A campaign could check that file every morning to know how many registered Republican, Democratic, and unaffiliated voters had requested and returned a mail-in ballot.

“From a mechanics point of view, this is a gold mine of information for candidates and their campaign,” Bitzer told me previously.

That treasure trove of data would have given Dowless and the people he worked with a detailed picture of how many absentee ballots were coming in every day from Republican, Democratic, and unaffiliated voters — and, by extension, how many absentee ballots they needed from their voters to keep pace with the Democrats.

Indeed, some of the workers who testified before the board Monday described Dowless discussing with other operatives how the state of the absentee ballot count. Harris even allegedly asked Dowless at one point about his apparent confidence in the state of play in the election.

Investigators working on behalf of the North Carolina election board started Monday’s hearing by laying out the contours of the ballot tampering scheme, which they say was led by Dowless, and then questioned Lisa Britt and several other women who worked for him.

Britt, who was Dowless’s stepdaughter for a time and said she remained close to him, said she believed that she and Dowless had done something wrong. But she insisted more than once that the GOP candidate, Harris, had not been privy to the plot.

Between the opening statement from investigators, Britt’s testimony and corroborating testimony from other witnesses, here is what we learned about the alleged ballot tampering scheme:

State investigators said Dowless had used absentee ballot request forms for prior elections to “pre-fill” forms for the 2018 election and sent out workers to find the voters so they could sign the forms and request a ballot — they described this as “Phase One.”

The workers allegedly presented the forms to Dowless and received a payment from him, based on how many they brought in, and then sent the forms to the board of elections.

At least 780 absentee request forms were allegedly submitted by Dowless or one of his workers.

For “Phase Two” of the operation, investigators said, Dowless sent out workers to collect the absentee ballots from voters.

Some of the ballots the workers collected had not been signed by witnesses or had not been sealed and the workers again took those ballots to Dowless and received payment in return.

Dowless held on to the returned ballots and instructed workers to falsely sign as witnesses for some of the ballots he collected, according to investigators.

To avoid raising the suspicions of state officials, the ballots were mailed in small batches, from post offices near the voters’ homes, and the workers made sure that the dates of their signatures and even the ink they used matched that of the voters.

Britt affirmed much of the investigators’ case in her testimony, testifying that she had collected ballots, that Dowless had instructed people to sign ballots they had actually not been there to witness, and that she had signed her mother’s name on some ballots so they would not raise suspicion from the state board.

Britt testified that if the ballots were left unsealed and there were elections left blank, she would fill in some of the empty offices — again, this was done to avoid arousing suspicion from state election officials. (She did say she had never filled in Harris’s name on a ballot, because voters would usually fill in at least the congressional race and a few others.)

Britt also testified that Dowless had reached out to her shortly before Monday’s hearing and provided her with a statement so she could plead the Fifth during her testimony.

Collecting an absentee ballot for another person and falsely witnessing a ballot — two of the allegations made in the witnesses’ testimony — are violations of state law, according to state investigators.

Britt, Andy Yates and John Harris have been emphatic that Harris was not aware of the plan. Investigators and Democratic lawyers still grilled Yates about his failure to identify Dowless’s prior criminal history while he was working for Yates’s firm on Harris’s campaign. John Harris also told the board that he had warned his father that Dowless might have conducted illegal electioneering in previous elections — but his father hired Dowless anyway.

State investigators also said they had not been able to conclude whether early voting numbers were improperly shared with third parties, one of the other allegations that had been made in the sworn affidavits that jump-started the fraud scandal.

The number of not-returned absentee ballots in the Ninth was unusually high

Most of the attention has focused on two counties in the Ninth: Bladen and Robeson, in the southeast corner of the state near the South Carolina border. Notably, each of the affidavits provided by Democratic attorneys involved voters in Bladen County, and one man said that Dowless himself had stated he was working on absentee ballots for Harris in the county.

Bitzer documented the unusual trend in those counties: They had a much higher rate of mail-in absentee ballots that were requested but not returned, compared to other counties in the Ninth District.

And at the district level, according to Bitzer’s calculations, the Ninth had a much higher rate of unreturned absentee ballots than any other district in North Carolina.

Bitzer also found that the share of votes Harris received from mail-in absentee ballots in Bladen was remarkably high. It was the only county where the Republican won the mail-in absentee vote, earning 61 percent to McCready’s 38 percent.

Strangely, though, based on the partisan breakdown of absentee ballots accepted in the county, Harris would have needed to win not only all the Republican ballots but also almost every single ballot from voters not registered with either party and a substantial number of Democratic ballots as well.

In other words, according to the data, Harris seems to have benefited from an oddly high share of votes in these two counties, where an operative of his was allegedly working. Now substantial evidence of ballot tampering has been presented at a state hearing that could, at its conclusion, lead to a new election being called in the North Carolina Ninth.","The bizarre election fraud hearings that could lead to a new House election in North Carolina, explained",Vox.com,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/18/18229711/north-carolina-election-fraud-board-hearing-mark-harris
245,Empty,2019-02-24T11:53:46Z,"Yes, it’s true: The man who wants to build a wall to keep out immigrants is winning over just enough Latinos to get re-elected. Unless Democrats figure out how to stop him.","David S. Bernstein is a contributing political analyst at WGBH News in Boston.

When President Donald Trump tweeted, on January 20, that he had reached 50 percent approval among Hispanic-Americans, most fair-minded observers reacted with skepticism, if not outright disbelief. Trump was, after all, still the same man who announced his candidacy by accusing Mexico of sending “rapists” across the border, the same man who ordered refugee children separated from their parents, the same man who has made building a wall to shut out migrants the focal point of his presidency. Yet here he was, crowing characteristic bravado: “Wow, just heard that my poll numbers with Hispanics has gone up 19%, to 50%. That is because they know the Border issue better than anyone, and they want Security, which can only be gotten with a Wall.”

So, when even the pollsters responsible for the data Trump was touting—Marist Institute for Public Opinion, for NPR and ""PBS NewsHour""—cautioned of the high margin of error for that subset, and a possible over-sampling of Republicans, many on the left promptly dismissed it as an anomaly.

Story Continued Below

One month later, however, and Trump is making an aggressive play for Hispanic-American votes in Florida and beyond. Meanwhile, polls suggest Marist might have been onto something—and that Democrats should be worried that Hispanic voters could help reelect Trump and keep the Senate in Republican control. If so, it would be a cosmic twist of fate: A party that has staked its future on a belief that America’s demographic picture is changing decidedly in its favor could find itself losing to a man whose politics of fear should be driving precisely those voters into the Democrats’ waiting arms.

In theory, the rosy predictions that once gave rise to chest-beating liberal books like “The Emerging Democratic Majority” are proving true: 2020 will be the first U.S. election in which Hispanics make up the largest racial or ethnic minority in the electorate, according to the Pew Research Center. Pew estimates that 32 million Hispanics will be eligible to vote—a full 2 million more than eligible black voters and more than 13 percent of the electorate. Hispanics figure to constitute at least 11 percent of the national vote, as they did in 2016 and 2018.

Many expected Hispanics to vote overwhelmingly against Trump in 2016. A Latino Decisions poll conducted just before the 2016 presidential election found Trump had the support of just 18 percent of Hispanics. But the actual figure was 28 percent, which—given Trump’s incendiary rhetoric about immigrants—some analysts and pundits refused to believe from exit polls until further studies confirmed it. That was just as good as Mitt Romney, as the 2012 Republican nominee, did with Hispanics—and it was enough to help Trump squeak an Electoral College victory.

If Hillary Clinton had improved her share of the Hispanic vote by just 3 percentage points in Florida (from 62 percent to 65 percent of the Hispanic vote) and Michigan (from 59 percent to 62 percent), she would have won both states and their combined 45 Electoral College votes. That would have been enough to make her president. Slightly bigger swings—let alone the Democrats’ 88 percent-8 percent margin among African-Americans—could have added Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin into the blue column as well.

Now, here’s the brutal truth for Democrats: If Hispanic Americans are in fact showing surging approval of Trump, he could be on his way to matching or exceeding the 40 percent won by George W. Bush in his 2004. If Trump does 12 percentage points better than his 2016 numbers with the growing Hispanic vote, it pretty much takes Florida, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina off the table for Democrats, who would need to sweep Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to reach the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House. At the same time, that 12-point shift would give Trump a clear shot at winning Colorado and Nevada, states where Hispanic voters make up well over 10 percent of the electorate and where Clinton won by 5 percentage points or less in 2016.

And if the Democratic path to the presidency looks hard without overwhelming Hispanic support, control of the Senate looks almost impossible. Any realistic scenario to gaining the necessary three seats—four if Trump retains the presidency—requires Democrats to defeat incumbents Cory Gardner in Colorado and Martha McSally in Arizona. Both states have higher than average Hispanic electorates. Gardner won his seat in 2014 by evenly splitting the Hispanic vote. McSally, who was just appointed to succeed John McCain, narrowly lost her 2018 race to Kyrsten Sinema by winning 30 percent of the Hispanic vote in her state. Any improvement among Hispanics for Republicans—or even just a lack of enthusiasm for turning out to vote against Trump—could easily return Gardner and McSally to the Senate and leave Democrats in the minority.



***

Let’s take a closer look at the numbers.

A new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll found Trump’s approval rebounding to 45 percent overall, with Hispanic approval jumping sharply—to 42 percent, after bottoming out at 22 percent on January 21. That result, like the early Marist number, suffers from a high margin of error. A more conservative rolling average puts the figure at around 35 percent, and rising.

Other polls also show Trump in the mid-30s with Hispanics. An Economist/YouGov poll found 32 percent approval rating among Hispanics; another from The Hill and HarrisX has it at 35 percent. In mid-January, Reuters/Ipsos found his approval among Hispanics at 36 percent, the highest since the 2016 election.

That’s about where Trump’s Hispanic approval spent most of 2018, according to previous POLITICO/Morning Consult polls, but about 10 points above where Reuters/Ipsos and Gallup polling showed him throughout the year. Whether keeping pace or on the rise, these polls suggest that Hispanics are responding to Trump as president more like Americans as a whole—close to 45 percent of whom approve of Trump—than like African-Americans, whose Trump approval remains around 10 percent.

That doesn’t necessarily translate into votes, Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. Despite that 50 percent approval rate, his poll found that only 27 percent of Hispanics said that they definitely plan to vote for Trump in 2020, with 58 percent definitely voting against him. Still, a definite 27 percent, if accurate, is equal to the percentage of Hispanic voters who chose Trump in 2016 (28 percent), or Mitt Romney over Barack Obama in 2012 (27 percent), or Republicans in the 2018 congressional midterms (29 percent).

There appears to be room for growth. Morning Consult’s polling showed Trump approval among Hispanics at or above 40 percent for much of his first year in office, perhaps in something of a grace period, to which he could return.

And remember: pollsters in 2016 thought Trump would get only about 18 percent of the Hispanic vote; he actually got 28 percent. If polls are, for some reason, still underestimating his appeal among Hispanics by a similar margin, he could be on his way to 40 — and reelection.



***

So why might Trump be suddenly surging with Hispanic voters?

It’s easy to assume that all Hispanic-Americans must detest and disapprove of the president who derides and vilifies immigrants coming across the southern border. But that hasn’t been the reality. Hispanics make up a large, diverse population that does not act as a monolith.

As a whole, Hispanic-Americans are becoming politically more and more like non-Hispanic white Americans. Two-thirds of the Hispanic electorate is now American-born, and Hispanic voters are far more likely to approve of Trump than naturalized immigrants, according to Pew Research Center data. They remain more Democratic than non-Hispanic white voters in part because so many of them are young adults and share many of their generation’s progressive views.

But as FiveThirtyEight recently noted, Hispanic Democrats are considerably less liberal than others in the party. Hispanics make up about 12 percent of those who identify as Democrats or who tend to lean Democratic; but they are 22 percent of Democrats who describe themselves as moderate or conservative. Hispanics, roughly half of whom are Catholic (and another quarter who are former Catholics), skew conservative on social issues, including abortion.

After Trump’s midterms misfire of trying to rally the Republican base through immigrant-bashing, there is evidence, too, that the 2020 playbook will return to the more tried-and-true method of characterizing Democrats as extreme leftists. He, and other leading Republicans, are criticizing Democrats more on abortion, taxes and “socialist” positions on health care and climate change. He’s also made a targeted appeal to Cuban-Americans in Florida by vocally supporting the overthrow of Nicolás Maduro, the socialist dictator in Venezuela. There is good reason to think that those efforts will be effective on Hispanic voters—or, at least, effective enough.

The Democratic Party hasn’t been wowing them. Hispanic approval of congressional Democrats, and of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer individually, is poor. There are few, if any, elected Democratic Hispanics who are national household names. After Clinton passed on the opportunity to put a Latino on the national ticket in 2016, the 2020 presidential field has just one Hispanic in the mix: Julián Castro, who has been overshadowed by a white fellow Texan, Beto O’Rourke.

Meanwhile, Democrats’ hope of a deal to protect Dreamers — immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children — ended with nothing to show for it. Immigration reform and labor issues have taken a back seat in the Democratic-controlled House to climate change, health care, and gun control—similar to what happened the last time Democrats took control of the House, in 2009.

And most importantly, things are pretty good for most Hispanic-Americans. Trump is correct that they have enjoyed record-low unemployment rates, notwithstanding a small uptick at the start of this year. And, despite all of Trump’s rhetoric, and the fear it induced, not much has changed for most Hispanic families in the U.S. Deportations are a little down from Obama administration peaks, while immigrant arrests are a little up.

The good economy might be Obama’s doing more than Trump’s, but regardless, it’s a powerful incentive to keep the current political leadership in place.

None of this is to suggest that Hispanics are entering a prolonged love affair with Trump. But it does mean that the eventual Democratic nominee can’t simply assume that Hispanic voters will flock to the polls to prevent Trump's second term. If anything, the challenge for the party looks tougher than in 2016—when it arguably cost them the White House.",Trump’s Secret to Victory in 2020: Hispanic Voters,Politico,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/24/2020-hispanic-voters-donald-trump-225192

Since 2016, however, Sanders has dedicated a significant amount of his time and energy to global affairs.

He's delivered two major speeches on foreign policy, one at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in October 2018 and another in September 2017 at Westminster College— where Winston Churchill gave his infamous ""Iron Curtain"" speech.

Sanders is also leading the charge on a Senate resolution to end US support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen.

Matt Duss, 46, has been at Sanders' side as his foreign policy adviser throughout this shift, and he'll be helping the senator craft his approach to global affairs along the campaign trail.

Duss, a staunch progressive who broke into the political world as a blogger, has gained prominence among left-leaning foreign policy wonks and added significant credibility to Sanders on matters of global import.

Sanders' bold approach to domestic politics is reflected in his views on foreign affairs, which at times makes him a fringe figure in Congress. In recent days, for example, he's been criticized by some congressional Democrats for not recognizing Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's legitimate leader and for not referring to Nicolas Maduro as a dictator.

Duss spoke with INSIDER last week, offering an intimate view into how Sanders sees the world and what the senator will be prioritizing along the campaign trail. He also addressed the criticism Sanders has received on the subject of foreign policy, and why he feels much of it is unfounded.

Editor's Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

INSIDER: Sanders faced a fair amount of criticism in 2016 for not having a clear foreign policy vision. How has Sanders evolved since and has he made it more of a priority?

Duss: He certainly has made it more of a priority. There's a great deal of evidence for that, not only in the statements he's made, speeches he's given, but also substantively and legislatively. The Yemen war powers resolution is the most prominent example of [Sanders] being more aggressive on the issue of foreign policy and adding it to the progressive agenda.

Coming out of 2016, we recognized that he had a much bigger platform, a much bigger opportunity to move things in a progressive direction and the importance of making foreign policy part of that, which is why he asked me to join the staff.

INSIDER: There are strong anti-interventionist sentiments on both sides of the aisle right now. Barack Obama was fairly critical of the US in a similar way back in 2008, but faced accusations of being unpatriotic as a result. Could Sanders face similar attacks?

Duss: He certainly will. We're seeing it right now with some of the attacks he's getting even from some Democrats on Venezuela.

But there are shared concerns amongst progressives and conservatives about American militarism, the costs, and many unintended consequences of this kind of interventionism that has guided our approach certainly since 9/11, but even before that.

The Yemen resolution, the fact that [Sanders] introduced it with Republican Mike Lee as an original co-sponsor as well as Democrat Chris Murphy — that's an illustration of this, right? Sen. Sanders and Sen. Lee don't agree on a great deal, but they strongly came together around this idea that not only do we need to take a hard look at some of these interventions we're supporting, but we also need to take a hard look and reassert Congress' constitutional authority over these interventions.

This is where you see a sharp difference between Trump's approach and Sen. Sanders' approach. Trump and a lot of the conservatives who support him see international relations in very zero-sum terms: If someone else is winning the US is losing; the US needs to dominate all these relationships.

Sen. Sanders does not see it in those terms, he sees it in very much a positive-sum way: We can all gain when we are working together, multilaterally. We have shared problems and challenges, so we need shared solutions.

INSIDER: You recently told The Nation what it meant to you when in 2008 you heard Obama say he didn't just want to end the Iraq War, he wanted to end ""the mind-set"" that got the US into the war in the first place. But once he entered the White House, Obama encountered a reality that made it difficult to deliver on his campaign's idealistic foreign policy vision. If elected, could Sanders face a similar reality as president?

Duss: That statement [from Obama] meant a lot to me and a lot of other young progressives that I know for a reason — it really captured something.

But let's remember that when Obama came into office he had a financial crisis. There was a lot going on and Obama had an idealistic idea of turning the ship on a number of things, including foreign policy. I don't ding him too hard for some of the decisions he made, they made a great deal of sense at the time. In retrospect, some of the decisions led to really problematic outcomes now, such as the decision not to investigate fully the use of torture or other things like that.

Any president has to deal with the world as it is when they take office. But what Sen. Sanders recognizes is building that kind of movement around this idea, and starting a much more robust conversation and a real political consensus about what America's role in the world should be.

Now that's challenging, right? Because foreign policy is not something that is very immediate to a lot of Americans for obvious reasons, but grounding it in this discussion about how we treat ourselves, how we treat our own society, what kind of society we want it, how that is reflected in our foreign policy is the way to go about it.

INSIDER: Congress essentially abdicated its war-making authority with the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) in 2001 — which has since allowed presidents to wage an expansive, ill-defined, global war on terrorism with few obstacles. Will Sanders call for repealing the AUMF along the campaign trail?

Duss: He will be focusing on that. He has said that Yemen is important in itself because it's a humanitarian crisis. The US shouldn't be supporting the Saudi coalition.

There's the constitutional question of congressional oversight and of reining in these wars, and that relates to the broader set of issues about the 2001 AUMF and the global war on terror. He will be talking about these things.

INSIDER: Does the Yemen resolution have a realistic shot in the Senate? Does Sanders' forceful criticism of Trump jeopardize the fate of the resolution?

Duss: It does have a realistic chance. We have 51 of the 56 who voted with us in December — they're still in office. Plus we have two new members of the Democratic caucus, both of whom have indicated that they will vote with the caucus, which puts us at 53. We only need 51 votes to move through every stage of this process.

The Trump administration will put a lot of pressure on Republicans to peel off this thing. But it's the same resolution that passed two months ago. The humanitarian crisis [in Yemen] has only gotten worse.

INSIDER: Sanders' criticism of Israel, particularly on the debate stage in 2016, is notable for multiple reasons. He's Jewish and less susceptible to accusations of anti-Semitism. But it's politically risky. Does Sanders want to radically alter the US-Israel relationship or is he more concerned with the rights of Palestinians and related humanitarian issues?

Duss: I don't think he wants to radically reorient the relationship. He's been clear he supports Israel's right to exist, he supports the two state solution.

But going back to that debate you mentioned, his point about [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] has been borne out many, many times. We just saw this week with Netanyahu literally forming an alliance with fascists, people who are identified as terrorists.

But the approach [Sanders] would support, and has supported, is one that is consistent with our relationships with other countries, which is to say: we support the rights of Israelis and Palestinians to live in security and dignity. And we have to recognize when policy, for example the settlements or the occupation, undermine those goals. So the US needs to speak clearly about that and when necessary we need to take steps to put pressure to stop those policies. [Sanders is] going to be willing to do that.

INSIDER: Sanders has been accused of being too soft on dictatorial leaders like Fidel and Raul Castro, Daniel Ortega, and more recently Nicolas Maduro. Is any of this criticism fair?

Duss: There are times where he's definitely pushed back on some of the reflexive hawkishness of the establishment. But he's always been consistently for human rights and self-determination.

His statement on Maduro, if you go back to what he initially said, reflects that. He's very clear about Maduro's abuse of his population and the corruption.

But that doesn't mean that we endorse Trump's approach here. It's making sure that the approach is consistent and grounded in a set of principles — human dignity, human security.

INSIDER: Sanders is also facing criticism for not recognizing Juan Guaidó as the legitimate leader in Venezuela, including from Democrats in Congress, as the US and many of its allies take a stand against Maduro. From the senator's perspective, how should the US approach the crisis in Venezuela?

Duss: No one is defending Maduro — the senator certainly is not doing that.

But coming out as Trump has done and sort of putting the US in the lead — just completely recognizing Guaidó as the president— and putting the US four-square behind the opposition, has the potential to create some possible outcomes that the US is not quite prepared for.

There are also other people the US could be talking to. It's unfortunate that the Trump administration did not pursue the opening with Cuba that the Obama administration started, because talking to Cuba right now could actually be really useful.

INSIDER: That's an interesting point because Trump is clearly open to dialogue with North Korea, and has defended the notion of talking to your enemies, even as he went after Obama over reopening dialogue Cuba and Iran. What's Sanders' view on this?

Duss: Sen. Sanders was perhaps the only member of the Democratic office to actually compliment Trump's last summit with Kim Jong Un for that reason. Talking is better than threats.

INSIDER: So, if we ultimately have a President Bernie Sanders, would we also see more dialogue with America's geopolitical adversaries?

Duss: We certainly would. We'd be clear about the values and the outcomes the US favors — self-determination and human rights, respect for people's dignity and their security.

But the fact is the US is extraordinarily powerful and we don't have to fear sitting down with anyone, whether it's the North Koreans, whether it's Iran, whomever.

INSIDER: Trump has a record of praising dubious world leaders and Sanders has referred to the president as an ""authoritarian."" Do you agree with the senator?

Duss: [Trump] is certainly behaving in authoritarian ways. There's some ways in which he is being constrained.

But certainly using the bully pulpit, the huge megaphone that he has on Twitter and elsewhere, to attack the press, to attack progressives, to attack all kinds of people — these have consequences.

We've seen violence against the media. We saw this guy who was just arrested planning this huge attack.

Leaders in other countries take notice of what the president of the US says. In talking to activists in other countries, there is no question in their mind that they feel that their oppression and [their leader's] use of these tools to control, oppress, and persecute their own people is being affirmed by the president of the US. That's a huge problem.

INSIDER: If you had to summarize Sanders' worldview as succinctly as possible, what would you say?

Duss: He sees the US as a kind of global facilitator by virtue of our enormous economic, diplomatic power. The US has the ability to bring parties, states, and people around tables to address common challenges that really no other country has.

That doesn't mean that the US needs to run to the head of every parade or be in charge of everything — certainly not. But the US does have a role to play in facilitating multilateral cooperation, conversation, and innovation.",Q&A WITH MATT DUSS: Bernie Sanders' foreign policy adviser breaks down the senator's progressive global agenda for 2020,Business Insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/matt-duss-bernie-sanders-foreign-policy-adviser-2019-2

The Senate on Monday rejected a bill making it a felony for a doctor to harm or neglect an infant who survives an “attempted abortion,” part of a Republican effort to squeeze Democrats ahead of the 2020 campaign.

The vote split mainly along party lines, 53-44. Democratic Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Doug Jones of Alabama and Joe Manchin of West Virginia crossed the aisle to vote for it; no Republicans broke ranks. Sixty votes are required for the bill to advance.

“Evidently the far left is no longer convinced that all babies are created equal,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

Ahead of the vote, the bill’s Republican sponsors and outside anti-abortion groups lobbying for its passage made it clear that the intent of Monday’s vote was to undermine the growing pool of Senate Democrats running for president.

In a speech just before the vote, bill author Sen. Ben Sasse quoted campaign stump speeches by Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and independent Bernie Sanders vowing to look out for society’s “voiceless and vulnerable” and accused them of hypocrisy for opposing his bill’s regulations for the care of newborns.

""Was that all just clap track for the campaign trail and for soundbites? Or do people mean the stuff that they say around here?"" he said of his colleagues with White House aspirations.

Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group closely allied with Hill Republicans and the Trump administration, said Monday that it was “watching this vote closely to see whether leading Democratic candidates for president in 2020 will go on the record for or against infanticide.”

""This bill is important in itself but it‘s also important as a setup for the coming election, where there will be a stark contrast between the president of the United States and any one of the Democratic nominees,"" SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in an interview. She stood just outside the Senate chamber lobbying senators as they entered to cast their votes.

Sanders, Harris, Warren, Booker and Gillibrand all voted against the measure. Sherrod Brown, another Democratic senator exploring a White House bid, complained to POLITICO that the vote was held in bad faith.

""This is pure Mitch McConnell. It's all aimed at keeping his base in line, while the president grows increasingly unpopular,"" the Ohio Democrat said. ""We're not doing infrastructure, we're not doing health care. We're not doing anything that matters to help our country. It's just votes on abortion and other kinds of divisive votes he's going to bring.""

Democrats and reproductive rights advocates blasted the bill, saying it's already a felony to harm or neglect an infant and that the “medically irresponsible” bill would restricts doctors from making case-by-case decisions about what is best for infants and mothers.

""This bill is not about protecting infants, as Republicans have claimed — because that is not up for debate and it is already the law,"" said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). ""This bill is government interference in women’s health care, in families’ lives, and in medicine on steroids.""

The bill was previously introduced in the House by now-Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.). Sasse first tried to force a vote on it earlier this month, capitalizing on a wave of outrage among conservatives after New York loosened its restrictions on third-trimester abortions and embattled Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam gave an interview defending similar efforts in his state.

Democrats led by Murray objected to that fast-track procedure and blocked a floor vote, prompting Republicans to vow to try again.

Susan B. Anthony list said earlier this month that even though the Senate lacks the votes to pass abortion restrictions, it should continue to hold votes to put pressure on Democrats and divide the caucus. The move is part of a larger strategy designed to maintain current abortion restrictions while revving up the GOP’s conservative base ahead of 2020 and courting independents who may be turned off by Democrats' position on abortion rights.

""We're seeing a gradual movement to hammer a wedge right into the middle of the Democratic Party, and at some point soon here, they're just going to have to cry mercy,"" Dannenfelser said.","Senate defeats anti-abortion bill, as GOP tries to jam Dems",Politico,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/senate-defeats-anti-abortion-bill-1185531

Nomiki Konst, the 35-year-old TV pundit casting herself as the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of the New York public advocate’s race, readily acknowledges that her background is politically unconventional.

She’s wandered from Tucson to Buffalo to Florida to Los Angeles to New York City, from one cause to the next. It’s all, her aides say, part of a bildungsroman that naturally culminates in a run for an office that’s second in line to the mayor of the biggest city in America.

Story Continued Below

Like Ocasio-Cortez, Konst has not risen through traditional Democratic channels. She identifies as a Democratic Socialist. Her campaign depicts her as one in a movement of millennial women finding their voices. But for someone campaigning for a job to keep fellow city leaders honest, her own personal history is hard to pin down.

“The last decade and a half have been very tumultuous for millennials,” Konst told POLITICO.

Konst came to POLITICO’s office on Tuesday to discuss her background and her aspirations for the office of public advocate. POLITICO followed up with 19 fact-checking questions that same night. Citing debate preparations, she declined to answer those questions, some simple queries like what year she graduated from college, and how much of her life she spent in Tucson. The campaign ultimately declined to answer many of the questions.

“Given that this election is less than 4 days away, it is simply impossible to accommodate this request on this timeline,” emailed campaign manager Dominique Shuminova on Thursday evening.

Certain things are clear: She is a sometimes-magnetic TV personality who spent two years roving the country for The Young Turks, an openly ideological news outlet that is, in many ways, the left’s answer to Breitbart.

She can credibly lay claim to being a social media “influencer,” with a robust Twitter following of 84,000. And she has a peripatetic background populated by ventures that have gone bust: from an aborted run to succeed Gabby Giffords in Congress in Arizona, to the founding of a now-defunct Los Angeles civic organization, to the creation of a now-defunct journalism enterprise.

Konst has an uncanny ability to ingratiate herself with influential people, and she is adept at getting herself on TV, where she appears poised and eager to throw rhetorical bombs. She’s demonstrated a Zelig-like ability to appear around insurgent Democratic primary candidates in New York.

In the 17-person race to succeed now-Attorney General Letitia James as public advocate — a race that will be decided in a special election next Tuesday — she also appears to be making some headway.

In the last month, Konst has raised more money than the other candidates, bringing in more than $80,000 in donations. Mayor Bill de Blasio’s press secretary has donated to her. So have Susan Sarandon and Rosario Dawson. Renee Cafaro — a progressive heir to a real estate development fortune and a former aide to former Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer and former Gov. David Paterson — hosted a fundraiser for Konst at her Plaza Hotel spread earlier this year.

“She has a real grassroots feel to her, which I love,” Cafaro said.

Konst’s campaign manager helped state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi defeat Independent Democratic Conference leader Jeff Klein in 2018.

And Konst was one of just seven candidates to have raised and spent enough money to appear in Wednesday’s public advocate debate, during which she aggressively attacked the other candidates, accusing them of taking donations from real estate developers. She even suggested that NY1 moderator Errol Louis, who threatened to cut her mic after interrupting other candidates, was trying to “silence women.” (Louis didn’t cut the mic as he did for Bo Dietl in the 2017 mayoral debate.)

“I think the people who come from our side of the left kind of organize quietly,” Konst said. “And then sometimes the establishment doesn’t necessarily see what’s happening.”

The Nomiki Konst story begins in Tucson, where she was born. She moved to Buffalo with her family when she was eight. Her mom was an Erie County legislator. Konst attended Nichols School, a private prep school in Buffalo.

Much of the rest of her life remains occluded by imprecision.

Konst says she attended the University of Arizona but declined to say if she graduated. Inquiries to the university were not returned.

She was also briefly an actor and says she was an Obama organizer. In news articles and television appearances over the past decade, she has been described using more than 30 different titles, from “former blogger” to “film industry activist” to “pro-Sanders journalist.”

She founded Alliance Hollywood, an organization whose mission was, according to an archived version of its website, to act as “the voice of entertainment on Capitol Hill.” Konst’s LinkedIn page says she founded it in 2007. In an interview, Konst said “2009, I believe.” The organization no longer exists.

“I’m really bad with dates,” she said Tuesday.

By 2011, the organization was describing itself as “a DC non-profit corporation.” POLITICO has been unable to find evidence that the organization registered as a nonprofit. Konst’s campaign declined to provide any documentation either. Nor would she say where the group's funding came from. Neither did she say what it did, aside from the handful of events documented on its Flickr page.

In 2011, Konst says she moved to New York City.

“I think I’ve lived in over 12 apartments [since then],” she said.

Since 2011, however, she has also lived in Arizona. In 2012, she started showing up in Tucson papers as a candidate to succeed Gabby Giffords after a gunman shot the congresswoman.

“I really don’t know any other home other than Tucson,” Konst said at the time.

She failed to make the ballot. More recently she disputed that she really ran for the seat, both in the interview with POLITICO and at a debate among the candidates running for public advocate this week, where she was asked by another candidate how she could call herself an outsider candidate if she had run for Congress before.

“I was never on the ballot. I did not run,” Konst said.

At some point after her Congressional bid, she returned to New York and got involved in the ultimately successful campaign to ban fracking here.

Josh Fox, the anti-fracking filmmaker who made ""Gasland"", says they met in 2011, at a party in Los Angeles for his Oscar-nominated documentary.

“Nomi was there because she was working on fracking, working on those issues,” he said. Fox said he met her again in 2013, on the anti-fracking campaign, and then again when both served on the Democratic National Convention's platform committee. Konst also served on ""Unity Reform Commission,” established in the aftermath of the 2016 Democratic primary, in an effort to restore faith in the DNC’s nomination process and management.

Around 2013, Konst says she founded the Accountability Project, an attempt at a local nonprofit investigative journalism outlet, with the late journalist Wayne Barrett, whom she has frequently referred to as a “mentor.” (Her LinkedIn profile says the project began in 2012 and lasted two years).

“Wayne had trained me,” Konst told POLITICO. “He taught me everything about investigative reporting. We would sit there for hours in his living room.”

Barrett ended up getting sick, ultimately dying in 2017. Funding dried up. The Accountability Project shuttered. Several people who spoke with POLITICO said Konst and Barrett did work together on the project and Barrett recommended reporters for Konst to hire. Barrett’s widow, Fran, declined comment, citing her work for Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

“That was probably where I learned the greatest tricks from the most recent greatest investigative reporter of our time, Wayne Barrett, who I was very close to,” she said in a recent interview with Gotham Gazette’s Ben Max and City Limits’ Jarrett Murphy.

But in an interview with POLITICO, Konst clarified that she did not do reporting for the Accountability Project. She describes herself as an “investigative reporter,” because of her work for The Young Turks.

Konst could point to two pieces The Accountability Project produced — a heavily disputed article about the former head of an anti-corruption body Cuomo created in 2013, and another about Bronx party bosses. She also hosted an apparently short-lived but “big deal” podcast for the project. A Soundcloud page for the podcast shows just five episodes. She declined to disclose how many subscribers it had or how many episodes it produced.

Konst frequently argues that the Public Advocate’s office needs someone with her investigative skills.

Steven Weiss, a reporter and a former Wayne Barrett intern who worked with Konst on the Accountability Project, said he was impressed with Konst’s work and her managerial skills.

“I do know that Wayne Barrett thought well of her, spent at least dozens of hours with or speaking to her, and recommended her to others he cared for and respected, as the manager of that process and organization,” Weiss said.

But, he added, ""As to her claim of being an investigative journalist, specifically, and whether Wayne would agree with that characterization of her work, I've not seen or heard anything that would suggest that she was, or that he would.""

Konst says that it was while touting the Accountability Project on TV that she gained steam as a talking head. By 2015, she was making frequent appearances on CBS and Fox News as a Democratic political strategist and expert on national politics, particularly on fighting within the Democratic Party during the 2016 presidential primary. For the most part, the television appearances were unpaid, she told POLITICO.

At various points along the way, Konst said she also campaigned to draft Joe Biden for president and joined the Truman Center, which advocates for “tough, smart national security solutions,” according to its website.

Though Konst has touted her role as a “partner” at the organization in her Young Turks profile and her Huffington Post bio, on Tuesday she said that her role there, as well as her membership in the New Leaders Council, were meaningless.

Partners at the Center write their own online profiles, according to Truman Center spokesperson Graham West, and Konst’s said she was also the group’s West Coast Managing Director of Partnerships. That bio has since been deleted.

“We don't have any records of [that job] ever existing,” said another Truman Center spokesperson Ryan Cahill, though his colleague West noted that, “Nomiki's involvement at Truman essentially predates the employment of everyone currently on staff given organizational turnover."" Her membership, Cahill added, has lapsed.

“That was literally something that was killed in like three days,” Konst said, referring to the West Coast Managing Director of Partnerships position.

“It literally means nothing,” she said Tuesday. “If there’s any way for me to explain it to you, these organizations are nothing. They just basically go around the country and try to get young people involved and come to their conferences.”

She says she worked in Libya after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi, but one day after POLITICO asked her for details on that particular claim, she had yet to provide any.

For the past two years, Konst worked at The Young Turks, where she filed dispatches from Flint, Mich., Puerto Rico post-hurricane Maria, and East Chicago, until she was laid off in June of 2018. While working for the Young Turks, she says she was bombed in the Dakotas, amid protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline.

“I was at Standing Rock in the water when there were like bombs being thrown at us, literally, where a woman got her arm ripped off and she still is paralyzed in one arm,” she said, in possible reference to protester Sophia Wilansky, whose arm was damaged by shrapnel of indeterminate origin.

She also hosted a radio show called “The Filter” on SiriusXM.

She describes herself on her campaign website as an “award-winning investigative journalist.” Asked to specify, her campaign said she participated in a Citizens Union panel entitled, “Recognizing New York Journalists Who Make Democracy Work,” after which she and other panelists were awarded glass apples with their names on them.

After leaving The Young Turks last summer, she worked for Our Revolution, the non-profit 501c4 organization started by supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders after his 2016 campaign for president.

Konst said there was no overlap between her employment by The Young Turks, for which she earned $42,000 in salary last year, and her employment by Our Revolution, which paid her $36,000, according to a disclosure form she filed with the City’s Conflicts of Interest Board. She says she’s now getting by on savings. On her income disclosure form, she identified herself as a self-employed journalist.

As a reporter for The Young Turks, Konst sometimes interviewed politicians whose campaigns she publicly supported, or activists whose political positions she openly agreed with. But Konst sees no dissonance between her political activism and her journalism.

“Politico was founded by Republicans,” Konst said. “The New York Times invented this in the late 1800s, invented this concept of non-partisan. And it was actually a PR stunt.”

POLITICO spokesperson Brad Dayspring said that is not accurate.

“POLITICO has been owned by Robert Allbritton since its launch 12 years ago. Robert is politically independent, or as he would say, ‘fiercely independent,’“ Dayspring said. “Robert’s editorial co-founders were John Harris and Jim VandeHei. John is currently POLITICO’s editor-in-chief and is also an Independent. While no longer with POLITICO, Jim VandeHei is, by all accounts, also an independent and advocated for a 3rd party candidate in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal in 2016.”

Konst says she first voted in a New York City election, at earliest, in 2016. City Board of Elections records indicate she first registered to vote in the 2018 fall primary elections in New York City, but her ballot was rejected on a technicality. She successfully cast her first vote in New York City in the general election in November 2018.

“I understand that people like to bring that up as a criticism of me, but at the end of the day, a lot of people who have been in office for a very long time have rezoned their neighborhoods and made it completely unaffordable to live in their neighborhoods,” she said. “And I think that’s more of an abomination, in terms of civics.”

Konst said she wasn’t registered to vote in New York City during the 2013 mayoral elections, for example, because she thought her vote might count more in a place like Arizona, a purple state.

In the event she’s elected, Konst would not be the first public advocate to struggle with accuracy. Tish James was known to misstate her age and falsely claimed to have a role in helping the New York Times report a story about a young homeless girl named Dasani.

Konst’s vision for public advocate is undeniably ambitious. She wants to decentralize the office, so there’s a deputy in every borough. She thinks the city’s Department of Investigation should be relocated under the auspices of public advocate. She wants to change the law so that the public advocate is no longer second in line to the mayor.

A woman passes by a screen displaying images promoting the vote for ""yes"" for the constitutional referendum, in Havana, Cuba, February 5, 2019. Picture taken on February 5, 2019. REUTERS/Stringer

Opposition to the new charter could reach a quarter of the vote, one Cuban analyst said, a major increase from the low single digits of past votes.

The new document introduces important changes to Cuba’s Cold War era constitution, recognizing private property for the first time, as well as the role of foreign investment and the Internet.

While it confirms centralized economic planning, the charter introduces presidential term limits, adds a prime minister and restructures local government. It also enshrines fundamental principles such as the right to legal representation upon arrest and habeas corpus.

The current constitution was approved in 1976 with 97.7 percent of 5.6 million registered voters in favor, and just 54,000 voting no. Most analysts expect the new version to pass by a lesser margin among today’s 8 million registered voters.

“This time, I would say that around three-quarters of the population will vote yes,” said Rafael Hernandez, a leading Cuban political analyst and editor of Temas, a reform-orientated cultural magazine.

“We have become accustomed to the idea that if something does not pass by 98 percent there is no consensus, even though in other countries gaining 65 percent would be huge.”

A grassroots debate last year, instigated by the government, resulted in some secondary changes when a final version was approved in December by the National Assembly.

Since then Cuba’s government has used its monopoly on public spaces, transportation and traditional media to launch an all-out campaign for approval.

“Because it defends the sovereignty, independence and dignity of Cuban men and women, I vote yes,” Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel tweeted.

The government has portrayed a “yes” vote as patriotic, while the new constitution’s most vociferous opponents say “no” would be a step toward ending decades of Communist rule.

And with an ever-bolder civil society and more Cubans than ever before connected to the Internet, public debate has become more active than in the past.

Hash tags such as #YoVotoSi (I vote yes) and #YoVotoNo (I vote no) compete for space on Twitter.

“We can only overcome tyranny if everyone who wants a free and democratic Cuba gives full support ... I vote no,” tweeted Jose Daniel Ferrer, leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba, some of whose members have suffered temporary detentions and raids on their homes in the lead up to the referendum.

Some Cubans, while expressing regret that reforms do not go further, say they will vote for the new charter. Alejandro Hernandez, a 54-year-old skilled tradesman in Havana, said the proposals were sufficient to garner his support.

“That does not mean I agree with everything. For example, the top figure of the country, the president, should be elected by the people, not the National Assembly,” Hernandez said.

A clause allowing gay marriage by defining the institution as between persons, not a man and woman, provoked so much opposition that the new constitution contains no reference to marriage. Its framers in fact removed a previous reference to marriage, effectively kicking the issue down the road for possible inclusion in a future family code.

A growing evangelical movement, which boasts hundreds of thousands of ardent followers, campaigned against the measure and has not been appeased.

“I am voting `no` because taking out that marriage is between a man and a woman opens the door in the future to something that goes against our beliefs and the Bible,” said Ruben, a Baptist pastor in Havana, requesting his last name not be used.

The Catholic Church took a similar position in a four-point critique read from pulpits. It also took issue with the document’s ideological bent, denial of access to media and education, and the specification that foreigners, but not Cubans, could invest.

“Affirming as an absolute that ‘only in socialism and communism the person reaches his full dignity’ is totally unacceptable,” Monsignor Jose Felix Perez, secretary of the Cuban Catholic Bishops’ Conference, said of the proposal’s preamble.",Cubans expected to voice unprecedented opposition in constitutional vote,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-constitution-idUSKCN1QA275

Former Clinton pollster Mark Penn told Fox News this morning there are a number of scenarios that may lead to a third Hillary candidacy.

﻿

After defending Clinton’s credentials as “one of the most experienced politicians around,” Penn went on to say of the reported recent confabs between Hillary and declared candidates, “Those meetings are going to be somewhat awkward because she hasn’t declared that she’s not definitely running, and she, in fact, at the same time is looking over the field and I think will make a decision later in the year whether or not to run herself.

Penn said the chances of Hillary running depends on how the field shapes up.

“If the party looks too far to the left and there’s no front runner, she’ll get in,” he said.

“I think if Joe Biden gets in, that probably means she won’t run if he gets in. If he doesn’t get in, I think the field will be open for her,” Penn said.

He went on to indicate Clinton has long despised the year before the election year, so that may underscore the point she will wait as long as she can to declare her candidacy.

Reuters indicates there are serious worries about the field moving left, which could leave room for a more moderate candidate:

Liberal Democratic presidential contenders’ rush to embrace the left’s most ambitious proposals has some Democrats worried there could be a price to pay when they try to defeat President Donald Trump next year.

Party activists have been energized as Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and other candidates endorsed plans to provide Medicare coverage to every American, some form of tuition-free college, a national $15 minimum wage and the so-called “Green New Deal” advocated by U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

But Trump and his allies in the Republican Party have seized on those stances to attack the Democratic 2020 field as outside the American political mainstream — a claim the president plans to make throughout his re-election campaign, according to sources with knowledge of his strategy.

Some Democrats fear the argument has potency. They worry the primary may produce a nominee who will not appeal to centrist working and middle-class voters who voted for Trump in 2016 but whom Democrats believe they can win back.

“The big progressive programs are popular in a caucus or primary electorate, but probably don’t move the needle among voters who want to find someone who will change Washington by tilting the system to favor people in the middle — not the very rich or the very poor,” Jeff Link, an Iowa Democrat, tells Rueters.",PENN: Hillary back in if field 'too left'......,Theamericanmirror.com,https://www.theamericanmirror.com/ex-clinton-pollster-hillary-will-run-if-biden-doesnt-or-field-is-too-far-left/
251,Empty,2019-02-25T06:00:03Z,Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse spoke to Salon about the virtues of the Green New Deal... and why it isn't radical at all.,"Is Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a progressive Democrat from Rhode Island, ready to join the long and growing list of U.S. senators who are running for president in 2020? I asked him this, and his answer was emphatic: ""No."" The assistant who set up the interview told me the same thing in advance: Despite a surname that practically begs for headlines, Whitehouse isn't running. (At least not this time.)

This isn't to say Whitehouse plans on staying quiet. He has emerged as a leading Senate champion of the Green New Deal, — the ambitious package of environmental and economic reforms recently popularized by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. In one document posted on Ocasio-Cortez's website (and later taken down), the Green New Deal was defined by a set of goals: achieving ""net-zero greenhouse gas emissions,"" moving America to 100 percent ""clean and renewable energy"" and realizing Franklin D. Roosevelt's vision of an Economic Bill of Rights by guaranteeing good-paying jobs, health care, education and housing for all, along with economic security for those unable to work.

Not every Democrat supports all those goals, by a long shot. As Whitehouse made clear in our conversation, the Green New Deal is in an early developmental stage and its exact policy content is likely to evolve considerably. But for many progressives, the Green New Deal establishes a positive agenda that can helps the Democratic Party emerge as something more than a catch-basin for everyone who opposes Donald Trump.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell apparently believes that forcing an early vote on the Green New Deal may damage Democrats politically, and some Democratic presidential candidates have been notably reluctant to embrace it. Whitehouse believes it's time for his party to seize the moment ... and change the world in the process.

He plans on being there when this legislation is enacted -- but not as the person who signs it.

This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and context.

Republicans have been reacting with -- I think ""terror"" would be an accurate word -- to the concept of a Green New Deal. Sen. Tom Cotton said the media's coverage of it has been Stalin-like. A deleted summary from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's website was entered into the congressional record. Rep. Liz Cheney has attacking it. Why are they so scared of this/

Well, I think it is significant to watch the Republican heads explode over it and to hear the invective and falsehood that are thrown at it. It reminds me a little bit about when Democrats were trying to set up Medicare years ago, and Republicans who were fighting Medicare insisted it was socialized medicine. This is a little bit the 2019 replay of that same Republican playbook. I do think that the Green New Deal brings new energy to the climate debate.

Advertisement:

What [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is up to is to try to use the fact that we're still at an early stage in negotiating a climate bill amongst ourselves to try to foment division. When in fact, we have a very strong common Democratic purpose to work together to get a very significant climate bill passed.

What are your specific thoughts on the Green New Deal, in terms of your own individual interpretation of what it means and what should be included?

The Green New Deal at this point is only a resolution that hasn't even approached legislative language. Hearings have not yet been held. In the Senate alone, there are carbon-price bills on the Democrats side, ""Keep It in the Ground"" bills on the Democratic side -- a variety of smaller bills for different economic sectors that address climate change and the general prospect of a Green New Deal.

Our job as legislators is to walk through those various pieces of legislation, and pull something together that keep the 1.5-degree [increase] climate threshold that is most likely to actually get passed, and that maximizes all the collateral benefits for society in passing it as a significant climate bill.

Advertisement:

From what I've read, both on Ocasio-Cortez's website, and in just in general from the progressive commentators, this is about more than just addressing climate change. It's about radically overhauling how ordinary people live, providing a stronger social safety net for people who are in poverty, increasing the standard of living, guaranteeing benefits. It's really trying to realize Franklin Roosevelt's vision as embodied in the Economic Bill of Right from 1944. Is it really possible to accomplish that, in addition to accomplishing the environmental reforms necessitated by climate change?

Well, first of all, let me just back off a little bit on your last comment. I don't think what we're proposing to address climate change is radical. I think what's really radical is the Republican notion that climate change is a hoax, that it shouldn't be addressed, and that they are conveniently ignorant about the science and the facts. That, to me, is an extraordinarily radical proposition, and it may even be a worse than radical proposition once we understand the extent of fossil-fuel funding in the Republican Party.

I'm not going to accept being painted into the radical corner when we try to solve this problem, when I think the radical action here is the way that the Republican Party is misbehaving.

Advertisement:

For what it's worth, I don't perceive fighting climate change as being a radical solution. But I believe it's important to try to, one might say, play devil's advocate in terms of acknowledging the arguments that will inevitably be made …

The socialized medicine argument about Medicare. We've seen this game before. We usually power our way through it. To the first part of your question, I would say that the Green New Deal has been expressed in an array of policy recommendations that have an extraordinarily worthy purpose, which is to offset the increasing income inequality in the country, and the increasing share of the country's political power and economic power which is controlled by a smaller and smaller number of extraordinarily wealthy people and families and corporations.

All of that, I think, makes a lot sense. Even Franklin Roosevelt didn't get his New Deal passed in one bill. It was more a statement of purpose. What we have to do, the same way Franklin Roosevelt had to do it, is work together with Congress to pass section-by-section laws that will solve the climate problem before it gets out of hand. After doing that, rebalance what the traditional balance of power has been in American politics and in the American economy. Arrest and reverse the slide in both of those areas of power and money to those that already have the most of it.

There's a reason the Tea Party were serious, and that voters supported Trump, and that voters came out to support Bernie [Sanders] and other authentic — recent in Trump's case — authentic, new and disruptive points of view. That’s because, I think people in America can see and feel and breathe that something is amiss in this country, but they don't have power in Congress any longer. They don't have a fair share of the country's wealth and revenues any longer, and those things are demonstrable and factual.

They're absolutely right to be furious about it, and we need to address that concern. To some extent, the way forward on the climate problem helps address that concern. That’s a very significant plus, not just for liberal politics, and certainly not for ""socialism,"" but for the way America has always worked. It's just -- we're in a Gilded Age.

I'm actually writing my dissertation about The Gilded Age.

Republicans are gearing up for an uncertain and potentially crowded primary in the new election for North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, while Democrat Dan McCready is already coalescing support from his party for the re-vote.

As McCready held an event relaunching his campaign Friday and landed a valuable endorsement from the Daily Kos, a small-dollar fundraising powerhouse on the left, a pack of Republicans were considering their own runs, with no clear favorite among them. It’s unclear if Mark Harris — the 2018 candidate whose campaign was the subject of fraud allegations that tainted the midterm election and forced a new race — will run again, after recently suffering from health problems.

Story Continued Below

What’s more, Republicans on the ground think that Harris would now be a weak general election contender in the GOP-leaning district, after North Carolina’s board of elections voted unanimously to call a new campaign. Harris’ son delivered stunning testimony before the board this week, saying he warned his father against hiring the political operative who allegedly collected and marked voters’ absentee ballots in 2018. And Harris, a former preacher, could have trouble raising new money into his broke campaign as a result.

“What we’re going to get is a primary with a lot of candidates,” said Carter Wrenn, a North Carolina Republican strategist. “I wouldn’t presume to tell Harris what to do, but he took a hard hit at the end of the hearings, he’s got some bruises.”

“His whole campaign becomes more problematic,” Wrenn added.

But if Harris does decide to run again, his name recognition — and the belief of some Republican voters that he “got a raw deal” — could make him difficult to beat in a GOP primary, said Patrick Sebastian, a Republican strategist and nephew of former Gov. Pat McCrory. That could be a problem for Republicans in the general election, in a district President Donald Trump carried in 2016, but McCready — a veteran making his first run for office — made competitive in 2018.

It would take someone with “a heck of a lot of money to defeat [Harris] in the primary,” Sebastian said.

North Carolina's board of elections will vote soon to set dates for the new election. Other potential GOP candidates include Matthew Ridenhour, former Mecklenburg County commissioner, and Kenny Smith, a former Charlotte city council member who ran for the mayor of Charlotte and lost. Additionally, former state Rep. Andy Dulin told WSOCTV he would not rule out a run. The state GOP won’t weigh in on the primary but said it will continue to work with legislators and investigators to improve the electoral system.

Though McCrory previously said he’s not interested in running for the congressional seat, local Republicans are pushing him to jump into the primary, according to a person familiar with those discussions. McCrory has also received a few calls from Republicans in Washington, D.C.

McCrory wouldn’t comment on the new election, instead expressing frustration that the election board didn’t continue hearing testimony on Thursday. “Why are they stopping the investigation — both Republicans and Democrats,” McCrory said.

Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman told a local CBS affiliate that “a criminal prosecution should be anticipated” on the allegations of election fraud against Dowless. Freeman added that her office is not only trying to get to the bottom of any illegal activity that took place but “who might have been funding that and what did they know?”

As Republicans wait to figure out who might run in the 9th District, McCready rallied supporters Friday.

“I am running in the special election for North Carolina’s 9th district,” McCready said at an event. “We are in this fight and we are going to win this fight. ... This is about what does it mean to live in a democracy.”

McCready starts the new election with a major financial head start. The Democrat raised about $500,000 in December and ended 2018 with approximately $337,000 in his campaign account. Harris finished 2018 with just $19,131 on hand. Meanwhile, McCready sent campaign emails and launched a barrage of digital fundraising ads Thursday and Friday after the new election was called.

He also has support from Democratic heavy-hitters from the Daily Kos to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is ready to back up McCready in the new race.

“Dan McCready is a United States Marine Corps veteran who led a platoon in Iraq, as well as a business leader who has created jobs in his community in North Carolina,” said Cole Leiter, DCCC spokesperson. “While Washington Republicans have spent over $2 million propping up a candidate who stole North Carolinians’ votes and threatened the integrity of our election process, we’re proud to stand with Dan and look forward to him bringing his leadership to Congress.”

The DCCC plans to hammer the North Carolina GOP and national Republicans over the election fraud allegations — particularly what Harris knew and when. After taking a break in the middle of Thursday’s election board hearing to huddle with his lawyers, Harris returned to the stand to admit that he’d been mistaken in early testimony about whether he expected email exchanges with one of his sons to be made public.

The National Republican Congressional Committee, which does not get involved in open GOP primaries, has not said what it will do in the new election. NRCC chair Tom Emmer issued a statement against ballot harvesting — the process of collecting others’ absentee ballots to turn them in, which is illegal in North Carolina but legal in other states.

""Voter fraud is never acceptable and neither is ballot harvesting. We call on Democrats to join Republicans in rejecting the practice of ballot harvesting in every congressional district in the country,” Emmer said in the statement.

After remaining quiet about the scandal, Trump weighed in Friday.

But Sanders doesn’t just talk about foreign policy more. He talks about it in a more radical way. None of the senators running for president are hawks. Last January, Booker co-wrote an op-ed arguing that—absent new congressional authorization—it would be illegal to keep American troops in Syria once the fight against ISIS was over. In her Foreign Affairs essay, Warren called for “ending” the “endless war” that has “sapped” America’s “strength,” and for rethinking the “singular focus on counterterrorism” that “has dangerously distorted U.S. policies.” Warren and Gillibrand also led the fight to keep the Trump administration from pulling out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia.

What distinguishes Sanders is the same quality that distinguished him on domestic policy in 2016: his willingness to cross red lines that have long defined the boundaries of acceptable opinion. One clear example is Israel. Most of the Senate Democrats running for president have shifted left on the subject. Booker, after initially supporting legislation to criminalize boycotts of the Jewish state, voted against a similar bill last month. Warren, after defending Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip earlier in her career, last year criticized Israel’s response to protests there. But Sanders has gone much further: He’s produced videos that call Gaza an “open-air prison,” he’s depicted Benjamin Netanyahu as part of the “growing worldwide movement toward authoritarianism,” and, most controversially of all, he’s suggested cutting U.S. military aid to Israel.

But Israel is only the beginning of Sanders’s sacrilege. He’s the only presidential candidate in recent memory who regularly describes the Cold War not as a heroic American victory, but as a cautionary tale. Sanders doesn’t just warn against U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, as Warren and Gillibrand have. He warns against it while invoking the United States’ “long history of inappropriately intervening in Latin American countries.” In his speech at Westminster College in 2017, he spent paragraph after paragraph detailing America’s disastrous 20th-century interventions: Iran, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, Vietnam—a litany that resembled a Noam Chomsky lecture more than a typical presidential candidate’s foreign-policy speech.

Peter Beinart: America needs an entirely new foreign policy for the Trump age

Sanders’s darker view of Cold War foreign policy isn’t mere historical revisionism. It’s linked to his critique of American foreign policy today. Now, as then, he wants America to shun the quest for global supremacy that leads it to overthrow regimes it can’t control and to instead pursue a foreign policy based on “partnership, rather than dominance.” That’s why, in his Westminster speech, Sanders did something Democrats have rarely done in recent decades: He called for putting the United Nations—which he called “one of the most important organizations for promoting a vision of a different world”—near the heart of American foreign policy.",It’s Foreign Policy That Distinguishes Bernie This Time,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/foreign-policy-distinguishes-bernie-sanders-2020/583279/

Radical ideas are not unusual in the early stages of a US presidential election campaign, but many of the Democratic candidates for 2020 are advocating unrealistic policies. Just because a new idea seems more exciting does not make it better than an established, more practical one.

CAMBRIDGE – America’s Democratic Party is moving to the left, we are told. It is not yet clear whether this applies to the median American voter, or the median member of Congress who was elected last November. But it is clear that many of the candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination are experimenting with “bold new ideas.” They seem to receive a disproportionate amount of attention for doing so. If interpreted literally, many of these policy proposals are not entirely practical, either economically or politically.

Renewing Europe Mar 4, 2019 calls on EU citizens to focus on three goals ahead of the critical European Parliament election in May. Jose Luis Pelaez Inc/Getty Images A Better Populism Feb 27, 2019 argues that beggar-thy-neighbor policies cannot solve the problems facing declining communities. Wojtek Radwanski/AFP/Getty Images Europe, Please Wake Up Feb 11, 2019 argues that the EU cannot be saved without transforming its political party systems. Previous Next

Fortunately, few of the current or prospective Democratic candidates have yet committed irrevocably to extreme policies. Any of them could still build a campaign on solid practical proposals to address inequality and other pressing problems, without sacrificing economic growth or fiscal sustainability.

Such ideas are perhaps most likely to come from moderates such as former Vice President Joe Biden, former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, former US Representative Beto O’Rourke, or former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Other prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, share this emphasis on the doable. They made important progress with practical policies in areas such as health insurance, financial regulation, and progressive taxation, although Republicans often blocked or reversed these advances.

There is no reason why other new faces in the presidential field, such as US Senator Amy Klobuchar, cannot follow in the sensible Democratic tradition of Obama and Pelosi. The same applies to fellow senators Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren, who are often seen as being on the left of the party.

But for now, the bolder, less practical Democratic ideas are getting the airtime. Five in particular stand out, and there exist more practical alternatives to each of them.

First is the proposal for a marginal income-tax rate of 70% on the super-rich. There are more efficient and enforceable ways to improve income distribution in the US. For starters, the carried-interest loophole could be abolished, the Earned Income Tax Credit could be expanded, and the payroll tax could be made more progressive. Further suggestions include restoring the inheritance tax on all estates worth more than, say, $10 million, and eliminating the “step-up” of estates’ valuation that allows generations to pass on capital gains without ever paying tax on them. Other substantial Republican tax cuts for the rich could be reversed, too.

Another idea is that the government pays for universal four-year college education. But this would be expensive, and not the best way to help the children of families that have been left behind by US economic growth. Universal, quality pre-school might be a more effective way of working toward equality of educational opportunity.

To be sure, it makes sense to expand student grants for higher education and increase support for public institutions. This should cover two-year programs and vocational training as well as four-year degrees. But the most urgent higher-education policy priority is pushing back against the scams perpetrated by some for-profit colleges. The worst of these leave vulnerable students – veterans have been frequent targets – with high taxpayer-funded debts, low graduation rates, and poor post-graduation employment prospects.

A third idea is universal health-care coverage through “Medicare for All.” If this meant adding a public option for those who can’t get private health insurance, it would be a worthy initiative. But US Senator Bernie Sanders – not a Democrat, but running for the party’s nomination – has been clear that he favors the elimination of private health insurance. Most Americans do not respond positively when they realize that “Medicare for All” would force the many who are currently happy with their employer-paid plans to give them up, and saddle taxpayers with an enormous fiscal burden.

A more practical Democratic health-care policy would be to resume the expansion of coverage rates that the 2010 Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) achieved. This means, as a first step, reversing the damage that Republicans have done to it.

Fourth, several candidates support a government-led “Green New Deal” that would radically change US energy use. True, when the US unemployment rate exceeded 8% between 2009 and 2012, the country could have used a larger and longer increase in government spending on environmental projects than Obama was able to get past Congress. But, with unemployment currently around 4%, now is not a good time to be expanding the budget deficit.

If the Green New Deal were interpreted as simply a rallying cry to mobilize support for strong action on climate change, it would be a welcome development. But the impracticality of so many of the Green New Deal’s components is worrisome, such as its goal of expanding renewable energy to 100% of electric power, not to mention some of the package’s extraneous parts. The efficient way to achieve climate-change goals is not via a truly massive expansion of government, but rather by using the price mechanism, meaning either a carbon tax or tradable emission permits.

Finally, Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (who is not seeking the presidency) recently proposed preventing firms from buying back their shares. It is true that corporations have spent more of their big gains from the December 2017 tax cut on share buybacks and dividends than on investment or workers. But the proper remedy is to broaden the corporate tax base. Banning buybacks would just divert firms’ extra profits into Treasury bills or other companies’ shares.

Radical proposals are not unusual in the early stages of a presidential election campaign. But just because a new idea seems more exciting does not make it better than an older, more practical one. The Democratic contenders for 2020 would be wise to remember this as they chase their presidential dreams.",Should Bold Ideas Drown Out Old Ideas?,Project-syndicate.org,https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/presidential-election-2020-democrats-radical-proposals-by-jeffrey-frankel-2019-02

Elizabeth Warren highlighted her new universal child care plan and explained her support for reparations for black Americans affected by slavery as she campaigned Friday night in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House.

Taking questions from reporters after headlining the New Hampshire Democratic Party’s McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club fundraising gala, Warren pointed to the country’s “ugly history of racism” as she explained her support for the proposal.

HARRIS, WARREN, EMBRACE REPARATIONS

“We need to confront it head-on and we need to talk about the right away to address it and make change,” Warren added.

The idea of reparations for black Americans affected by slavery is also backed by at least two other Democratic presidential candidates – Sen. Kamala Harris of California and former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, who served as housing secretary under President Barack Obama.

The push by some Democratic White House hopefuls points to the further importance of race and identity issues within the party. While supporters say reparations are needed to address slavery and other racist aspects of American history, some critics say such a move could cost several trillion dollars.

Asked whether she would include Native Americans in her support for reparations, Warren answered “I think it’s a part of the conversation. It’s an important part of the conversation.”

The senator has long faced criticism over her claims of Native American heritage, and recently apologized to the Cherokee Nation for last autumn’s release of DNA results in a bid to prove she had Native American ancestry dating back at least six generations.

WARREN HECKLED ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL

Child care, early education

Warren used her much of her address to more than 900 Democratic officials, federal, state and local lawmakers, rainmakers, and party activists in New Hampshire to showcase her new universal child care and early education proposal.

“We’re the richest country in the history of the planet. Access to high-quality care and education during the first five years of a child’s life shouldn’t be a privilege reserved for the rich,” she said to a standing ovation, one of around 10 that she received during her address.

Warren emphasized that “high-quality child care should be a right for every child in America.”

The senator touted that her plan “would provide high-quality care and education for free for millions of families and at low cost for everyone else.”

Warren claimed that she could pay for her plan “without raising taxes one thin dime for working families.”

She said revenues from the ultra-millioanires tax that she recently proposed would “cover the cost of this universal child care and early education plan.”

ELIZABETH WARREN CALLS FOR 'WEALTH TAX' ON RICHEST AMERICANS

“Asking the 75,000 wealthiest families in this country to pay a little more would cover the cost of providing affordable and high-quality child care and early education options to every child in our country,” she added.

Republicans respond

The Republican National Committee targeted Warren's proposal.

“Whether it’s government-run health care, taxpayer-funded jobs for all, or universal daycare, nothing is free and ultimately these proposals do nothing but raise taxes and expand big government. The financial burden always falls on the taxpayer,” RNC spokeswoman Mandi Merritt said.

""Ultimately these proposals do nothing but raise taxes and expand big government."" — Mandi Merritt, spokeswoman, Republican National Committee

But that kind of criticism doesn't fly with Manchester, N.H., Bergen Ambrose, who said as she waited in line after the speech to take a selfie with the senator that “I’m sold on Elizabeth Warren.”

Ambrose, who recently moved to the state from Massachusetts, said the controversy over Warren’s claims of Native American heritage didn’t trouble her.

“That is nothing in comparison to the scandals that we’ve seen on the Republican side” she explained. “I feel like she is the voice of the people.”

But Granite State native and Derry, N.H., resident Alyssa Wadlin is undecided at this early point in the campaign.

“I’m definitely excited about Elizabeth Warren. I’m excited about Kamala Harris, too. Those are my two front-runners,” she explained. “Elizabeth answered a lot of things that I wanted to hear from her tonight.”

Wadlin said beating President Trump in the general election was the most important factor in her decision.

“I wanted to see tonight that we have a candidate that can speak to all of America. It’s easy to be a Democrat from Massachusetts. I wanted to see that a Democrat from Massachusetts can speak to the rest of the country,” she said.

Friday night’s speech kicked off a two-day swing by Warren through the Granite State. It’s her fourth visit to New Hampshire since launching her campaign Dec. 31. Many political observers consider New Hampshire a ""must win"" state for a presidential candidate from neighboring Massachusetts. Bay State White House contenders have a long history of winning the first-in-the-nation primary. Think most recently of Democratic Sen. John Kerry in 2004 and former Republican Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012.

But the state is also a ""must win"" for Sen. Bernie Sanders, who hails from neighboring Vermont. On Tuesday, the independent senator and fellow populist firebrand launched his second straight bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.

The night before Warren returned to New Hampshire, Sanders held a conference call with many of his top Granite State supporters from his 2016 campaign.

A top Sanders supporter and adviser who was on the call told Fox News that the senator told them that “New Hampshire’s extremely important and he made that point very clearly, how important it is for all of us to work as hard if not harder than we did last time and win again.”

The supporter, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more broadly, said that most of the leading Sanders supporters in New Hampshire are “all with him again.”","Warren talks reparations, child care, early education during New Hampshire campaign stop - Fox News",Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-defends-push-for-reparations-makes-plea-for-universal-child-care-during-nh-stop

R. Kelly still behind bars after sexual abuse charges

R&B star R. Kelly, 52, was charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse Friday and turned himself into police custody that night. Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx said the indictment lists four victims and multiple alleged acts of sexual assault dating to 1998. Three of the victims were between the ages of 13 and 17, court documents show. Cook County Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. set Kelly's bond at $1 million, calling the allegations against him ""disturbing"" as Kelly stared at the floor looking dejected. The singer remained behind bars Sunday, unable to yet post the 10 percent of his $1 million bond required for release.

An unpredictable road to the 91st Annual Academy Awards ended with Hollywood's biggest night on Sunday. ""Green Book"" took the night's biggest prize for best picture, along with best original screenplay and best supporting actor, for Mahershala Ali. The Queen biopic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" grabbed four Oscars – the most of any film – including best actor for Rami Malek's portrayal of lead singer Freddie Mercury. The biggest upset came in the best actress category, when Olivia Colman won for ""The Favourite"" over seven-time nominee Glenn Close (""The Wife""). Couldn't watch the show?

Trump to delay tariff hikes against China

President Donald Trump announced Sunday on Twitter that he would be delaying an increase in tariffs against China and plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping to settle on a final trade agreement. Trump said ongoing trade negotiations with China have been ""very productive"" and that he would delay the tariffs. Those were set to go into effect March 1, ahead of a meeting with President Xi at Trump's Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida. Trump said last week that he expected to meet soon with Xi to work out “the final points” of an agreement. Currency manipulation is one of a number of issues that have been on the table as part of the ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries.

Fire bombs on Venezuela border as opposition tries to deliver aid

Tear gas, rubber bullets and fire bombs from Venezuela’s National Guard rained down on activists on the Colombia-Venezuela border Saturday as the opposition tried to deliver humanitarian aid. The guard set fire to trucks in Cucuta carrying materials destined for the country’s starving people, and along the Brazil border two protesters were killed. Amid the aid push, President Nicolas Maduro broke diplomatic relations with Colombia, whose government he accuses of aiding a U.S.-led effort to oust him from power. Opposition leader Juan Guaido said he would meet U.S. Vice President Mike Pence Monday in Colombia at an emergency meeting of mostly conservative Latin American governments to discuss Venezuela’s crisis.

Pope on clergy abuse: 'Spare no effort' to bring justice

Pope Francis vowed to ""spare no effort"" in confronting the Catholic Church’s clergy sex abuse scandal head-on, calling Sunday for priests to be guided by the ""holy fear of God"" while victims are believed and supported. His comments were to a group of about 190 Catholic bishops and religious superiors summoned to Rome. Last week, Francis defrocked former U.S. cardinal Theodore McCarrick, 88, after Vatican officials found him guilty of sex crimes against minors and adults. McCarrick is the most senior Catholic official to be defrocked for such crimes, and church experts say that's a reflection of how slowly the church has moved in response to the scandal.

Amazon Prime cargo plane crashes

Authorities said they had recovered a body as they hunted for clues Sunday into an Amazon Prime Air cargo plane crash outside Houston. The Boeing 767 operated by Atlas Air was a scheduled cargo flight for Amazon from Miami to Houston when it disappeared from radar Saturday and apparently nosedived into a swampy area about 30 miles from George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Three people were aboard the plane, and police said it was unlikely anyone survived. Federal investigators are helping local authorities search the wreckage for the plane's boxes, which could help explain the crash.

Sex spas are big business, authorities say after Robert Kraft charges

New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was charged with two counts of soliciting prostitution, police in Florida said Friday. Police said Kraft paid for sexual services at a Jupiter, Florida, spa under investigation for ties to an international human trafficking ring. While the charges have brought national attention to the issue of sex trafficking, data, expert opinion and cases from around the USA show how widespread the problem is. Illicit massage or spa businesses, similar to the ones in the Florida case, were the top location or industry where sex trafficking occurred in 2017, according to the National Human Trafficking Hotline. “The spas will make $20,000, $30,000 a year total, and yet they’re pulling in hundreds of thousands of dollars that we know of,” sheriff’s Lt. Mike Dougherty of Florida's Martin County said Friday.

Adopt Tax-the-Rich Label After Years of Ducking It... VIDEO: Bernie Praised Fidel Castro In 1985 Interview... Advertise here","That two leading Democratic candidates have embraced reparations — the concept that the federal government should both acknowledge the ongoing legacy of slavery and discrimination and provide compensatory payment to those affected — is a major shift from past presidential campaigns and a win for activists who have tried to push the issue into the mainstream for decades. Julián Castro, the former cabinet secretary who is also running for president, has also indicated that he would support reparations.

Even among the 2020 Democrats who stopped short of endorsing reparations, several have laid out robust policies aimed at closing the gap in wealth between black and white families. Scholars estimate that black families in America today earn just $57.30 for every $100 in income earned by white families, according to the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. For every $100 in white family wealth, black families hold just $5.04.

Senator Cory Booker’s “baby bonds” policy aims to help poorer children by giving them a government-funded savings account that could total up to $50,000 for the lowest income brackets. The plan has been praised by liberal scholars, who think it could go a long way in helping lower-income Americans begin to build wealth. And Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has endorsed a proposal to allow Americans without checking accounts to bank at the local post office; a disproportionate percentage of America’s unbanked population are people of color.

María Urbina, national policy director for the progressive group Indivisible, said that after years of being pushed by activists, the Democratic Party was getting closer to applying its liberal values to racial equality. Policies like reparations or “baby bonds” that seek to close the racial wealth gap, she said, should be viewed similarly to idealistic programs that have been embraced by Democrats seeking the presidential nomination, including the Green New Deal and “Medicare for all.”

“We want folks who are being ambitious, not just working within the margins and the contours of what we had before, but sort of reimagining things on our own terms and being really aspirational,” Ms. Urbina said.

Sandy Darity, a Duke University professor who is a leading scholar on reparations and the racial wealth gap, said he believes more black Americans may come to see reparations as a defining issue for their support.

“There is a point in black Americans making a collective decision to treat a candidate’s attitude toward reparations as a litmus test for supporting them,” Dr. Darity said. “I think if folks had paid closer attention to the fact that Barack Obama was against reparations, they would have not been as disappointed by his presidency, because they would have had more realistic expectations about what he was likely to do.”",Dems Embrace Reparations for Slavery...,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/us/politics/2020-democrats-race-policy.html

Biden has yet to declare his presidential intentions, but if he does run, he’s looking at a Trump-like coalition of support within the Democratic Party, with backing from men, the less-educated and older voters.

Mr. Biden would enter the race as the most well-known and most well-liked option, with polls consistently putting the 76-year-old first in the Democratic nomination race.

“There is no question he is the front-runner if he decides to announce,” Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth Polling Institute, told The Washington Times.

The Biden buzz picked up last week after Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said she believed her old friend was going to make a third bid for the White House.

Ms. Feinstein confessed that she likely would catch flak for backing him over the female candidates in the field, signaling just how divided Democratic voters are on their potential options.

Democratic strategists say that could complicate things for Mr. Biden, a white man in his 70s, at a time when many in the party want to nominate someone who checks other boxes such as being younger, female or a racial or ethnic minority.

Everyone loves Mr. Biden, but his window for a successful presidential bid may have closed, they say.

The polls so far suggest that’s not a major hurdle.

The latest Monmouth Polling Institute national survey showed him holding a double-digit lead over the pack of contenders. Self-described moderates, the 50-plus crowd, white voters without a college degree, and men are his most fervent supporters.

That’s a serious deviation from the liberal multiracial coalition that powered President Barack Obama — and Mr. Biden, on the same ticket — to victories in 2008 and 2012, then boosted Democrats to a majority in the House in November’s elections.

“Older, white men, working class, ex-union guys still make up a significant, but smaller portion of the Democratic Party, and for the Democratic Party to be a majority party they have to hold this coalition together even as younger voters, and minority voters grow in strength,” Mr. Murray said.”There is no question Joe Biden has a particular appeal to that group of old, labor Democrats.”

Other past candidates have held early national polling leads, only to take a pass at running or to see their campaigns fizzle. Then-Sen. Joe Lieberman was Democrats’ front-runner in 2003, but he failed to win any primaries or caucuses in 2004. Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was the Republican front-runner in 2007 but failed to win any of the early 2008 states.

Mr. Biden may buck that trend, with polls showing his national support is matched by strong backing in the early primary states.

A UMass Poll released Thursday put the former vice president outpacing the field in New Hampshire, for example.

“With a roster full of fresh, young faces vying to be the Democratic Party’s nominee, New Hampshire’s Democratic primary voters seem more comfortable handing the reins to a seasoned veteran,” said Tatishe Nteta, associate professor of political science and director of the poll.

The deep reservoir of goodwill for Mr. Biden derives in large part from the eight years he spent as Mr. Obama’s sidekick. He also remains a sympathetic figure, having lost his first wife and 1-year-old daughter in a car crash in 1972 and one of his sons, Beau, to brain cancer in 2015.

Being liked, though, is different than being trusted on the issues, activists say.

He led action on the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act and voted for the Iraq War in 2002 and a bankruptcy reform bill in 2005 — each of them now viewed by liberal activists as a colossal mistake.

Bryce Smith, chairman of the Dallas County Iowa Democrats, said Mr. Biden will have to defend more than four decades of public service that started before four of the declared Democratic candidates were even born.

“Joe Biden has sat at the presidential table,” Mr. Smith said. “He understands that you have an agenda and you have goals and you have ideas, but in all reality you kind of have to be the pragmatic negotiator to get moving towards those goals and ideas, which I think is not a strong point for him in a Democratic primary — especially in this Democratic primary where we see a tremendous amount of pressure to move the party to the left.”

With a midterm election rebuke and disastrous government shutdown in the rear view, Trump’s 2020 campaign team and constellation of key outside supporters are sensing a turnaround. The president hasn’t changed his controversial ways. But Trump’s top lieutenants believe that newly empowered liberal Democrats — in Washington and across the country — plus the sometimes peculiar spectacle of the Democratic primary, are causing uneasy Republicans to reconsider their opposition.

""As the House Democrat caucus is increasingly dominated by extreme left members, and as Democratic presidential candidates work to outmaneuver each other in embracing socialist policies, the choice will become increasingly clear,” Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement provided to the Washington Examiner. “Support for the president is already on the rise.""

[Byron York: Dems' hard-left turn poses dilemma for 'Never Trumpers']

Democrats flipped 40 seats in the House of Representatives in November, winning control of the chamber in a direct backlash against Trump. That was followed in late December with a politically ill-fated government shutdown pushed by the president over the Mexican border wall.

Trump’s job approval ratings have since bounced back to an average of around 44 percent, the higher end of the range over his presidency. Some ardent critics have even dropped their opposition to his re-election or said they could be persuaded to vote for him. Republicans are giving the lion’s share of the credit to the Democrats.

In Washington, the Democratic Party activist wing has proposed a “Green New Deal” to overhaul U.S. climate policy, aggressively redistribute wealth via the tax code, and greatly expand government influence over energy usage and transportation. In the states, Democratic-controlled legislatures have moved to ease restrictions on late-term abortions.

On the campaign trail, Democratic presidential contenders are competing for progressives by endorsing these policies and more. Suddenly, Trump looks less problematic to Republicans uncomfortable with his character and belligerent behavior.

“The people who find reasons to be uncomfortable with the president but like the general thrust of his policies are scared as hell that Venezuela is trying to get into the White House,” said Matt Schlapp, a veteran Republican operative and loyal Trump ally who runs the Conservative Political Action Conference. “Look at his foils; they’re all worse.”

That’s the conclusion that previously virulent Trump antagonist Erick Erickson came to. Erickson is a conservative activist and radio talk show host who during the 2016 campaign very publicly disinvited then-candidate Trump to a conference he was hosting.

Liz Mair, a GOP operative who still identifies as “Never Trump” and this week endorsed Republican Bill Weld’s long-shot primary bid to block the president’s re-nomination, conceded there are scenarios under which she would vote for him.

“If they nominate [Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.] and Virginia is right on the line — if Virginia polling was Warren-Trump, 49 percent to 49 percent, I would vote for Donald Trump. I would do that,” said Mair, who is a Virginia resident. “If it were [Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.], I definitely would do that.”

Sanders calls himself as a socialist, a label no longer verboten in the Democratic Party. Warren is a liberal populist but has embraced much of Sanders’ socialist agenda.

Trump’s overall approval numbers with self-identified Republicans are historically high. His support among the GOP base is rock solid.

But the president’s relationship with critical elements of the traditional wing of the Republican Party is less secure. These voters were a crucial part of the coalition that helped put him over the top in key battlegrounds.

Trump’s allies don’t appear that worried. They expect the Democratic primary to produce a nominee unpalatable for this group.

Dionne: History will notice which Republicans distance themselves from Trump Salt Lake Tribune California Republican Party elects first woman, Latina to be its leader Los Angeles Times California's hurting Republicans pick insider to lead party ABC News …","Washington • In 1964, Nelson Rockefeller, then the governor of New York, rose before the Republican National Convention to condemn “extremists” who had “no plan and no program to keep the peace and bring freedom to the world.”

Amidst the boos and catcalls from right-wingers on the floor, Rockefeller denounced those who ""spread distrust,"" ""engender suspicion"" and ""encourage disunity.""

“There is no place in this Republican Party,” declared this stalwart of GOP progressivism, “for such hawkers of hate, such purveyors of prejudice, such fabricators of fear.”

You wonder what Rocky would make of a President Trump and the movement he has nurtured. And you sure wish someone like Rockefeller were around today to call his party back to reason and tolerance.

The events of recent days ought to try the consciences of Republicans who know that extremism and hatred are wrong. Many in the party acknowledge — usually in private — that the president they have continued to back has rooted his political appeal in vicious attacks against his opponents and a free press. He has invented crises for the purpose of stoking dread and horror. And he targeted minority groups (immigrants especially) to harvest political support.

In the meantime, the party as a whole has abandoned the embrace of civil rights and voting rights that had been, from the Lincoln era to Rockefeller's time, the GOP's calling card. Mimicking the segregationist Democrats of the past, Republicans have of late used the unfounded specter of voter fraud to justify voter ID laws and other measures squarely aimed at impeding access to the ballot box by African-Americans and the young.

So there was a delicious irony to last week's unanimous ruling by the North Carolina Board of Elections that it was a Republican candidate for Congress, Mark Harris, who found himself accused of massive voter fraud. As a result, the board threw out the district's 2018 election results and called a new election.

In 2017 Trump named a presidential commission that scoured the country for instances of in-person voter fraud that might justify the party's voter suppression efforts. It was such a bust that the commission itself had to be disbanded just eight months later.

Impeding voting rights needs to be called what it is: an act of extremism. It is radically anti-democratic to keep your opponents from voting. Where are the Republicans who will speak out loudly and clearly against what their party has done in so many states that they controlled?

An even more startling development was news that police in Maryland had arrested Christopher P. Hasson, a lieutenant in the Coast Guard and a self-identified white nationalist. The authorities said he stockpiled weapons and drew up a list of liberal politicians and commentators whom he hoped to kill. His catalog of targets included, among others, the House and Senate Democratic leaders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (whom he called ""Sen blumen jew""), and MSNBC commentators Joe Scarborough, Ari Melber and Chris Hayes.

Even if many Republicans have no problem these days labeling nearly all Democrats ""socialists"" based on the self-descriptions of a few in the party's ranks, it's obvious that no one should call out the entire GOP for the plotting of a fanatical would-be assassin.

One can, however, ask all responsible Republicans to deplore right-wing fanaticism and to take the threat of homegrown white nationalist terrorism as seriously as they do terrorism inspired from abroad. It is entirely fair to imagine that the GOP (and, especially, the president) would have a lot more to say if Hasson had been, say, a Muslim.

And it is important to examine the public statements of the president himself, his efforts to divide the country, and his constant demonizing of all those who oppose him.

Let's go back to Rockefeller's words: Day after day, Trump truly is a hawker of hate, a purveyor of prejudice, and a fabricator of fear. Prejudice and fear are at the heart of his invocation of national emergency powers to build his wall, an abuse of authority that ought to horrify all who proudly call themselves ""constitutional conservatives.""

The good news is that Republicans will soon have an opportunity to tell us who they are. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called a vote this week on a measure rejecting Trump's emergency declaration. The House is virtually certain to pass it. The Senate, by law, will be required to take it up.

It's not too much to say that history will notice how many Republicans choose to separate themselves from Trump's extremism.

Lawyers for the opposition demanded that the servers containing data for the 19.2 million registered voters in Kenya be opened and checked for electoral fraud. Lawyers for the electoral commission insisted that it could not be done because the servers were in France.

Millions of Kenyan citizens' biometric data was collected over an extended period of time in preparation for the highly contested 2017 vote. However, when the data was most needed, at the point when it was necessary to verify the results announced by the electoral commission, it was unavailable. Apparently, a private foreign entity, a French firm known as OT Safran Morpho, owned the information and the government struggled to get the corporation in question to make the information available on demand.

In February 2019, Kenya is gearing up to launch another massive citizen data collection drive called ""the Huduma Number"". Over a 30-day period, the government will compel citizens in a number of counties to register their biometric details, other identity numbers and their physical address to receive a new number to be used as ""a unique identifier"".

Further digging reveals the government has done a deal with MasterCard to link the Huduma number to a prepaid card with chip and pin that will be used by citizens to pay for an array of government services.The government denies that the two initiatives are connected, but given similar initiatives in countries like Nigeria, there is credible fear that the initiatives will eventually be combined. Regardless, the Huduma programme will add yet another number and card to the litany of numbers and cards that Kenyans must wield to prove their Kenyan citizenship to their increasingly predatory state.

The Huduma card will join your ID, passport, driver's licence, birth certificate, National Social Security Fund card, National Hospital Insurance Fund card, Kenya Revenue Authority Tax PIN, etc.

Critically, the invitation to apply comes with a threat: Anyone who does not register will be denied government services.

There are many wrong and, indeed, dangerous elements to this initiative.

For one, forcing citizens to sign up for a financial product under the threat of denying them important government services isn't governance, it is blackmail. Kenya's constitution provides that all legislation must be subjected to public participation.

Therefore, it is prima facie unconstitutional for a government ministry to make a ""roadside declaration"": to create a new legislative hurdle for gaining an important citizenship document without allowing the public time to reflect and respond.

Yet, this ill-informed initiative was announced at a press conference and information about it was distributed on both traditional and social media: a roadside declaration with 21st-century tools.

Secondly, Kenya still does not have a data protection law. That means that this massive data collection exercise - including facial recognition, fingerprints and other key citizen data - will be in place in the absence of any real legal oversight.

Remember the surrealism of Kenya's electoral servers, still owned by OT Safran Morpho, and apparently inaccessible from Kenya without interlocution by the French? There are currently no legal provisions, certainly none in the public domain, that prevent OT Morpho Safran from monetising data that Kenyans provided to enhance their democratic processes.

In my book, Digital Democracy, Analogue Politics, I call this ""digital colonialism"" - where a private corporation in one country is given political power over citizens of a second country for its own economic benefit.

The fact that Kenya's election database could not be made available on demand for what was arguably the most important legal process in the country's history is cause for major concern. Kenyan electoral data is now a product for digestion and monetisation in a legal domain beyond our control.

How free can a country be when citizen information that is central to government and governance is nothing more than a commercial product owned by a foreign corporation?

Significantly, the Kenyan government has not demonstrated that it can be trusted with Kenyans personal data.

A report from Tactical Tech reveals the extent of abuse that occurred during the 2017 presidential election in the absence of a rigorous data protection law. Voter registers were available for sale and were publicly available through SMS and web, which allowed politicians to send unsolicited text messages and even make calls to voters.

Party lists collected by the various political parties also contained key private data and were not secured in any meaningful way.

Outside the election, Privacy International has also reported on how mobile data from Kenyans is routinely handed over to the police and other security actors to facilitate other forms of human rights abuse, like extrajudicial executions or arbitrary arrest and detention.

Kenyans also routinely complain of their private mobile data being sold to third-party service providers without their consent. They often receive a barrage of unsolicited text messages and have to pay to unsubscribe from such premium services.

Women have also complained of being harassed by security guards to whom they must provide key contact details before accessing any public or private buildings.

As it stands, if you are Kenyan, your data is not secure or safe, especially not from a government that has routinely avoided creating a legal framework to at least give citizens some form of recourse when violations happen. This Huduma number is an ill-timed, ill-advised initiative that should be suspended until further public participation and consultation occur.

265,Empty,2019-02-21T13:30:50Z,Michael Kazin Why and how the region switched from being the stronghold of one party to the base of its adversary. The post The Southern Paradox: The Democratic Party Below the Mason-Dixon Line appeared first on The Nation.,"As long as there has been a US government, white Southerners have done their best to dominate it. They shoehorned the three-fifths clause into the Constitution, expanded slavery beyond the banks of the Mississippi River, started an armed rebellion to preserve that evil institution, created terrorist outfits like the Ku Klux Klan to sabotage Reconstruction, installed an American version of apartheid, and then fought the modern civil-rights movement with bombast, filibusters, and violence. In the 1960s, when a Democratic president and Congress finally passed laws that nullified the most blatantly racist statutes in the South, resentful whites below the Mason-Dixon Line began migrating to the Republican Party, which betrayed its Lincolnian roots in return for a sizable new constituency. The Mississippi voters who elected Cindy Hyde-Smith, a latter-day admirer of the Confederacy, to the US Senate last fall were merely extending a long, benighted tradition.

Lapinski Buy this book The Unsolid South: Mass Politics and National Representation in a One-Party Enclave By Devin Caughey Buy this book

Yet in that same region often lurked another set of impulses that today’s progressives might cheer. In 1877, during a nationwide railroad strike, a Memphis newspaper asserted that the federal government should be “wrested from the hands of those who manipulate it to their own aggrandizement and to the oppression of the masses.” It was only one of many newspapers to champion the cause of organized labor. Three decades later, every major piece of legislation that President Woodrow Wilson signed to regulate big business—from a major anti-trust act to an eight-hour day for railroad workers—was crafted by a Democrat from one of the states that barred most African Americans from voting. Later, when Franklin Roosevelt sat in the White House, such landmark New Deal achievements as Social Security, the minimum wage, and protections for labor organizers would not have become law without the backing of explicitly racist lawmakers from Dixie.

The authors of two new books—David Bateman, Ira Katznelson, and John Lapinski in Southern Nation: Congress and White Supremacy After Reconstruction and Devin Caughey in The Unsolid South: Mass Politics and National Representation in a One-Party Enclave—take up this apparent contradiction and show how it helps to explain why the region switched from being the stronghold of one party to the base of its adversary.

Both books also come to a similar conclusion: that most white voters in the South, as well as the politicians they elected, were fine with egalitarian economic policies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries so long as they didn’t threaten to disrupt the Jim Crow order. Some endorsed these policies for purely instrumental reasons—as the price of sustaining an alliance with Democrats from the urban North who needed to win the votes of industrial workers. But others believed, with ample justification, that industrialists and Wall Street financiers ran the economy solely to benefit themselves, at the expense of small farmers and wage earners. Of course, the only exploitation these voters cared about was that suffered by white people, and this “egalitarian whiteness”—the concise term used by Bateman, Katznelson, and Lapinski to describe this combination of racial supremacy and working-class egalitarianism—helped keep the South solidly Democratic through the first half of the 20th century.

It is fitting that these historically minded works of political science bear the imprint of Princeton University Press. After all, the university’s most famous president was a distinguished political scientist who grew up in Dixie and, as the nation’s 28th president, instituted some notable reforms while also overseeing the segregation of a large part of the federal bureaucracy.

Southern Nation is the more ambitious of the two volumes. Its authors examine not just how Dixie Democrats forged and fought for a common agenda in Congress built around both white supremacy and taxing the rich, but also how much this agenda ended up shaping domestic policy writ large. When lawmakers from the South strongly favored a bill, such as the Federal Reserve Act or the 16th Amendment allowing Congress to impose an income tax, it passed. When they opposed a bill, such as the one proposed by Republicans in the late 1880s that would have enabled federal officials to supervise the conduct of elections all across the country, they nearly always managed to kill it.

And Southern politicians kept winning on Capitol Hill even when their party didn’t control the White House or either chamber of Congress. By the early 20th century, most Republicans had essentially given up the battle to secure the right to vote that the 15th Amendment had guaranteed to black men—a right that the Democrats, who ruled every Southern state, had gradually stripped away from them. Moreover, some GOP leaders were quite willing to endorse that effort: In his 1909 inaugural address, President William Howard Taft confidently proclaimed, “The danger of the control of an ignorant electorate has…passed. With this change, the interest which many of the Southern white citizens take in the welfare of the negroes has increased.” It is hard to overestimate the power of a bloc of lawmakers united by the aim of preserving a racial order and able to use their mastery of the rules to wear down, if not convert, the opposition. Current Issue View our current issue

The authors of Southern Nation make their argument through a rigorous analysis of scores of legislative conflicts and outcomes. In less skillful hands, this could make for a long slog through a series of arcane disputes among politicians whom even most historians of the period ignore. But Bateman, Katznelson, and Lapinski know how to tell a good story, which on occasion also turns out to be a rather dramatic one. In 1922, for example, Congress had a sizable Republican majority, and the party, which still retained traces of its abolitionist heritage, seemed poised to pass an anti-lynching bill that black activists and journalists like Ida B. Wells had long advocated. It would have been the first significant blow against legal racism since the end of Reconstruction, in 1877. The bill’s sponsors even persuaded one border-state Democrat, as well as seven of his Northern colleagues, to support it. But Southerners in the Senate found ways to slow down the process and threatened to filibuster the measure if it came up for debate on the floor. By the end of the year, the GOP’s leaders had surrendered and moved on. As the authors note, “The belief that the South could unilaterally, and relatively easily, defeat civil rights legislation would endure for decades.”

Dixie lawmakers also kept regulations placed on a critical part of the economy from undercutting the Jim Crow order. In 1906, Congress—then under GOP control—passed the Hepburn Act, a landmark measure that set an upper limit on railroad rates and required the transport firms to file annual reports with the Interstate Commerce Commission. Southern lawmakers made clear that they hoped to vote for the measure but would filibuster it to death if it included language that did away with segregated passenger cars. Progressive Republicans acquiesced to their Democratic colleagues. “After the deed was done,” the authors write, “a black paper from Indianapolis mocked the sight of the ‘old parties join[ing] hands on the color line.’”

Southern Nation’s single-minded emphasis on the grim achievements of a determined group of Dixiecrats neglects the influence that Democrats from other regions had on the party’s increasing commitment to anti-corporate and pro-labor causes. During the early 20th century, the bosses of New York’s Tammany Hall called for the municipal ownership of utilities and the inspection of factories and groomed progressives like Alfred E. Smith and Robert Wagner to become leaders, first in New York State and then on a national scale. In his three runs for the presidency, William Jennings Bryan, who hailed from Nebraska, courted unions and argued for passing a strongly progressive income tax and clapping the violators of antitrust laws in jail. During his 1908 campaign, Bryan won the endorsement of the American Federation of Labor—the start of a long, if often troubled, marriage between the Democrats and organized labor.

Even so, the authors of Southern Nation are right to emphasize the considerable sway of segregationists over the party in the first half of the 20th century. No leading Democrat from the North or West was willing to risk dividing his party by standing up for the rights of black people. “Egalitarian whiteness” even wormed its way into some of the landmark bills of the New Deal. The National Labor Relations Act of 1935, written by Wagner, excluded workers who toiled in agriculture or other people’s homes—the only occupations available to most black people in the South at the time. When first enacted, Social Security also left those same groups out in the cold.

But even as Northern Democrats wrote such racist exclusions into law, their Dixie brethren were beginning to doubt that Roosevelt and the coalition he built really had their best interests at heart. As the mass suffering of the Depression faded, a growing number of Southern politicians voiced alarm that the interracial unions of the CIO, which undergirded the Democrats in the industrial North, might shatter the Jim Crow order if they organized successfully in the South as well. When, in 1947, a bipartisan majority passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which restricted strikes and boycotts and allowed states to pass “right-to-work” laws, only four Southern Democratic senators voted to uphold President Harry Truman’s veto.

Though most Democrats did not yet realize it, this vote marked a momentous disruption in the strong transregional coalition that had governed the nation since the early 1930s. The gap widened in 1948, when Hubert Humphrey and other liberal Democrats succeeded in getting a strong civil-rights plank added to the platform on which Truman would run that fall. Furious at this break with the party’s fidelity to Jim Crow, a group of segregationists bolted from the Democratic convention and nominated a States’ Rights ticket headed by South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond. From the end of Reconstruction until the 1950s, Democrats had won every single Senate election and nearly every House seat in the South. But by the time George W. Bush was elected president in 2000, conservative Republicans held a majority of those offices. The consequences of that rightward turn produced a sea change in American politics.

In The Unsolid South, Devin Caughey uncovers the roots of this transformation in the many combative primaries fought among Southern Democrats in the 1930s, ’40s, and ’50s. Party officials either prohibited blacks from voting in these contests or made it difficult or even dangerous for them to do so. But the primaries, in which only a white “selectorate” (as Caughey calls it) took part, still turned into pitched battles between those who defended the New Deal and hoped to expand it and those who warned that a party led by FDR and his liberal successors was beholden to powerful unions that could not be trusted to uphold white supremacy.

One of the starkest examples in Caughey’s book comes from a rural district in South Carolina. In 1948, Hugo Sims, a World War II veteran in his late 20s, took on John J. Riley, the incumbent congressman, who often voted with right-wing Republicans. Although Sims had the backing of the local CIO textile union, he ran on banal slogans like “The man who gets elected will be the one who knows and is liked by the most people” and swept the primary. Once he got to Washington, Sims supported every significant measure that the Truman administration proposed. The young pol insisted that he could “work out a liberal program a Southerner can run on and get elected.” But he neglected the growing hostility of his white constituents to Truman’s Fair Deal, which included presidential statements of support for civil rights and the desegregation of the armed forces. “We call it the Raw Deal down here,” snapped one white farmer. In the 1950 primary, Riley took on Sims again; this time, he crushed his young rival by 20 percentage points.

A decade before this, another young Southern congressman, one Lyndon Baines Johnson from Texas, had already learned the dangers of poking at the vitals of the racist order. In 1938, Johnson watched Maury Maverick, a liberal firebrand from San Antonio, lose his bid for renomination after he became the only Southern member of Congress to endorse a federal law against lynching. “I can go [only] so far in Texas…my people won’t take it,” Johnson complained to a fellow New Dealer. “Maury forgot that and he is not here…. There’s nothing more useless than a dead liberal.” Yet in the late ’50s, Johnson risked angering his own constituents and broke with his Southern colleagues to help pass a civil-rights act, the first since Reconstruction. By then, however, he had become the shrewd majority leader of the Democratic Caucus and wanted desperately to be president.

While Caughey’s study is empirically impressive, it lacks the popular touch that makes Southern Nation a pleasing, if lengthy, read. Those unfamiliar with social-science methods who come across such chapter subtitles as “Details of the Group-Level IRT Models” and “Variation Across Issue Domains” may decide that The Unsolid South is not for them. But Caughey’s granular text explains as well as any previous history why white Southerners were primed to vote for a conservative Republican like Barry Goldwater years before he ran for president in 1964. Except for just two occasions—when segregationist George Wallace ran as an independent in 1968, and when Jimmy Carter ran as a Democrat in 1976—a majority of white Southerners have cast their ballots for the Republican candidate in every presidential election since then.

These richly detailed books provide a sober, enlightening analysis of why Southern Democrats endured so long and prospered—before abandoning their partisan home for the embrace of a Republican Party led by the likes of Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, and the Bushes. But the authors seldom mention those episodes in the Southern past that, taken together, enable one to imagine a different, interracial, and more egalitarian path for the South.

In the 1880s and early 1890s, black and white Southerners organized in segregated branches of the Farmers’ Alliance and in the People’s Party to battle the harm that “the money power” was doing to the livelihood of small farmers. In the 1930s, ’40s, and ’50s, the Highlander Folk Center in rural Tennessee nurtured interracial movements for labor and black freedom that eventually helped shake up the entire region in the 1960s. And last fall, Stacey Abrams in Georgia, Andrew Gillum in Florida, and Beto O’Rourke in Texas all came close to writing a far more hopeful chapter in Dixie’s electoral history.

For now, however, most white Southerners continue to embody the same paradox that their ancestors did: They’re happy to benefit from the federal programs enacted by Democrats over the past century, while scorning the idea that the federal government should help black folks in equal ways. Ernest “Fritz” Hollings, the last Democratic senator from South Carolina (he retired in 2005), was fond of telling an anecdote about one of his white constituents who embodied this view. It is worth repeating in full:

A veteran returning from Korea went to college on the GI Bill, bought his house with an FHA loan, saw his kids born in a VA hospital, started a business with an SBA loan, got electricity from TVA and, later, water from an EPA project. His parents, living on Social Security, retired to a farm, got electricity from REA, and had their soil tested by the USDA. When his father became ill, the family was saved from financial ruin by Medicare, and a life was saved with a drug developed through NIH. His kids participated in the school lunch program, learned physics from teachers trained in an NSF program, and went to college with guaranteed student loans. He drove to work on the Interstate and moored his boat in a channel dredged by Army engineers. When floods hit, he took Amtrak to Washington to apply for disaster relief and spent some time in the Smithsonian museums. Then one day, he got mad. He wrote his senator an angry letter. “Get the government off my back,” he wrote. “I’m tired of paying taxes for all those programs created for ungrateful people!”

Only Democrats, of any race, who can speak truth to such Southerners and make them like it will finally put the long, painful dilemma of Dixie politics behind us.",The Southern Paradox: The Democratic Party Below the Mason-Dixon Line,Thenation.com,https://www.thenation.com/article/democratic-party-in-the-south-review-bateman-katznelson-lapinski-caughey/

Jay Inslee: Democrats will play by new rules if Trump's emergency declaration not stopped Washington Examiner Trump's Secret to Victory in 2020: Hispanic Voters POLITICO Charlie Kirk on the continuing fight over President Trump's border wall Fox News Wil…,"Washington Gov. Jay Inslee warned Republicans on Sunday that the Democratic Party will govern by the standard set by President Trump’s emergency declaration for border security, especially on the issue of climate change, if the GOP majority in the Senate don't fight it.

Trump declared a national emergency on the border with Mexico on Feb. 15, after Congress refused to give him the funding he had requested to build a border wall. Sixteen states, not including Washington, filed a lawsuit last week against the Trump administration over the order that would divert billions of dollars from the military for the project.

House Democrats have set a Tuesday vote to advance a resolution to reject Trump’s declaration. The measure is expected to easily pass in the Democratic-controlled House. In the Senate, Democrats need four Republicans to defect to put it on Trump’s desk. Trump said Friday he would “100 percent” veto the measure.

“Republicans ought to stand up on their hind legs, because they took an oath to the Constitution, not to Donald Trump, and reverse this decision,” Inslee, a Democrat, told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.

“But if there are new rules, the Republicans have to understand that Democrats will play by whatever the rules are, particularly when it comes to climate change,” he said.

Inslee, who has teased a possible 2020 campaign, also said during the interview that he could announce his decision as soon as this week.

“People want a president that will act on a real emergency, which is climate change,” he said. “[Americans] need a president who will rally the nation to a clean energy economy, jobs by the millions, and save this country from that damage.”",Gov.

""In terms of the constituencies that we are looking at, it's no different from the ones we contested in 2015 - subject of course to the redrawing of the boundaries which we won't know until closer to the election,"" Dr Chee told reporters at a Mandarin Orchard ballroom.

""But as it stands right now, it will be those same few constituencies that we contested in 2015.""

SDP had fielded 11 candidates in the 2015 General Election but failed to gain a seat. The party contested three Single Member Constituencies – Bukit Batok, Bukit Panjang and Yuhua - and two Group Representation Constituencies – Holland-Bukit Timah and Marsiling-Yew Tee.

The next general election must be held by April 2021.

The SDP’s new campaign slogan is “#SDPNOW, The Way Forward”, which Dr Chee said was based on the party’s ""vision"" and ""alternative policies"" for the future.

He added that the SDP has stuck to its beliefs and values.

""We're still continuing to fight the same things, because the PAP (People’s Action Party) refuses to change,"" he said.

""And in the interim, what they have done is that they have hit us, thrown the kitchen sink at us, but we've stuck to our message, we've never wavered in our belief that rights come before riches, people before profit, wisdom before wealth.""

He also explained why the SDP is kickstarting its campaign early.

""The fight, the contest, is won or lost way before those nine days (of campaigning). So for us, it's making sure we start early, we get people who are new here, coming to this event early enough ... Call us kiasu, I don't know, but it's important for us because we don't know when elections are going to be held. By the time it's held, it's going to be too late,” Dr Chee said.

Several SDP members took to the stage at the launch, including chairman Paul Tambyah and vice chairman John Tan.

Dr Tambyah talked about the “relentless rise in the cost of living”, as well as a “series of leaks and tragedies” that he said have caused people to question whether the PAP is up to the task of leading Singapore.

“I don’t think mistakes are going to go away,” he added. “I know they will happen, that malicious individuals will commit crimes that hurt many people and accidents also will happen, but what I’m concerned about is that nobody takes responsibility, or ownership of these disasters.""



A “CONSOLIDATED” OPPOSITION NEEDED: DR CHEE

In his speech, Dr Chee touched on the importance of having a “consolidated” opposition effort in local politics.

The SDP was among seven opposition parties which came together last year to explore the possibility of working closer together at the next general election.

Present at that meeting was political veteran Tan Cheng Bock, who recently filed an application to form a new political party called Progress Singapore Party.

“The first step is to get everybody to sit at the same table and ask the question - what are we trying to achieve?” Dr Chee said on Saturday. “I want to encourage our opposition friends to think of what we are fighting for and work towards that end where we have that common value, that goal we want to achieve.”

SDP chairman Paul Tambyah addresses the audience during his party’s campaign launch on Feb 23, 2019. (Photo: Matthew Mohan)

Mr Benjamin Pwee, who recently applied to join SDP after his resignation from the Democratic Progressive Party, was at the campaign launch.

“The launch was very good because it features public policy which is at the very heart and it is very much beliefs and values based rather than personality based,” Mr Pwee told Channel NewsAsia. “There are very few political parties who have the wherewithal to actually come up with good solid policy formulations.”

The SDP’s Central Executive Committee will meet in early March to consider the application of Mr Pwee, who contested in Bishan-Toa Payoh in the last two general elections.

According to SDP vice chairman John Tan, the party will progressively roll out a series of revised policies in the months to come, with their cost of living policy and housing policy to be unveiled in March.

The party is also planning to hold a pre-election rally at Hong Lim Park in September.","SDP launches election campaign, aims to contest same constituencies as in GE2015",Channelnewsasia.com,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sdp-launches-campaign-general-election-constituencies-11282880

On Saturday night, Harris was on the other side of town at the United Steelworkers hall, keynoting the Iowa Democratic Party Black Caucus. Klobuchar, as she always does, built her speech up to a quote from Walter Mondale, talking about Jimmy Carter’s presidency: “We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace.” Harris, as is her custom, progressed to a paraphrase of Coretta Scott King: “The fight for justice and the fight for civil rights must be fought and won with each generation.”

Afterward, I asked Klobuchar what she thought being a senator from Minnesota, compared with being a senator from California, would mean to Iowa.

“It means that for me, going south for the winter is going to Iowa. It’s easier to get here,” she said. “It’s important to have a lot of people running, but I am a candidate from the heartland, and it’s an important part of our path to success in the general election.”

Graeme Wood: The two Amy Klobuchars

Was she arguing that senators from the coasts—not just Harris, but Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Kirsten Gillibrand—wouldn’t be able to win?

“Senators from the coast have won in the heartland in the past. So I don’t think it’s that. It’s that my No. 1 request was to be on the Agriculture Committee. I served on that committee for 12 years. I’ve played a major role in getting the farm bill passed,” she said. “I know these issues here.”

Klobuchar likes talking about herself as an underdog, and structurally that’s how she started a campaign that many people thought she wasn’t actually going to go through with. She’s short on campaign staff, here and nationally, and arrived with just one person on her payroll and a handful of others who’d come in as volunteers. She had a surge of online fundraising after she announced, but aides have acknowledged in conversations with others that money is going to be a scramble and that her best hope is to scrape by enough to make it through Iowa, and then count on an explosion of interest if she wins to carry her over.

And so she lays it on thick, talking about the two states’ main agricultural exports, or how they both put a premium on butter-carving contests. On the list of ways the states are similar that she read from on Thursday evening: “You have the world-famous matchstick museum, and we have the only museum in the world devoted to Spam—or, as we call it, the ‘Guggen-ham.’”

But her main argument is that the country needs a pragmatic president, and that starts with making a pragmatic argument for why she should be the nominee.

“We need to win. So here’s my deal: I have won every single congressional district in the state of Minnesota, including Michele Bachmann’s, three times,” Klobuchar said, referring to the former congresswoman and 2012 Republican presidential candidate who helped popularize Tea Party politics in the run-up to a campaign that got much more attention than actual votes. With Democrats nationally nervous that Minnesota is in danger of slipping away—in a shocker, it had the smallest margin of any state Hillary Clinton won in 2016, and Trump’s campaign has been public about Minnesota being at the top of its 2020 target list—Klobuchar leaned in.",The Opposite Reasons Klobuchar and Harris Both Need Iowa,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/klobuchar-harris-need-win-iowa-caucuses-2020/583558/

The outcome of Sunday’s contest sets the stage for coalition talks or possibly new elections, just as the country has recovered from a political and economic crisis following a $1 billion banking scandal in 2014 and 2015.

Adding to the uncertainty, opposition leaders threatened street protests after raising suspicions of vote-buying.

The opposition Socialists, who favor closer ties to Moscow, emerged as the largest party with 35 out of 101 seats on a revised estimate, with recounts possible in some constituencies.

The ruling Democratic Party, which wants closer integration with the EU, came second with 30 seats while an opposition bloc called ACUM, campaigning to fight corruption, was third with 26 seats.

Democratic leader Vladimir Plahotniuc said his party was “ready for negotiations on forming a majority and approving a new government”, adding, “I hope that such negotiations take place as soon as possible”.

Corruption scandals and worries over the health of democracy in Moldova, which is squeezed between Ukraine and EU member Romania and is one of Europe’s poorest countries, have tarnished the country’s image and weakened the appeal of the pro-Western political class.

The Socialist Party said its lawyers were studying reported election violations and declared it may not recognize the results.

ACUM leader Maia Sandu said her bloc did not recognize the elections as free and democratic.

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said the elections were “generally well-run” but “tainted by allegations of pressure on public employees, strong indications of vote buying and the misuse of state resources”.

President Igor Dodon, formerly head of the Socialist Party, said it would become clear only in the coming weeks whether the election was above board. He raised the prospect of calling a new election in June if the vote was declared illegitimate or no party managed to form a coalition.

Dodon on Saturday had called the campaign “one of the dirtiest in our entire history”.

Plahotniuc, an oil-to-hotels tycoon, could repeat a feat he achieved at a previous election in 2014, of cobbling together a coalition despite not winning a majority.

He may woo a smaller party led by Ilan Shor, who just two years ago was convicted of fraud and money-laundering for his part in a scam to pilfer $1 billion out of three banks, the equivalent of an eighth of Moldova’s national output in what Moldovans call the “theft of the century”.

Shor denied wrongdoing and said he was made a scapegoat. After time spent under house arrest, he became mayor of the central town of Orhei while his appeal was heard.

His party won 7 seats on Sunday.

POISONED POLITICS

The election campaign was dogged by controversy.

In the past few days, ACUM’s leaders said they were being poisoned on the orders of the authorities, which the Democratic Party swiftly dismissed as a “strange accusation”.

Russia announced an investigation into Plahotniuc, accusing him of involvement in organized crime, prompting Plahotniuc’s party to accuse Moscow of election meddling.

The Democratic Party had already been accused of trying to bend the electoral system in its favor by introducing changes in 2017 on how votes are cast.

The crisis in Venezuela is sending tremors through Florida’s political landscape, emboldening Republicans and throwing Democrats on the defensive in the nation’s largest swing state.

Florida Republicans hope the outspoken push by President Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro will help the GOP strengthen its bonds with the state’s Hispanic voters, paying dividends in the 2020 election and beyond.

Opposition to the socialist regime in Caracas, which is closely aligned with communist Cuba, has been a shared cause of the state’s large and traditionally pro-Republican Cuban American and Venezuelan immigrant communities.

“It’s a huge moment for the Republican Party,” said Brian Ballard, a Florida lobbyist and GOP donor with ties to Trump and Rubio. “It will be like Donald Trump can [be] to Venezuelan American voters the way Ronald Reagan was to Cuban American voters.”

Adding to the tension is growing concern among Democrats that Trump and his allies, seizing on the party’s leftward shift, will move to portray his potential 2020 challengers as socialists and point to Venezuela’s collapse as a symbol of what’s wrong with the views they espouse.

Florida Democrats are disavowing the recent refusal by presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a self-described democratic socialist, to label Maduro a dictator and call for him to go, though Sanders has criticized him.

“They are clearly ignorant comments, and someone who’s running for president of the United States should be better briefed and knowledgeable about this crisis in Venezuela and how it impacts the Florida political landscape,” said Christian Ulvert, a Florida Democratic strategist who is of Nicaraguan descent and whose husband’s family has roots in Venezuela.

A Sanders aide said the candidate strongly supports self-determination for Venezuelans, but that to suggest the possibility of military intervention, as Trump has done, is irresponsible.

The emerging dynamic comes at the start of a closely watched two-year stretch for each party in Florida, as both see the state as an important front in the battle for control of the Oval Office. Democrats are hoping to make a comeback after their nominees for the White House, the U.S. Senate and the Florida governorship lost in the last two elections, despite initially appearing to have good odds.

Democrats for years have hoped Florida will move into their orbit, especially with the rise of a new generation of Cuban Americans that is less conservative and less driven by animus toward Cuba’s communist government.

President Barack Obama captured Florida in 2008 and 2012, and Trump’s anti-immigrant posture has alienated many Hispanic voters.

However, the state remains conservative in many ways, particularly its rural stretches and the Florida panhandle, and recent Democratic candidates, including former senator Bill Nelson and gubernatorial hopeful Andrew Gillum, were unable to prevail.

Now it’s Republicans who are hoping they can shift the state more firmly into their camp, powered by the GOP’s anti-Maduro push.

Still, the outcome of Trump’s Venezuela strategy remains to be seen and risks political blowback should the crisis continue to escalate. That could compound widespread concerns in Florida’s Latino communities about Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and hard-line border policies.

Trump traveled to Miami on Feb. 18 to deliver a speech urging Venezuelan military officers to abandon Maduro and pledge support for opposition leader Juan Guaidó. He also forcefully criticized socialism, invoked two countries with large exile communities in South Florida and seemed to draw a direct line between his foreign policy and his domestic political message.

“As the United States stands up for democracy in Venezuela, we reaffirm the solidarity with the long-suffering people of Cuba and Nicaragua and people everywhere living under socialist and communist regimes,” he said. “And to those who would try to impose socialism on the United States, we again deliver a very simple message: America will never be a socialist country.”

In recent weeks, Trump has intensified his critique of socialism, seeking to portray the Democrats running against him as far-left extremists who have embraced policies he casts as outside the mainstream.

Republicans believe those arguments could be effective, especially in some parts of South Florida, where an older generation of Cuban Americans whose relatives fled the communist regime — or who did so themselves — are deeply skeptical of left-wing governance.

At the moment, Cuban Americans are paying close attention to the situation unfolding in Venezuela, according to a local official, including how the Trump administration responds.

“Many Cubans here predicted what would happen in Venezuela,” said Carlos A. Gimenez, the Cuban-born mayor of Miami-Dade County. Gimenez, a Republican, said he was pleased to see Washington Republicans “putting down socialism” and argued that the administration’s strategy on Venezuela would help the GOP in Florida.

At the forefront of that strategy is Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants and a sharp Trump critic when they were rivals in the 2016 presidential race. Since then, the two have cultivated a more positive relationship, rooted heavily in collaborating on foreign policy in Latin America.

Rubio recently traveled to Colombia, visiting an area near the border with Venezuela. The senator also has been tweeting real-time updates about the volatile situation on the ground.

On Saturday, he posted a steady stream of messages, including information about aid trucks and the presence of the Venezuelan National Guard. “Very tense moments as civilians take to the street on #Venezuela side of border & peaceful aid workers have started up the trucks at border crossing,” he said in one tweet.

Among Democrats in Florida, there has been a lot of focus on a recent interview Sanders gave to Univision, a Spanish-language television network.

“Is Nicolás Maduro a dictator, senator, for you? And should he go?” anchor Jorge Ramos asked him.

Sanders replied, “I think clearly he has been very, very abusive.”

But he also signaled a desire to avoid repeating the U.S. approach used in the past, such as in the 1980s, when liberals strongly opposed Washington’s aggressive intervention in Latin American affairs.

As to whether Maduro should go, he continued, “That is a decision of the Venezuelan people. So I think, Jorge, there has got to be a free and fair election. But what must not happen is that the United States must not use military force and intervene.”

Sanders was asked whether he considered Guaidó to be the legitimate president, and he replied that he did not. Trump — as well as Democratic leaders and many Western countries — have recognized Guaidó as the interim president.

Some prominent Florida Democrats distanced themselves from Sanders’s comments.

“I’ll make it clear, @SenSanders does not reflect the majority of the Democratic Party and our support for Venezuela’s interim president @jguaido and the Venezuelan people. Maduro is a dictator and must go,” Rep. Donna Shalala (D-Fla.) tweeted on Thursday.

While Sanders is critical of Maduro, his foreign policy aide Matt Duss said Sanders forcefully opposes the option of U.S. military intervention, something the president has suggested is a possibility.

“Bernie strongly supports the right of democratic self-determination, for the Venezuelan people and those across the world,” Duss said in a statement. “The Trump administration even floating the possibility of military intervention is extremely dangerous and irresponsible, and we should be absolutely opposed to it.”

Ulvert recalled Democratic candidates in the 2018 campaign facing attacks from Republicans who sought to cast them as socialists, and he fears a repeat in 2020. “My worry level is growing every month,” he said.

Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in Florida by just 1.2 percentage points in 2016. In 2018, both the governor’s race and the U.S. Senate race went to recounts.

Florida has always been a politically complex state, with major cities from Miami to Tampa to Orlando to Jacksonville. Influential voting blocs range from Latin American immigrants to Jewish retirees to dairy farmers, and tourism and the environment are among the state’s diverse concerns.

While Democrats still hold the advantage in winning Hispanic voters statewide, some party leaders worry they need to do more to counter GOP strategies there.

Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who served as governor for eight years before his election to Congress in November, ran Spanish-language TV ads and emphasized his outreach to Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

Scott narrowly defeated Nelson, whose campaign drew complaints from within the Democratic Party, including that he was not aggressive enough in courting Hispanic voters.

Gillum, a former Tallahassee mayor, generated enthusiasm among Democrats when he won the primary in an upset, but he lost to Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was strongly supported by Trump.

Democrats insist Florida has not slipped from their grasp — especially if they can run well-prepared campaigns that provide more face time in Latino communities.

Democrats gained two U.S. House seats in South Florida, they note, even though Nelson and Gillum lost in 2018.

But new revelations show almost no one understands what really happened back in the 1930s.,"Judge Glock is a senior policy adviser with 8vc, a venture capital firm, and the Cicero Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. He may be reached at judge@8vc.com.

Americans spent much of 2018 with their eyes trained on the Supreme Court—from its rulings on presidential travel bans and public employee unions to Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation battle, the most heated confirmation battle in modern memory. So it should be no surprise that many are talking about ways to reform the court.

Some Democrats even want to revive the most famous, or infamous, attempt at Supreme Court reform in history: President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s proposal to pack the court with extra justices in 1937. In Philadelphia this week, presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., said that court packing was “no more a departure from norms than what the Republicans did to get the judiciary to the place it is today.”

Story Continued Below

FDR’s court-packing battle is one of the best-known constitutional struggles in U.S. history. The story, as it’s often been told, pits an entrenched, reactionary Supreme Court, which overturned a slew of Roosevelt’s New Deal economic reforms, against a hubristic president willing to take the unprecedented step of asking Congress to appoint six new, and sympathetic, justices to the bench. Only a national outcry against this unconstitutional skulduggery, along with a newly cowed court that began upholding Roosevelt’s laws, stopped the plan.

Yet this narrative gets much of the court-packing episode wrong. New research I have conducted, forthcoming in the Journal of American History, demonstrates that Roosevelt saw his plan in the context of a long tradition of judicial reform, not as a departure from it. FDR wanted to encourage older justices to retire, not to add extra justices to the bench. He saw a recent, although now nearly forgotten, law cutting Supreme Court pensions as preventing retirements and thus appointments that were his due. The court-packing episode was partially an attempt to fix retirement issues—not a mere presidential power grab. And at the time, at least at first, many in the press and public agreed with him.

Today, those looking to reform the Supreme Court might want to look away from court packing and instead consider the seemingly mundane issue of judicial retirement—and how it has reshaped the court throughout its history. A new SCOTUS retirement plan might just be the best way to protect the court’s independence from the hyperpartisanship of our times.



***

Although the Constitution provides clear methods for putting judges on the bench, it says little about how to get them off. The Founding Fathers assumed federal judges would just die in their seats. Of course, back then, life expectancies were shorter than they are today. But the founders also viewed any government-provided pension as corrupt patronage the Constitution could not condone. Therefore, judges who left the bench early would sacrifice their livelihoods. As Alexander Hamilton predicted in the Federalist Papers, few did.

Starting in the 1860s, however, a series of Republican Congresses began providing full salaries and benefits to all federal judges who retired, with the explicit idea that this would encourage some of the older, and, in that era, Democratic, judges to leave. It worked and opened several seats for the Republican Party.

Yet what Congress could give, it could also take away. Although the Constitution contains a clause protecting judges’ salaries, that clause did not apply to retirement packages. This loophole has provided an unfortunate means for politicians to manipulate the court. Twice in the 50 years after the first retirement provision, Congress passed laws stating that a particular unfavored justices could only collect their retirement money if they left the court in the following few months, and the justices obliged. Such nakedly political laws became the new normal after retirement was in place.

Then, in 1932, a little-noticed Depression-era austerity act cut Supreme Court justices’ retirement salary in half, almost as an afterthought to broader cuts. At the time, President Herbert Hoover’s attorney general warned that the law meant justices “will hang on like grim death until the Angel Gabriel blows the horn.”

He was right. I discovered a previously unpublished letter in which conservative Justice Willis Van Devanter wrote to his sister, “I do not like the idea of losing half of my salary by retiring” and that he would stay on the court. In fact, no justice would retire for the next five years, the longest period without a retirement since the creation of the nine-member Supreme Court. The lack of retirements, and the subsequent conservative battle with Roosevelt, is almost certainly a result of this cut in retirement pay.

As early as 1935, Roosevelt recognized the dilemma and tried to pass a bill restoring full retirement salaries. He failed because of lingering concerns about tight budgets during the Depression. Yet the court’s continued opposition to New Deal laws, especially by the older justices, led FDR to reach for more drastic reforms. In February 1937, he proposed a bill that would appoint an extra justice for every justice older than 70 who didn’t retire. In a little noticed addendum to his proposal, he asked that Congress also restore full judicial pensions.

While today this proposal is often seen as an attempt to pack the court with six extra judges, it was in the tradition of older judicial retirement reforms. Records in the Roosevelt library and the papers of Roosevelt’s attorney general at the time, Homer Cummings, demonstrate that Roosevelt modeled his proposal after the 1860s Republican Congress’ plan, as well as a now-forgotten Democratic reform to the lower courts put in place in the 1910s, which allowed the president to appoint an extra judge for any older judge who hadn’t retired and taken his or her pension. Historians have missed the close parallels between these earlier retirement reforms and Roosevelt’s proposal. But these parallels explain why most reporters and members of Congress did not regard Roosevelt’s bill with alarm in its early days, and why most thought it would pass.

Some of the earliest critics of the bill, like the deans of New York University and Fordham law schools, however, decried the attempt to unpack the court by encouraging older judges to retire. Publicly, Roosevelt and Cummings agreed, saying that if the older justices took advantage of a newly restored pension, the court would stay at nine members.

Many popular histories today focus on the “switch in time that saved nine”—conservative Justice Owen Roberts’ public decision to start upholding New Deal measures barely two months after Roosevelt’s proposal. But, as some historians have noted, Roberts’ decision to “switch” had been made long before Roosevelt’s plan was unveiled and did little to persuade either the president or Democrats in Congress to back down from their court reform proposal. It was only after Congress passed a bill that restored justices’ full pensions, separate from Roosevelt’s overall package, and Van Devanter retired at his full salary in May 1937 that FDR’s allies gave up the fight for the larger court reform bill.

Although the retirement aspects of the 1937 court struggle have been forgotten, the 1937 Supreme Court retirement bill remains in force today and justices can retain their full pensions when they retire.

Yet the existence of judicial pensions creates problems that were unanticipated by the founders. For one, these pensions can still be can be manipulated by Congress for partisan purposes. For those concerned about politicization of the court, there is nothing to prevent a future Congress from changing retirement salaries to either encourage or discourage justices to retire, as it did from the 1860s to 1930s.

More importantly, the pension system in place since 1937 means justices can wait to leave and collect their full salary until a like-minded president and Senate are in place. With partisanship at new heights, justices now practice “strategic retirement,” meaning that they in effect pick their successor. This leads to long-term “conservative” and “liberal” seats and makes every appointment one whose effects linger for many decades. These strategic retirements further elevate the importance of every court appointment and help make them near apocalyptic struggles that would have baffled the founders, who thought justices would either leave or die at random after they were on the bench.

So what’s the answer? Is there a way to avoid both a stultified bench and SCOTUS partisan shenanigans? There is one retirement reform proposal that could improve both issues. A constitutional amendment that limits each justice to a set amount of time—say, 18 years—on the bench would mean each would have no power beyond his or her own term, limiting the importance of each appointment. It is one of the few constitutional amendments that has found support from both liberal and conservative legal professors, and it is the only one that has been endorsed by both Senator Ted Cruz and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Such a constitutional amendment would also make irrelevant proposals to either pack or unpack the Supreme Court, which have unfortunately aggravated our political divides for generations.",The Lost History of FDR’s Court-Packing Scandal,Politico,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/24/the-lost-history-of-fdrs-court-packing-scandal-225201

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not the future of the Democratic Party.

WATCH:

Lieberman, during a Sunday morning “Fox & Friends” appearance, argued again that Ocasio-Cortez is not the future of the Democratic Party.

“Well, I hope not,” he said. “Look, she’s a congresswoman. She won a primary. She didn’t get an enormous number of votes but enough to win. She’s one congresswoman. Incidentally, she’s not typical of the new Democrats who have been elected to the Congress. Most of them are center or left, not far left, because they won in swing districts.” (RELATED: Joe Lieberman’s Formula For Democrats Winning In 2020 Does Not Include Ocasio-Cortez)

Host Katie Pavlich reminded Lieberman of a now infamous Twitter spat between the former senator and Ocasio-Cortez that ended with the newly-sworn-in congresswoman saying of Lieberman, “New party, who dis?”

“Dis me,” Lieberman cracked with a smile. “I’ve been here awhile. Here is the point. In the American political system, the time that the parties really say what they’re about is when they nominate a presidential candidate. This is just beginning, and I’m saying that if Ocasio-Cortez is the leader of the pack, as we go into the presidential primaries next year, a candidate is going to be nominated who simply cannot get elected because America doesn’t support the big government socialistic extreme and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement that she’s been talking about, so she’s got a voice but let’s not give it, let’s not listen to it more than it deserves.”

Lieberman concluded by saying that even if embracing the Green New Deal, open borders and other extreme positions is where the “soul of the Democratic Party” is, “Well that’s not where the soul of America is, and that’s what worries me.”

As discussion on the Governor’s address resumed Wednesday, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) launched an attack on the government with former cabinet minister Bikram Singh Majithia taking a jibe at Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on promises made before the polls saying that “the gift wrapping was so wonderful, but there was nothing inside.”

“When Congress made the pre-poll promises, people thought ‘Banda magron pahunchu, naukri pehlaan khari hou. Banda magron pahunchu, karja pehlaan maaf hoya hou (Before a man reached home he will get a job offer and before a farmer reached home, his debt would be waived off)’,” Majithia said.

The AAP leader said that that only crop loan was waived off, “which accounted for only two per cent”. He said police action was being taken against the farmers for not paying back the loans and “15,000 farmers had been identified to be sent to jail while 100 farmers are absconding”.

Majithia said that on one side government had made provision for reservation of 50 per cent for women in Panchayati Raj Institutions and on the other there were incidents where a Congress MLA would tell a woman police officer that “Tu rab taan nahi lag gayi (You have not become God)”, and a minister would reprimand a woman District Education Officer.

AAP MLA Rupinder Kaur Ruby said 50 per cent reservation to women “appears limited to papers only.” She said, “There are Panchayats that have women sarpanches but, the panchayats are run by their husbands.” She said this had been happening due to lack of education.

Jai Kishan Singh Rori, also of AAP, said had unemployed youth got jobs they would not have been making beeline to go abroad. “You park four planes and invite people from Punjab telling that planes were heading to countries like United States and United Kingdom. Everyone would board the planes.” said Rori.

“There is a saying that the proof of pudding lies in eating,” AAP MLA Kanwar Sandhu said, questioning the employment claims of the government. He added that the way youth were heading abroad to countries like Georgia, Armenia presented a contrasting picture to government claims.

Pointing out that private players continued to have upper hand than the government in running the buses, AAP legislator Sarabjit Kaur Manuke said permits of 73 integral coach buses of private players were “cancelled” years ago, but the buses were still “operating”.

Calling Punjab Vidhan Sabha a “democratic train”, Lok Insaf Party legislator Simarjit Singh Bains said, “In previous SAD-BJP government (then chief minister) Parkash Singh Badal was the driver sitting at number one seat. I was sitting at seat number 117. As a guard, I blew the whistle several times telling him that the train was getting derailed due to drugs and mafia. But he did not listen to my whistles. From 60, they (Akali Dal) got reduced to 14 (MLAs).”

Bains said only the driver of the train has changed. As guard, he said, he continues to “blow the whistle”.

He said Congress government was claiming zero tolerance on corruption, but in Pathankot alone there was “illegal” business of Rs 5 crore in sand and gravel.

He said transport mafia has continued to loot people. Bains said buses of private players were given more time to board passengers than the government buses.

Transport minister Aruna Chaudhary in her response said matter relating to permits was sub judice and permits will be cancelled as per new policy.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Brahm Mohindra said the bill making it mandatory for MLAs to give details of property was ready and likely to be introduced in the ongoing session.

From the beginning of the modern era of popular control of the presidential nominating process (basically inaugurated in 1972) to very recently, the unrepresentative nature of the first two stops on the road to the presidency, the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses and the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary, was a chronic complaint. This was especially true for an increasingly diverse Democratic Party that nonetheless gave two small and very white states (as of the 2000 census, Iowa was 94 percent white and New Hampshire was 96 percent white) protected status as dominant factors in the nominating process.

After the 2004 cycle, Democrats (followed eventually by Republicans) got serious about this problem, and introduced calendar reforms that added two more diverse states — Latino-heavy Nevada and African-American–heavy South Carolina — to the early mix. Super-honkified Iowa and New Hampshire still got to go first, but nonwhite voters got to have a say before the whole deal was done. Indeed, Barack Obama’s successful nomination strategy combined an Iowa win with a dominant performance in southern states with large African-American voting populations, beginning with South Carolina. Hillary Clinton followed the same pattern in overcoming a terrible New Hampshire performance in 2016 by wins over Bernie Sanders in Nevada and South Carolina that put her ahead for good.

The 2020 nominating contest will represent a big leap forward in the development of a more diverse early calendar for Democrats, as Ron Brownstein explains:

As in every recent Democrat primary race, the 2020 contest will begin in two virtually all-white states, with the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary in early February. But after that the next month of the primary calendar is dominated by states across the Sun Belt where non-white voters comprise a large share, and often an absolute majority, of the electorate.

This decisive turn toward diversity, reinforced by California’s decision to move up its primary to Super Tuesday, represents a potentially critical new wrinkle in the nomination process. The pivot begins with Nevada and South Carolina, where contests will be held in the second half of February. The tilt toward diversity then explodes in early March when big Sun Belt states from Florida, North Carolina and Virginia in the southeast to Arizona and Texas along with California across the southwest will all crowd together on the calendar.

This shift may actually be intensified by the fact that while Iowa and New Hampshire have never embraced early voting, their new competitors emphatically have, as my colleague Gabriel Debenedetti has pointed out:

[S]trategists aligned with potential contenders’ teams are already starting to plan for 2020 by operating under the assumption that early voting in California — the state with the most delegates up for grabs — will start the very morning of Iowa’s evening caucuses, the traditional kickoff. (Vermont’s primary voting will have already begun by that point, if the current expected schedule holds.)

Usually, all the attention then shifts to New Hampshire directly after Iowa. This time, though, Ohio and Illinois could both begin their own early voting before the Granite State’s day in the spotlight, and Georgia and North Carolina could start the day of New Hampshire’s primary. Then the windows could open in Tennessee, Texas, Arizona, and Louisiana before Nevada’s caucuses, let alone South Carolina’s primary.

All these wrinkles are likely to reinforce nonwhite voting power, notes Brownstein:

Through March 17, the Democratic candidates will face significant Latino populations in Texas and California on Super Tuesday and then Florida and Arizona on March 17 …

Starting on Super Tuesday [March 3], large black populations will vote through mid-March in Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida and Illinois. In all of these states, minorities comprised at least about two-fifths of the 2018 vote, and they reached majority status in several of them, including Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and Texas. Given the overall trends in the party, Democratic strategists consider it likely that the nonwhite share of the vote in virtually all of these states will be higher in 2020 than it was in 2016.

If that’s not enough diversity, New York may move its primary to March as well.

These dynamics will likely help candidates who really do well among nonwhite voters while hurting those who don’t. It could, as in 2008, put a minority candidate in the driver’s seat, though the fact that there are at this point a Latino (Julian Castro) and two African-American (Cory Booker and Kamala Harris) candidates could keep the nonwhite vote split up for a good while.

It’s even possible that candidates will be tempted to skip or skimp on Iowa and New Hampshire as outlier states. But the fact remains that the only candidate since 1976 to win a presidential nomination in either party while losing both Iowa and New Hampshire was Bill Clinton in 1992, who was running against a relatively small and weak field at a time when Iowa was taken off the table by favorite son Tom Harkin.

So the former longtime duopoly of Iowa and New Hampshire will still matter in 2020. But they’d do well to elevate candidates who are prepared to excel in the next very difference phase of the nominating process. Indeed, with a good opening push from the very white electorate of these two states, a candidate with strong minority voting appeal could wrap things up relatively early despite the vast field of rivals she or he will face.",The New Democratic Primary Calendar Makes Voters of Color Even More Important,New York Magazine,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/new-democratic-primary-calendar-2020-election-race.html

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is fast-tracking a Green New Deal resolution through the Senate, enabling a vote as early as next week.

The resolution was authored by rising freshman star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and longtime climate advocate Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. It is nonbinding but calls for Congress to take the lead in ridding the nation of fossil fuels in the next few decades, among other dramatic environmental and economic changes.

The plan to eradicate fossil fuels is considered so drastic, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked Markey after reading the resolution, “What in the heck is this?”

Some Democrats are distancing themselves, but others will likely back the resolution, including a bevy of Democrats running for president.

“I’m proud to co-sponsor @AOC and @EdMarkey's Green New Deal,” Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who is running for president, said on Twitter. “We must aggressively tackle climate change which poses an existential threat to our nation.”

Other presidential hopefuls backing the deal include Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kristen Gillibrand, D-N.Y., as does Julian Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii.

But McConnell is eager to put Senate Democrats into a potentially difficult political position by forcing them to take a side. “We’ll give everyone an opportunity to go on record and see how they feel about the Green New Deal,” McConnell said earlier this month.

It's not yet clear if the vote will create the wide split McConnell is looking for. Some Democrats, like Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have indicated they will vote against it, and at least some Democrats are likely to vote ""no"" when forced to decide.

But the upcoming 2020 election is also a factor. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who entered the presidential race as a party moderate, hedged when asked on Fox News whether she backs the Green New Deal.

""The Green New Deal? I see it as aspirational,” Klobuchar said on Fox News. Klobuchar said she would vote yes on the resolution but not necessarily specific legislation aimed at implementing the goals laid out in the nonbinding measure.

“If it got down to the nitty-gritty of an actual legislation, as opposed to, here's some goals we have, that would be different for me,"" she said.

Democrats stumbled as they rolled out the Green New Deal in a way that allowed Republicans to mock the plan as pie-in-the-sky. It was accompanied by a fact sheet produced by Ocasio-Cortez’s staff that called for eliminating the need for air travel, retrofitting every house and building to green energy standards, and reforming the nation’s agricultural practices to eliminate cows.

Ocasio-Cortez removed the document, but Republicans plan to keep touting its radical provisions as the Senate heads toward a vote. But Ocasio-Cortez this week didn't back down from her calls to curb methane-producing cows and the proposal to end environmental damage caused by large-scale farming.

She said on a Showtime comedy show this week, “We need to take a look at factory farming, and maybe we shouldn't be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.”

Meanwhile, Senate Democratic leaders know the GOP is setting a trap and call the vote on the resolution a political stunt designed to split them.

“Since Republicans took control of this chamber in 2015, they have not brought a single Republican bill to meaningfully reduce carbon emissions to the floor of the Senate,” said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.. “Not one bill. Republicans have controlled this chamber for over four years. Not a single bill to significantly reduce carbon emissions.”",McConnell hopes to trap Democrats in their own Green New Deal - Washington Examiner,Washingtonexaminer.com,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/mcconnell-hopes-to-trap-democrats-in-their-own-green-new-deal
278,Empty,2019-02-22T14:47:10Z,A one-term pledge could stave off critics who say Bernie Sanders is too old — and allow him to focus on passing bold policies without worry of re-election. The post Why Bernie Sanders Should Promise to Serve Only One Term as President appeared first on The In…,"Nevertheless, his age is still an issue. It would be mad to pretend otherwise . “Since 1828,” reported Axios on Wednesday, “only 3 Democratic presidents have been in their 60s when inaugurated — and none came close to Sanders, who would be 79 if elected in 2020.”

“We began the political revolution in the 2016 campaign, and now it’s time to move that revolution forward,” Bernie Sanders said on Tuesday morning, as he announced his candidacy for president of the United States. Within 24 hours, he had raised a whopping $6 million from more than 200,000 donors. And according to the latest polls , he is the most popular of the declared candidates.

If he were to win the next election, the independent senator from Vermont, who is five years older than Donald Trump, would be the oldest president in the history of the United States — six years older than Ronald Reagan was when he won re-election in 1984. In terms of the Democratic primaries, if 77-year-old former Vice President Joe Biden chooses not to run, Sanders will be the only candidate above the age of 70 come the first round of Democratic presidential debates this summer.

So how does he neutralize this issue?

There is a possible — if unconventional — solution: Sanders should promise to serve only one term in the White House. Four years max! 2020 and done!

A one-term pledge isn’t as crazy as it might sound. As the Washington Post’s Philip Bump noted in 2015:

Three American presidents made — and kept — pledges to serve one term at most. Rutherford B. Hayes and James K. Polk made one-term pledges; each served one term. William Henry Harrison, our second-oldest president at 68, also took a pledge to serve only one term, a pledge that was in keeping with his Whig Party. That pledge turned out not to matter; he barely served a full month before dying.

In recent years, high-profile — and older — figures in both parties have seriously entertained the idea. Seventy-year-old John McCain was “inches away” from making a one-term pledge when he announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in 2007. Then-73-year-old Biden considered it in 2015, and may do so again this time around.

Think about it: There are several clear advantages to any older candidate, but especially Sanders, renouncing any ambition to serve a second term in the Oval Office. For a start, while Sanders and his surrogates might be able to defend the idea of a president who is in his late 70s, they might struggle to convince voters that he’d be as effective in his late 80s (he’d be, ahem, 87 at the end of his second term).

There are benefits beyond just Sanders’s age. Making such a pledge would be a dramatic and bold move that could shake up the Democratic primaries. Whether we like it or not, horse race-obsessed reporters and pundits love dramatic and bold moves. The more unconventional, the better. Sanders would immediately stand out from a crowded Democratic field, many of whom have adopted his ideas on everything from health care to higher education. It would make the Vermont senator look like he is interested only in the issues — in contrast to the naked ambitions of some of his younger rivals.

In fact, one of Sanders’s biggest selling points has always been that he is an independent and an outsider. A one-term pledge would only reinforce that iconoclastic image and boost his anti-establishment appeal with the millions of Americans who loathe the Washington political class.

His rationale for such a pledge could be both simple and popular: As president, he would be free of re-election pressures and distractions, allowing him to devote a full four years to two or three major issues: Medicare For All, a Green New Deal, and, maybe, free college for all, too.

A one-term pledge would only reinforce that iconoclastic image and boost his anti-establishment appeal.

There is a danger, of course, that a one-term president would be seen as a lame-duck. Maybe. On the other hand, Sanders would come to office with a very specific and time-sensitive mandate to get things done. His pledge might make it harder for Republicans in the Senate to block his agenda, given he’ll have been elected to serve only four years and won’t face the re-election pressures that they will. And, in terms of his legacy, he would also be dodging the second-term curse that has plagued so many previous presidents.

Finally, in declaring that he would only serve four years in office, Sanders could bestow much more significance on whomever he picks as his running mate. There is an opportunity here for the senator to address the “identity politics” objection to his candidacy, or what some might call his “old white guy” problem.

This is the most diverse field of Democratic presidential candidates in American history. Plenty of people in the party’s base, even those who are ardent fans of the Vermont senator and his politics, don’t want an all-white or all-male presidential ticket (and for good reason!).

So why not put Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for Georgia governor in 2018, on the ticket — and all but guarantee her the Democratic presidential nomination come 2024?

280,Empty,2019-02-21T13:00:00Z,"Voter ID laws don’t suppress voters or combat voter fraud after all, according to a new study.","Strict voter ID laws, now on the books in 10 states, have gotten a lot of attention over the past several years. Supporters argue that they’re necessary to stop voter fraud, particularly voter impersonation. But critics argue that the laws, by restricting voting, make it harder for minority voters in particular to cast a ballot.

But a new study suggests that the laws, which require certain IDs to vote, may do neither.

The study, from Enrico Cantoni at the University of Bologna and Vincent Pons at Harvard Business School, found that voter ID laws don’t decrease voter turnout, including that of minority voters. Nor do they have a detectable effect on voter fraud — which is extremely rare in the US, anyway.

The implication: Despite the legal and political battles over voter ID laws, they don’t really seem to do much of anything.

The researchers caution that their results “should be interpreted with caution” and that they “do not see our results as the last word on this matter — quite the opposite.” Still, the findings join a growing body of research that suggests voter ID laws have a much smaller effect than critics feared and proponents hoped.

Democrats argue that the laws discriminate against minority and younger voters who are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates, because they’re less likely to have the money, transportation means, and flexible work hours needed to obtain a required ID. Republicans, on the other hand, insist that the measures are meant only to protect against voter fraud, although in some cases they’ve admitted that the intent is to make it harder for some groups to vote.

The authors of the new study don’t view their findings as a go-ahead for passing more voter ID laws. Citing the laws’ apparent ineffectiveness against voter fraud, they argue the opposite: “This result weakens the case for adopting such laws in the first place.”

What the latest study found

The study drew on multiple sets of data to evaluate the impact of voter ID laws.

On voter turnout, the researchers drew on a data set from Catalist — which collects and sells voter registration and turnout records, as well as data for unregistered voters from data firms, retailers, marketing companies, and other commercial sources. The researchers say the Catalist database covers the vast majority of voting-age individuals.

The researchers then looked at how the voter ID laws affected turnout and compared trends to states without voter ID laws from 2008 to 2016.

The results: Voter ID laws do not seem to decrease turnout, even when the data is broken down by race. This held when the data was analyzed in different ways, like evaluating only the effect of stricter laws that require an ID with a photo.

One possibility, the researchers acknowledge, is that voter ID laws do have some effect, but mobilization efforts against voter ID laws end up canceling it out — since, after all, these measures have become highly contentious among Democrats in particular.

So the researchers tried to account for that, using data for people’s self-reported contacts from campaigns, donations to candidates, political meeting attendance, use of campaign signs, and campaign volunteering, all of which would suggest voter mobilization.

There was no evidence that political mobilization went up significantly after voter ID laws.

“We cannot fully reject the possibility that mobilization against the laws alleviated direct negative effects — that would require evidence on additional outcomes such as people’s feelings — yet we do not find any sign of it in available data,” the researchers found.

Finally, the researchers turned to voter fraud. For this, they used two databases tracking voter fraud reported by the media and elsewhere — one from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, and another from News21, a journalism project that the researchers described as “more liberal.” Their conclusion was straightforward: “We find no significant effect in either dataset.”

They also didn’t find a significant effect on perceptions of voter fraud — measured by how often people think voter fraud occurs and their beliefs that elections were fair.

Simply put, voter ID laws seem to have no detectable effect on voter fraud, real or perceived.

The researchers caution that their findings are not meant to be the final word. It’s possible that the results could be flawed — maybe the data sets for voter turnout are less complete than they believed, or the type of analysis they took on for this study isn’t the right model. The voter fraud databases in particular are, by their own admission, not comprehensive. Or maybe voter ID laws do have some effect, but the model the researchers used couldn’t detect it because it was just too small.

This is also a working paper, so it’s likely to be reevaluated as it goes through a review process.

Still, there’s other research to suggest that voter ID laws don’t have as much of an effect as people on both sides of the debate suggest.

Other research suggests voter ID laws have limited to no effect

It’s good to be skeptical of single studies with surprising findings, but previous reviews of the research on voter ID laws are in line with what Cantoni and Pons’s study found.

In 2017, Benjamin Highton, a political scientist at UC Davis, conducted the most thorough review of the research yet on voter ID laws. He tried to filter out the studies with weaker methodologies, putting more emphasis on those that were more rigorous. His conclusion: The better studies “generally find modest, if any, turnout effects of voter identification laws.”

In 2014, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a review on voter ID laws. Among the 10 studies it looked at, the results were mixed — five found no significant effect on turnout, one found increased turnout, and four found decreased turnout (between 1 and 4 percentage points). The GAO’s own study, looking at the effects of voter ID in Kansas and Tennessee, indicated that the laws may have decreased turnout by a few percentage points, with larger effects among younger, black, and newer potential voters.

Some caution is still warranted with these research reviews: Even if these laws have very modest effects — a decrease of 1 to 3 percentage points in voter turnout — that could still affect close elections. These kinds of elections are rare, but they can happen, and they can be important. For example, Democrat Heidi Heitkamp beat her Republican opponent, Rick Berg, by fewer than 3,000 votes, out of nearly 320,000, in 2012 to become a US senator for North Dakota.

And every study and review on this topic expresses a need for more research, indicating that this issue is far from settled.

Still, the overall research so far suggests that voter ID laws don’t have much, if any, effect on turnout. If true, these laws are not swinging the great majority of elections.

This may be surprising, given some of the reports about voter ID requirements in the past few years. A 2012 analysis, for example, found that as many as 758,000 registered voters in Pennsylvania didn’t have a photo ID issued by the state’s Transportation Department — suggesting that up to 9.2 percent of Pennsylvania voters may have been disenfranchised by a strict photo ID law.

But as Nate Cohn explained in the New York Times, this kind of figure is highly misleading. Citing a study for the North Carolina Board of Elections, Cohn wrote that “the true number of registered voters without photo identification is usually much lower than the statistics on registered voters without identification suggest.” The figure is just an estimate, “calculated by matching voter registration files with state ID databases.” But this method overestimates the number of voters without identification.

To the extent the figure is right, though, it misses another crucial point: People without IDs are less likely to vote in the first place. Based on the North Carolina study, voters who could be matched to a driver’s license — an ID, in other words — were more than 60 percent more likely to participate in the 2012 election.

Still, those few voters who may be denied the right to vote are more likely to be minorities and Democrats, based on previous studies on voting data. That’s a problem, but apparently not one that impacts most elections — given that other research, like Cantoni and Pons’s study or Highton’s review, suggests the overall impact of voter ID laws on voter turnout is small to nonexistent.

That doesn’t make voter ID laws okay — far from it

One reaction to this evidence is that it may justify voter ID laws. After all, if they don’t significantly reduce voter turnout, then what’s the harm if they can help combat voter fraud?

But as Cantoni and Pons noted in their study, the evidence suggests that voter ID laws have no significant effect on perceived or actual voter fraud.

That shouldn’t be surprising, because voter fraud is already incredibly uncommon in the US, especially the kind of fraud — voter impersonation — that ID requirements target.

Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt studied voter impersonation. He found 35 total credible accusations between 2000 and 2014, constituting a few hundred ballots at most. During this 15-year period, more than 800 million ballots were cast in national general elections and hundreds of millions more were cast in primary, municipal, special, and other elections.

A 2012 investigation by the News21 journalism project looked at all kinds of voter fraud nationwide, including voter impersonation, people voting twice, vote buying, absentee fraud, and voter intimidation. It confirmed that voter impersonation was extremely rare, with just 10 credible cases.

But the other types of fraud weren’t common either: In total, the project uncovered 2,068 alleged election fraud cases from 2000 through part of 2012, covering a time span when more than 620 million votes were cast in national general elections alone. That represents about 0.000003 alleged cases of fraud for every vote cast, and 344 fraud cases per national general election, in each of which between 80 million and 135 million people voted. The number of fraudulent votes was a drop in the bucket.

What’s more, not all — maybe not even half — of these alleged fraud cases were credible, News21 found: “Of reported election-fraud allegations in the database whose resolution could be determined, 46 percent resulted in acquittals, dropped charges or decisions not to bring charges.”

So the problem that voter ID laws set out to fix isn’t really a problem that needs solving.

But maybe the goal of these kind of laws isn’t to combat voter fraud, but to suppress certain voters. As the New York Times reported, some Republicans have openly acknowledged that hurting Democratic voters is their goal.

One example, reported by William Wan for the Washington Post, regarding North Carolina’s court-rebuked voter ID law:

Longtime Republican consultant Carter Wrenn, a fixture in North Carolina politics, said the GOP’s voter fraud argument is nothing more than an excuse. “Of course it’s political. Why else would you do it?” he said, explaining that Republicans, like any political party, want to protect their majority. While GOP lawmakers might have passed the law to suppress some voters, Wrenn said, that does not mean it was racist. “Look, if African Americans voted overwhelmingly Republican, they would have kept early voting right where it was,” Wrenn said. “It wasn’t about discriminating against African Americans. They just ended up in the middle of it because they vote Democrat.”

So despite claims that this is really about the integrity of elections, enough Republican supporters have slipped in moments of candor to validate Democrats’ suspicions — that this is about stifling the fundamental right to vote for minority constituents Republicans don’t typically win. No matter the real or perceived effect of voter ID laws, that intent is racist.

Fortunately, the research suggests that voter ID laws aren’t effective at suppressing voters, either.

Given the latest research, some conservatives are starting to push against more voter ID laws. Writing in the New York Times, conservative columnist Ross Douthat argued that Republicans should “step back and stand down” from voter ID laws.

He added, “The voter ID debate essentially involves Republicans whipping themselves into a panic over a problem that doesn’t meaningfully affect their chances of winning elections, and then passing laws that whip Democrats into a panic over a problem that also doesn’t meaningfully affect their chances of winning elections. So if the debate simply disappeared tomorrow, a source of distrust would vanish without either side losing ground.”",A new study finds voter ID laws don’t reduce voter fraud — or voter turnout,Vox.com,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/21/18230009/voter-id-laws-fraud-turnout-study-research
281,Empty,2019-02-22T11:00:47Z,The two old socialists have done an impressive job at shifting progressive politics from the staid status quo. Now they should leave the matter of governing to others.,"On both sides of the Atlantic, a hectoring old white man looms over the political left.

In the US, senator Bernie Sanders has finally announced his candidacy for a Democratic primary race filled with younger, more capable, versions of himself. In the UK, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is presiding over the left’s biggest split in decades. Neither looks likely to give up soon, and that’s a problem.

While the similarities between the two candidates have been long remarked upon, and the two old socialists themselves have even acknowledged using each others’ campaigning ideas, their policy priorities aren’t actually perfectly aligned—Sanders’ most radical policies would find a comfortable home with Britain’s centrist Liberal Democrats, while his history on guns and abortion would be on the hard-right for a British politician. However, the two men are almost identical candidates in all the worst ways.

Impressive policy shifts

Firstly, it bears noting that progressives in both countries have a fair amount to thank both men for—both have shifted their previously centrist parties towards leftist platforms that are genuinely popular with voters tired of the Blair-Clinton “third way.” These include policies such as Sanders’ Medicare for all, free college tuition, and $15 minimum wage, and Corbyn’s push for a “green jobs revolution,” railway nationalization, and an end to abusive hiring practices. They have driven a considerable amount of activism and enthusiasm, with Sanders racking up extraordinary levels of small-dollar donations and Labour membership surging under Corbyn.

Their platforms have had real impacts on national politics. The Democrats won back the House last year on “Better Deal” policies partly cribbed from Sanders’ 2016 campaign. While facing Corbyn, the leadership of the Conservative party has been taken out of the hands of a cabal of upper-class free-marketeers presiding over radical austerity, and handed to a flock of middle-class incompetents who—were they not tying themselves in knots over Brexit—would love to be trying to win over blue collar voters.

Both men should look proudly at these accomplishments, but they should let others take the helm. For all the impressive shifts Sanders and Corbyn have delivered in their respective political landscapes, their personal drawbacks pose more far more harm than good to the left in their countries.

Party schisms

Let’s start with the obvious: the rifts they have caused in their countries’ leftist parties. (Note that Sanders has still never joined the Democratic party.)

The 2016 Democratic primaries were fought with such bitterness, that, as the leader of a grassroots activist group told me almost a year after the election, “We literally cannot say the names Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in any of our groups because people are still so split about it.”

For Corbyn, the divide is starker. This week saw the Labour party’s biggest rupture in living memory, with eight MPs quitting to form a new independent voting block in Parliament. The group hasn’t ruled out running against Labour MPs in marginal seats where they risk splitting the progressive vote.

Equally damaging is how the two have reacted to the rifts, showing uncannily similar levels of stubbornness. Many Clinton supporters blame Sanders in part for her loss to Donald Trump, suggesting his refusal to throw his weight behind her—and his holding out on conceding the race after it was clear she would win—led many Sanders voters to either stay home or even back Trump. Corbyn, meanwhile, simply refuses to engage with his critics. Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson has begged for him to treat the MPs’ departures seriously, but Corbyn has merely said he is “disappointed,” without acknowledging the legitimacy of their grievances.

Overlooked women and minorities

The two politicians have so far failed to win power in large part because of their unwillingness to deal with issues of race and gender.

Sanders, who surrounded himself with largely white male advisers, has systematically declined to seriously consider racism and sexism as problems in their own right, instead viewing them as outcomes of widespread economic inequality. Unsurprisingly, Clinton trounced him among minority and female voters.

Since then, female staffers on his 2016 campaign have said there was both pay inequality and “an entire wave of rotten sexual harassment that seemingly was never dealt with,” such as one top staffer allegedly forcibly kissing a subordinate and another treating women “like his personal assistants.” Black staffers have complained of micro-aggressions, lackluster outreach efforts to African American voters, and feeling as if the campaign had black staff “just to say you have black staff.”

Sanders made an equivocal apology to those alleging sexual harassment, saying, “I was a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case.” He has since made a more full-throated apology.

He has also exacerbated matters by stumping for an anti-abortion mayoral candidate and suggesting that it wasn’t necessarily racist for white people to feel uncomfortable about voting for a black candidate.

Corbyn tarnished his self-declared feminism in his first week as Labour leader, announcing a shadow cabinet with no women in the top three posts. Instead of acknowledging that he hadn’t properly considered the matter beforehand, as seemingly revealed by an interaction between Corbyn and a lieutenant overheard by journalists, Corbyn accused critics of “living in the 18th century.” His claim: that those jobs are now no more important than less prominent shadow cabinet posts like health and business secretary. A year later, when Labour named a roster of white men as its candidates for big city mayorships, a backbench Labour MP wrote: “I suppose feminism is out of the window when your brothers in arms want the jobs.”

The Labour leader has said that MPs who harass women “must be held to account,” but shortly after a Labour activist told leadership that an MP had sent her suggestive texts and made inappropriate sexual contact, the MP was briefly promoted. When another MP was revealed to have a history of making misogynistic and homophobic comments, it took days for Corbyn to suspend him.

Despite a lifetime as an avowed anti-racist, Corbyn has presided over a Labour party in which antisemitism has brewed to such dangerous levels that, when quitting the party this week, Luciana Berger, one of the most prominent Jewish Labour MPs, called the party “sickeningly institutionally racist.” Several men have been prosecuted for sending Berger antisemitic death threats over the years, but when the party found out about an assault threat last year, it told neither her nor the police. The fact that one Labour MP responded to Berger’s and others’ defection by suggesting they were funded by Israel says everything you need to know about the state of the party under Corbyn.

With the advent of Trumpism, Brexit, and #MeToo, the Anglo-American world is at a historic juncture on misogyny and xenophobia, in which the next leader of each country could either entrench existing ills or take a road of reconciliation and progress. Sanders’ and Corbyn’s permissive records on the subjects show they are in no position to do the latter.

Vapid foreign policies

While Sanders barely had a foreign policy in 2016, both men share an anti-imperialist worldview that can lead to troubling stances. Both have questioned their countries’ membership of NATO. Corbyn once suggested the military alliance set up to defend the West during the Cold War should “close down” and Sanders paradoxically called for it to be expanded to include Russia.

In the latest example of their distaste for interventionism, both likened international recognition of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as president to Cold War-era American imperialism, branding it “outside interference” (Corbyn) and “supporting coups” (Sanders). That’s despite Guaidó being backed by almost all of Latin America.

Often the rejection of intervention serves as a way of avoiding taking tough decisions, allowing them to continue a career-long pattern of criticizing from the outside without offering solutions. For example, both have opposed military action in Syria. That’s an understandable position, but it’s unclear how they would actually fix the problem. In one beat, Sanders called for a US military drawdown, then added, “Assad has got to go. ISIS has got to be defeated.” How exactly will that happen? Meanwhile, Corbyn insists that “diplomacy and not bombing” is the answer. However, diplomacy has failed time and again—as to what Corbyn would do differently, we are none the wiser.

Similarly, both are queasy about free market trade agreements, but they’ve failed to articulate what they want instead aside from vague protectionism. A Brexiter at heart, Corbyn’s refusal to really throw his campaigning skills behind the Remain cause is seen as one reason they lost. It ultimately took him until Feb. 2019 to detail what he actually wanted from a Brexit deal, and some of that may not even be tenable.

As Trump himself has acknowledged, he and Sanders have rather similar views on trade. Sanders told the Daily Beast last year, “[Trump] is identifying the problem correctly but I’m not sure that his particular solution at this moment is exactly the right one.” What solution did Sanders suggest? Platitudes about “a more comprehensive approach than Trump is laying out” and calling for Congress to “begin to rethink our trade policies.”

Unfit to govern

Both superb campaigners, Sanders and Corbyn have corralled such blind, messianic support that their followers are unable to acknowledge the obvious: neither man is capable of governing.

Corbyn has run the Labour Party as a shambolic autocracy. His aides once accidentally published his “enemies list” of 14 MPs, one of whom was included for the petty reason of telling a Corbyn ally to “fuck off.” He has systematically alienated swaths of his MPs. The group who left this week did so in part out of the belief that he would just be a bad prime minister.

The past six weeks should have been a time of reckoning for Corbyn. With Theresa May facing historic defeats in the commons over her Brexit deal, Corbyn had the chance to show real leadership and steer the talks in the direction that Labour’s europhile base wants. Instead, he hasn’t even forced May to rule out a ‘no deal’ Brexit, preferring to hope the Conservatives fall apart and he can take the helm of whatever mess they eventually leave behind. He put personal ambition ahead of the country’s needs at a time of national crisis.

The left is now definitively fractured in Britain. Any progressive government would likely need to work in coalition with the new Independent Group and perhaps the Liberal Democrats. The fact that Corbyn hasn’t even been able to hold the party together suggests he wouldn’t have the skills to run a coalition as prime minister. Labour membership is so supportive of his domestic policy positions that it’s hard to imagine a new leader taking the party in a radically different ideological direction—however, they could make it fit to govern.

As for Sanders, his failure to grapple with the intricacies of governing was put in excruciating view when the editorial board of New York’s leftist tabloid, the Daily News, skewered him with basic questions about how he’d implement key policy proposals such as breaking up the banks and jailing Wall Street CEOs.

If you think that was a one-off, look at his past. When Politico quizzed lawmakers on his record from decades in Congress, it found that his big picture thinking has “rarely…translated into actual legislation or left a significant imprint on it.” One political scientist found Sanders was a generally below average senator in terms of impact on legislation, as measured by successful bills authored and amendments passed. His only executive experience is as mayor of tiny Burlington. He lost three attempts at running for governor of Vermont—his best result was winning 14% of the vote as an independent in 1986. If Vermonters don’t think he’s up to running one of America’s smallest states, what are his chances of success in governing the whole country?

Sanders’ opponents in the primary are running on strikingly similar policies to his. The candidates also just happen to be more competent than him, either with more governing experience (whether via cabinet posts, law enforcement roles, or big city mayorships), better legislative chops, or more policy smarts.

The two old lefties have changed national politics in ways they couldn’t have dreamed of five years ago. Now they should return to their shared forte of heckling from the sidelines, and leave the matter of governing to others.",Bernie and Corbyn are the same candidate—in all the wrong ways,Qz.com,https://qz.com/1555526/bernie-sanders-and-jeremy-corbyn-share-the-same-weaknesses/

If I were a young person entering politics, I'd be looking for the best résumé-enhancers, to see what sort of qualifications and accomplishments are shared by those ""getting ahead"" in today's political arena.

After serving as a Chicago community organizer and Illinois state senator, Barack Obama rose from a pedestrian three years as a U.S. senator to become the 44th president of the United States. Coming out of a corrupt city and a corrupt state with corrupt politicians (four of the last seven Illinois governors have been jailed), Obama had a few election irregularities of his own that were basically unreported by the media. Also largely ignored by the media was Obama's choice of mentor-pastor, Jeremiah Wright, who would regularly condemn America and white people from the pulpit on Sunday mornings, using coarse and inflammatory language.

Obama gave great speeches about bringing Hope and Change, which were short on specifics but emotionally appealing to many voters. The lack of any specific plans to make America better was an appalling shortcoming of Obama's campaign, but the media ignored it. Instead, the media fell in love with the idea that America had a chance to elect its first black president, so Obama's actual accomplishments, character, and intended policies were given short shrift. Tom Brokaw and Charlie Rose, two of America's most recognized journalists, admitted in an interview a few days before the 2008 election that they didn't know what books might be important to Obama and didn't know anything about his foreign policy views. The fact that these highly influential media figures purposely chose to remain clueless about Obama's beliefs and the policies he would promote as leader of the free world is a stunning admission of incompetency and journalistic malpractice. Instead of being journalists presenting facts, the media hid important facts about Obama from the voters in an obvious attempt to influence the election.

In 2016, the Democratic nominee for president was Hillary Clinton. Her résumé included conducting top-secret State Department business on her own unsecured home server, as well as raking in hundreds of millions of dollars donated by U.S. citizens and foreigners alike to the Clinton Foundation, money probably given with expectations of a future return on the ""investments"" from the likely to be elected President Clinton. To cover her misdeeds, she destroyed electronic records and devices while they were under subpoena, and those aides closest to her were granted immunity by Obama's complicit FBI, resulting in a tainted investigation that concluded without any consequences for Clinton's years of nefarious activities. Again, the media were enamored of the possibility that we might actually have our first female president and therefore chose to hide Clinton's blatant corruption from the voters..

Donald Trump, in contrast, was subjected to intense media scrutiny and won the 2016 election despite the media's allegation factory running nearly 24-7. The media breathlessly announced, sometimes with hundreds of references in a single 24-hour news cycle, that Trump was dishonest; crude; hateful; and a racist reality TV personality in danger of ruining the economy, starting WWIII, and so on. But many voters ignored the media's focus and instead looked at Trump's record of building businesses (Trump owns approximately 500 business entities employing about 22,000 people) as well as his skills in negotiating and compromising with different groups in order to achieve meaningful and long-lasting results. The Trump résumé was based on real accomplishments in the real world, and when Trump, the rookie politician, spoke of a set of specific policies aimed at Making America Great Again, many voters were convinced he was speaking from his heart and therefore just might pursue fulfilling his campaign promises with the same vigor and tenacity they perceived to be part of his character and track record. Today, thanks to Trump's policies and fulfilled campaign promises, we have a booming economy with wages rising across the board and unemployment rates the lowest ever for blacks and Hispanics.

It is clear that the right and left prefer radically different résumés for their leaders. They also prefer different styles of communication. Politicians use softly spoken magic words to appeal to voters, and it's evident that the Left and right prefer radically different prose. What's magic for the Left is words that make them feel good, words that say to a leftist that you are important because you are part of a group that is so much smarter and more righteous than the other side, that you are good and classy because the side you have chosen is against hate and racism.

The right has a different set of magic words, oriented toward implementing solutions to specific problems, so its voters tend to be favorably inclined toward leaders who have already accomplished great things. America faces great problems, and those on the right would like to empower leaders offering solutions that have already been tried and proven to work.

Simply put, the right wants to make life better for its kids and grandkids, while today's Left wants to be the boss of America, which leftists hope to achieve through making the government ever larger so it can intrude into more and more of the average person's life. The Green New Deal is the Democrat's shiny new toy, which expands government so much that it will surely bankrupt our nation. Yet over 70 Democrats in Congress are already offering their public support for the GND. Have they learned nothing from Obama's tremendous expansion of government, which led to a near doubling of our national debt in just eight years? If the expansion of government and debt is left unchecked, eventually, America will collapse due to insolvency.

No doubt, we live in perilous times with an uncertain future. Is there anything on the horizon coming our way that may prevent America from becoming a failed, bankrupt state? I think there is a chance that recent events in Virginia may well be showing us how America can come back from the brink of self-destruction.

Virginia's Democratic leadership team is now being blown up due to past behaviors and transgressions. While Republicans tend to prevent seriously flawed people from rising far by using a kind of self-policing, the Democrats, always coddled by the media that hide their character flaws and gross malfeasance, have never had to consistently apply a standard of ethics in order to weed out those inclined toward behaving badly. Rather than great character or great accomplishments, the media and the Democrats years ago started using identity politics to select their leaders.

Recently, identity politics has increasingly been used as a cudgel to force people from office and other positions of power and influence. And what's new is that now, in Virginia, identity politics as cudgel is being applied with vigor against high-ranking Democrats. Do the Democrats realize that the runaway freight train of identity politics has left the station and is now bearing down directly at them? They've created this train, and the engineers running the train are the leftists and journalism majors and politicians who so far seem powerless to stop the coming wave of self-destruction.

The Democratic Party is approaching an all-important fork in the road. Either the Democrats choose common sense, humility, and patriotism to redirect their choice of policies, tactics, and leaders or, like the Whigs and the Know-Nothings before them, the Democrats and their identity politics will eventually vanish from the American political landscape.",Democratic and Republican Résumé-Enhancers,Americanthinker.com,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2019/02/democratic_and_republican_rsumenhancers.html

The U.S. senator from California, a leading 2020 hopeful for the White House on the Democratic side, has recently been overshadowed by the entry of Senate colleague Bernie Sanders -- the progressives’ likely first choice -- into the race, and the potential candidacy of Beto O’Rourke the former congressman from Texas who’s been making inroads and positioning himself as the anti-Trump candidate.

KAMALA HARRIS AFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR CAPITALISM AS DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST SANDERS ENTERS RACE

This prompted Harris to come out against O’Rourke’s call to tear down the existing 700 miles of fencing on the U.S.-Mexico border during a Wednesday night appearance on Comedy Central's “The Daily Show.”

“No, I believe that we need border security,” said Harris, who has opposed President Trump’s immigration policies in the Senate.

“But we need smart border security. We can't have open borders, we need to have border security, all nations do,” she continued. “All nations define their borders, but we should not have a policy and perspective that is grounded in keeping people out for the sake of this nationalistic kind of thing this president is trying to push.”

""But we need smart border security. We can't have open borders, we need to have border security, all nations do."" — U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.

The rebuke comes after O’Rourke told MSNBC last week that would “absolutely” tear down the border wall in El Paso, Texas, if he gets the chance.

“Absolutely, I'd take the wall down,” O'Rouke said. “Here's what we know: After the Secure Fence Act, we have built 600 miles of wall and fencing on a 2,000 mile border. What that has done is not in any demonstrable way made us safer.”

KAMALA HARRIS' DAD SAYS PARENTS ARE 'TURNING IN THEIR GRAVE' OVER HER COMMENTS ON WEED AND BEING JAMAICAN: REPORT

Harris added during her TV appearance that although she wants a secure border, people should be allowed to come in. She also reiterated that the U.S. is “a nation that was founded and has grown because we have always welcomed immigrants.”

Harris’ comments were carefully hedged while other Democrats running for president, such as U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, have openly endorsed ideas such as abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.

But just last year, Harris told multiple news outlets that the U.S. “maybe” or “probably” should “start from scratch” on an immigration enforcement agency, echoing the concerns of the “Abolish ICE” movement.

Harris’ distancing from the far-left of the party has been in motion for days. On Tuesday, she reaffirmed her commitment to capitalism instead of democratic socialism and reiterated what she said a day earlier: “I am not a democratic socialist.”

""We are looking at what can be done within our system to give this family a little solace in a time of unbelievable tragedy,"" the prime minister said after a funding announcement in Halifax.

""I can't comment on specific cases, but in heartbreaking cases like this we're certainly looking at doing what we can to bring this family that has suffered such a devastating loss together.""

Kawthar Barho and her husband Ebraheim arrived in Nova Scotia with their children as privately sponsored refugees in September 2017.

Early Tuesday, a fast-moving fire killed all seven of their children, prompting a outpouring of grief and support from across the country.

With his wife at his side in a Halifax hospital, Ebraheim Barho remains in a medically induced coma.

A funeral for the children, who range in age from three months to 14 years, is expected either Friday or Saturday.

Trudeau said Halifax MP Andy Fillmore had already contacted Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen about expediting the immigration process for family members.

Kawthar Barho has no other relatives living in Canada.

I think it's absolutely critical that we get those family members here as quickly as we can. Halifax MP Andy Fillmore

""I can tell you that this is a case that the minister is giving personal attention to,"" said Trudeau, who was among hundreds of people who gathered for a vigil in Halifax's main square Wednesday night in support of the Barhos.

Fillmore said immigration applications were being reviewed Thursday.

""This is an absolute priority to get this done as quickly as possible,"" he said. ""I think it's absolutely critical that we get those family members here as quickly as we can.""

The Liberal MP said he had met with Kawthar at the hospital, where she was asked if there was anything federal officials could do to help.

""She made it clear that it was her family,"" Fillmore said.

At Wednesday's vigil, Ali Duane, a member of Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency, urged all Canadians to pressure Ottawa to bring Kawthar Barho's family members to Nova Scotia.

Refugee claims can take years

Natalie Horne, vice-president of the community group that sponsored the Barhos' refugee claim, said some family members from Syria have already registered with the UN refugee agency, which should help speed up the process.

Typical refugee claims can take several years to complete.

""Once (the Barhos' story) leaves the headlines and people go back to their lives, there's still going to be a wake of tragedy for Kawthar and for Ebraheim,"" said Horne, vice-president of the Hants East Assisting Refugees Team.

""It will be a long road to recovery ... It's really important for us to get family here who can support them on that journey.""

The Barhos had lived in the Halifax suburb of Spryfield for only a few months, having moved to the city from nearby Elmsdale, N.S., to take advantage of language training and other immigrant services. They had planned to return to Elmsdale next month.

The Canadian Press





HALIFAX -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced up to $86.5-million to improve an expressway into Halifax, predicting the work will make commutes safer and swifter.

Trudeau said Thursday the federal money would help extend the Highway 107 Burnside Connector and build a high-speed bypass to connect Highways 101, 102, and 118.

""We know that families are going to get to work and back home quicker because of this investment,"" the prime minister said.

""We know that moving forward on something that's been talked about for so many decades . . . is something that a lot of families around here have been waiting for.""

The federal money from the Building Canada Fund is in addition to $107-million announced by the province, while the Halifax Regional Municipality will provide the remainder.

Later on Thursday, Trudeau is expected to take part in a tour of historical exhibits at the Black Cultural Centre in the community of Cherry Brook.

He is also to meet with a youth group before delivering a speech in recognition of black history. It's expected Trudeau would also extend a personal apology to those who were part of a group that were singled out in an apparent case of racial profiling during a visit to Parliament Hill earlier this month.

The incident took place during an event called Black Voices on the Hill, prompting a complaint to the Speaker from Liberal MP Greg Fergus.

The Federation of Black Canadians said several participants in the lobbying event were referred to as ""dark-skinned people"" and asked to leave a parliamentary cafeteria.

The Parliamentary Protective Service apologized at the time and said the force was investigating the incident.

In the House of Commons on Tuesday, Speaker Geoff Regan called the service's apology a welcome first step, but said it shouldn't be seen as closing the issue or as a way to erase the harsh and unacceptable reality of what happened.

""What was reported as happening was completely unacceptable,"" Trudeau said Thursday. ""The Parliament Buildings belong to all Canadians and the opportunity to access them freely in a moment . . . of celebration of Black History Month should not have been tarnished by these actions that we've heard about.""

Trudeau said he was looking forward to meeting with the group.

""We all have a responsibility as parliamentarians as Canadians to ensure that everyone is fully welcome everywhere in this country,"" he said.

""We have to recognize unfortunately that there are still barriers, there is still systemic racism in this country -- anti-black racism that can rear its head at surprising and unfortunate times and we need to make sure that we are responding appropriately.""

Michael MacDonald, The Canadian Press





HALIFAX -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed Thursday his government is responding to a desperate plea from the grieving mother who lost all seven of her children in a recent house fire, saying he wants to ""give this family a little solace in a time of unbelievable tragedy.""

Kawthar Barho, whose husband Ebraheim is in a medically induced coma to recover from extensive burns, has told local politicians and religious leaders in Halifax that she wants to be reunited with family members living overseas because she has no other relatives in Canada.

The prime minister, in Halifax on Thursday for a funding announcement, said Halifax MP Andy Fillmore had already contacted Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen about expediting the immigration process for some family members.

""I can't comment on specific cases, but in heartbreaking cases like this we're certainly looking at doing what we can to bring this family that has suffered such a devastating loss together,"" said Trudeau, who attended a vigil in Halifax's main square Wednesday night in support of the Barhos.

The Barhos arrived in Nova Scotia with their children as privately sponsored refugees in September 2017.

Early Tuesday, a fast-moving fire killed all of their children: Ahmad, 14; Rola, 12; Mohamad, 9; Ola, 8; Hala, 3; Rana, 2 and Abdullah, who was born in Canada on Nov. 9.

The cause of the fire remains unclear.

Fillmore said immigration applications were being reviewed Thursday.

""This is an absolute priority to get this done as quickly as possible,"" he said. ""I think it's absolutely critical that we get those family members here as quickly as we can.""

The Liberal MP said he had met with Kawthar at the hospital, where she was asked if there was anything federal officials could do to help.

""She made it clear that it was her family,"" Fillmore said.

Natalie Horne, vice-president of the community group that sponsored the Barhos' refugee claim, said some family members from Syria have already registered with the UN refugee agency, which should help speed up the process.

Typical refugee claims can take several years to complete.

""Once (the Barhos' story) leaves the headlines and people go back to their lives, there's still going to be a wake of tragedy for Kawthar and for Ebraheim,"" said Horne, vice-president of the Hants East Assisting Refugees Team.

""It will be a long road to recovery ... It's really important for us to get family here who can support them on that journey.""

Horne said Kawthar Barho told her the fire was caused by an electric baseboard heater that ignited a couch.

However, deputy fire Chief David Meldrum said residents should be wary of reading too much into that kind of speculation.

""We're aware of the reports that are in the media, as well as other information on social media,"" Meldrum said in an interview. ""I want to remind everyone this information is not coming from official sources. Our investigation is ongoing.""

Meldrum said if the investigation uncovers anything that would affect community safety, that information will be released to the public as soon as possible.

Still, he said it was unclear how long the investigation would take.

Ehab Zalok, an expert in fire safety engineering at Carleton University in Ottawa, said the fact that neighbours heard a bang before flames spread rapidly through the house suggests something non-solid, like a gas, may have caused the fire to spread rapidly.

He said the scale of the fire, which destroyed much of the home's top floor, suggests it was ""much more than just (a) structure burning or furniture burning"" because that kind of fire usually takes longer to grow.

""If you have something burning for a few minutes you would expect that people will smell something like smoke, smoke alarms will sound -- something to prepare people for what's coming, which is a bigger fire,"" he said in an interview.

A funeral for the children is expected either Friday or Saturday, said Imam Abdallah Yousri of the Ummah Mosque in Halifax.

Though the mosque can hold about 2,000 people, Yousri said the ceremony will be moved to a larger venue. That site had yet to be selected by Thursday afternoon.

The Barhos had lived in the Halifax suburb of Spryfield for only a few months, having moved to the city from nearby Elmsdale, N.S., to take advantage of language training and other immigrant services. They had planned to return to Elmsdale next month.

Neighbours say the children missed their old school and the friends they had made there.

The Barho family was among 1,795 Syrian refugees who have come to Nova Scotia in recent years.

The Trudeau government granted asylum to 40,000 Syrian refugees in 2015-16.

A brutal civil war has raged across Syria since 2011, claiming more than 400,000 lives.

Privilege and confidentiality are not mine to waive and I hope that I have the opportunity to speak my truth,” Wilson-Raybould said.Moments after those comments, Justin Trudeau stood to lead the Liberals in shutting down the possibility of a public inquiry into this matter.

All but two Liberals, Wayne Long and Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, voted against a public inquiry.The vote came hours after it was revealed that the PM had spoken to Wilson-Raybould about SNC-Lavalin and the possibility of a sweetheart deal for the company after it was already decided not to grant them one.

According to court documents disclosed by The Globe and Mail, SNC-Lavalin was informed on Sept. 4, 2018 that they would not get the special deal.

On Sept. 5, Wilson-Raybould met with the PM’s former right hand man Gerry Butts at Ottawa’s historic Chateau Laurier hotel.

It was two weeks later that Trudeau himself met with Wilson-Raybould to discuss the SNC-Lavalin file.

The accusation facing Trudeau and his office is that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured Wilson-Raybould to give the well connected SNC-Lavalin the sweetheart deal.

If the conversations between Trudeau, or his staff, veered into pressuring the former attorney general not to prosecute SNC-Lavalin, then it could be a case of obstruction of justice.

Obstruction of justice is a crime that comes with a sentence of up to 10 years in jail.Trudeau has denied doing so but always with carefully worded statements.

Asked about this in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Trudeau bobbed and weaved.

“Who asked for the meeting was it the prime minister or the former attorney general?” Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asked. “I can assure all Canadians — that unlike the leader of the opposition — we will always stand up for good jobs right across this country every step of the way while making sure we respect the independence of the judicial system,” Trudeau said.

It didn’t answer the question and it would be shocking news to the truckers and farmers parked outside the House of Commons for a second day calling on the government to help the oil industry.

Time and again Trudeau was asked by Scheer if he had expressed support for a deal to Wilson-Raybould during his discussions with her, each time Trudeau reverted to talking points that avoided the question.

Scheer called it “very telling” that Trudeau would not answer, saying this was not how an innocent person acts.

Liberal caucus united?

Liberal MPs left their weekly caucus meeting claiming to be united but the sales job wasn’t always convincing.

The Liberals were holding their first caucus meeting since the SNC-Lavalin controversy rocked the government with claims of obstruction of justice, the resignation of a cabinet minister and the departure of the prime minister’s top advisor.

“Very respectful,” said Liberal MP Marc Miller when asked about the reception Wilson-Raybould received in caucus.

Veteran MP John McKay sounded like a kid that had been ordered to eat his Brussel sprouts as he said, “Everything’s fine,” while leaving the caucus meeting.

“We’re all a team with individuals, it was great,” said MP MaryAnn Mihychuk.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel Erskine-Smith called it an “ongoing conversation.”

The Trans Mountain project took a step back into reality Friday with the National Energy Board approval that everyone expected.

But it’s still a cancelled pipeline after the disastrous Federal Court of Appeal decision of last Aug 30.

Trans Mountain will be legally extinct until the Trudeau cabinet re-approves it, ostensibly within the 90-day guideline for these decisions.

It’s absurd to imagine the cabinet failing to grant a new certificate, after spending $4.5 billion to buy the whole works from Kinder Morgan.

Cabinet rejection would combine with the SNC-Lavalin fiasco and likely drive the Liberals from office in the federal election this fall. No government can survive two spectacular regional fiascos in the same year.

Approval has to come at some point, obviously.

But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wounded cabinet have a very tricky choice here, and it’s all about election timing.

Under the worst scenario, the cabinet may just let the decision ride until after the election. That would push the construction reboot well into 2020.

The simplest and best solution would be to approve the pipeline by the end of May and get construction moving as quickly as possible.

There would be controversy on the coast, and more legal challenges, but at least the thing would be a fait accompli by federal voting day, likely in October.

The pipeline could well be a fading national issue by then. And the Liberals would win back approval among many westerners.

Premier Rachel Notley doesn’t expect approval within 90 days, but she sure wouldn’t object. Federal approval before her own election would be an NDP bonanza.

A quick approval would take courage and decisive leadership, though. The Liberals don’t show much of either these days.

For one thing, cabinet isn’t bound by this 90-day guideline for approving or rejecting an NEB approval. In fact, it’s usually ignored.

Notley points out that with both Northern Gateway and the first Trans Mountain approval, the gap between NEB approval and cabinet certificates was about six months.

Federal sources suggest there’s hope of getting this one done within the guideline. It’s less complicated because this is the second round and many details are already decided.

But the feds also won’t specifically promise to decide within 90 days because that would suggest there’s a cutoff date for Indigenous consultation.

That impression helped bring down the first approval. So they’re avoiding any hint of a deadline.

Notley is probably right, then — federal response to the NEB, and work on the First Nations engagement, could extend well beyond the 90-day period that began Friday.

She doesn’t see that as a threat to cabinet approval that would allow construction to start again by fall.

But then, she’s a self-professed optimist. You must be, to see the Liberals making a highly contentious decision that benefits Alberta with an election very close.

Trudeau’s federal caucus and cabinet are not entirely united on the pipeline. The more ardent climate-change activists don’t like it at all. From the moment the Liberals were elected in 2015, it was obvious that some key players don’t even like to talk about the project.

Related

That same crew (including Finance Minister Bill Morneau) were then forced to buy the project when Kinder Morgan threatened to pull out.

Having done that, and then swallowing the federal court rejection, can we really imagine the Liberals staking their electoral survival on the pipeline?

But they must. This is hugely important to a country that has already lost $100 billion in resource investment, according to the C.D. Howe Institute.

As another PM once said, roll the dice. Approval no later than June, construction starting in late summer.

Go ahead, Liberals. Amaze Alberta.

Two capital cities, two raging scandals.

In Ottawa, the SNC-Lavalin affair is producing steady eruptions of bad news for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

And in Victoria, Speaker Darry Plecas keeps swinging his political wrecking ball in the shocking legislature spending scandal.

Both could get even wilder and crazier in the days ahead, with immediate impacts set to be felt in the crucial Burnaby South byelection.

Monday’s byelection battle pits federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh against Liberal candidate Richard Lee.

This one looked like a walk in the proverbial park for Singh after the Liberals’ original candidate, Karen Wang, was replaced for singling out Singh’s South Asian ethnicity in a social-media post.

The Liberals brought in an emergency pinch-hitter in Lee, a former provincial MLA who won four straight elections for the B.C. Liberals.

Ironically, the Wang affair may have actually helped the Liberals because Lee is arguably a better candidate.

But then things went berserk back in Ottawa, where Trudeau’s office was accused of pressuring former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to give a cushy plea-bargain deal to Montreal-based corporation SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal corruption charges.

The timing was perfect for Singh, who demanded a public inquiry.

“Canadians deserve to know if their government is working for them or for a massive corporation with deep ties to the Liberal party,” Singh said.

Will the SNC-Lavalin scandal help Singh beat his Liberal opponent on Monday? He’d better hope so.

If Singh loses — and the Liberals came awfully close to winning the riding less than four years ago — he will likely be forced out as NDP leader with a federal election looming in the fall.

Lee has tiptoed carefully around the SNC-Lavalin affair, avoiding direct comments while insisting he stands for clean, honest government.

“I believe in transparent, better politics,” Lee said.

On paper, Singh should finally win a seat in the House of Commons Monday. In reality, he is in tough, in a riding where he’s seen as an outsider from Ontario.

Ironically, many Liberals might be secretly hoping Singh wins the byelection and continues his uninspiring leadership of the NDP, which is trailing badly in national polls.

But, even if they still have Singh to kick around, the SNC-Lavalin affair is still damaging Trudeau.

The drama has unfolded in the worst possible way for the prime minister and his Liberal government: A daily drip-by-drip series of damaging revelations. And the worst could be yet to come.

Wilson-Raybould is now set to testify in front of the federal justice committee. Her appearance could come as early as Monday, at the same time Burnaby South voters are heading to the polls.

What will the former AG have to say? She has so far refused to comment, insisting her former role as the country’s top lawyer prevents her from speaking because of solicitor-client confidentiality.

She clearly wants to tell her story. Ottawa is awash in whispers that she already told cabinet colleagues that she was pushed to give SNC-Lavalin a get-out-of-jail-free card.

If Wilson-Raybould tells the committee this week that she was inappropriately pressured to let a Liberal-linked company off the hook on criminal charges, Trudeau’s troubles are going to deepen.

In Victoria, meanwhile, the Darryl Plecas Show continues to shake the people’s house to its foundations.

Last week, the Speaker released yet another report on the legislature spending scandal, insisting suspended officials Craig James and Gary Lenz took lavish “business” trips that were more like vacations.

A trip to study earthquake preparedness was really a whale-watching adventure, Plecas wrote, while a getaway to Seattle to review “emergency evacuation procedures” at Safeco Field turned into a group outing to a Seattle Mariners baseball game.

“What in fact appears to be the case is that their extensive ‘work’ travels served as their de facto holidays,” Plecas wrote.

The sour cherry on top of this rotten sundae for taxpayers? Plecas said James and Lenz routinely demanded cash payouts for their vacation time, insisting they didn’t take holidays.

Where does it all go from here? The all-party committee that “manages” your money at the legislature voted last week to bring in a retired judge to review the whole stinking mess.

Alan Mullen, the Speaker’s chief of staff, said he expects the former judge to review the findings in a matter of weeks rather than months.

Could that lead to James and Lenz being fired? The two men, who insist they have done nothing wrong and want their jobs back, are currently on paid leave.

“I don’t think the information contained in these reports is leadership,” Mullen said.

“I’m not a member of the house, so it would be inappropriate for me to say whether they should or should not be fired. But as a British Columbian, that’s not leadership.”

Plecas, meanwhile, has no plans to stop swinging his wrecking ball and will issue more reports on wrongdoing at the legislature.

Said Mullen: “We’ve got a job to do and British Columbians are screaming loud and clear, ‘Please don’t stop. Please keep going.’ Oh my goodness, are we going to keep going? That’s a big Yes.”

In this tale of two political cities, don’t expect the drama to end.

Ken Price, father of one of the injured victims, told the media on Friday that a group of families have sent a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The letter requests that the government addresses what they say is a lack of action to curb gun violence.

“Are we going to learn from our experience or are we going to express grief in the moment and move on? We are better than this as a nation,"" the open letter reads. ""We are urging that Canada follow the lead of other like-minded countries such as the UK, Japan and Australia and impose a ban on the private ownership of handguns and military style assault rifles.""

The gathering on Friday marked not only the seven month anniversary of the shooting but also the first time victims and their families rallied together publicly.

On July 22, gunman Faisal Hussain opened fire into crowded restaurants and patios killing 18-year-old Reese Fallon, and 10-year-old Julianna Kozis. Thirteen other people were injured. Investigators say the gunman later killed himself.

Price’s daughter Samantha was on Danforth Avenue eating ice cream with Fallon and a group of friends on the night of the shooting. A bullet pierced Price’s thigh.

Fallon's younger sister, Quinn Fallon, also spoke during the press conference at Danforth Music Hall and said her family now feels ""incomplete.""

""Reese always talked about her future — her future at McMaster [University], becoming a nurse and how many kids she wanted and where she wanted to raise a family,"" she said, adding the pain her family feels is “indescribable.”

""Because of this tragedy, Reese and Julianna will never get to experience a day past that July 22. They both wanted love and peace, not hate or violence,"" she said. Noor Samiei, a friend of Fallon, told CTV Toronto she could never accept Fallon’s death. “It’ll always affect me.”

""We miss Reese and we miss Julianna. We have to live with that,"" Samiei said at the press conference. ""But we don't have to live with the laws that could be changed to help prevent this from happening again.""

Price said “the shootings took the lives of two girls we miss very much,” Price said. “We’re grieving still, every family here still feels affected … however there are some of us who do want to stand up today and say we do need to change.”

He said Canadians have gone through an “unprecedented year” in gun violence, particularly in Toronto. He stressed this wasn’t a “referendum on firearms in general, but on specifically handguns and assault rifles.”

Price said the group was “unanimous” in asking elected officials at all levels of government to advocate for these changes. Several of the family members wore shirts which read “protect kids, not guns.”

'We don’t want this to be you'

“We want to see this country move in this direction. We think it will benefit the country and we think it will prioritize public safety,” Price said. “We don’t want this to be you in the future and we can improve our odds of that not being the case if you’re supportive now.”

On Friday, Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders said their investigation into the shooting had finished but he didn’t say when more information would be released.

Toronto’s city council has already called for a ban on handguns and assault rifles. Mayor John Tory previously sent a letter to the families of the Danforth shooting victims, and that he has also reached out to Trudeau.

The Liberal government is already exploring a potential handgun ban but affected families worry it won’t be enough.

""The families fear that the initiative will fall short of recommending a handgun and assault rifle ban, and they want to ensure they see action,"" the letter states.

Canada’s current firearms legislation doesn’t contain a definition of what constitutes as an assault rifle. But a recent federal government paper on new gun legislation took the definition from the United States Department of Justice, which states: “assault weapons are semi-automatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire.”

Although Canada has long prohibited possession of automatic guns, some semi-automatic firearms are not restricted and can be bought if purchasers obtain a basic possession and acquisition licence.

299,Empty,2019-02-21T13:49:39Z,CANADA’S Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing a difficult election campaign after a new poll saw the scandal-hit leader’s approval ratings plummet.,"Canadians are due to go to the polls in October but Mr Trudeau is battling to maintain his popularity after becoming embroiled in claims his aides pressured former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to ensure construction firm SNC-Lavalin avoided a corruption investigation. The 47-year-old insists there was no wrongdoing but 41 percent of Canadians disagreed with Mr Trudeau in a Leger poll for news agency The Canadian Press. Just 12 percent believed he hadn’t done anything wrong following the allegations which has left his Liberal Party in turmoil. JUSTIN TRUDEAU ROCKED BY CRISIS: WHO IS JODY WILSON-RAYBOULD?

The poll read even worse for Mr Trudeau on a question regarding which party respondents would vote for in the autumn election. Leger found 36 percent of people said they would vote for the opposition Conservative party while 34 percent would support Mr Trudeau’s Liberals. It marks the first time since the 2015 general election the Conservatives have been ahead of the Liberals who were once way out in front in the polls. The results have left Mr Trudeau’s inner team fearing he could be ousted outright or forced into a coalition government in eight months time.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has seen his approval plummet in a new poll

Also worrying for Mr Trudeau was the response to a question on which party’s leader would make the best Prime Minister. Despite receiving the most support, just 26 percent of respondents answered for Mr Trudeau - a seven point nosedive from a similar Leger poll conducted in November last year. Opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer received 21 percent while Green leader Elizabeth May scored eight percent and the New Democratic Party’s Jagmeet Singh gained six percent. Leger’s executive vice president Christian Bourque said the results proved Canadians were increasingly suspicious of their prime minister. Mr Leger told Canadian media: “I think a lot of it leads back to how the prime minister himself has handled the crisis over the last week or so. “He’s not found a way to reassure Canadians or … been clear enough about his involvement, what he said or did not say, so that a lot of Canadians right now are holding it up against him because they don’t know all the ins and outs to make up their own mind.” However Mr Bourque added the polls do not necessarily mean Mr Scheer is destined for victory. He said: “There’s nobody right now that’s capturing the minds and hearts of Canadians and probably explains why voting intentions are so close while we see that the Prime Minister is actually showing signs of weakening in terms of support.”

Mr Trudeau is facing allegations members of his team pressured Jody Wilson-Raybould over corruption

The poll comes as a top Trudeau aide denied suggestions Ms Wilson-Raybould was pressured into using a deferred prosecution agreement to grant SNC-Lavalin a reprieve at an extraordinary Canadian House of Commons justice commitee session. Mr Wernick told lawmakers: “It is my conclusion and my assertion, based on all the information I have, that there was no inappropriate pressure on the minister of justice in this matter.” In yesterday’s committee appearance, Mr Wernick admitted Ms Wilson-Raybould may have felt pressure to “get it right” on SNC-Lavalin and would likely “express concern” about three meetings. The first would be a September 17 meeting she had with Mr Trudeau while the second “is a conversation between the PMO’s staff and her former chief of staff when she was minister of justice on December 18.” Mr Wernick added: “The third is a conversation I had with her in the afternoon of December 19.” The chief public servant said all three meetings were about SNC-Lavalin and in his discussion he explained the “context” and “consequences” a criminal prosecution would have on the Quebec company. He said: “How Ms Wilson-Raybould interprets and perceives those conversations she can tell you next week.”

Mr Werner added: “I can tell you my view very firmly is they were entirely appropriate, lawful, legal.” Mr Trudeau has been hit by a series of resignations from his administration and met with members of his Liberal Party to calm anger about how he is handling the SNC-Lavalin affair. He has dismissed calls for a full public inquiry into claims relating to the Montreal engineering firm’s government contracts in Libya, saying the ethic commissioner has launched a probe into suggestions staff in the Prime Minister’s Office pressured Ms Wilson Raybould when she was justice minister. Wilson-Raybould, who was demoted in a cabinet reshuffle last month, resigned as veterans affairs minister on February 12. She has been invited to speak to the Canadian House of Commons’s justice committee and is currently consulting lawyers as to how much she can reveal on SNC-Lavalin. She defiantly told reporters on Wednesday: “I hope to have the opportunity to speak my truth”. Meanwhile Mr Trudeau’s principal private secretary and close ally Gerald Butts quit on Monday insisting he had not pressured the former Attorney General. Mr Trudeau’s position is not in immediate danger after Wednesday’s three hour clear-the-air meeting with members of his party with one source saying no leadership challenges are being plotted. Mr Trudeau can not be replaced by parliamentary vote of no-confidence in the same way Theresa May fought off a Labour initiated challenge in January as Canadian party leaders are confirmed at formal conventions.

301,Empty,2019-02-24T15:35:00Z,Transport Minister Marc Garneau is warning U.S. lawmakers that Canada will struggle to ratify the new North American trade deal if U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum exports remain in place much longer.,"

The Canadian Press





WASHINGTON -- Parliament will struggle to ratify the new North American trade deal if U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum exports aren't lifted soon, Canada's transport minister warned Sunday during a high-profile gathering of American state lawmakers.

Marc Garneau said time is running out for the federal government to get the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ratified before the House of Commons rises for the summer break, and it remains an open question whether it will happen without the tariffs being lifted.

""This will present us with real challenges as we begin the process of ratification in Canada, and I don't know if we're going to get there,"" Garneau told a free-trade panel during the winter meeting of the National Governors Association in Washington.

""I'm making a plea here to the governors. I'm making a plea here that you bring up with the president of the United States the fact that these tariffs are a serious impediment to us moving forward on what is the best trade deal in the world.""

Larry Kudlow, President Donald Trump's economic adviser and one of Garneau's fellow panellists, acknowledged the tariff issue, which the minister raised multiple times.

""We are hard at work on that to solve that issue,"" Kudlow told Garneau. ""I got the message loud and clear.""

Following the panel, Kudlow struck a positive tone on hopes for finalizing USMCA, but more commonly in Canada as the ""new NAFTA."" He even told a story about how Prime Minister Justin Trudeau embraced him in a hug when the three countries gathered in Argentina last year to sign the deal.

""We've had a great coming together in Argentina,"" he said, recalling the animosity that erupted last spring after the G7 meetings in Quebec, when Trump lashed out at the prime minister on Twitter over comments he made about the ongoing trade talks.

""In Argentina, he came up to me -- this is a true story -- after the USMCA ceremony, he walked across the hall to come up and grab my hand and give me a hug,"" Kudlow said. ""I asked him if we could please turn the page on any of that stuff that happened last spring, and he said, 'Absolutely,' and then we started having some policy discussions.""

Kudlow had his own request of the governors gathered Sunday: to lobby members of Congress to support the agreement, which has received decidedly mixed reviews on Capitol Hill, particularly among Democrats who want to see sharper enforcement teeth for the deal's labour and environmental provisions. A number also oppose extending protection for drug patents by two years.

And afterward, Kudlow urged Canadians to be patient, acknowledging the anxiety the tariffs have caused. Garneau ""mentioned it 13 times in our meeting,"" he joked.

""I acknowledged that he's correct, and that we're working on that, and I believe he knows that,"" Kudlow said. ""We're negotiating for a vote in Congress, and we're negotiating with our friends in Canada and Mexico on that subject.""

Garneau called it ""illogical"" that the White House is using national security to justify the tariffs, which were imposed last May and remain in place despite the signing last year of USMCA.

But he also said Canada would move quickly to approve the agreement once the tariffs are lifted.

""We want to see USMCA ratified in Canada,"" Garneau said. ""If the tariffs on steel and aluminum are removed, Canada will move expeditiously towards ratification of the USMCA; we believe very strongly in it.""

Garneau also said Canada would lift its own tariff countermeasures on $16.6 billion worth of U.S. imports, ""which we know are affecting many American companies.""

Canada's ambassador to the U.S. David MacNaughton said last week he believes the tariffs could be lifted in a matter of weeks, but refused to provide additional details.

Trump ended a Canadian exemption from the tariffs last spring in a move he later acknowledged was a negotiating tactic, and the president has also said the tariffs would be lifted once the deal was signed.

Kudlow was asked why, since the deal was signed late last year in Buenos Aires, the tariffs remain in place and what role they serve.

After a pause, he said: ""It's part of the rules of the game, that's what I'll say.

""There's no animosity, it's just that if you flip switches on and off, you really can't do that ... the steel and aluminum tariff discussion is an integral part of the larger legislative picture discussion, and don't take that negatively. It's actually a positive. We're going to figure it out.""","Tariffs could jeopardize new NAFTA deal in Parliament, Garneau warns - CTV News",Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/tariffs-could-jeopardize-new-nafta-deal-in-parliament-garneau-warns-1.4310267

Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press

Clusters of seven stuffed animals were set on Halifax doorsteps and hundreds gathered after sundown for a moment of silence Wednesday as the city grieved the deaths of the children of a Syrian immigrant family.

All seven of the Barho family’s children, ranging in age from four months to 15 years, perished in a house fire early Tuesday morning in the suburban community of Spryfield. Ebraheim Barho was severely burned while trying to rescue his children and remains critically injured. His wife, Kawthar, survived. Their children were Abdullah, Rana, Hala, Ola, Mohamad, Rola and Ahmad.

Details emerged Wednesday on a possible cause of the fire. Natalie Horne, a spokesperson for the citizens’ group that sponsored the family’s immigration to Canada in 2017, said Ms. Barho told her through a translator that a baseboard heater in the family room had caught fire. Ms. Horne said Ms. Barho had told friends there had been problems with the heater and attempts to repair it.

“What we were told from Kawthar is that she had come downstairs and noticed that the heating register behind the couch was on fire. It then quickly spread to the sofa and from there moved up to the stairs, where the children were sleeping.”

Ms. Barho has family in Lebanon, Ms. Horne said. Her group had been working “with all levels of government” to try to arrange travel for Ms. Barho’s relatives. It is not clear whether visa restrictions will allow them to arrive in time for the children’s mass funeral, which is being planned by a coalition of Halifax imams.

“Not very many communities – if any, in Canada – have had a taste of what we have here,"" Halifax deputy mayor Tony Mancini told The Globe and Mail in an interview. “To have a Syrian refugee family leave their country to come to Canada for a better life – that in itself is so brave. It’s pretty rare in Canada to have seven children. To lose them all, it has touched everyone.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attended the Wednesday night vigil, but did not make any remarks.

Ms. Horne told The Globe Wednesday she had visited the mother in hospital. Ms. Barho told her through a translator that she woke up and went downstairs to the kitchen to get the baby some milk and found the couch on fire. She called her husband to put it out. He could not.

Mr. Mancini said the city will offer any municipal facility deemed suitable to host the funeral, which is expected to be too large for any local mosque. It may be held as early as Friday. The timeline hinges largely on the office of Nova Scotia’s medical examiner, which is conducting its own probe into the cause of the deaths.

Heather Fairbairn, a spokesperson for the medical examiner, said it is unclear how long the investigation will take, but added the office is “working to complete their work as quickly as possible.”

Several efforts to support surviving members of the Barho family are under way. A GoFundMe campaign organized by the Imam Council of Halifax and the Hants East Assisting Refugees Team (HEART) had raised more than $400,000 by 1 a.m. (AT) Wednesday. The goal for the fund was set at $1-million. All of it will be “gifted to the family,” according to a webpage for the fund.

“It’s hard to estimate how much they’ll need to restart their lives,” the page reads. “But we urge Haligonians and the people of Nova Scotia to do their best.”

Caitlin Stanley, a spokesperson for GoFundMe, said that donations were made from at least 10 countries.

Mr. Mancini, the deputy mayor, said the city has been inundated with calls from people asking what they can do to support the Barhos, but there are few answers so far.

“They need to be able to help when someone in the community passes away,” he said. “I grew up in rural Nova Scotia and what did we do? Somebody made a casserole. You knocked on the door, you took out the garbage for the family. We just want to do something.”

Kim McGinn, a group-home worker, used her afternoon break Wednesday to lay a bouquet of white carnations at the curb in front of the Barhos’ burned house. The pile was already thick with stuffed pink bunnies and other toy animals.

“It’s the smallest thing I can do,” she said. “My heart is just broken for this family.”

She watched as fire investigators climbed a ladder to the roofless third floor, where they appeared to examine wires. Behind the house, one investigator used a hoe to dig through frozen ash beside a barbecue. A single pink and purple child’s running shoe sat outside the front door. Across the street, a pile of used blankets remained at the base of a tree of a house where a blue Care Bear was affixed to the porch railing.

Ahead of the evening vigil, Mr. Mancini offered advice for those at a loss for what to do.

“If you’re able, come together and have a moment of silence for this beautiful, beautiful family,” he said.

He also had advice for those grieving from afar.

“If they think about us, just hug the person that they love,” he said. “It doesn’t take much for life to change direction.”

The Barhos' home, 33 Quartz Drive, is listed as a ""lovely family home"" on a website for Picket Fence Homes. Photos of the interior of the house show multiple baseboard heaters, including one in what appears to be the living room at the rear of the house.

The Globe’s calls to the home’s listing agent, placed Tuesday, were not returned. The house is listed for $1,500 per month.

Taking questions from reporters after an event in St. John's today, where he visited the Core Science Facility under construction at Memorial University, Trudeau called Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick an ""extraordinary public servant"" who has served Canada with ""integrity and brilliance.""

Wernick told the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair that he warned Wilson-Raybould — who was justice minister at the time — that there would be economic ""consequences"" from prosecuting SNC-Lavalin, including big job losses. But he maintained that he, Trudeau and officials in the Prime Minister's Office did not impose any inappropriate pressure on the minister.

Asked why Wernick and PMO officials pressed Wilson-Raybould to consider what was at stake in an SNC-Lavalin prosecution — given that the decision had been made already to proceed with that prosecution — Trudeau said the government has a fundamental responsibility to preserve jobs and promote economic growth while respecting the rule of law and an independent judiciary.

""That is something this government has always done,"" he said. ""I would recommend that people pay close heed to the words of the clerk of the Privy Council. His service to this country over decades in the public service leaves him well-positioned to understand what institutions are grounded in, and make sure that we're doing the right things as a government.""

The Public Prosecution Service told SNC-Lavalin on Sept. 4, 2018, that it would not negotiate with the company on a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, which would have applied alternative penalties to avoid criminal proceedings against the Quebec-based global engineering firm on bribery and fraud charges related to contracts in Libya.

Wernick said he called Wilson-Raybould on Dec. 19, 2018, to discuss various issues — including the option of a remediation agreement.

During that call, Wernick said he spoke of the implications of prosecuting the company for employees, suppliers and communities. He said he told Wilson-Raybould that the prime minister and ""a lot of her colleagues"" were anxious about what they were hearing and reading in business media — articles warning that the company could close down or move if criminal proceedings went ahead.

Pressured to 'get it right'

""I am quite sure the minister felt pressured to get it right, and part of my conversation with her on Dec. 19 was conveying context that there were a lot of people worried about what would happen ... the consequences not for her, the consequences for the workers, and the communities and the suppliers,"" he told MPs on Thursday.

Wernick said he did not cross any line in his exchanges with Wilson-Raybould, insisting the conversations were ""lawful and appropriate.""

The justice committee is examining the growing controversy touched off by a Feb. 7 Globe and Mail report that said Trudeau's aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the Justice portfolio.

Wilson-Raybould has remained silent on the issue, citing solicitor-client privilege. This week, she told the House of Commons that privilege is not hers to waive, and she hopes she is able to speak her ""truth.""

Opposition Conservatives and New Democrats have been demanding the prime minister waive privilege so Wilson-Raybould can speak freely when she appears before the committee, which she is expected to do next week.

Wernick said Thursday he doesn't believe Wilson-Raybould is bound by solicitor-client privilege, but Trudeau said again on Friday that there are serious implications at play.

""This is something we do have to take very seriously because it's a fundamental part of our justice system and, indeed, in this case there are two ongoing court cases,"" he said.

Wilson-Raybould's successor, Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti, is reviewing the matter, but has offered no indication of when he could provide advice to the prime minister on privilege.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says waiving solicitor-client privilege is a complicated matter and doesn't want to impact the two ongoing court cases involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair while taking questions from reporters during an appearance in St John's Friday. 1:15

As the controversy around SNC-Lavalin heats up, the company itself is facing headwinds. It reported Friday that it had slashed its dividend by 65 per cent and recorded a fourth-quarter loss of $1.6 billion.

The company said it will now pay a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, compared to its earlier payment of 28.7 cents per share.

'A political hockey game'

SNC-Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce told a news conference today that the company and its current employees have done nothing wrong.

""Our employees are being used as puck in political hockey game,"" he said. ""They don't deserve it and, frankly, we've had enough.""

Bruce said the company requested that the charges against it be ""circumvented"" through a remediation agreement — that it didn't ask for them to be dropped entirely. He argues that a remediation arrangement would be in the public's interest.

The company will ""vigorously defend"" itself in court, Bruce said.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau was asked Friday whether he thinks SNC-Lavalin can survive if the criminal prosecution proceeds.

""I really can't speak about the potential success of any individual business,"" he said in Toronto after meeting with private sector economists. ""I think in the case of SNC-Lavalin, it's an organization that's been very successful over a long period of time and we obviously want to see a business like that, that employs that many Canadians, continue to be successful.""","'Pay heed' to words of top bureacrat on SNC-Lavalin affair, Trudeau says",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-snc-lavalin-privy-council-st-john-s-1.5029516
304,Empty,2019-02-25T14:46:09Z,Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer wants Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to appear as a witness at the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair.,"The Trudeau government issued a broad waiver on Monday allowing former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to tell the Commons justice committee details of her conversations with government officials about the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In an order-in-council (OIC) posted online, the government says Wilson-Raybould — ""and any persons who directly participated in discussions with her relating to the exercise of her authority under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin"" — can report to the committee and to the federal ethics commissioner any cabinet confidences ""in any information or communications that were directly discussed with her respecting the exercise of that authority while she held that office.""

The OIC also ""waives ... to the extent they apply, solicitor-client privilege and any other relevant duty of confidentiality to the Government of Canada"" regarding what Wilson-Raybould discussed with other government officials as justice minister ""respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin while she held that office.""

The waiver does not extend, however, to any communications between Wilson-Raybould and the director of public prosecutions on SNC-Lavalin while she was justice minister — ""in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,"" says the text of the order.

The order sets the stage for what could be an extraordinary session of the justice committee. Wilson-Raybould was expected to speak before the committee this week; a time has not yet been set for her appearance.

The justice committee is examining the growing controversy touched off by a Feb. 7 Globe and Mail report that said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin to help the company avoid criminal prosecution on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya — and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the Justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs.

Wilson-Raybould quit cabinet entirely on Feb. 12. She's offered no comment since on the SNC-Lavalin affair or the company's attempts to secure a remediation agreement to avoid criminal prosecution, arguing that she's still bound by solicitor-client confidentiality from her time as federal attorney general.

The OIC clears a few things up in advance of Wilson-Raybould's appearance before the committee. The ex-minister, who said she is ""anxious"" to testify before the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair, wrote to committee chair Liberal MP Anthony Housefather today saying it would be useful for the committee to have an ""authoritative statement"" on the scope of what she can say prior to her appearance.

""I am anxious to appear at the first available time,"" she wrote. ""However, I believe that in advance of my appearance the members of the committee and I should have as much clarity as we can in relation to the possible constraints on the matters about which I may properly testify.""

Wilson-Raybould, who has retained retired Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell as counsel, also requested an extended period of 30 minutes to make an opening statement to the committee.

Under pressure to waive solicitor-client privilege for his former justice minister and attorney general, Trudeau said earlier today Wilson-Raybould would be given leeway to speak.

Earlier today, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau to testify at the committee, insisting Canadians should be outraged by the allegations of political interference in a criminal case.

A motion tabled by the Conservatives said Trudeau should be called to answer questions given his ""alleged direct involvement in a sustained effort to influence SNC-Lavalin's criminal prosecution."" It called on the prime minister to appear at a two-hour televised committee under oath sometime before Mar. 15.

The motion was defeated in the Commons this evening.

During a news conference on Parliament Hill Monday, Scheer described the SNC-Lavalin affair as an unprecedented attempt to alter the course of justice through political interference.

""Politicians don't get to execute our justice system,"" he said.

""What we've seen unfold over the last two weeks is a textbook case of government corruption, with those at the very top of the Prime Minister's Office implicated in what could be the obstruction of justice.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer outlines the motion he will introduce calling on the Prime Minister to appear before the Justice Committee . 1:25

It's rare for a prime minister to appear before a committee.

On Sept. 7, 2006, then-prime minister Stephen Harper appeared before a special committee on Senate reform.

Former prime ministers have occasionally appeared before Commons committee hearings. Former prime minister Paul Martin appeared before a committee on the Kelowna Accord on Nov. 9, 2006 and Brian Mulroney spoke before a committee looking into the Airbus settlement on Dec. 13, 2007.

Last week, Canada's top civil servant Michael Wernick told the justice committee that he warned Wilson-Raybould that there would be economic ""consequences"" from prosecuting SNC-Lavalin, including big job losses. But he maintained that he, Trudeau and officials in the Prime Minister's Office did not impose any inappropriate pressure on the minister.

Trudeau said Friday that Wernick is an ""extraordinary public servant"" who has served Canada with ""integrity and brilliance.""

""I would recommend that people pay close heed to the words of the clerk of the Privy Council,"" the PM said. ""His service to this country over decades in the public service leaves him well-positioned to understand what institutions are grounded in, and make sure that we're doing the right things as a government.""

In September 2018, the government amended the Criminal Code to allow for remediation agreements, enabling prosecutors to use them as an alternative to a criminal trial ""at their discretion to address specified economic crimes if they consider it to be in the public interest and appropriate in the circumstances,"" according to the Department of Justice website.

If the accused organization upholds the terms and conditions of the agreement, charges can be stayed and a criminal prosecution avoided.

Shawcross doctrine

According to the government website, the purpose of remediation agreements is to denounce wrongdoing and hold the organization to account, while reducing harm to innocent employees, shareholders and other third parties. The organization would have to accept responsibility for the wrongdoing and pay a financial penalty.

In the case of SNC-Lavalin, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada opted not to pursue a remediation agreement and chose instead to proceed with prosecution. It advised the company of that decision on Sept. 4, 2018.

Wilson-Raybould, as attorney general at the time, had authority to override the decision and halt prosecution. Wernick confirmed last week several meetings were held on the topic — including a telephone call on Dec. 19 he initiated, during which he warned Wilson-Raybould of the economic consequences of prosecuting a company that employs about 9,000 people.

He insisted there was never ""inappropriate"" interference.

According to the so-called Shawcross doctrine, the attorney general must consider the impact of prosecution on the public interest. The attorney general can consult with cabinet colleagues, but those discussions are limited to hearing advice, not receiving directions.

Delay advising investors

Arguing in favour of calling Trudeau to speak to the committee, Conservative justice critic and deputy leader Lisa Raitt said it's in the public interest to have the prime minister testify in order to bring together the various threads of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Raitt also asked why SNC-Lavalin was told of the prosecutor's decision on Sept. 4 but didn't disclose that information to its shareholders until Oct. 10.

""Who in the Prime Minister's Office, what cabinet minister, or even did the prime minister give assurances to SNC-Lavalin that they would not have to disclose a material fact to their shareholders because they were going to sort it all out?"" she asked.

Five legal experts appeared before the committee today; some couched their comments by saying they don't have all the facts yet.

Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond is a senior associate counsel at Woodward and Company LLP and a professor at the Peter Allard School of Law, University of British Columbia. She told the committee the law imposes limits on anyone trying to influence an attorney general acting in the role of chief prosecutor.

'Crisis' in rule of law

""Those engaging in that must point to lawful authority that actually backs up their actions, and I would say the Shawcross doctrine is a flimsy authority,"" she said.

Turpel-Lafond said she believes it's important to hear from all of those involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair, not just Wilson-Raybould, because the situation is escalating to the level of a ""crisis in the rule of law.""

She said the RCMP integrity unit could investigate the matter — if it isn't doing so already — to determine if there was a ""subtext"" to the discussions between various officials and Wilson-Raybould regarding the criminal prosecution.

""If there's evidence that a prosecutor is fired and there was an attempt to influence or direct her attention to something that didn't have lawful authority, then it does raise the spectre of obstruction of justice, because obstruction of justice requires this sort of fear-favour element,"" she said.

Maxime St-Hilaire, associate professor at the Faculty of Law, Université de Sherbrooke, said he finds it difficult to understand how information conveyed to an attorney general would be useful after a decision had been made to not overturn a prosecution.

""If there are cabinet discussions after that decision has been made, then I find that quite difficult to understand,"" he said.

305,Empty,2019-02-25T23:29:00Z,"Jody Wilson-Raybould is forcing everyone around her to react as the politically damaging affair grinds on, and that’s pretty impressive clout for a rookie politician, Susan Delacourt writes.","Or is it? While Jody Wilson-Raybould’s split with the Prime Minister’s Office is not apparently linked to any leadership ambitions, it is abundantly clear now that the former justice minister is driving the bus in this whole saga over SNC-Lavalin .

Once again, without uttering a word about the specific grievances, Raybould is forcing everyone around her to react. Last week, she managed to get a hearing from cabinet and caucus — and this of course came after the resignation of Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts.

On Monday, on the eve of her much-anticipated appearance at the Commons justice committee, Raybould demurred, issuing instead a long letter setting out the conditions under which she intended to speak.

So while Wilson-Raybould is not the leader or even a would-be leader of her party, she definitely has forced Liberals to follow her — if only to try to anticipate her next move.

That’s pretty impressive clout for a rookie politician, new to cabinet and government a little over three years ago and a relative newcomer to the Liberal party.

When Lucien Bouchard left Brian Mulroney’s cabinet in 1990, that Conservative government carried on without him. Ditto for Paul Martin’s exit from Jean Chretien’s cabinet in 2003. Damage was done in both cases, certainly in the long term, but neither prime minister seemed overly concerned with keeping the departed minister in the fold.

In fact, it’s difficult to remember any other politician who retained the power to keep dictating rules of engagement to a Prime Minister’s Office after leaving cabinet.

Trudeau’s reaction to this whole saga has been curious. For several days after the story of Wilson-Raybould’s grievances about SNC-Lavalin first broke in The Globe and Mail earlier this month, the prime minister did not speak to her.

Then he spoke to her a couple of times in Vancouver and seemed to be confident she would stay in cabinet — until she quit, hours later. He apologized to her behind the closed door of the cabinet room last Wednesday, only to have her stand up in the Commons and warn that she was waiting a chance to “speak my truth.”

Late last year, Trudeau was asked in one of his year-end interviews to sum up U.S. President Donald Trump in a word. “Unpredictable,” Trudeau replied, which summed up a lot of things, especially his disciplined silence in the face of Trump’s trade-related tantrum after the G-7 meeting in Charlevoix last June.

In the end, Canada and the U.S. did end up signing a new trade deal a few months later and Trump stopped calling Trudeau and Canada names on his angry Twitter feeds.

Trump’s unpredictability isn’t Trudeau’s biggest problem now — Wilson-Raybould’s is. But when you think about it, the prime minister is handling them the same way, which is probably a mistake.

Trudeau’s strategy on Trump, distilled to its essence, was basically this: say nothing, don’t rise to the bait and fan out to seek allies and experts while the situation cools down. A similar strategy seems to be under way now, inasmuch as the Trudeau government’s response can be called a strategy.

But Wilson-Raybould’s disaffection with Trudeau and how she’s been treated is looking far more methodical than Trump’s episodic outrage of last year.

What’s more, in Trump’s case, Trudeau could count on most of Canada to be on his side. With some exceptions, Canadians were more likely to stick up for their prime minister in any battle with the unpredictable Trump.

This confident streak — maybe overconfident streak — is at the nub of the Wilson-Raybould saga now. It is striking to see the ways in which Trudeau and his team have just left the slate blank in this whole tale, banking on the conviction that Canadians will give them the benefit of the doubt.

Each day in the Commons, this is basically what Trudeau says — that Canadians know his government is balancing concern for jobs and the law. “Trust us,” he says, while the government fans out, looking for experts and allies to attest to Trudeau’s integrity and hoping that the mess will go away.

Sometimes scandals do blow themselves out; sometimes ministers — or angry presidents — just go away, and governments carry on in their absence.

Nothing in this nearly three-week-old saga over Wilson-Raybould and SNC-Lavalin gives any indication of following that pattern. Trudeau and his government aren’t leading themselves out of the controversy — they’re following and reacting — and Wilson-Raybould is doing the leading.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government ordered a review of the Trans Mountain Project taking into account its impact on killer whales after the Federal Court of Appeal blocked it over concerns for the marine mammals.

The National Energy Board (NEB) said the project would have ""significant adverse environmental effects"" on the whales and an oil spill could have equally horrendous impacts on the marine environment.

But it concluded ""that they can be justified in the circumstances, in light of the considerable benefits of the project and measures to mitigate the effects.""

The federal government has 90 days to decide whether to give final approval for the project, but has signaled it may delay until after a general election in October.

The expansion of the 715-mile (1,150-kilometer) pipeline was to move 890,000 barrels of oil a day from landlocked Alberta province to the Pacific coast, replacing a smaller crumbling conduit built in 1953.

The Trudeau administration approved the project in 2016 after an initial environmental review, saying it was in the ""national interest"" to ease Canada's reliance on the US market and get a better price for its crude oil.

The pipeline has faced opposition from environmentalists and indigenous tribes (protest pictured March 2018) worried that increased shipping from a mraine terminal in Vancouver would impede the recovery of the local killer whale population

But it has faced opposition from environmentalists and indigenous tribes worried that increased shipping from a marine terminal in Vancouver would impede the recovery of local killer whale populations.

Ottawa bought the project for Can$4.5 billion (US$3.5 billion) in August, effectively nationalizing it in a bid to bring a swift end to legal challenges and protests at construction sites.

But on the same day, the Federal Court of Appeal ordered ministers to take a second look at the project, taking greater care to consult with indigenous tribes and consider marine traffic impacts.

Opponents of the pipeline said Friday the NEB recommendations do not satisfy their concerns, and vowed to continue their fight against it.

Former UFC welterweight champion and middleweight title holder Georges St-Pierre officially retired from mixed martial arts on Thursday.

He is one of only six UFC fighters to have held titles in multiple weight classes having also been welterweight champion for 2,204 days and won 26 of his 28 fights from 2002-17.

But what kind of legacy does the 37-year-old Canadian leave?

Here are five reasons he should be considered MMA's greatest of all time.

Champion's mentality

Throughout the 28 fights of his MMA career, St-Pierre displayed the heart of a true champion with his ability to not only go to the proverbial well to get the victory, but also by beating rivals at their own game.

He out-grappled Matt Hughes, Matt Serra and Jon Fitch, just like he out-struck Josh Koscheck, BJ Penn and Nick Diaz.

He went to war with Carlos Condit and Johnny Hendricks, and conclusively avenged the two losses he suffered inside the octagon.

Between 2007 and 2013 he dominated his weight class, defeating every leading welterweight contender the world could offer.

Even four years away from competition couldn't stop him from weathering a storm to choke out Michael Bisping in November 2017 and add a second weight-class world title to his incredible legacy.

A true martial artist

St-Pierre dedicated his life to martial arts and reaped the rewards.

In a sport, prior to GSP, littered with tough-talking street-fighting men, and more recently, with athletes as focused on the celebrity and entertainment aspect of prize-fighting as they are on training, St-Pierre bucked the trend.

He was always a true professional. Respectful, strategic and athletic, his behaviour was more reminiscent of the characters in the Bruce Lee or Jean-Claude Van Damme movies he adored than that of an overly aggressive, cauliflower-eared, toothless warrior.

Throughout his career, St-Pierre also searched out the best possible coaching to further his lifetime of marital arts education.

His journey took him to Renzo Gracie's in New York, Greg Jackson's in New Mexico, onto the mats with Muay Thai master Phil Nurse, the boxing ring with iconic coach Freddie Roach and, of course, he forged a long-time partnership with head coach Firas Zahabi.

He was always ahead of the curve, too, employing a sports psychologist early on in his title reign to stay on top.

A national hero

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted on Twitter following St-Pierre's retirement

When Bisping retired last year, where was the reaction and tribute from British prime minister Theresa May? Likely she has never heard of MMA, the UFC or 'The Count'.

In Canada, however, GSP's career achievements enthralled the nation.

He was voted Canadian Athlete of the Year three times in a row between 2008-2010, and when he announced to the world he was walking away from the sport, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was one of the first dignitaries to take to social media to offer his admiration.

When he fought Jake Shields in April 2011, GSP proved he also didn't necessarily need the right dance partner to sell tickets, when 55,724 fans (the second biggest gate in UFC history) packed into the Rogers Centre in Toronto in to watch their hero retain his belt.

He makes his own rules

Long before Conor McGregor became the breakout superstar he is, there was another pay-per-view champion in the UFC who wasn't afraid to push back at the top brass.

When you get to the big show, most fighters are all about the three letters - UFC. But St-Pierre had three of his own that were always given priority - GSP. Once he was established as champion, he only took fights when he was ready.

He knew his worth, would push back on contract deals and danced by his own tune. He never swerved anybody, but he never took fights that weren't for the benefit of his own brand either.

He returned last year, beat Bisping and walked away from the 185lb belt. His terms. And that is part of the reason he quit for good this week.

He would have liked to face lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, the unbeaten Russian who rag-dolled McGregor back in October. But having St-Pierre end the unbeaten reign of a fighter starting out on his PPV journey didn't appeal to the UFC.

After all, St-Pierre would only of likely stuck around for a Conor superfight in victory. Again, always on St-Pierre's terms.

He kept it clean

Long before the UFC partnered up with the US Anti-Doping Agency and employed Jeff Novitzky in a defiant move to clean up MMA, St-Pierre campaigned long and hard for a cleaner sport.

He even walked away from the octagon at one stage in protest at the lack of testing. And while that may not, on the face of it, seem relative to his GOAT potential, his legacy is untarnished. The same cannot be said of his two most decorated rivals.

Anderson Silva, a long-time potential crossover opponent for GSP, and the incredibly gifted Jon 'Bones' Jones both have comparable skill-sets, dominant title reigns and a similar long list of acclaimed opponents inside the octagon.

Yet both of their careers are now stained with multiple drug test failures. St-Pierre has never failed a test. He has never cheated, cut corners or broken the martial arts code of conduct.

308,Empty,2019-02-25T21:13:47Z,"Former justice minister says she is “anxious to appear at the first available time,” but remains constrained by what she say by solicitor-client privilege, cabinet confidence and ongoing cases still before the courts.","“It may well be that we have a situation where we have a prosecutor that was removed from her role, as opposed to an attorney general that should have resigned,” Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a former Saskatchewan provincial court judge, told the Commons justice committee.

OTTAWA—Discussions the Prime Minister’s Office had with former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould about criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin are “troubling,” lack a strong legal justification and may have led to her being “fired,” a respected jurist said Monday.

The director of public prosecutions decided last fall to proceed with criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin, rejecting the company’s request for a remediation agreement that would have spared it a conviction and, with it, a 10-year ban on government contracts.

“Perhaps this is an instance where a prosecutor was actually fired for establishing a boundary that was not popular or accepted. I’m not sure of that. I think there is some suspicion and concern here about that.”

“In fact, prosecutors should not resign. Lead prosecutors, when they’ve taken a decision, should hold firm to their position and that is consistent with the rule of law,” Turpel-Lafond said.

Now those interventions are in the spotlight amid questions whether lines were crossed.

Wilson-Raybould appears to have stuck by that decision in the face of meetings with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s senior aides and the top civil servant, despite concerns about the future of the Quebec company if the charges went ahead.

Turpel-Lafond, who currently practises law and teaches in Victoria, expressed serious doubts about the government’s claim — articulated by Wilson-Raybould’s successor, David Lametti, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick and Liberal MPs — that officials are permitted to hold robust discussions with an attorney general under the so-called Shawcross Doctrine.

Once a decision is made to pursue a prosecution, there is “limited authority for anyone to intervene at that decision point and going forward,” Turpel-Lafond said.

She said if the talks went beyond a “more passive and respectful approach,” and the purpose “was to persuade the attorney general as prosecutor to take a different position on a prosecution, it triggers a serious rule-of-law concern.”

And she cast doubt on Lametti’s and Wernick’s assertions that the decision to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin is one that still remains open to the attorney general, even with the preliminary inquiry underway.

She said there should be a “full” airing of what was said to Wilson-Raybould, adding it would be something she’d expect the RCMP’s sensitive investigations or “integrity” section would already be looking into.

Two other legal experts agreed that the Shawcross Doctrine — a concept imported from the United Kingdom — does not justify any pressure put on an attorney general to make or change a prosecutorial decision.

That decision, they said, is the attorney general’s alone to make.

“The attorney general should not be put under pressure by colleagues and in particular should not be put under partisan political pressure,” said Mary Condon, interim dean of Osgoode Hall Law School.

Maxime St-Hilaire, an associate law professor at the University of Sherbrooke, said the clear line would be better drawn if Canada’s attorney general did not also serve as justice minister inside a federal cabinet.

Trudeau told the House of Commons he would partially lift confidentiality obligations on his former attorney general so she can testify about allegations that his office was at the centre of what the Opposition says was a “sustained effort” to influence the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Under fire in the House for weeks, Trudeau told question period Monday that Wilson-Raybould would be able to appear at the justice committee and “will be able to address relevant matters at the committee while ensuring that the two active court cases are not jeopardized.”

Monday night, the Trudeau cabinet issued an order-in-council waiving cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege for Wilson-Raybould for discussions she had on SNC-Lavalin, clearing the way for her testimony to the committee.

However, “in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,” the waiver did not extend to communications Wilson-Raybould had with Kathleen Roussel, director of public prosecutions concerning SNC-Lavalin.

It was not entirely clear when her long-awaited appearance will be scheduled, as her expected appearance Tuesday was postponed.

In a letter sent earlier Monday to the committee, Wilson-Raybould stated that she is “anxious to appear at the first available time.”

But she said that she remained constrained by what she can say by solicitor-client privilege, cabinet confidence and the ongoing cases involving SNC-Lavalin still before the courts.

“The government can waive solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence. I cannot, Wilson-Raybould said in her letter to Liberal MP Anthony Housefather, chair of the committee.

She said she wants to delay her testimony until “we all have whatever clarity we can have about these issues.”

When she does appear, Wilson-Raybould said she wants to make an extended opening statement of about 30 minutes to provide “my best recollection of all relevant communications.”

Trudeau has denied he or anyone in his office applied any inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould. She has not yet spoken publicly to confirm or deny the allegation, saying she is bound by solicitor-client privilege.

Late Monday, the Commons voted 155-106 against compelling Trudeau to testify before the committee, as the Conservative and NDP opposition wanted.

The prime minister again defended his actions, telling the Commons that “at every stage,” his government did what it promised Canadians, to stand up for jobs and growth while protecting the rule of law and the independence of the justice system.

“We’ve consistently and continually stood up for the 9,000 jobs at SNC-Lavalin and good jobs right across the country,” Trudeau said.

“That’s exactly what we’ll continue to do and we will continue to do it in a way that ... always respects the rules and norms that govern our institutions.”

SNC-Lavalin and two former employees were charged in 2015 under the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act with one count of bribing former members of the Libyan regime of Muammar Gaddafi, and one count of fraud under the Criminal Code.

Draft legislation by the Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) has triggered the suspension of 18,000 applications made under existing laws from immigrants seeking to live in the predominantly French-speaking province. The CAQ, which won power in October, has said that the reforms would improve newcomers’ integration into the workforce.

Lawyer group Association québécoise des avocats et avocates en droit de l’immigration asked Quebec Superior Court Justice Frederic Bachand to order the government to process existing newcomers’ applications as the bill is being debated.

“This situation is a catastrophe for us,” said Seeun Park, a nurse and plaintiff in the case who came to Quebec with her two children from South Korea in 2017.

“We already invested a lot of money and efforts end energy to work in Quebec,” she told reporters on Friday outside the courtroom in Montreal.

A spokesman for the province’s immigration minister declined to comment on Friday, saying the matter was before the court.

The CAQ campaigned on a pledge to cut immigration from 50,000 to 40,000 people a year and expel new residents who fail to pass tests on French and Quebec values within three years.

The policy could put Quebec on a collision course with the Liberals of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who are hoping to make gains in the province to offset expected losses elsewhere in a federal election this October.

The group of almost a dozen people were at a morning news conference to make their first public remarks since the deadly rampage last July that left two people dead and 13 wounded.

""What happened to us was a tragedy, and we think we could have had better odds had attitudes toward handgun ownership been different before that night,"" said shooting victim Noor Samiei, who was out with friends celebrating her 18th birthday on the night of the attack.

The group also revealed an open letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and a petition calling for the ban.

""We acknowledge that this action is not the only step that needs to be taken to stem gun violence; however, we believe it will be impactful and effective,"" the letter reads.

The news conference coincides with the seven-month anniversary of the attack on an otherwise quiet Sunday evening on July 22 along Danforth Avenue in Toronto's Greektown neighbourhood, in an area also known as the Danforth.

The group is calling out a perceived ""lack of action"" by governments to combat gun violence in the aftermath of the shooting.

""We miss Reese and we miss Julianna. We have to live with that, but we don't have to live with the laws that could be changed to help prevent this from happening again,"" Samiei told reporters.

""The pain and loss we feel without Reese and Julianna is indescribable,"" added 15-year-old Quinn Fallon, Reese Fallon's younger sister.

""Because Reese and Julianna don't have a voice anymore, we are doing this in their honour.""

The group says that despite the best intentions of responsible gun owners, too many firearms end up stolen and on streets across the country. They would like to see handguns used for sport shooting owned by licensed shooting facilities, and not the people who take part in the activity.

""Are we going to learn from our experience or are we going to express grief in the moment an move on? We are better than this as a nation,"" the open letter reads.

""The families fear that the initiative will fall short of recommending a handgun and assault rifle ban, and they want to ensure they see action,"" according to the letter.

312,Empty,2019-02-21T15:28:38Z,Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti will be first in the hot seat today as the Commons justice committee begins hearings on the SNC-Lavalin affair.,"Canada's top civil servant insists there was no inappropriate pressure on Jody Wilson-Raybould to override a decision to prosecute SNC-Lavalin, but says he warned her about the dire economic ""consequences"" of criminal proceedings.

In blunt testimony before the justice committee Thursday, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick said he called the then-justice minister and attorney general on Dec. 19, 2018 to discuss various issues — including the option of a remediation agreement that would serve as an alternative to prosecution for the Quebec-based global engineering company, which is facing bribery and fraud charges related to contracts in Libya.

During that call, Wernick said, he spoke of the implications of prosecuting the company for employees, suppliers and communities. He said he told Wilson-Raybould that the prime minister and ""a lot of her colleagues"" were anxious about what they were hearing and reading in business press — articles warning that the company could close down or move if criminal proceedings went ahead.

""I am quite sure the minister felt pressured to get it right, and part of my conversation with her on Dec. 19 was conveying context that there were a lot of people worried about what would happen ... the consequences not for her, the consequences for the workers, and the communities and the suppliers,"" he told MPs probing the scandal now engulfing the Liberal government.

Wernick insisted he did not cross any line in his exchanges with Wilson-Raybould.

""I can tell you with complete assurance that my view of those conversations is that they were within the boundaries of what's lawful and appropriate. I was informing the minister of context. She may have another view of the conversation, but that's something the ethics commissioner could sort out,"" he said.

In the end, Wernick said, the matter may boil down to an interpretation of what constitutes 'pressure'.

""I think the matter may come down to the ethics commissioner's view on a conversation between two people, between what was sent and what was received. And I think the ethics commissioner is the appropriate person to decide what was undue and what was inappropriate,"" he said.

Wernick's extraordinary testimony sets the stage for what could be a fierce rebuttal from Wilson-Raybould, who is expected to appear before the committee early next week.

Michael Wernick the Clerk of the Privy Council spoke to the Commons Justice committee Thursday 0:27

Wernick also attacked the bombshell Feb. 7 Globe and Mail report that touched off the political scandal and triggered the resignation of cabinet minister Wilson-Raybould and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's principal secretary, Gerry Butts.

""I'm here to say to you that the Globe and Mail article contains errors, unfounded speculation and, in some cases, is simply defamatory,"" he said.

The article — citing unnamed, anonymous sources — said that Trudeau's aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the justice portfolio.

Wernick repeatedly denied any undue pressure from Trudeau or any officials in the PMO.

Michael Wernick the Clerk of the Privy Council spoke to the Commons Justice committee on Thursday 3:39

""At every opportunity, verbally and in writing in December, the prime minister made it clear that this was the decision for the minister of justice to take. She was the decision-maker,"" he said.

Wernick, who met with representatives of SNC-Lavalin on Sept. 18, 2018 — after the company had been turned down on its request to avoid criminal proceedings — said the firm was ""making the rounds"" to make a pitch to avoid prosecution. He said he could not remember whether the company advised him that it had been told the Public Prosecution Service of Canada had rejected its request.

Wernick said that if she had felt she was being put under pressure at any point, she could have filed a complaint with the ethics commissioner or reported any perceived wrongdoing to the prime minister.

In his opening remarks to the committee, Wernick said he's worried about the state of politics in Canada right now, citing the threat of foreign interference in the coming election and the use of words like 'treason' and 'traitor' in political discourse.

""Those are the words that lead to assassination,"" he said. ""I'm worried that somebody's going to get shot this year during the political campaign.""

Earlier today, Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti told the committee he has never faced inappropriate pressure from the prime minister or anyone in the PMO, and would take action if any official tried to direct his actions improperly.

‘I'm here to say to you that the Globe and Mail article contains errors, unfounded speculation and, in some cases, is simply defamatory,’ Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council, said. 5:31

Lametti said he would not ""speculate"" on ""what others might or might not do,"" but would only explain how he would respond to political pressure.

""I would take, under the circumstances, a number of different actions,"" he said.

Trudeau appointed Lametti to the post in a January cabinet shuffle that demoted Wilson-Raybould from the Department of Justice to Veterans Affairs.

She resigned from that position a month later, just days after the Globe and Mail reported that she had been pressured by officials in the Prime Minister's Office to stop criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based global engineering and construction firm facing charges of bribery and fraud related to contracts in Libya.

The Globe and Mail said PMO officials pushed her to direct the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to draft a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — a legal tool resembling a plea deal — for SNC-Lavalin.

The Liberal government changed the Criminal Code in 2018 to introduce such remediation agreements as an option for cases of corporate wrongdoing in Canada.

Lametti said the legislative regime was addressing a perceived ""gap"" in the law and is meant to hold corporations to account while protecting bystanders who could be harmed by a criminal prosecution and possible bankruptcy — such as a corporation's employees, subcontractors and third-party suppliers.

Similar compliance tools — which can impose fines in lieu of prosecution — are also available in the U.S. and the U.K.

Lametti said he only had general knowledge of the SNC-Lavalin case before he was appointed to cabinet and did not discuss it with Trudeau before his appointment.

A Globe and Mail report published today says Wilson-Raybould told federal cabinet ministers Tuesday she believed it was improper for PMO officials to press her to help SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution.

Wilson-Raybould took the unprecedented step of requesting permission to address cabinet Tuesday, and was allowed to do so after vigorous debate among ministers.

​Today, Wernick said Lametti exited the meeting during her address to cabinet.

""He saw it right away, the need to recuse, left the room and was not present for that discussion,"" he said.

Polling fallout

The political fallout since the Feb. 7 Globe and Mail report has been heavy for the Trudeau government.

The opposition Conservatives and NDP have called for a public inquiry and have demanded Trudeau waive solicitor-client privilege so Wilson-Raybould can speak freely on the matter during her appearance before the committee, expected sometime next week.

The CBC's Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polls, shows the scandal is taking a toll on the Liberals. It puts the Liberals and Conservatives neck-and-neck in voting intentions and virtually tied in the number of seats each party would be likely to win if an election were held today.

On Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould abstained from a vote in the House of Commons on an NDP motion calling for an inquiry because she was personally involved in the matter. She said she can't waive client-solicitor privilege on her own.

""I understand fully that Canadians want to know the truth and want transparency,"" she said. ""Privilege and confidentiality are not mine to waive, and I hope that I have the opportunity to speak my truth.""

​During an event in Halifax Thursday, Trudeau said he remains ""surprised and disappointed"" by Wilson-Raybould's resignation from cabinet. He cited cabinet confidentiality and said the government is working to create good jobs and protect an independent judiciary.

""We will always do that in the right way,"" he said.

Lametti said the issue of waiving solicitor-client privilege is ""complex and layered."" He said he is seeking a way to ensure transparency and fairness without compromising cabinet confidentiality or legal proceedings, but could not say if he would make a decision before Wilson-Raybould appears at committee.",Canada's top lawyer to testify at committee probing SNC-Lavalin scandal,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/lametti-justice-committee-snc-lavalin-1.5027617

Mr Scheer is proposing an opposition motion asking MPs to “order the Prime Minister to appear, testify and answer questions at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, under oath, for a televised two-hour meeting, before Friday, March 15, 2019”, as reported by Global News. The publication stated Mr Scheer told reporters on Monday morning: “We are a country of the rule of law and nobody, no matter their status, their wealth or their connections, should be entitled to special treatment under it. “What we’ve seen unfold over the last few weeks is a textbook case of government corruption.” Ms Jody Wilson-Raybould, who has remained silent until now, will appear in front of a House of Commons justice committee on Tuesday.

Is Justin Trudeau set to be TOPPLED? Mr Trudeau is coming under increasing pressure and this morning's statement by Mr Scheer will have only further damaged his reputation. Meanwhile, another politician has also piled on the pressure for the Canadian Prime Minister after calling for a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair. Pagemeet Singh, the leader of the left-wing NDP who is standing for a by-election in Burnaby South in the Vancouver, said he was not afraid to criticise the Liberal party. He said: ""I think people are very disappointed with what's going on with the Liberal government.”

Canada news: Justin Trudeau with Jody Wilson-Raybould in January

Ms Wilson-Raybould resigned last week following her demotion from her ministerial role in January. What is revealed from her meeting on Tuesday could have serious implications for Mr Trudeau’s future as Canada’s Prime Minister. The public image of the handsome, feminist, tolerant leader appears to have already taken a battering, polling suggests. An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News taken after Mrs Wilson-Raybould's resignation showed the Liberals had dropped four percentage points since December to 34 percent. Their rivals, the Conservatives, were up two points at 36 percent, eight months ahead of the Canadian federal elections. Mr Trudeau has dodged more recent questioning about his officials’ interference, saying only there was no “directive”.

314,Empty,2019-02-21T09:00:00Z,The Liberals were on track for re-election at year's end - but the SNC-Lavalin affair has taken its toll on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.,"The fallout from the SNC-Lavalin affair is only beginning to rain down on Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government but it seems to be having an impact — one that could put the Liberals on track to defeat in this fall's federal election.

The controversy surrounding allegations about political interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, a major Quebec-based engineering firm, and the subsequent demotion and resignation from cabinet of former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould (followed by the resignation of the prime minister's principal secretary, Gerry Butts), is evolving on a daily basis.

The first polls published since the Globe and Mail initially reported the allegations on Feb. 7 suggest that the Liberals have taken a significant hit in public support.

The CBC's Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polls, puts the Liberals and Conservatives neck-and-neck in voting intentions and virtually tied in the number of seats each party would be likely to win if an election were held today.

Right now, there's no clear indication of which party would emerge with the most seats in a general election — a significant shift from where things stood at the end of 2018, when the Poll Tracker gave the Liberals a better than 90 per cent chance of winning an election.

For the Liberals, the trend line might only get worse.

Three polls that were conducted entirely after the initial Globe reports emerged have been published in recent days — from Campaign Research (Feb. 7-11), Ipsos/Global News (Feb. 14-18) and Léger/Canadian Press (Feb. 15-19). The last two surveys were conducted after Wilson-Raybould's resignation from cabinet and include some data gathered since Butts stepped down on Monday.

Campaign Research showed the Conservatives ahead with 37 per cent to 32 per cent for the Liberals, while both Ipsos and Léger put the margin at 36 to 34 per cent in the Conservatives' favour. Since December, when both polling firms were last in the field, the Liberals have lost one point in Campaign Research's polling and four percentage points in the Ipsos poll, while the party is down five points since November in the Léger poll.

The Conservatives have gained two to three points over that time.

The only shift that appears statistically significant is the five-point Liberal slide recorded by Léger — but the fact that all three polling firms are picking up similar trends suggests that the swing between the Conservatives and Liberals is real.

SNC-Lavalin wearing on Trudeau

Campaign Research also picked up a drop of four points in Trudeau's own approval rating (to 35 per cent), while Ipsos found the number of respondents saying the Liberals deserve to be re-elected has plummeted eight points since December to 38 per cent.

Léger reports satisfaction with the government is down nine points and Trudeau's own score on Canadians' preference for prime minister is down seven points to 26 per cent. That this drop did not result in any sizeable gain for any of his opponents suggests it's more about Trudeau himself than it is about the performance of any other party leader.

The Léger/Canadian Press poll provides some indications of the impact of the SNC-Lavalin affair in particular. The poll finds that Canadians are paying attention, with 67 per cent reporting some awareness of the story.

Of those with some knowledge of the controversy, 41 per cent agreed with this statement: ""Yes, the prime minister did something wrong."" Only 12 per cent said that the prime minister ""did not do anything wrong.""

Another 41 per cent said that they were ""not sure either way,"" suggesting that many Canadians are still waiting to learn more before coming down on one side or the other. That might be the silver lining here for the Liberals: most Canadians polled either believe the prime minister or are still giving him the benefit of the doubt.

But it also means that if the story generates more negative headlines for the government (and there are few indications so far that it won't), there aren't very many Canadians predisposed to believe the Liberals' side of the story.

Liberals hurting in Quebec, but mostly Ontario

While the impact of the affair has sapped the Liberals in every part of the country, there is a difference between what the polls are saying in the two largest provinces that inevitably will decide the next federal election.

Across the three surveys, the Conservatives made gains in both Ontario and Quebec while the Liberals lost support. (The NDP also is down consistently in Quebec and the Bloc Québécois up, but that was a pre-existing trend that probably has little to do with the SNC-Lavalin affair.)

The swing was more pronounced in Ontario than it was in Quebec, where concerns about the impact of the affair on SNC-Lavalin's future have been more prevalent. The Conservatives gained between three and six points in Ontario in the three surveys, averaging a gain of just under five points. The Liberals lost between three and seven points, for an average loss of just over five points.

Both Ipsos and Léger recorded slides for the Liberals in Ontario sizeable enough to be statistically significant.

In Quebec, however, the Conservative gain was only three to four points, with the Liberals dropping two to four — all within what would be the margin of error for probabilistic samples of the sizes surveyed in the province.

The trend is pointing in one direction, which is notable. But so far, the impact in Quebec seems less pronounced. Both Léger and Ipsos still give the Liberals a double-digit lead in Quebec, while the race is now either tied or leaning Conservative in Ontario.

That could have some important electoral implications if the trends hold. As it stands now, the Liberals are still projected to gain seats in Quebec — perhaps about a dozen — but are also on track to lose as many as 30 in Ontario. Even if the Liberal slide in support halts, that alone would make it nearly impossible for Trudeau to secure another majority government in the fall.

Of course, October's federal election is a long way off. The SNC-Lavalin story and the polling trends might change (and change again, and again) between now and then. But based on where the story and the trends are heading now, the Liberals have to hope for a swing back in their direction.",First post-SNC-Lavalin polls look bad for Trudeau Liberals,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-polls-snclavalin-1.5026798

The problem is the Liberal government is standing in the way. What's a government to do?

The question at the centre of this saga is whether former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was pressured by anyone in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to seek a deferred prosecution agreement in the criminal case involving Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been unequivocal in his answer. It's just that he's been answering a different question: No one directedher to secure a particular resolution.

But did anyone pressure her?

No one ""directed"" her.

Don't be confused. Ever since that unambiguous denial of a question that wasn't asked, the government's line on the matter has been consistent and clear: We would like to tell you more, but we simply can't, because we are choosing not to.

Solicitor-client privilege​

Last week, the Liberal majority on the Commons justice committee blocked efforts to call relevant witnesses — including Wilson-Raybould and PMO senior advisers Gerald Butts (who resigned Monday) and Mathieu Bouchard — before the committee. Expanding the witness list to those who were actually involved in the pertinent conversations would be akin to a ""witch hunt"" and a ""fishing expedition,"" explained Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault.

Instead, the committee would be calling legal experts, civil servants and the current attorney general, David Lametti, who had already said he has no direct knowledge of conversations between Wilson-Raybould and the PMO. The committee has not called anyone who can speak to the colour of the paint on the wall where these conversations took place, but alas, there is still time to add more witnesses. (Indeed, the committee eventually relented to calling Wilson-Raybould to testify after all.)

Michael Wernick the Clerk of the Privy Council spoke to the Commons Justice committee Thursday 0:27

Proceedings began on Thursday, when Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick testified that the conversations with Wilson-Raybould about SNC-Lavalin were lawful and appropriate. He repeated the prime minister's line that if she felt pressure — due to the multiple conversations in which it was emphasized that the wrong decision on the matter could have dire economic consequences in Quebec — she should have reported it to the ethics commissioner.

Wilson-Raybould has not been able to publicly give her side of the story because, as she has noted previously, she is bound by solicitor-client privilege. The prime minister can waive that privilege should he choose, but he has not for a reason he has not coherently articulated other than to say he is discussing the matter with the current attorney general. During his testimony Thursday, Lametti was tight-lipped about his efforts on the matter, saying he himself is bound by solicitor-client privilege.

Now, the Liberals have been clear that they want to get to the bottom of this. It's just that all of the ways that have been proposed are not the correct ways to do so. They include a motion tabled by NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus calling for a public inquiry on the matter and for the prime minister to waive privilege to allow Wilson-Raybould to speak. All but two Liberals voted against the motion Wednesday.

Earlier that day, Wilson-Raybould reportedly told cabinet, according to a Globe and Mail source, that she experienced inappropriate pressure from the PMO on SNC-Lavalin. Meaning that, within the span of a few hours, cabinet reportedly heard from Wilson-Raybould that she was improperly pressured, then voted against a motion to allow her to say that publicly.

Move to Veterans Affairs

There are questions the prime minister may answer on the matter that don't involve privilege or require him to speak directly on SNC-Lavalin's criminal case. They include why Wilson-Raybould was moved from the Justice Department to Veterans Affairs even though other ministers maintained their posts during the last cabinet shuffle.

The prime minister has noted there are a ""range of factors"" that go into any decision to move a minister, but did not elaborate on the particular factors in Wilson-Raybould's case. There is no directive that requires Trudeau to keep this information confidential, but it nevertheless appears he is constrained by the parliamentary convention colloquially known as ""I'm Not Telling You Anything Else Because I Don't Want To.""

Indeed, if you trust the Liberals' words instead of their actions, it is clear they want to fulfil their promise of transparency; to free up Wilson-Raybould to ""speak my truth,"" as she requested in the House this week; to call upon all the relevant witnesses to testify; to allow a full and thorough public investigation. The problem is, the Liberals keep getting in the way. Alas, what is a Liberal government to do?

316,Empty,2019-02-24T09:00:00Z,Monday's federal byelections should shine a spotlight on some of the big themes of this election year.,"There's always something to learn from byelections. For starters, Jagmeet Singh will find out whether he has a future as the leader of the NDP.

But the results of all three of today's byelection contests also will shine a spotlight on some of the key dynamics that could decide the 2019 federal election.

Local factors always play a significant role in byelections, making it hazardous to draw overly broad conclusions from the results. But they're still instructive.

We know, for example, that how a party performs in byelections offers clues to how they might fare in subsequent general elections, that prime ministers with better byelection records have a higher chance of staying in office and that these seemingly minor affairs can have enormous historical significance.

There's certainly the potential for some drama tonight.

Singh is staking his leadership on the voters of Burnaby South, a riding in British Columbia's Lower Mainland. The area has voted for the NDP in every election since 2004 and even has a history of electing NDP leaders in need of a seat: Tommy Douglas won here in a 1962 byelection after he failed to secure a seat in his native Saskatchewan. Singh, a former Ontario MPP, is hoping to be offered the same hospitality.

If he doesn't get it, his days as leader of the NDP are likely to be numbered.

Can Singh put a halt to the NDP's struggles?

It speaks to a larger problem for the New Democrats. The party has made little headway since Singh became leader in October 2017. It's been dropping in the polls and now sits at just 14 per cent in the CBC Poll Tracker — a result which, if replicated on election night, would be the worst result for the party in nearly 20 years.

Singh's approval rating is in the red and he stacks up poorly against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer on the question of who Canadians would prefer in the top job.

This has a wider impact on the electoral landscape. The Conservatives have a tough time winning elections when the NDP is weak.

Expectations are that Singh will win in Burnaby South. His party has poured its meagre resources into the riding and Singh — who has taken up residence in Burnaby — has been campaigning there for months.

There's no telling what impact a defeat there would have on the NDP. It could send the party into a tailspin from which it couldn't recover in time for the fall election. Or the party could install an interim leader with better prospects.

How to follow tonight's byelection results

Join us for results and analysis on a live Power & Politics byelections special, hosted by VassyKapelos and Éric Grenier, starting at 10 p.m. ET on cbc.ca, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. You can also follow results on a special edition of The National with Ian Hanomansing on CBC Television and CBC News Network - and check for updated results stories throughout the evening at cbc.ca/politics

With that kind of uncertainty looming over the party, the New Democrats might be satisfied with a win of any kind. The party needs some good news. If Singh can secure the seat by a comfortable margin, it could be the signal needed to give the NDP hope that the rest of the year will be better.

A squeaker of a win, however, would only mean that a lot of work remains to be done before the NDP starts seeing some light at the end of the tunnel — and the Conservatives start breathing easier.

Battleground GTA - if Bernier doesn't get in the way

The Conservatives are unlikely to lose any sleep over York–Simcoe, a riding located north of Toronto. It has been a safe seat for the party ever since the right was united in 2003. The Conservatives won it by 45 points in 2011 when Stephen Harper secured a Conservative majority government. They still held it by 12 points in 2015 when Harper went down to defeat.

While it's a more sprawling riding than many of those located throughout the Greater Toronto Area, it's still only a stone's throw away from some of the seats that decide every federal election. So while the results might not be emblematic of the battles that will be fought between the Liberals and the Conservatives in the GTA in the fall, they might still give us a clue to just how hamstrung the Conservatives could be in the region by Maxime Bernier.

Andrew Scheer's Conservatives are expected to hold the Ontario riding of York–Simcoe, but it's the results for Maxime Bernier's People's Party that will offer clues to how likely the Conservatives are to make gains in the rest of the Greater Toronto Area. (Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press)

The runner-up in 2017's Conservative leadership race still has a long way to go before his People's Party is in a position to challenge for anything but Bernier's own seat in the Beauce region of Quebec. The Poll Tracker pegs support for the PPC at just 2.5 per cent nationally.

But Bernier could still have a significant impact on the Conservatives' chances of winning seats in key regions of the country — such as the GTA.

A recent Innovative Research Group poll gave the PPC five per cent support in the suburban GTA. With Liberal support slipping in Ontario in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin affair, a lot of their seats in the GTA are up for grabs. But fewer of them will flip over to Scheer's party if Bernier scoops up five per cent of the vote that otherwise would have gone to Conservative candidates.

The results in York–Simcoe will be a good gauge of just how much of a complication the People's Party will prove to be for Scheer in October.

Quebec and the Liberal path to re-election

If the Conservatives are banking on the GTA to propel them back to power (and are hoping Bernier stays out of the way), the Liberals are looking to Quebec to keep themselves in office.

The New Democrats won 16 seats in Quebec in the 2015 federal election. With their support in the province plummeting to just 8.9 per cent, according to the CBC Poll Tracker, the party is on track to lose every single one of them.

The Liberals are counting on that; they need gains in Quebec to offset expected losses in places like New Brunswick and Ontario. With 38.3 per cent support and a 17-percentage point lead over the Conservatives in the province, the Liberals are well-positioned to win most of those 16 seats.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is counting on Quebec to help him secure re-election in the fall. That plan starts with Outremont on Monday. (Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press)

Outremont would be high on that list of potential pick-ups. Prior to Tom Mulcair's breakthrough there in 2007, the riding was a Liberal stronghold. It's also the type of urban, diverse riding the Liberals tend to hold throughout the country.

An NDP win would be a tremendous upset and a signal that the Liberal plan for re-election is in big trouble. So Trudeau doesn't simply need to win Outremont — he needs his party to win it with a crushing margin. The provincial polls suggest that the Liberals should win the riding easily. They'll want to see a big number there, and a small one for Singh's NDP.

They'd also like to see middling numbers for the Bloc Québécois, which is enjoying an uptick of its own under new leader Yves-François Blanchet. The Bloc was the perennial rival of the Liberals in Outremont before its collapse in 2011.

So when the results of Monday's three federal byelections start to come in, don't just look at who won and who lost. The implications might go far beyond that. In an election year, every tea leaf tells a story.

318,Empty,2019-02-22T13:36:00Z,"Keep an eye on BlackBerry, Ambarella, and NVIDIA over the coming weeks.","Even the most groundbreaking, innovative technology can take decades to enter the mainstream. Yet the massive potential market for driverless cars, combined with rapid recent advancements in hardware, have helped convince hundreds of companies to target this nascent industry niche.

Below, we'll highlight just a few of those entities that deserve investor attention right now. Read on to see why Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA), BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) are worth following over the coming weeks.

A computer-vision specialist

Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Ambarella): Investor sentiment turned negative against many small tech companies at the end of 2018 and helped push Ambarella shares sharply lower for the year. It didn't help that the semiconductor specialist, which produces low-power video compression hardware for miniature cameras, has seen sales growth grind to a halt while profitability declined in the last three quarters. Management's outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter isn't optimistic, either, with revenue set to slump by 29%.

Those low expectations could set shareholders up for gains when the company reports earnings results on March 1. CEO Fermi Wang and his team may highlight some good news, such as progress at securing a bigger client base for Ambarella's second generation of computer vision chips.

Early market share wins in this potentially booming industry would mark an important first step. However, Ambarella isn't likely to reverse its recent stock price slide until the company secures bigger avenues for growth and can raise prices to reflect its design innovation leadership. Investors will have a better idea about those trends when they see the 2019 sales and profitability outlook management will issue in the March report.

A bet on branded car tech

Jamal Carnette, CFA (BlackBerry): While it's simple to think of driverless cars as an all-or-nothing proposition, the reality is that vehicles are on a continuum from fully human operated to truly unmanned. In between these extremes are various features as mundane as cruise control and handsfree systems and as complicated as unassisted maneuvering and path tracking. BlackBerry's QNX technology has a strong foothold in this market, as its software/operating system (OS) is in more than 120 million cars across more than a dozen car brands performing many or all of these functions.

CEO John Chen has doubled down on cybersecurity and automotive applications as the company's focal points, specifically autonomous vehicles for the latter. Last quarter the company reported QNX had four design wins (a fancy way to say the automaker initially chose QNX) in advanced driver-assistance systems. Recently the company partnered with a Canadian start-up -- LeddarTech -- to provide the OS for LeddarTech's LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) platform.

The company is also seeing financial results from its QNX car-tech focus. Last quarter, BlackBerry's technology solutions division reported 23% year-over-year growth owing to its automotive vertical. Despite the green shoots of success, the company is not resting on its laurels in autonomous vehicles as it did with smartphones and has a huge backer in the form of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau; BlackBerry is getting a CA$40 million grant from the Canadian government to develop next-gen technologies that will power autonomous cars.

BlackBerry's QNX is already a mainstay in automobiles, and the company is looking to leverage those relationships to become the de facto plug-and-play OS in autonomous vehicles, akin to Alphabet's Android in smartphones. Investors who believe driverless cars are the next big thing would be wise to put the company on their watch lists and follow this industry closely.

A beaten-down chipmaker

Leo Sun (NVIDIA): NVIDIA lost about 40% of its value over the past six months over concerns about slowing sales of its data center and gaming GPUs. NVIDIA attributed those declines to three causes: the end of the cryptocurrency boom, which flooded the market with cheap GPUs; softer demand in China; and weak sales of its new Turing-based GPUs.



NVIDIA's revenue plunged 24% annually last quarter, but it allayed some of those fears with a forecast for flat to slightly negative sales growth in fiscal 2020 -- which was slightly better than the consensus forecast for a 5% decline.

NVIDIA is best known for its gaming GPUs, but its Tegra CPUs also power cars. NVIDIA currently supplies over 370 Drive partners -- including automakers, suppliers, and service providers -- with its driverless technologies. Its Drive PX, PX 2, PX Xavier, and PX Pegasus platforms all let automakers add driverless capabilities to their cars by plugging in an onboard computer.

NVIDIA's Automotive revenues rose 23% annually to $163 million last quarter. That accounted for only 7% of the chipmaker's top line, but it helped its data center and professional visualization businesses partly offset a 45% plunge in gaming revenues.

During the quarter, NVIDIA launched Drive AutoPilot, the world's ""first commercially available Level 2+ automated driving system."" It also announced a new partnership with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz to create a ""centralized computing architecture"" for next-gen AI-controlled vehicles.

These moves could widen NVIDIA's moat against Intel, which became a major player in the automotive market after its takeover of Mobileye, which provides ADAS (advanced driver assistance system) solutions to about 90% of the world's automakers. Looking ahead, investors should see if NVIDIA's auto business can keep expanding as the chipmaker tries to turn around its core gaming business.",3 Top Driverless Car Stocks to Watch in February,Fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/02/22/3-top-driverless-car-stocks-to-watch-in.aspx

James McCarten, The Canadian Press





WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Donald Trump's senior economic adviser gave Canada and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau a symbolic pat on the back Sunday for how the federal government has been ""hanging tough"" on the diplomatically delicate extradition case of senior Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou.

Larry Kudlow said he's ""proud"" of how Canada has handled the Meng matter -- a tacit acknowledgment of the diplomatic bind the U.S. Justice Department created for the federal Liberals in December when they asked that the chief financial officer and telecom scion be arrested and held in Vancouver, pending extradition.

Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, is at the centre of a sprawling U.S. indictment unsealed last month that accuses the growing tech juggernaut of misrepresenting its ownership of a Hong Kong-based subsidiary between 2007 and 2017 to circumvent U.S. sanctions against Iran. She and the company are facing 13 counts of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice.

""I'll just say how proud I am of Prime Minister Trudeau, and Canada, for hanging tough on Huawei,"" said Kudlow, director of the U.S. National Economic Council.

He acknowledged the grief the case has caused Canada since Meng, who remains under house arrest in Vancouver pending an extradition hearing, was detained at the city's airport in early December: two Canadians have since been detained in China, ostensibly for national security reasons, while a third -- convicted by a Chinese court of drug trafficking -- is facing the death penalty.

""That's why I'm so I'm so proud of Prime Minister Trudeau for staying with the rule of law and assisting the United States. I'm very proud of him.""

Kudlow made the comments following an appearance on a free-trade panel at the winter meeting of the National Governors Association in Washington alongside federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau. And it wasn't the only instance that he dropped the prime minister's name.

As world leaders were gathering last year in Argentina, where Trump, Trudeau and former Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto signed the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the prime minister approached Kudlow in an effort to move past the animosity that had erupted six months earlier at the G7 meetings in June in Quebec.

Trump, apparently piqued by Trudeau's hard-line rhetoric on tariffs and trade, unleashed a Twitter tirade that denounced the prime minister as ""dishonest"" and ""weak,"" refusing in the end to sign on to the agreed-upon end-of-summit communique. Kudlow called Trudeau's comments a ""betrayal,"" while U.S. trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested he deserved a ""special place in hell.""

The dust-up left Canada-U.S. relations, already strained over the ongoing NAFTA talks and a burgeoning cross-border tariff war, at their lowest point in recent memory -- until Trudeau crossed the corridor to reach out to Kudlow.

""He came up to me -- this is a true story -- after the USMCA ceremony, he walked across the hall to come up and grab my hand and give me a hug,"" Kudlow said. ""I asked him if we could please turn the page on any of that stuff that occurred last spring, and he said, 'Absolutely,' and then we started having some policy discussions.

""Justin just grabbed my hand and gave me a bear hug, and I was thrilled.""

Asked whether the animosity has similarly diminished between the two leaders, Kudlow said: ""I think it's partly happened.""

On Friday, Trump himself floated the possibility -- again -- that the U.S. could drop criminal charges against Huawei, as the president wrapped up two days of negotiations at the White House aimed at resolving America's own ongoing trade dispute with China.

""We're going to be discussing all of that during the course of the next couple of weeks,"" Trump said at the White House during an Oval Office meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping's special envoy, Vice Premier Liu He.

""We'll be talking to the U.S. attorneys. We'll be talking to the attorney general. We'll be making that decision. Right now, it's not something we've discussed.""

Late Sunday, Trump announced he would hold off on a dramatic spike in tariffs on Chinese exports, originally scheduled for Friday, pending the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks that he said on Twitter have ""made substantial progress.""

""Assuming both sides make additional progress, we will be planning a Summit for President Xi and myself at Mar-a-Lago to conclude an agreement.""","Trump adviser Kudlow 'proud' of Canada, Trudeau, for approach to Huawei case - CTV News",Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/trump-adviser-kudlow-proud-of-canada-trudeau-for-approach-to-huawei-case-1.4310520

The scandal, over whether the prime minister’s office pressured its justice ministry to help a Quebec firm facing fraud charges, has consumed the nation for the past two weeks. Each detail that has dripped into the public domain has generated multiple opinion columns and dominated airwaves.

Part of that scrutiny owes to the federal electoral season – with the opposition seizing on any whiff of Mr. Trudeau tainting the rule of law as the nation heads to the polls this fall. But it’s also captured public attention because it seems to stand in opposition to everything that Trudeau, and the Canada he represents, stands for: a respite to the pressures squeezing the rule of law, human rights, and liberal values in the rest of the world.

When Trudeau was propelled into power, it was his brand as a fresh and youthful face, positive politics, and a new and more transparent way of governance that drew the electorate to him. While more than three years of decisionmaking at the top has necessarily damaged his “real change” brand, he remains a beacon for many middle-power countries in the world, especially as the United States under President Trump has put into question the American commitment to a rules-based, international order.

Now Trudeau faces charges that his government is, essentially, just like everybody else’s.

A WOMAN BORN TO NOBLE PEOPLE

The scandal began after The Globe and Mail published a report earlier this month that alleged that the prime minister’s office put pressure on Jody Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister to help SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution for its dealings in Libya. According to the newspaper, she resisted. She was demoted to veterans affairs minister in January and has since resigned – without revealing anything about why, citing solicitor-client privilege.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould is a powerful symbol of Trudeau’s branding. She both personified his pledge to build a new relationship with indigenous people in Canada as a historic reconciliation and his commitment to gender equality.

And while the main issue that could damage Trudeau concerns the rule of law, Alex Marland, author of “Brand Command: Canadian Politics and Democracy in the Age of Message Control,” says that gender and race add to the scandal at a sensitive moment.

“If the attorney general happened to be a white guy, to what extent would the story be an issue? It would still be an issue,” he says. “It’s just that because it happens to be an indigenous woman and this particular prime minister – and not even just the prime minister, it’s just the nature of society at the moment. It’s really a sensitive thing to have a white man and a prime minister demote an indigenous woman, especially in Canada where we’re going through this period of reconciliation.”

When the scandal broke, Trudeau immediately said he did not “direct” Wilson-Raybould to reach an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin, which faces charges of fraud and corruption. The firm employs 9,000 people in Quebec, a province that will be crucial for the Liberals in the election. But Trudeau’s carefully constructed statement only led to speculation that he was engaging in a semantics game because the government had something to hide. He tried to stifle it by saying her continued presence in his cabinet spoke for itself. The next day she stepped down, signing her resignation “Puglaas,” her name in her native Kwak’wala language, which means “a woman born to noble people.”

Days later Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s longtime friend and influential principal secretary, resigned. In his letter he said there was no untoward pressure placed on Wilson-Raybould, but his resignation only turned up the speculation.

It was only in testimony in the House of Commons justice committee last week that Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council of Canada, shed some light on a basic timeline of meetings that have taken place. He essentially admitted a degree of pressure placed on the justice minister but said that it wasn’t inappropriate.",A murky scandal threatens to mar Trudeau's – and Canada's – good names,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/murky-scandal-threatens-mar-trudeaus-canadas-good-names-220949695.html

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Canada is looking at ways to bring over relatives of a Syrian refugee who lost her children in a house fire.

Kawthar Barho's seven children died in an early morning fire in the Canadian city of Halifax on Tuesday.

Her husband sustained life-threatening injuries in the fire.

The family had come to Canada after fleeing their home in Raqqa, which had been taken over by the group known as Islamic State.

Ms Barho, 30, has no other family in the country.

Mr Trudeau told reporters on Thursday in Halifax that the federal immigration minister is giving personal attention to the case and seeing what can be done within the system to bring over some of her family members to bring ""some solace in this tragedy"".

""In heartbreaking cases like this we're certainly looking at doing what we can to bring this family, which has suffered such a devastating loss, together,"" he said.

There has been an outpouring of support for the parents in the wake of the tragedy, including a vigil on Wednesday evening attended by the prime minister.

An online fundraiser for the Syrian couple has also raised over C$440,000 ($330,000; £255,000) in two days.

The youngest Barho child was just four months old and the oldest was 15.

The funeral for the children will be held at a local mosque the family attended.

The family had been privately sponsored to come to Canada by a local refugee resettlement group.

""For the past year and a half, the children have been able to enjoy life as kids should be able to: going to school, riding bicycles, swimming, having friends, running in the yard, celebrating birthday parties and hanging out with the neighbours on their porch swing,"" the organisation wrote in a Facebook post.

""They loved every minute of it, and it seems impossible we won't hear their laughter and feel their hugs again.""

Authorities say it took about an hour to get the flames under control when fire and emergency services arrived on the scene in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

Fire crews said the fire quickly engulfed the first and second floors of the building.

The two-storey home was completely gutted by the fire.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s personal approval ratings are down; a declining number of Canadians think his government deserves re-election; and Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives narrowly lead the Liberals on the ballot box question.

“This is the worst couple of weeks the PM has had since the India trip,” said Darrell Bricker, CEO of polling firm Ipsos. “The biggest problem is that it hits at what gives the Liberal Party its appeal: the prime minister.”

READ MORE: Charges against SNC-Lavalin explained — and how the PMO allegedly got involved

Ipsos was in the field last week, after revelations surfaced that, last fall, while she was justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould felt that unnamed individuals in the prime minister’s office were pressuring her to intervene in a criminal court case in favour of Quebec-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Those allegations were first reported by the Globe and Mail, citing unnamed sources.

If she did feel pressured, she did not act and did not intervene on behalf of SNC-Lavalin. But a few months later, she was shuffled out of her job as justice minister and attorney general and into the job of veterans affairs minister.

Then, last week, as Liberals themselves seemed divided over the optics of seeing the country’s first-ever Indigenous justice minister being shuffled aside for what appeared to be craven political calculations, Wilson-Raybould stepped down from cabinet altogether.

Meanwhile, all through the week, Trudeau and other Liberals struggled to explain what had happened while Wilson-Raybould announced she had retained a former Supreme Court justice to provide her with advice about what, if anything, she might say about the whole matter.

Voters took notice.

Ipsos found that, among the 1,002 Canadians it surveyed online from Thursday through to Monday, nearly half or 49 per cent said they were aware of this rapidly shifting story involving SNC Lavalin, Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould.

And it appears many are changing their opinion of the government as a result.

READ MORE: Justin Trudeau’s top adviser Gerald Butts resigns amid SNC-Lavalin affair

Support for the Trudeau Liberals is now at 34 per cent of decided and leaning voters, down four percentage points from a poll Ipsos did in December. In the 2015 election, the Trudeau Liberals won their commanding majority with 39 per cent of the vote.

Scheer’s Conservatives appear to have benefited from this slide. That party is now at 36 per cent support, up three points since the end of 2018.

“The big trouble spot is now Ontario, where the Tories have a six point lead over the Liberals,” said Bricker. “The way the vote breaks in Ontario suggests that the Tories are doing well in the 905, where the Liberals won their majority in 2015.”

The NDP and its leader Jagmeet Singh, meanwhile, continue to languish, with 17 per cent support right now versus 18 per cent at year-end.

The poll was out of the field before Monday afternoon’s bombshell news that Gerald Butts had quit his post as the prime minister’s principal secretary. Butts, one of Trudeau’s closest friends, had played a critical role in the revival of Liberal fortune and was, along with Trudeau’s chief of staff Katie Telford, central to Trudeau administration. Butts said he had done nothing wrong but was resigning to avoid being a further distraction to the government’s agenda.

In any event, Ipsos found that even before that additional turmoil, voter approval of the Trudeau government had dropped nine points since the beginning of the year down to 42 per cent in its most recent pulse-taking.

Trudeau’s own personal approval rating is now two points lower than it was after his disastrous trip to India this time last year.

“Those who strongly disapprove of his performance now outnumber those who strongly approve by a margin of four to one,” Bricker said.

And yet, Trudeau is still doing better than his two main rivals, Scheer and Singh, who continue to have lower approval ratings than Trudeau.

“All is not bad for Trudeau,” Bricker said. “When assessed head to head with his major rivals, Scheer and Singh, he still does well on specific leadership attributes. Although the gap appears to be closing now.”

And just 38 per cent of those surveyed believe the Trudeau Liberals deserve re-election, while 62 per cent agreed that it was time to give another party a chance at governing.

A margin-of-error could not be calculated for this poll as the sample surveyed was not drawn randomly. That said, Ipsos says the accuracy of its polls can be gauged using a statistical measure known as a credibility interval.

READ MORE: Trump says ‘good chance’ trade deal can be struck with China

RCMP arrested Meng Wanzhou at Vancouver’s airport in December at request of the U.S., which is seeking her extradition on fraud charges, and Trudeau has repeatedly said that the government will not interfere in the process.

Nine days after Meng’s arrest, China detained two Canadians on allegations that they were endangering the country’s national security. It also increased another Canadian’s sentence on drug trafficking charges from 15 years to the death penalty.

China has not linked the moves to Meng’s detention, but the fallout has nonetheless been a diplomatic chill between Canada and China in recent months.

Kudlow acknowledged as much on Sunday, saying he appreciates the Canadian government sticking to its guns by not allowing Meng — or the detained Canadians — to become bargaining chips in wider trade discussions.

“Is it part of the overall trade landscape, if you will? Yes. But it’s principally a legal matter and not a trade matter,” Kudlow said.

“That’s why I’m so I’m so proud of Prime Minister Trudeau for staying with the rule of law and assisting the United States. I’m very proud of him.”

On Friday, Trump himself raised the possibility that the U.S. could drop criminal charges against Huawei, as the president wrapped up two days of negotiations at the White House aimed at resolving America’s own ongoing trade dispute with China.

The notes are being sought by the legal team defending the former vice chief of the defence staff against a single charge of breach of trust. Norman is accused of leaking cabinet secrets in relation to a shipbuilding deal.

The subpoenas were issued by the court at the request of Toronto lawyer Marie Henein, who is preparing a motion to dismiss the case on the basis of alleged political interference.

The court order for notes includes both the prime minister and Butts, and also Trudeau's Chief of Staff Katie Telford, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick and Zita Astravas, chief of staff to Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan.

Henein told the court Friday she views obtaining those notes as a ""high priority"" for the defence.

""These requests have been outstanding for some time,"" she said. ""I just want to make sure we're moving to the top of list the material that may be relevant to the abuse of process motion.""

Justice Heather Perkins-McVey noted that Wernick ""has been quite busy this week"" — a reference to the clerk's testimony Thursday before the House of Commons justice committee, which is investigating allegations of political interference in the prosecution of SNC Lavalin.

At a pretrial hearing on Friday, the Department of Justice indicated officials are still in the process of collecting the notes and could not say when they will be turned over.

""We've made it a priority, along with some other priority tasks,"" said Robert MacKinnon, the Department of Justice lawyer who is shepherding the disclosure of federal government documents. ""I think you can appreciate everyone is working at full speed.""

Focused request

Henein asked the court last October to force the government to deliver up communications between the Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council, which supports and advises Trudeau.

The demand for documents was narrowed on Feb. 1 after Astravas testified at the pretrial hearing last month that she could not recall the substance of any conversations within the PMO about the Norman case while she was a senior official there.

The former commander of the navy is accused of leaking cabinet secrets related to a $668 million shipbuilding deal in 2015. He is one of two people charged in the case; federal procurement official Matthew Matchett also faces a single count of breach of trust.

Henein will present a motion to dismiss the case — citing abuse of process — at the end of March.

Many of the documents being sought by the defence — including items of witness evidence — have not been fully disclosed.

The RCMP conducted many of its interviews in the winter and spring of 2016, two years before Norman was charged. The Crown is obliged to disclose documents and notes the witnesses relied on in giving their statements to police.

The process, however, has been hung up because the government is worried the notes may reveal cabinet secrets. Justice Perkins-McVey has said it's ""baffling"" that the Crown still has not produced the records.

Cases Intersect

Norman's lawyers alleged political interference in the case earlier this month, claiming the Crown had inappropriate conversations with the top lawyer in the Privy Council Office, which supports and advises the prime minister.

The director of public prosecutions vehemently denied the claim in an extraordinary public statement on Feb. 12.

The issue of prosecutorial independence strikes at the heart of the justice system and has been the key factor in the controversy involving SNC Lavalin and former justice minister Jody-Wilson-Raybould.

Wernick, testifying before the House of Commons justice committee on Thursday, tacitly acknowledged both the Norman and SNC cases intersect over the claims of Crown separation.

He twice cited the prosecution of the former vice chief of the defence staff and attempted to assure MPs that the justice system remains solid.

""There is a statutory legal force field around the prosecution function in Canada,"" Wernick said ""We have the strongest protection of independent prosecution that I can think of.

If there ever was a deal to earn Jody Wilson-Raybould‘s silence in the SNC-Lavalin affair as some cynically pondered — specifically, she gets Gerry Butts‘s head on a platter in return for her going easy on the government when she finally speaks — it blew up in spectacular fashion Wednesday.

First, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appeared to extend an offer of peace to Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from cabinet after allegations surfaced that while she was attorney general the PMO had tried but failed to pressure her to help SNC-Lavalin avoid a fraud trial. Trudeau apologized to her, both in a caucus meeting and standing before reporters, for not being “quick enough to condemn, in unequivocal terms, the comments and commentary and cartoons made about her last week.” (CTV News)

Then Trudeau congenially called for an “airing on this situation” so Canadians can “hear the different perspectives in this situation,” a reference to Wilson-Raybould’s expected appearance next week before a parliamentary justice committee. (Canadian Press)

(Side note: even Trudeau seems lost as to where we are in this story, not to mention Wilson-Raybould’s status in the party: “Obviously, she had asked to speak to her fellow, er, her former caucus, sorry, cabinet members, colleagues, and that’s exactly what she did,” he stumbled during a scrum with media.)

Ah, but then in the House Trudeau joined most (but not all) Liberals in voting down an NDP motion that urged the government to launch a public inquiry into the allegations, and for Trudeau to waive solicitor-client privilege so Wilson-Raybould can speak openly about what went down between her and the PMO last year. (The two Liberals to side with the opposition were Nathaniel Erskine-Smith and Wayne Long).

Part way through the voting, Wilson-Raybould rose to share some of her different perspective with the House. After making note of the fact she was abstaining from voting on the motion and amendments because they involved her (she didn’t need to point out that Trudeau wasn’t abstaining, the opposition did that for her) Wilson-Raybould lobbed the steaming spud back to the Prime Minister: “I understand fully that Canadians want to know the truth and want transparency; privilege and confidentiality are not mine to waive and I hope that I have the opportunity to speak my truth.” (Global News)

Cue standing ovation. By the opposition. For a Liberal MP. While the rest of the Liberals sat on their hands.

For what it’s worth — and no one else seems to be claiming to have seen this and perhaps the eye sees what the mind wants it to and it would be a stunning lack of self-awareness if true, but… — after Wilson-Raybould rose to speak, Conservative MP Michelle Rempel tweeted that Trudeau looked at Liberal MP Carla Qualtrough “and both give her a mocking look and shake their heads in disgust.” Alas, no instant replay exists since the pool cameras in the House were fixed on Wilson-Raybould as she spoke, as per the rules. (Twitter)

Anyway, the justice committee hearings are expected to start today. Up first, current Attorney General David Lametti, his deputy Nathalie Drouin, and Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council. (CBC News)

Hey, you know what would help change the subject right about now? A budget. Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced a date of March 19 for the Trudeau government’s last budget before the federal election. While promising to be “fiscally responsible” he indicated the budget will address skills training, millennial housing needs, pharmacare and support for seniors. (Canadian Press)

John Geddes looks the question of what more Morneau can promise on the skills training front, given the government has already promised so much yet delivered so little. (Maclean’s)

In a note apparently to everyone on social media who’d been clamouring for former Conservative MP Tony Clement to resume his sharing ways, Clement returned to Instagram Wednesday and thanked his followers “for allowing me time away from social media as I get my life back in order.” His Twitter and Facebook followers will have to wait, as Clement hasn’t posted any updates since he was booted from the Conservative caucus after sending sexually explicit photos of himself to extortionists.

Worldwide, Canada is held in high regard, due in large part to generations of goodwill, upholding the ideals of human dignity, our unique British and French legal heritage, and enforcement of the rule of law. The rule of law means that there is one law for all and that no one is favoured — especially the powerful and influential at the expense of everyone else.

Canada’s well-deserved reputation is now in jeopardy, as Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin, accused of criminal wrongdoing, appears to be receiving special treatment from the Trudeau government.

Now, the news is swirling about the resignation from cabinet of former justice minister and attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said recently: “The government of Canada did its job and to the clear public standards expected of it.”

But Canadians have questions. What are those standards? What are the criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin? What is a remediation agreement? Why do the Conservative and NDP members on the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice want to hear testimony from all involved under oath? Why is Opposition leader Andrew Scheer demanding disclosure of information and preservation of documents?

As an experienced lawyer and former cabinet minister, I can provide answers to some of these questions. The larger questions, however, must be answered by Trudeau, his cabinet colleagues and his staff.

The standards have been set by the Supreme Court of Canada. Attorneys general must act independently of political pressures when exercising their delegated sovereign authority to initiate, continue or terminate prosecutions.

Justice Marc Rosenberg further summarized them in the “Shawcross” doctrine. Prosecution decisions taken by an attorney general require her to take into account the public interest, allow for her consultation with cabinet colleagues (covered by cabinet confidentiality in any event), but draws the line at taking cabinet or prime minister direction, and specifically does not allow government to put any pressure on an attorney general for political reasons.

The criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin and many of its executives go back several years and have included paying up to $160 million in bribes to government officials to obtain contracts in Libya. Similar previous charges were brought regarding a project in Bangladesh. Several company executives and implicated Canadian public servants have already been convicted or pled guilty to corruption offences.

In 2015, charges were laid against the company itself, and it has publicly claimed the resulting loss of billions of dollars in contracts and share value. If convicted, the company could face a 10-year ban on winning any federal government contracts and a similar ban on any projects financed through the World Bank.

What is a remediation agreement? First, although it is now law, I have seen little comment on how this legislation was passed a mere five months ago. When this legislation came into force as part of an omnibus bill, many in Ottawa referred to it as the “SNC-Lavalin bill.”

For the first time, prosecutors may enter into formal agreements with organizations that self-report wrongdoing or stand accused of having committed crimes, as an alternative to prosecution.

These crimes can be serious, such as bribery, money laundering, theft, forgery or fraud. Criminal prosecution is suspended pending agreed-upon terms and can result in all charges being stayed.

Published reports assert that SNC-Lavalin had been forcefully lobbying for this change in Canada’s criminal law, which by September 2018 was achieved. In October 2018, however, federal prosecutors told SNC-Lavalin that Canada would not negotiate a remediation agreement with it. The company has sought a judicial review of that decision, keeping all issues alive.

In this context, reports recently surfaced of the Trudeau government “heavily pressuring” Wilson-Raybould to drop the criminal prosecution in favour of a remediation agreement that could see all charges dropped.

Only those involved know what actually took place. Was “heavy pressure” applied? What was the nature of that heavy pressure? Who applied the heavy pressure? In what context?

Heavy pressure brought on the attorney general by the prime minister, or anyone on his behalf, to reverse the prosecution’s earlier decision for political gain would certainly breach the Shawcross doctrine.

Why is this a political issue? SNC-Lavalin employs approximately 9,000 Canadians and is seen by some as one of those companies that is too big to fail. But no company is too big to fail.

If a company fails due to its own corrupt dealings as proven, or pled guilty to, in a fair court process, other employers will come forward to do the work at hand. Indeed, SNC-Lavalin operates in a very competitive industry.

There is no doubt that the changes to Canada’s criminal law by the federal Liberal government could benefit the company, but once federal prosecutors refused to offer a remediation agreement, other than judicial review, its only option is for the prosecution to change its mind.

The only person with the authority to direct the prosecution to change its mind is the attorney general.

Canadians deserve answers to this government chaos.

Western Canadians deserve answers as to why the Trudeau government stood by as vibrant, job-creating, ethical companies in the West were allowed to implode, losing tens of thousands of jobs, while special attention was reserved for a company under criminal suspicion with a long history of questionable business practices, but with close ties to the Liberal government.

332,Empty,2019-02-22T09:00:00Z,Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick sat before a committee of MPs Thursday and explained that he was holding a position that has existed in one form or another for 800 years.,"Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick sat before a committee of MPs Thursday and explained that he was holding a position that has existed in one form or another for 800 years.

While Canada has been a country for a much shorter period, in the U.K. the privy council has served to advise monarchs on legislation, justice and the functioning of government for centuries.

Wernick's appearance before the justice committee served to open the door of Canada's ""private council"" and shed some light on the role of the privy council clerk in a democratically elected government.

In Canada, the clerk holds three positions. The first is to act as the deputy minister for the prime minister, fulfilling a bureaucratic role. The second is to be secretary of the federal cabinet and the third is to act as the head of the federal public service.

Wernick laid out that part of the job but more importantly he detailed how he fulfilled those roles with respect to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office in the ongoing court case involving SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.

The committee asked Wernick to appear because it is examining whether Trudeau or someone in his office tried to pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould — when she held the dual role of attorney general and justice minister — to allow SNC-Lavalin to avoid charges on corruption and fraud by offering it the option of a remediation agreement as an alternative to prosecution.

Wernick said that he did, in fact, speak with Wilson-Raybould about the decision to prosecute the firm, making the case that there would be economic consequences for the Montréal-based company and its 9,000 plus Canadian employees if she chose to disregard the remediation option.

While no former clerks of the privy council would speak to CBC News on the record, a source with intimate knowledge of the position explained that making a strong case to Wilson-Raybould to seek remediation was an entirely justified position for the clerk to take.

Clerks 'want good decision making'

The source said that the clerk's role, in a sense, makes them responsible for cabinet decision making by ensuring the appropriate steps are taken to execute cabinet decisions.

The clerk also has the responsibility to ensure that the public interest is considered in cabinet decisions.

""It is perfectly legitimate for the clerk to call the attorney general and and say: 'have you considered employment in Montreal' in the decision they are going to make,"" the source said.

Watch Michael Wernick address MPs:

Michael Wernick the Clerk of the Privy Council spoke to the Commons Justice committee on Thursday 3:39

The attorney general, however, can disregard the public interest under the law, the source said, if it is determined that a person at the centre of a case has been found guilty of corrupting foreign officials. But the clerk still provides the advice.

""An effective clerk will make sure that ministers have these facts because they also want good decision making. They want everything on the table for them to take into account,"" David McLaughlin, a former chief of staff to Brian Mulroney and deputy minister to New Brunswick Premier Bernard Lord, told CBC News Network's Power & Politics.

Appropriate vs. inappropriate pressure

The source also said that the line between appropriate pressure and pressure that crosses the line is not complicated.

If, in the case of Wilson-Raybould, the prime minister told her that she had to make a specific decision or she would be kicked out of cabinet, that would be crossing the line, the source said.

Watch David McLaughlin discuss the job of privy council clerk:

Brian Mulroney's former chief of staff David McLaughlin weighs in on the first day of the justice committee's probe. 8:23

But the level of pressure would be appropriate, and just, if the prime minister told Wilson-Raybould that she should take the weekend to really think over her decision because prosecuting SNC-Lavalin could put thousands of people out of work and potentially sink an important Canadian company.

""There is nothing wrong with that whatsoever, and it doesn't matter who the prime minister uses as his messenger, whether it's the clerk, a member of the PMO's staff or [he] tells the minister himself,"" the source said.

Cabinet confidence

The clerk is also responsible for determining what documents or discussions are covered by cabinet confidence and ensuring that cabinet confidences persist. All of his rulings are final and cannot be appealed to a court.

So if the clerk decides that a conversation or written correspondence between two ministers or a minister and the prime minister are a cabinet confidence, then the content of that discussion remains confidential.

""His job is not political at all,"" said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. ""I'll define the clerk this way: it's operationally oriented but politically sensitive. In contrast, the Prime Minister's Office is politically oriented but has to be operationally sensitive.""

Wiseman said the role is ""absolutely non-partisan.""

That's something McLaughlin said Wernick demonstrated well during his appearance at committee. While the position is non-partisan, the prime minister can appoint whomever he wants to the role.

Wernick, it should be noted, was appointed to the position of deputy clerk of the privy council and associate secretary to cabinet by former Prime Minister Stephen Harper and promoted to clerk by Trudeau.

""His job is not to give political advice,"" said Wiseman.

The clerk is there to anticipate issues or concerns that will arise as a direct result of policy decisions and to inform the prime minister of what those are.

""That's part of the background analysis, basically trying to assess what will be the consequences of a particular decision, what are the pros, what are the cons,"" said Yan Campagnolo, assistant law professor at the University of Ottawa. ""Certainly that's something that public servants do in general, and the clerk is at the top of the pyramid.""

Kudlow made the comments on a panel at the National Governors Association’s winter meeting in Washington on Sunday. He spoke after Marc Garneau, Canada’s transport minister, said “I don’t know if we are going to get there” in approving the deal if the tariffs aren’t removed.

The duties are no longer needed now that the two countries and Mexico have agreed on the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, Garneau said. Kudlow also suggested that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was working toward having the tariffs removed.

“Ambassador Lighthizer and his group, we are working on that, we are hard at work on that, to solve that issue,” Kudlow said of the metals tariffs after Garneau spoke. Earlier in the panel discussion, Kudlow said the new three-nation agreement was “very strong” and that Trump taught him tariffs can be a good negotiating tactic to break down trade barriers.

Canada retaliated dollar-for-dollar against U.S. tariffs last year, and Garneau’s comments on Sunday were some of the sharpest about the dispute since then as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau leads his government toward an October election. Garneau said that while political energy may shift to other issues in coming months, the tariffs alone are a major stumbling block to ratification.

‘Unnecessary Tax’

“Those tariffs are an unnecessary tax which is weighing down on both countries,” said Garneau, a former astronaut who served on U.S.-led space missions. He also said the original U.S. justification for tariffs on national security grounds was never justified.

“This will present us with real challenges as we begin the process of ratification in Canada -- I don’t know if we are going to get there,” Garneau said.

Canada would quickly drop its metals tariffs and ratify the agreement in response to a U.S. move, Garneau said. “We want to go ahead and do it because this is very good for both of our countries,” Garneau said of ratifying the trade agreement.

Garneau appealed to the governors in the audience to push the Trump administration to drop the tariffs, noting that Canada is the top export market for many U.S. states. The U.S. also has a $2 billion surplus in steel trade with Canada, and the bilateral deficit on aluminum is because America needs more of that metal than it can produce, Garneau said.

Letter to Ross

Mexican officials have also called for the metal tariffs to be removed, and a coalition of business, agricultural and trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote a letter in January asking the same of Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

Kudlow touted the new trade agreement on Sunday before Garneau spoke, saying it was a “template” for other pacts and would bring $62 billion of auto investment to the U.S. Such agreements are better than broad, multilateral trade pacts that sink to the “lowest common denominator,” Kudlow said.

Passing the USMCA would also be helpful as a “show of unity” by North America against other trade competitors like China, he said.

Ottawa (AFP) - Canada is looking to quickly bring over siblings of a Syrian refugee distraught over the loss of her seven children in a Halifax house fire, the prime minister said Thursday.

""The immigration minister is seized with this particular case,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said when asked if Ottawa would fast-track the immigration or asylum process to bring the woman's brothers to Canada in order to provide her with family support.

The family was among tens of thousands of Syrian refugees welcomed by Canada over the past four years.

""We're looking at what can be done within our (immigration and refugee) system to give this family a little solace in a time of unbelievable tragedy,"" Trudeau said during a trip to Halifax.

Kawthar Barho, 30, and her family had fled the northern Syrian city of Raqa, where Islamic State militants had established their de facto capital.

They settled in the Atlantic port city of Halifax in 2017. A video posted on social media showed a small crowd cheering their arrival at the airport.

Neighbors said they heard an explosion in the middle of the night Tuesday before seeing flames ravage the family's two-storey house.

Barho remains in hospital, and has been reportedly repeating the name of her youngest child, Abdullah, who was only four months old.

Ahmed, 15, Rola, 12, Mohammed, 10, Ghala, 8, Hala, 4, and Rana, 3, also died in the blaze -- which police are continuing to investigate.

Her husband Ebraheim suffered severe burns and is fighting for his life.

Wednesday night, Trudeau attended a vigil in Halifax for the young victims.

Officials would not comment on the specific case, citing strict privacy laws, but said Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen has discretion to fast-track asylum or immigration cases, including security and medical screenings, in special circumstances.

Locals have been grieving with the mother.

""For the past year and a half, the children have been able to enjoy life as kids should be able to: going to school, riding bicycles, swimming, having friends, running in the yard, celebrating birthday parties and hanging out with the neighbors on their porch swing,"" the Heart Society, the non-profit group that sponsored the family, said in an online post.

""They loved every minute of it, and it seems impossible we won't hear their laughter and feel their hugs again,"" it said.

Trudeau is battling allegations that his officials last year pressured Wilson-Raybould, then justice minister, to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption and bribery trial.

Trudeau insists there was no wrongdoing and said Wilson-Raybould has not made clear her reasons for leaving. In an unusual move, she was allowed to address her Cabinet colleagues on Tuesday, even though she was no longer a minister.

“I continue to be surprised by Jody Wilson-Raybould’s decision ... This is not a decision that remains clear to me,” he told a televised news conference in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.

Trudeau’s version of events was backed up by Michael Wernick, the head of the federal civil service, who was present for several top-level meetings with Wilson-Raybould last year and said nothing untoward had happened.

“There was no inappropriate pressure put on the minister at any time,” Wernick told the House of Commons justice committee on Thursday, saying Wilson-Raybould had had plenty of opportunities to complain had she felt the need to.

Wilson-Raybould, who on Wednesday said “I hope that I have the opportunity to speak my truth”, is consulting lawyers to determine how much she is able to say. She is due to address the justice committee next week.

The Globe and Mail on Thursday said Wilson-Raybould told the Cabinet she had come under improper pressure from officials.

“How she interprets and perceives those conversations she can tell you next week. I can tell you my view very firmly is they were entirely appropriate, lawful, legal,” said Wernick, a civil servant who is not a member of Parliament.

The issue could threaten the ruling Liberals’ election chances this October. Opposition politicians have accused the Liberals of a cover-up and want a full public inquiry.

SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in the province of Quebec province, where the Liberals say they need to capture more seats in the October election to have a chance of holding on to power.

“We believe in the independence of the judiciary and we believe in fighting for good jobs,” said Trudeau.

The prime minister on Wednesday sought to calm restless parliamentarians at a meeting to discuss the resignations of Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau aide Gerald Butts, a major architect of the Liberals’ surprise victory in October 2015, who quit on Monday while insisting he had done nothing wrong.

Trudeau sidestepped questions about how he planned to handle the crisis, party sources said.

Signs of stress remain. Two Liberal legislators voted with the opposition on Wednesday in a failed bid to launch a public inquiry, while a female Liberal member of parliament tweeted her support for Wilson-Raybould, adding the hash tag #IStandWithHer.

“One of the fundamental responsibilities of any government is to look for good jobs, to defend jobs and to make sure that our economy is growing in ways that give a real and fair chance to everyone,” Trudeau told reporters in St John’s, Newfoundland when asked about his conversations with then Justice Minister July Wilson-Raybould.

Trudeau’s remarks were among the most detailed yet to explain an affair that is harming his Liberal government ahead of an October election.

Trudeau denies a Feb. 7 report in the Globe and Mail that officials exerted undue pressure last year on Wilson-Raybould to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials and to pay a fine instead.

SNC-Lavalin is a big employer in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up seats to have any chance of winning a majority in the election.

After Canada’s director of public prosecutions ruled on Sept. 4 that the trial should proceed, Trudeau and senior officials raised the matter three times with Wilson-Raybould, who had the power to overturn the decision.

The company, which says the executives accused of wrongdoing have left and that it has overhauled ethics and compliance systems, says a trial could be devastating and has gone to court to try to overturn the ruling.

Wilson-Raybould, who quit last month after being demoted to veterans affairs minister in January, has said nothing. She is due to address the House of Commons justice committee next week.

Opposition politicians accuse the government of mounting a cover-up and are demanding a public inquiry.

Michael Wernick, the head of Canada’s non-partisan civil service, on Thursday said he had contacted Wilson-Raybould on Dec. 19 to discuss fears over what might happen in a trial but denied he had exerted any inappropriate pressure.

“(I) was conveying the context that there were a lot of people worried about what would happen, the consequences, not for her, but the consequences for the workers and the communities and the suppliers,” he told the justice committee.",Canada PM says concern over job losses at heart of SNC-Lavalin affair,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-politics-snc-lavalin-idUSKCN1QB20G

Besides that critical race in B.C.'s Burnaby South for Jagmeet Singh, there are two other byelections being held in the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe and Outremont in Quebec.

Burnaby South is one place where all three major parties have been competitive in past elections. The NDP held onto the seat by a hair more than one per cent of the votes in 2015.

The Liberals, who usually put up a strong showing in Burnaby, faced challenges in this campaign.

Their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Singh said he's not taking anything for granted, but he's confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off.

""I think people are very disappointed with what's going on with the Liberal government,"" he said.

He's up against Richard Lee (Liberal), Jay Shin (Conservative) and Laura Lynn Thompson (People's Party).

Singh has been without a seat since he was chosen as leader of the NDP in October 2017. The B.C. riding has been the focus of the party's heaviest campaigning efforts since Singh announced he would run for that seat in August. Expectations are Singh will take the win in this byelection.

But the NDP is also squaring off against the Liberals in another race — to defend former leader Tom Mulcair's seat in the downtown Montreal riding of Outremont.

Outremont

The provincial polls suggest that the Liberals should win the riding easily.

The NDP's support in Quebec has been fading, and the riding was a Liberal stronghold before Mulcair seized it in a 2007 byelection, the first-ever win in the province for the NDP and one that helped set the stage for the Orange Wave that swept the province in 2011.

Countrywide, that Orange Wave is now little more than a ripple. The NDP has been dropping in the polls and now sits at just 14 per cent in the CBC Poll Tracker — a result which, if replicated on election night in October, would be the worst result for the party in nearly 20 years.

Singh also presents unique challenges in Quebec ridings.

Julia Sanchez, the NDP's candidate in Monday's Outremont byelection, told The Canadian Press people in the riding talk to her about climate change, wealth inequality — and sometimes what the leader of her party wears on his head.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is Sikh and wears a turban, making him conspicuously religious in the eyes of a heavily secular province. His French is also weaker than the two previous party leaders, complicating the job of appealing to Quebec voters.

Even in multicultural Outremont, located in the geographic centre of the island of Montreal with one of the largest ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in North America, Singh's religious clothing is on some voters' minds.

""Some people are concerned about [the turban],"" Sanchez said during a recent interview following a candidate debate in the riding. She said when she knocks on doors, ""It's definitely not the main thing people bring up .... It does come up.""

Sanchez is running against Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan, Conservative Jasmine Louras, Bloc candidate Michel Duchesne, PPC candidate James Seale and Green party deputy leader Daniel Green.

York-Simcoe

York-Simcoe is almost certainly a safe Conservative seat. The Tories won it by 45 points in 2011 and still held it by 12 points in 2015 when Stephen Harper was defeated.

Tory candidate Scot Davidson told CBC News on Saturday he's confident the affluent riding will stay blue.

Thanks to an extraordinary intervention on Thursday by Michael Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant, Wilson-Raybould is now essentially being dared to come out from under the murky cloud of anonymous media leaks, cryptic gestures and non-answers that have fuelled the story we’re now calling the “SNC-Lavalin scandal.”

Liberal MP Jody Wilson-Raybould arrives to a caucus meeting on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Feb. 20, 2019. Wilson-Raybould, who is due to appear at the Commons justice committee next week, now has to decide whether she wants to call Canada’s top civil servant — and by extension, the prime minister himself — a liar, Susan Delacourt writes. ( Sean Kilpatrick / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

“There was no inappropriate pressure put on the minister at any time,” Wernick flatly declared at the Commons justice committee, in an appearance that could have been titled: “Enough of this b.s.” Wilson-Raybould, who is due to appear at the committee next week, now has to decide whether she wants to call Wernick — and by extension, none other than the prime minister himself — a liar. She stood in the Commons earlier this week and said she was keen to speak “her truth.” However, it’s not Wilson-Raybould’s truth we urgently need to hear now, but just the plain old truth.

Article Continued Below

Wernick has even argued that Wilson-Raybould can no longer hide behind the solicitor-client cloak she’s been using to avoid confirming or denying what’s being said about her differences with the PMO on making a plea deal with SNC-Lavalin in its fraud and corruption case. Stakes are now upped, so is the pressure. Whatever else was accomplished by Wernick’s forceful words on Thursday, the bizarre imbalance in this story — anonymous allegations and on-the-record denials — is rapidly coming to an end.

Article Continued Below

Yet another leak to The Globe and Mail on Thursday reported that Wilson-Raybould told cabinet this week she had faced undue pressure from the PMO to make that plea deal. Leaving aside the details of this newest report, the very fact of that leak showed that Wilson-Raybould’s war with the PMO is not over, however conciliatory (and strange) it was to see the former minister sitting down with her colleagues on Tuesday. If she indeed did tell her former fellow ministers that the PMO had been trying to force her to make a deal with SNC-Lavalin, it is a story opposite to what Wernick told, in some detail, to the justice committee on Thursday. Opposition members of the committee and no doubt some supporters of Wilson-Raybould seem to favour the version of this scandal that they’ve only been able to cobble together between the lines of this story. In that version, a principled Wilson-Raybould stood up to the PMO’s corporate cosiness with SNC-Lavalin and got demoted from justice to veterans’ affairs minister as punishment. Wernick didn’t dispute that conversations took place — he even laid them out in some detail, including how he told Wilson-Raybould of how her colleagues in government were reading the business pages and worried about SNC-Lavalin’s future. Was that pressure? He doesn’t think it was, but he said the ethics inquiry will help sort that out. So will Wilson-Raybould. Over the weekend, as she mulls what she can or will say to the justice committee, her choices will be to side with Wernick or the opposition’s version of events. Now that is pressure. Earlier this week, it was looking like efforts were being made to bring Wilson-Raybould back into the fold. Everyone was smiling after she spoke to cabinet and Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale even said he was “satisfied.” Wilson-Raybould walked back into the friendly fold of Liberal caucus and told reporters she still intended to run as a Liberal in the next election. Trudeau even told reporters that he was sorry for not apologizing to her sooner and condemning what has been said about her. Wernick’s testimony was not at all conciliatory toward the Wilson-Raybould story being told in the shadows to date. It was in fact a dare and a challenge. It might even be pressure. Undue?

View full coverage on …,"Huawei Technologies Co. would deny any Chinese government request to open up “back doors” in foreign telecommunications networks because they aren’t legally obliged to do so, the company’s chairman says.

Liang Hua, speaking to reporters in Toronto on Thursday, said the company had received an independent legal opinion about its obligations under Chinese law and said there is nothing forcing companies to create what he called “back doors” in networks. He said they’d never received any such request, but would refuse it if they did.

“We will not execute the request” because it wouldn’t be lawful, he said through a translator, stressing that he leads “an independent business organization” aimed at serving its customers. “We have kept a good track record on cyber-security.”

His comments, and an announcement of increased spending in Canada, come as the country and several of its peers weigh whether to restrict or ban Huawei from 5G networks. The company’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, meanwhile, is under house arrest in Vancouver and faces potential extradition from Canada to the U.S.

‘Challenges and Difficulties’

Liang downplayed some of the geopolitical tensions, saying that difficulties are normal in business and that they’ll continue to invest in Canada regardless of the 5G decision. However, he said he believes Meng is innocent and that Canada will keep politics out of its decision.

“At the end of the day, we hope decisions on 5G can be made based on technology and not on other factors,” he said. “At any time, at any point, it is normal for us, for a company to be faced with challenges and difficulties.”

The U.S., New Zealand and Australia have all restricted or banned Huawei from 5G networks. The U.K. said this week no decision has been made, but that the country “will not compromise on the improvements we need to see from Huawei.” Germany has ruled out a full Huawei ban.

‘Fair and Just’

Despite the tensions, the chairman predicted revenue growth for the company -- to US$125.4 billion in 2019, up from US$108.5 billion last year. Revenue in Canada totaled US$420 million last year, including US$270 million from telecom companies like BCE Inc. and Telus Corp., and US$150 million from consumer products.

He said the company “is just an equipment vendor” to those Canadian telecoms, and doesn’t own networks or Canadian customer data. He said he wants all providers to be treated equally in a “fair and just manner.” Cyber-security and privacy protection are challenges for the entire industry and not just one company, he said.

The company won’t abandon Canada if it bans 5G, Liang said. “There are still customers that will choose us. In that case, we will continue to provide good service to customers,” he said.

The U.S. unveiled allegations against Huawei, two affiliates and Meng over alleged bank and wire fraud related to business in Iran, along with allegations that the company stole trade secrets from T-Mobile US Inc. Liang said the dispute with T-Mobile had been resolved in civil proceedings and that a “defendant is innocent until proven guilty.”

Meng is due in court next month, though her extradition fight could last for years. “I cannot say the U.S. charges against Ms. Meng are not politically driven,” Liang said. “I believe she is innocent and I hope the Canadian justice system will bring justice back to her.”

Liang cited comments made by former Canadian ambassador to China, John McCallum, who said Meng had a good case to avoid extradition.

The evolving scandal is the subject of a study in the House Justice Committee that is set to reach a new level of attention this week when the former minister at the centre of the story, Jody Wilson-Raybould, testifies. Her appearance at committee is expected Tuesday at the earliest.

Prior to that, the opposition day motion that MPs are set to debate on Monday will make a new attempt at getting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to speak about the case. According to the House of Commons website, the motion deals with the “Appearance of the Prime Minister before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.” Two previous attempts to have senior PMO staff testify at the committee were unsuccessful, as was a motion to compel Trudeau to waive solicitor-client privilege and have a public inquiry launched.

Citing unnamed sources, The Globe and Mail reported on Feb. 7 that Trudeau’s office pressed Wilson-Raybould to drop a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin when she was attorney general. It was alleged that the PMO wanted Wilson-Raybould to instruct federal prosecutors to change course and pursue a remediation agreement rather than criminal prosecution in the corruption and fraud case against the Quebec engineering and construction giant. This is something she had the ability to do in that role, but she did not, despite several meetings and conversations on the matter after federal prosecutors decided to carry on with the criminal case.

Months later she was shuffled into the veterans affairs portfolio, and was replaced as attorney general and justice minister by Quebec MP David Lametti. Wilson-Raybould accepted her new position, but then resigned from cabinet days after the story broke.

To date, the government maintains that nothing improper occurred, though Trudeau’s principal secretary resigned over the matter on Feb. 18, denying any wrongdoing.

Deputy Conservative Leader and justice critic Lisa Raitt said the testimony of the clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick at the House Justice Commitee on Thursday laid out the level of effort to have Wilson-Raybould reconsider her decision.

Wernick, Canada's most senior bureaucrat, disputed the allegations. He said that while it's likely Wilson-Raybould could have felt pressured, those probing the matter will have to determine whether that or other conversations constitute as ""inappropriate pressure.""

Raitt said she thinks it’s clear that it was improper.

“Jody Wilson-Raybould told the prime minister and the clerk of the privy council in no uncertain terms she wasn’t going to overrule her deputy on the matter. That’s where it should end,” Raitt said on CTV’s Question Period. “And yet we see time and time again through phone calls through meetings between her staff and the PMO, the prime minister himself, Gerald Butts, and whoever else that we’ll find along the way, all took it upon themselves to go in and check-in with her and see whether or not she’s taken another decision.”

As Wernick argued, there is pressure on every decision made by a cabinet minister.

Citing a conversation he had with Wilson-Raybould about the case, months after the prospect of a remediation agreement was rejected by federal prosecutors, Wernick—who has been a public servant under both Liberal and Conservative governments over the last three decades— said he did convey to her the ""context"" that: ""There were a lot of people worried about what would happen, the consequences. Not for her, the consequences for the workers and the communities, and the suppliers.""

This, Wernick argued, signals that the system is working and that he is confident that the conversations he had with Wilson-Raybould on the matter were ""lawful and appropriate.”

NDP MP and justice critic Murray Rankin disagreed.

“No means no... Why are they continuing to brow-beat her?” Rankin said on CTV’s Question Period. “There’s clearly a line that was crossed it seems.”

Liberal MP Marco Mendicino said that it is part of Wernick’s responsibility to bring to the AG’s attention any new information that comes to light around a legal case that may impact innocent third parties, like the workers for large corporations.

Wernick predicted that Wilson-Raybould will, when she testifies, express concern with three events: A meeting she had with Trudeau about SNC-Lavalin, at which Wernick was present; a second meeting between PMO staff and Wilson-Raybould's chief of staff on Dec. 18; and a third phone conversation Wernick had with her on Dec. 19, which he classified as a check-in heading into the winter sitting of Parliament.

Citing the multiple discussions with Wilson-Raybould from senior level PMO and PCO officials, CTV political commentator Tom Mulcair said that ""Wernick admitted that he put pressure on Jody Wilson-Raybould full stop. That’s the starting point on this.""

""Whatever modifier Mr. Wernick or anybody else wants to put on it is not there. He’s not denying they put pressure on her, and he says ‘well I was just giving her context.’ Yeah sure,” Mulcair said.

‘Multiple conversations’ on tough files

On CTV’s Question Period, Labour Minister Patty Hajdu was asked about the evidence and testimony that has come to light so far. She said that while she could not speak on whether or not Wilson-Raybould felt pressure, it has not been her personal experience when it comes to interactions with Trudeau or his office.

Hajdu said she has had a number of frank and ""vigorous"" conversations on tough files and she has never felt ""undue pressure.""

""Whenever I’ve had challenging files, whenever we’ve had difficult situations often times there are multiple conversations about decisions that will impact Canadians…. Because these decisions have such an impact,"" Hajdu said.

She said she is looking forward to the outcome of the justice committee’s work, and the findings of the federal ethics commissioner probe before making any judgement on the situation.","SNC-Lavalin testimony indicates a line was crossed, opposition parties say - CTV News",Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/snc-lavalin-testimony-indicates-a-line-was-crossed-opposition-parties-say-1.4309481

Before shutting out the media, Justin Trudeau and Dwight Ball had a brief photo op, where they revealed some of what would be discussed.

""Today we'll have some discussion on things like Innu children in care,"" said Ball. ""I want to have a discussion on pharmacare of course, Bill C69, but of course the number one priority right now is continuing the discussion on the Atlantic Accord.""

Trudeau agreed, saying it was a priority to ""move forward positively"" on the Atlantic Accord discussions.

In a press release issued after the meeting, Ball said the conversations ""focused on Newfoundland and Labrador being the primary beneficiary of its offshore resources and the joint management of those resources.""

They hope to finalize the Atlantic Accord review by the end of March.

No mention of SNC-Lavalin during speech

Earlier in the day, Trudeau took a tour of Memorial University's core science building, which is still under construction, and gave a speech to Liberal donors at the Alt Hotel in downtown St. John's.

His speech focused on how faith in public institutions is dissipating around the world — he mentioned the United States, France and the United Kingdom, but neglected to mention the burning issue of the SNC-Lavalin affair at home.

""There's a time right now where people around the world are mistrustful of their institutions, worried that they are not being supported in the transformations of the world around them. And that's causing people and the democracies around the world to lash out in various ways,"" he said.

Not only did he leave out any mention of tensions in Canada, Trudeau said his government is doing just the opposite.

""What we are doing here in Canada is reinforcing faith in those institutions … governments can't do everything, but what it does do, it should do well.""

During the tour at Memorial University, Trudeau was asked about the SNC-Lavalin scandal. He said people should pay close attention to comments made this week by Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick.

""Canadians expect us always to be standing up for jobs, to be making sure that we're protecting economic growth across the country, and indeed promoting it. That is one of the fundamental jobs that anyone expects of their government,"" Trudeau said.

""But they of course expect their government to do that in ways that respects the rule of law, upholds the independence of our judiciary, and defends our institutions, and that is something that this government has always done.""

Playing to a local audience, Trudeau recounted his bachelor party in Newfoundland — when he and MP Seamus O'Regan went seakayaking in a snowstorm, and Trudeau says he got thrown out of the Sundance on George Street.

Muskrat Falls on the agenda

During the tour at Memorial University, Trudeau was asked by reporters about the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project, which is over budget, behind schedule and the subject of an ongoing public inquiry. He was asked whether or not there would be another federal loan guarantee.

""We will continue to work with the government of Newfoundland and Labrador on ways to ensure that the cost of living is affordable, like we do right across the country,"" Trudeau said.

""We have given significant loan guarantees to the Muskrat Falls project, which has reduced the cost, but we're always looking to hear directly from the premier on ways we can make sure we're working together to benefit the people of Newfoundland and Labrador.""

Trudeau was also asked about the Atlantic Accord, as well as a replacement for the aging Her Majesty's Penitentiary. Again, Trudeau deferred to discussions with Premier Ball.

Their meeting convened at 1:45 p.m., with Trudeau scheduled to head to Toronto on Friday evening.

He flew in from Nova Scotia Thursday evening, and the trip to St. John's is, in part, a fundraising stop, as Canadians and politicians get ready to vote in an October federal election.

Though he will be talking with some provincial politicians, Natural Resources Minister Siobhan Coady has said she had ""no plans at this point"" to discuss the ongoing saga of Muskrat Falls — and any potential financial help from Ottawa — with the prime minister during his brief visit.

Trudeau says the money will help extend the Highway 107 Burnside connector and build a high-speed bypass to connect highways 101, 102, and 118.

The prime minister says the connector will ""go a long way in making commutes shorter and safer,"" adding that its construction is expected to create 150 jobs.

The Burnside connector was previously announced as part of the provincial government's highway twinning plan, which also includes projects along highways 101, 103 and 104.

(N.S. Department of Transportation )

Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal Minister Lloyd Hines said the province will be spending $110 million on the project, on top of Ottawa's contribution.

Hines said the Burnside project would more directly connect the Burnside business park with the provincial highway network, including highways 102, 107 and 118. Construction is expected to begin this spring and be complete by 2023.

Deputy Mayor Tony Mancini noted there are almost 2,000 companies and 30,000 workers based in the business park, all of which provides about 13 per cent of the municipality's commercial tax revenue.

""It's an essential economic driver for our municipality and province,"" Mancini said during a news conference.

Later today, Trudeau is expected to take part in a tour of historical exhibits at the Black Cultural Centre in the community of Cherry Brook.

Black Nova Scotians who say they were racially profiled on Parliament Hill earlier this month are also expected to receive a personal apology from Trudeau during his visit to the centre.

Trudeau began his visit by attending a vigil Wednesday night for a Syrian family that lost seven children in a house fire earlier in the week, before attending a fundraising gathering of Liberal donors at a Halifax hotel.

The decision paved the way for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's administration to increase fossil fuel emissions, endanger wildlife, and threaten the lives and livelihoods of the eight million people who live in the pipeline's path.

The NEB argued that the pipeline is in the public interest and provided the government with a list of 16 conditions that it must meet as it prepares to expand the 1,150 kilometer (714 mile) pipeline, tripling the amount of oil the tar sands pipeline will carry from Edmonton, Alberta to Burnaby, British Columbia—but critics including Burnaby mayor Mike Hurley argued that the NEB has no intention of protecting the environment or wildlife by enforcing strict regulations on the construction.

""This is the problem with drinking the Kool-Aid served by politicians who are masters of progressive symbolism but evade substance. Once in power, they can be counted on to do substantive harm."" —Naomi Klein

The conditions will not ""prevent significant public safety risks and harms to marine life and other environmental impacts,"" Hurley told the Vancouver Sun.

The board noted that the Trans Mountain pipeline is likely to have a significant negative impact on the Southern resident orca, whose population in the Salish Sea off the coast of British Columbia is rapidly dwindling; on the Indigenous population in the area, especially in the event of an oil spill; and on the environment, with fossil fuel emissions rising as cargo ships carry the oil after it travels from Edmonton.

Outcry from First Nations and campaigners ensued when the NEB initially approved the project in 2016, and opponents rejoiced last summer when the Federal Court of Appeals temporarily blocked construction. The court argued that Trudeau's administration and Kinder Morgan, which sold the pipeline to the government for $4.5 billion last year, had not sufficiently considered its effects on Southern orcas and indigenous tribes.

But Friday's approval—which came after what one campaigner called a rushed process with a ""compressed hearing schedule"" that allowed for little input from the public—was not unexpected among critics.

""This entire process is a joke,"" Peter McCartney of the Wilderness Committee told the Sun. ""I don't think anybody's surprised to see the NEB green lighting this pipeline—it's what they were designed to do.""

Kwikwasut'inuxw Haxwa'mis Chief Bob Chamberlin, vice-president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, said Trudeau has indicated his government will stop at nothing to complete the project.

""The troubling part for me and First Nations concerned about their water and their territories is the fact that Trudeau has stated this pipeline will be built, full stop. It makes an absolute mockery of the consultation process that was court ordered and has been accomplished today,"" Chamberlin told the Sun.

In a press conference, Grand Chief Stewart Philip also said indigenous tribes will not relent in their ""deeply entrenched opposition"" to the pipeline, which will threaten food sources of the 29 tribes that live in the path of the proposed route.

""We are proud British Columbians and we have a duty to protect what we've all been blessed with in British Columbia in regard to the pristine beauty of the environment,"" Philip said. ""We will rise to the challenge.""

""I understand in British Columbia, this pipeline will provide a way of having an income,"" said Noel Purser of the Suquamish Tribe, which joined four other Northwest U.S. tribes in challenging the project in 2013. ""But is it worth the potential of a spill, that risk? Is it really worth that? Because that will impact everybody, not just here in British Columbia. It will impact us in Suquamish; it will impact our relatives in Alaska.""

""Once again, Canada's NEB has sided with short-term Big Oil profits instead of the long-term health of the Pacific Northwest's people, climate and orcas,"" said Marcie Keever of Friends of the Earth. ""Shame on Prime Minister Trudeau, his government, and the National Energy Board of Canada for ignoring widespread opposition and serious concerns in favor of this destructive pipeline. Canada's decision will likely bring about the extinction of the Northwest's iconic killer whales and drive us further towards the brink of climate chaos.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is backing Craft for the post, and she also has the support of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters. They say President Donald Trump has been advised that Craft’s confirmation would be the smoothest of the three candidates he is considering to fill the job last held by Nikki Haley.

Craft, a Kentucky native, was a member of the U.S. delegation to the U.N. General Assembly under President George W. Bush’s administration. She is also friends with McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, and thanked Chao for her “longtime friendship and support” at her swearing-in as ambassador.

As U.S. ambassador to Canada, she played a role in facilitating the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Trump’s first pick to replace Haley, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, withdrew over the weekend.

Trump is also considering U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell and former U.S. Senate candidate John James of Michigan for the post.

Nauert’s weekend withdrawal from consideration came amid a push within the administration to fill the position given a pressing array of foreign policy concerns in which the United Nations, particularly the U.N. Security Council, is likely to play a significant role. From Afghanistan to Venezuela, the administration has pressing concerns that involve the world body, and officials said there had been impatience with the delays on Nauert’s formal nomination.

Trump said Dec. 7 that he would pick the former Fox News anchor and State Department spokeswoman for the U.N. job, but her nomination was never formalized.

Notwithstanding other concerns that may have arisen during her confirmation, Nauert’s nomination had languished in part due to the 35-day government shutdown that began Dec. 22 and interrupted key parts of the vetting process.

With Nauert out of the running, officials said Pompeo was keen on Craft to fill the position. Although Pompeo would like to see the job filled, the vacancy has created an opportunity for him and others to take on a more active role in U.N. diplomacy. On Thursday, for example, Pompeo was in New York to meet with U.N. chief Antonio Guterres.

Three other officials said both Pompeo and Bolton favor demoting the U.N. position to a sub-Cabinet level position, and Grenell has suggested he isn’t interested in a non-Cabinet role. The officials were not authorized to discuss internal personnel deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Haley had been a member of the Cabinet and had clashed repeatedly with former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others during the administration’s first 14 months.

Bolton was not a Cabinet member when he served as U.N. ambassador in President George W. Bush’s administration, and neither he nor Pompeo is eager to see a potential challenge to their foreign policy leadership in White House situation room meetings, according to the officials.

Chris Sands, director of the Center for Canadian Studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, describes Craft as warm and gracious and said she is often underestimated.

“She’s always, ‘Oh, you know, I’m not the policy expert.’ But she has a disarming quality. She’s not a policy intellectual, but she’s more emotionally astute and so I think she is more effective than she comes off,” Sands said.

Craft is married to billionaire coal-mining executive Joe Craft, and they are major Republican donors.

Craft has been ambassador during a low point in relations.

""I totally respect his apology and also we shared some thoughts on ways to involve the youth, the upcoming generation,"" Trayvone Clayton told reporters at the Black Cultural Centre in Cherry Brook, N.S.

""This is not just for myself. I didn't do this for myself — I did it for all of us.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks to a crowd at the Black Cultural Centre in Cherry Brook, N.S., on Thursday. (Radio-Canada)

Clayton, a Halifax university student, was part of a coalition of black, human rights, labour and youth groups that visited Parliament Hill on Feb. 4 for a series of meetings with eight federal cabinet ministers.

The visitors later reported that a government employee complained to the Parliamentary Protective Service (PPS) about them, taking their picture and referring to them as ""dark-skinned people.""

A member of the PPS who responded to the complaint also used the term ""dark-skinned"" and told them to leave the parliamentary cafeteria even though they had valid passes allowing them to be there, the group said.

Clayton said he was very hurt by the incident given they were invited to Ottawa to discuss ways of stopping hatred and racism toward black people.

""Look at this history. This has been here for hundreds of years and so racism still shouldn't be a problem towards us, we should be accepted for who we are and what we do,"" he said.

Kate MacDonald, a Halifax education and outreach co-ordinator, also welcomed the apology from Trudeau — the first sitting Canadian prime minister to visit the Black Cultural Centre.

""He said that he was sorry and he was deeply affected by what had happened and he recognizes that there is anti-black racism in Canada, that it is an issue that we're still trying to work through,"" said MacDonald, who described the mood inside the room during the private meeting as good.

MacDonald and Clayton said they look forward to discussions with the prime minister to talk about possible youth initiatives for black youth.

After the private apology and a tour of the cultural centre, Trudeau spoke to a large crowd of black community members and leaders, dignitaries and other invited guests.

The prime minister did not issue a public apology but acknowledged the wrong done.

As an MP and now prime minister, Trudeau said he gets to meet people from every corner of the country who come to the Parliament Buildings, which he described as impressive and intimidating stone buildings with ""paintings of white guys on the walls.""

""One of the first things I say to people is, 'This is your House. This is your House of Parliament. This is your building. This is where we serve you. This is your place,'"" Trudeau said.

""And to have these young [people] walk into their place for the first time, wanting to be part of ... conversations about their identity and what matters, and to have them smacked in the face with a stark reminder that anti-black racism exists, that unconscious bias exists, that systemic discrimination exists in this country today still, is not something we would want to be talking about this Black History Month.""

Trudeau acknowledged there is still much work to be done to combat racism in Canada.

""If it hadn't happened in Parliament, doesn't mean it wouldn't have happened anywhere else in this country on any given day, because it does,"" he said.

Big day today on Parliament Hill.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould is set to speak her truth about the SNC-Lavalin controversy this week—specifically, tomorrow,* when she appears before a justice committee that’s looking into whether the PMO tried to pressure her into going easy on SNC-Lavalin.

Will she light it up? If the former AG adds credible colour to the story being told by anonymous sources this past week, it will be a devastating day for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, writes Andrew MacDougall: “If you’re Trudeau, it’s hard to envision an appearance in which Wilson-Raybould doesn’t burn everything—Trudeau included—to the ground. There has been some serious red-on-red action on the nation’s front pages in the past few days, and only one side can survive.” (Maclean’s)

No, no, no: The men who wanted SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal prosecution engaged in “Grand-Master-Jedi-level gaslighting” of former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould by repeatedly refusing to accept her authority on the file and then insisting she was under no pressure, writes Anne Kingston:

Even before her testimony, however, an eerily familiar tale has unfolded, the last chapter in the spell-binding spiel from [Privy Council Clerk] Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, this week before the justice committee. And that’s the spectre of powerful men not used to hearing “No,” not willing to accept “No,” doggedly pushing for a “Yes” from the person who ostensibly determines consent, then gaslighting her when they don’t hear it.

Politics show round-up

Didn’t catch the weekend politics shows? Here’s what you missed:

In his testimony to the justice committee Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick attacked the original Globe and Mail story that kicked off the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Bob Fife, one of the journalists who broke the story, made the rounds, and on CTV’s Question Period defended the scoop: “In politics the best defence is often a strong offence, and particularly shooting the messenger, but in his testimony [Wernick] actually confirmed what we reported—we reported Miss Wilson-Raybould was subjected to pressure to cut a deal so SNC-Lavalin would not be prosecuted, would pay a fine. We did not say the Prime Minister directed her to do so. Nobody said that. In fact nobody did do that.” (CTV video tweet)

Speaking on Question Period Conservative Justice Critic Lisa Raitt said Wernick’s committee testimony shows lines were crossed with Wilson-Raybould: “Jody Wilson-Raybould told the prime minister and the clerk of the privy council in no uncertain terms she wasn’t going to overrule her deputy on the matter. That’s where it should end. And yet we see time and time again through phone calls through meetings between her staff and the PMO, the prime minister himself, Gerald Butts, and whoever else that we’ll find along the way, all took it upon themselves to go in and check-in with her and see whether or not she’s taken another decision.” (CTV News)

Following Friday’s recommendation by the National Energy Board that the Trans Mountain pipeline be approved, Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Ottawa is on track to wrap up consultations with 117 Indigenous committees that would be impacted by the pipeline within the next few months: “The work that we have done so far and the work we will continue to do in the coming months, I can tell you that I feel that we are in a very strong position to conclude these consultations within the next 90 days. But we must get it right.” (Global News)

On Trans Mountain, Canada’s fisheries minister Jonathan Wilkinson told CBC’s The House that increased tanker traffic from the pipeline expansion won’t have much additional impact on endangered southern resident killer whales because they’re already being blasted with underwater noise. “It’s important to understand that the plight of the southern resident killer whale has very little to do with the Trans Mountain pipeline, he said. “There are 3,200 large container ships that come into Burrard Inlet every year, there are thousands of ferries…. All of those generate noise. So irrespective of whether Trans Mountain proceeds there’s a need for us to actually address issues around marine traffic.” (CBC News)

The NEB’s recommendation comes after the Canadian federal government and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau purchased the pipeline from Kinder Morgan in May 2018 in an attempt to guarantee its construction. In August 2018 a Canadian federal appeals court ruled that the project would need a far more extensive environmental review and First Nations consultation before it could move forward. Despite a second “process” the NEB has made the same decision – to recommend approval of the pipeline expansion.

Marcie Keever, Friends of the Earth US’s oceans and vessels program director, issued the following statement in response:

Once again, Canada’s NEB has sided with short-term Big Oil profits instead of the long-term health of the Pacific Northwest’s people, climate and orcas. The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion threatens the Salish Sea and its marine species, as well as the lives and livelihoods of the area’s 8 million people, including 29 Tribes and First Nations.

Shame on Prime Minister Trudeau, his government, and the National Energy Board of Canada for ignoring widespread opposition and serious concerns in favor of this destructive pipeline. Canada’s decision will likely bring about the extinction of the Northwest’s iconic killer whales and drive us further towards the brink of climate chaos.

Trayvone Clayton, a Halifax student who travelled to Ottawa for the Black Voices on the Hill Day, said he and others are scheduled to meet with Trudeau behind closed doors Thursday at the Black Cultural Centre in Cherry Brook, N.S.

Trudeau travelled to Halifax on Wednesday to attend a vigil in memory of seven children who were killed in a house fire.

Clayton, 20, said he received a call from Halifax MP Andy Fillmore to meet with Trudeau in response to his earlier request for an apology.

""I'm looking for a legit man-to-man apology and 100 per cent respect,"" Clayton, a second-year criminology student at St. Mary's University, said Wednesday.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks at the Black History Month reception in Ottawa on Monday, Feb. 4, 2019. (Justin Tang/Canadian Press)

Clayton was part of a coalition of black, human rights, labour and youth groups that visited Parliament Hill on Feb. 4 for a series of meetings with eight federal cabinet ministers.

The visitors later reported that a government employee complained to the Parliamentary Protective Service (PPS) about them, taking their picture and referring to them as ""dark-skinned people.""

A member of the PPS who responded to the complaint also used the term ""dark-skinned"" and told them to leave the parliamentary cafeteria even though they had valid passes allowing them to be there, the group said.

Clayton said he and another member of the coalition were getting ready to do a media interview when complaints were made that the group waiting in the cafeteria were being too loud.

""But they weren't though, they were just — it's a cafeteria. You're obviously going to hear talking in the cafeteria anywhere you go,"" Clayton said.

""We're not coming to the Parliament building to disrespect anyone or cause any ruckus or a bunch of noise. We're coming here to basically share our thoughts and get things off our chest to speak ... and get the chance to speak to ministers.""

In a statement, Fillmore said he was ""deeply troubled"" by the allegations.

""Discrimination of any kind is unacceptable, anywhere in Canada. But that is especially true in the halls of Parliament, the heart of Canadian democracy,"" he said.

""When constituents from Halifax brought this unfortunate incident to my attention, I quickly raised it in the House of Commons and called for an internal investigation.""

PPS mum on investigation

Fillmore said he raised the issue with Trudeau, who offered to meet with the individuals involved.

""I believe this is a positive step which demonstrates our commitment to the shared goal of ending systemic racial discrimination in Canada,"" Fillmore said.

The Parliamentary Protective Service issued an apology and launched an internal investigation of the incident. Joseph Law, chief of staff to the director of the PPS, said the investigation has since been completed, but he would not elaborate on the findings nor say whether disciplinary action had been taken.

Earlier this week, House Speaker Geoff Regan publicly condemned the incident, saying it ""cannot be condoned and must be dealt with swiftly and purposefully.""

Feb. 19, 2015 — The RCMP lays corruption and fraud charges against Montreal-based engineering and construction firm SNC-Lavalin, over allegations it used bribery to get government business in Libya. SNC-Lavalin says the charges are without merit and stem from ""alleged reprehensible deeds by former employees who left the company long ago."" A conviction would bar the company from bidding on Canadian government business, potentially devastating it.

Oct. 19 — The Liberals win a federal election, taking power from the Conservatives. Two weeks later, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau names Jody Wilson-Raybould minister of justice and attorney general of Canada. She is the first Indigenous person to hold the post, which combines duties as a politician (heading the Department of Justice) and a legal official (overseeing prosecutions).

March 27, 2018 — The Liberals table a budget bill that includes a change to the Criminal Code allowing ""remediation agreements,"" plea-bargain-like deals between prosecutors and accused corporations in which they can avoid criminal proceedings by making reparations for previous bad behaviour. SNC-Lavalin had lobbied for such a provision in Canadian law.

Spring — Although the bill has yet to pass, SNC-Lavalin contacts Public Prosecution Service lawyers to ensure they have all relevant information for a possible invitation to negotiate a remediation agreement. During the next three months, in response to requests from prosecutors, SNC-Lavalin provides detailed information it sees as making a strong case for an agreement.

Sept. 4 — The prosecution service tells SNC-Lavalin in writing it will not invite the firm to negotiate a remediation agreement.

Sept. 17 — Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould discuss the SNC-Lavalin file. As attorney general, Wilson-Raybould could overrule the prosecution service, directing it to negotiate an agreement with the company. Trudeau later says that Wilson-Raybould asked him if he planned to tell her what to do concerning the prosecution — a conversation that he says ended with him telling her any decision was hers alone.

No remediation agreement

Sept. 18 — SNC-Lavalin representatives meet with Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick (Canada's most senior civil servant) and Finance Minister Bill Morneau to discuss issues including ""justice and law enforcement.""

Sept. 21 — The remediation-agreement provisions come into legal force.

Oct. 9 — The director of prosecutions confirms again in writing that she will not invite SNC-Lavalin to negotiate a remediation agreement, a decision the company challenges in Federal Court. That challenge is ongoing.

Oct. 10 — SNC-Lavalin issues a news release saying it strongly disagrees with the director of prosecutions' position and remains open and committed to negotiating a remediation agreement. SNC-Lavalin shares fall nearly 14 per cent, closing at $44.86 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. That's the lowest close since March 2, 2016.

Oct. 11 — SNC-Lavalin meets with Elder Marques, a senior adviser in the Prime Minister's Office, to discuss ""justice and law enforcement.""

Nov. 5 and 19 — SNC-Lavalin meets with Mathieu Bouchard, a senior adviser in the Prime Minister's Office, to discuss ""justice and law enforcement.""

December — According to the Prime Minister's Office, Wilson-Raybould raises the remediation case with Gerald Butts, the prime minister's principal secretary, and he tells her to talk to Wernick, the Privy Council clerk.

Jan. 14, 2019 — Trudeau shuffles his cabinet after the resignation of Treasury Board president Scott Brison. Wilson-Raybould is moved from Justice to Veterans Affairs, widely seen as a demotion. David Lametti, a Montreal MP and former law professor, becomes justice minister. Wilson-Raybould posts a long letter outlining her record as justice minister and noting a great deal of work remains to be done toward reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

Feb. 7 — Citing unnamed sources, the Globe and Mail newspaper reports that Trudeau's aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould, while attorney general, to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the justice portfolio. Trudeau denies any impropriety. Citing solicitor-client privilege, Wilson-Raybould refuses to speak about dealings she had on the case when she was attorney general.

Wilson-Raybould resigns

Feb. 11 — Federal ethics commissioner Mario Dion says he's beginning an investigation. At a public appearance in Vancouver, Trudeau says he's spoken to Wilson-Raybould and confirmed with her that he said any decision on the SNC-Lavalin prosecution was entirely hers. Her continued presence in his cabinet speaks for itself, he says.

Feb. 12 — Wilson-Raybould resigns as veterans-affairs minister and says she's hired former Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell to advise her on the limits of solicitor-client privilege. Trudeau says he's surprised and disappointed that Wilson-Raybould has quit, and that if she felt undue pressure in her role as attorney general, she had a duty to report it to him.

Feb. 13 — The House of Commons justice committee debates its own probe of the issue. Liberals use their majority to call one closed-door meeting and hear from senior officials (Lametti as justice minister, the top bureaucrat in his department, and the clerk of the Privy Council) who can talk about the tension between the minister of justice's duties as a politician and his or her responsibilities as attorney general of Canada. The Liberals say this is a first step in a cautious investigation, but the opposition calls it a coverup.

Feb. 15 — Trudeau says Wilson-Raybould asked him in September whether he would direct her one way or another on the SNC-Lavalin question. He says he told her he would not.

Feb. 18 — Butts resigns as Trudeau's principal secretary. He denies any impropriety but says his continued presence in the Prime Minister's Office has become a distraction.

Sign here to remind Justin Trudeau we won't let him build this pipeline, and to get updates as this struggle for climate justice continues.

The NEB’s new report focused on the impacts of marine shipping including on the highly endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales, which was excluded from the original review. It was one of the 2 factors that caused the Federal Court of Appeal to quash the pipeline’s approvals and permits in their August 2018 ruling. The other was the inadequate consultation with affected First Nations, which the government says it is addressing through a new round of consultations that began in October.

The new report adds 16 conditions aiming to better protect marine life on the BC coast. It's delivery also starts the clock on a 90-day deadline for the cabinet to decide whether the controversial project will proceed. However, this is a deadline officials are already signalling could be pushed back.

The Federal Court of Appeal’s ruling happened a few months after the Trudeau Liberals made a deal for the federal government to buy the project from Texas-based Kinder Morgan for $4.5 billion (though Kinder Morgan itself and independent estimates estimate the final costs to complete the project will total 7-15 billion or more).

Earlier this week, the National Energy Board (NEB) also rejected a motion supported by environmental groups, First Nations, municipal governments, and community groups to include climate impacts in its new review of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project (TMX). The motion was asking the NEB to adopt the same climate impact standards it had already adopted for Energy East, that were a key factor in TransCanada finally abandoning the project.

So where does this leave us?

As I said, this decision was widely expected. The NEB has a long history of siding with industry over communities, and the rushed process for this tacked-on review was not expected to come to any other conclusion.

The reconsideration process was widely criticized as inadequate due to its short 22 week timeline, the inaccessible and frankly bizarre decision to accept feedback only by fax, “surprise” public comment periods of only 2-7 days, and a very narrow scope of review and evidence.

The good news is that there is a giant wall of opposition of communities from coast to coast to coast that know it’s time for a just transition. This is why the TMX pipeline, like Energy East, Keystone XL, and Northern Gateway before it, and Line 3 currently, have faced years of delays or outright cancellations. We know we can’t afford the tripling in tar sands production they would help facilitate – for our climate, for Indigenous rights, for reliable jobs, or for our water.

Further court challenges will now be launched, as the federal government will need to show that their new consultations and recommendations adequately address the Federal Court of Appeal's concerns.

There is also a beautiful, diverse, widespread movement ready to use lots of different tactics to stop this pipeline from being built. Some of the most exciting strategis on the horizon are those that are marrying the strong ‘no’ to new fossil fuels with the future with a liveable climate, Indigenous rights, and good work that we want to see. The Tiny House Warriors are building ten houses on the pipeline's path in Secwepemc territory to assert jurisdiciton, block access to the pipeline, and model the kinds of solutions to their nation's housing crisis that they want to see scaled up. And Climate Justice Edmonton's ""People on the Path"" project is shifting the narrative that all Albertans are pro-pipeline by showcasing different communities' visions for a just transition in 8 foot portraits to be installed along the route.

The National Energy Board of Canada has renewed its backing for an 895,00 barrels-a-day oil pipeline, even while acknowledging it will have ""significantly adverse environmental effects"" on endangered southern resident killer whales.

A major pipeline or oil tanker spill is unlikely, but the ""effects would be significant,"" Robert Steedman, the Board's chief environmental officer, told a briefing in Calgary.

The orcas are, in essence, being told to take one for the team. The Board found the $9.3 billion (Canadian) pipeline would bring ""considerable benefits"" across the country.

""While these effects weighed heavily on the NEB's consideration of project-related marine shipping, the NEB recommends that the government of Canada find that they can be justified in the circumstances, in light of the considerable benefits of the project and measures to minimize the effects,"" the recommendation said.

RELATED: Orca protection must be part of Canadian pipeline -- energy board

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee shot back: ""Now is the time to protect our orcas and combat climate change, not invest in long-term fossil fuel infrastructure.""

The 650-mile, Alberta-to-British Columbia project would bring the TransMountain Pipeline to a terminus at Burnaby, just east of Vancouver. The oil would not be for B.C., but export to global, especially Pacific, markets.

Thirty-four tankers a month, laden with bitumen crude from the Alberta tar sands, would traverse sensitive marine waters of the Salish Sea.

The tankers would pass through Burrard Inlet and English Bay in Vancouver, then move to Haro Strait which separates the San Juan and Gulf islands -- and is a major feeding area for the orcas. They would exit through the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

The tanker route passes popular, beloved places -- San Juan, Stuart, Speiden, Sucia and Patos islands in the San Juans, as well as Dungeness Spit on the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and, Cape Flattery, Shi Shi Beach and Point of Arches off the mouth of the Strait.

The tanker route is bounded by national parks in both the United States and Canada. Both Inslee and B.C. Premier John Horgan have opposed the project, fearful of tanker spills and harm to the southern resident killer whales.

RELATED: 'Year of the Orca' -- Inslee to unveil Orca whale recovery steps

""We need to stop the bleeding right now: We can't be adding a pipeline and increasing tanker traffic at a time when we need to be assessing and repairing that we already have been doing,"" said Raynell Thomas of the Lummi Nation, which intervened in the National Energy Board deliberation.

A Canadian appeals court ordered the Board to review an earlier decision, approving the pipeline, because it had failed to give attention to impacts on marine mammals, and had not heard out Canada's Aboriginal First Nations.

The Board found that waters of the Salish Sea are ""already highly disturbed,"" with conditions ""already detrimental"" to the orcas.

It delivered 16 new marine safety recommendations, such as calling on B.C. ferry boats to make less noise as they cross the Strait of Georgia.

""The (Board) panel feels strongly that if these recommendations are implemented, they will offset the relatively minor effects of project-related marine traffic and in fact will benefit the entire Salish Sea ecosystem,"" Steedman said.

ALSO FROM CONNELLY: $655 million in the form of a polar icebreaker for a changing Arctic

The benefits, cited by the Board, include giving Alberta oil access to new markets, additional government revenue, jobs and economic activity.

In a very different view, Christianne Wilhelmson of the Georgia Strait Alliance said:

""The NEB's recommendation relies on oil spill planning that's based on unscientific hope that diluted bitumen (oil) won't sink into our coastal waters. Weather and sea conditions on the proposed tanker route often make it impossible to respond to an oil spill.""

A 1988 barge spill of Grays Harbor dumped 230,000 gallons of oil into the ocean. The oil eventually fouled beaches of both Olympic National Park in the United States, and Pacific Rim National Park on Vancouver Island.

""How can you argue these impacts are justified at all, let alone based on a dying industry doomed to fail?,"" asked Peter McCartney of the Wilderness Committee, a leading Canadian environmental group.

The final decision on the pipeline, barring more court challenges, rests with the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Trudeau got the recommendation he wants. The Prime Minister has already endorsed the pipeline, and gone a giant step further.

The Canadian government purchased the pipeline project last year when its Houston-based builder, Kinder Morgan, hinted at a pullout.

But Premier Horgan struck a note of defiance, and said that the economy of the Salish Sea should not be thrown under 34 oil tankers a month.

""We will continue to stand up for B.C. and defend our environment,"" Horgan tweeted, ""the tens of thousands of jobs that depend on it & southern resident orcas from the risk of an oil spill.""",Canada's energy board: Build pipeline that hurts endangered killer whales,Seattlepi.com,https://www.seattlepi.com/local/politics/article/Canada-s-energy-board-Build-pipeline-that-hurts-13637504.php

Trudeau says the money will help extend the Highway 107 Burnside connector and build a high-speed bypass to connect highways 101, 102, and 118.

The prime minister says the connector will ""go a long way in making commutes shorter and safer,"" adding that its construction is expected to create 150 jobs.

The Burnside connector was previously announced as part of the provincial government's highway twinning plan, which also includes projects along highways 101, 103 and 104.

(N.S. Department of Transportation )

Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal Minister Lloyd Hines said the province will be spending $110 million on the project, on top of Ottawa's contribution.

Hines said the Burnside project would more directly connect the Burnside business park with the provincial highway network, including highways 102, 107 and 118. Construction is expected to begin this spring and be complete by 2023.

Deputy Mayor Tony Mancini noted there are almost 2,000 companies and 30,000 workers based in the business park, all of which provides about 13 per cent of the municipality's commercial tax revenue.

""It's an essential economic driver for our municipality and province,"" Mancini said during a news conference.

Later today, Trudeau is expected to take part in a tour of historical exhibits at the Black Cultural Centre in the community of Cherry Brook.

Black Nova Scotians who say they were racially profiled on Parliament Hill earlier this month are also expected to receive a personal apology from Trudeau during his visit to the centre.

Trudeau began his visit by attending a vigil Wednesday night for a Syrian family that lost seven children in a house fire earlier in the week, before attending a fundraising gathering of Liberal donors at a Halifax hotel.

Later, in a short speech to a small group of party donors at a St. John’s hotel, Trudeau pointed to such projects as essential planning for the future, as anxieties grow about disappearing jobs and a changing work landscape. “Our investments in science, in research, in higher education, in artificial intelligence and robotics, these are the things that potentially are a source of anxiety for folks who are wondering that the world is passing them by, and maybe there won’t be jobs for them or their kids in the future,” Trudeau said. “We’re showing that Canadians ... can be and are at the heart of this new economy we are building.”

Trudeau fielded reporters’ questions on the evolving SNC-Lavalin affair but mostly deflected questions on local issues, including the federal loan guarantee for the Labrador hydro megaproject and the need for a new prison in St. John’s. He later met with Premier Dwight Ball, who said they were continuing “many discussions we’ve had in the past.”

Among the key bilateral issues are Ottawa’s Bill C-69, which would set stricter rules for environmental assessments of energy projects, which Ball said is causing uncertainty for possible investors in the province’s offshore oil and mining industries. Talks have also been ongoing regarding a review of the 2005 Atlantic Accord, an agreement on managing revenues from offshore resources. Ball has previously stated his intentions to talk with the prime minister on the topic before the accord’s review period is up at the end of March. In a statement after the meeting, Ball said he spoke with Trudeau about Muskrat Falls and electricity rates and unspecified “social issues.” They also discussed a federal-provincial inquiry into the treatment of Innu children in care. In his speech to donors, Trudeau asked the people of the province to keep faith in his government for four more years and promised a listening ear to Canadians worried about their futures. “People around the world are mistrustful of their institutions, worried that they are not being supported in the transformations in the world around them,” Trudeau said. “What we’re doing here in Canada is reinforcing faith in institutions and demonstrating that yes, government shouldn’t do (everything) but ... the things it can do, it should do very well.” Trudeau was in Halifax on Wednesday and Thursday, where he announced up to $86.5-million to improve an expressway into the city and visited the Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia.

359,Empty,2019-02-21T22:25:34Z,"In surprising testimony, Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick denounces reckless talk, defends the government, and declares the Wilson-Raybould affair can be settled 'fairly quickly' The post As debate darkens, Canada’s top bureaucrat warns of violence appeare…","In extraordinary testimony to a parliamentary committee today, Michael Wernick, Canada’s most powerful bureaucrat, set out a vision of the country that contrasted his dark forebodings about reckless discourse drifting toward political violence, against his blanket reassurances that the government itself, especially in its reverence for the rule of law, is all but beyond reproach.

As Clerk of the Privy Council, Wernick heads the federal public service and acts as the Prime Minister’s deputy minister. He joined Ottawa’s bureaucracy in 1981, and reached its pinnacle post in 2016. Wernick was called to testify before the House justice committee as it delves into whether Liberal MP Jody Wilson-Raybould was improperly pressured last fall, when she was justice minister and attorney general, to give the Montréal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin a chance to avoid a damaging bribery trial.

Rather than sticking closely to the Wilson-Raybould controversy, however, Wernick offered the sort of sweeping, personal perspective that mandarins at his lofty level rarely voice publicly. “I worry about foreign interference in the upcoming election, and we’re working hard on that. I worry about the rising tides of incitements to violence, when people use terms like treason and traitor in open discourse. Those are the words that lead to assassination. I’m worried that somebody is going to be shot in this country this year, during the federal campaign,” he said in his opening statement.

Still, the committee called Wernick, not for his unexpectedly ominous worldview, but for insider answers on how hard Wilson-Raybould was pressured to override the federal prosecution service to give SNC-Lavalin a chance to negotiate what’s called a “remediation agreement” instead of going to trial. She refused to do that last fall. Early this year, Trudeau demoted her to Veterans Affairs from the more prestigious Justice portfolio. She later quit cabinet altogether, and is slated to testify about it all to the justice committee next week.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts, resigned earlier this week over allegations in news reports that the Prime Minister’s Office leaned too hard on Wilson-Raybould, and then moved her out of the way when she wouldn’t bend. Butts strongly denies he—or anyone at the PMO—did anything wrong. His exit raised the stakes dramatically in a saga that is gripping Ottawa, and guaranteed a tense atmosphere surrounding Wernick’s committee appearance.

Wernick said Wilson-Raybould’s independence as attorney general was always respected. “There was no inappropriate pressure put on the minister at any time,” he asserted. On the Trudeau government’s way of operating, he added, more broadly, “You may not like their politics or their policies or their Tweets, but they have always been guided by trying to do the right thing, in their own view, in the right way.”

He framed this uproar in the context of a world in which Canadians might start to fear that public figures can’t be trusted and institutions are being undermined. “I worry about the reputations of honourable people who have served their country being besmirched and dragged through the market square,” Wernick said. “Most of all I worry about the people losing faith in the institutions of governance in this country, and that’s why these proceedings are so important.”

He alluded pointedly to the precarious condition of American politics, although he didn’t mention President Donald Trump by name. Wernick seems to be afraid that Canadians bombarded by news of investigations into Trump might be susceptible to believing Canada’s justice system is also under siege. “Anybody who is following American politics these days, if you can stand it, will be seeing vigorous debates about the role of prosecutors, grand juries, law enforcement agencies, and so on,” he said.

Then Wernick made the link to how Canadians might process news of Wilson-Raybould and SNC-Lavalin. “I think Canadians need to be assured,” he said, “that their police and investigators with the powers of the state operate independently, and that the prosecution services—the state charging people with offences—are completely independent.”

He stressed repeatedly that even though SNC-Lavalin had aggressively lobbied the federal government, the company never did manage to get the remediation agreement it so badly wanted. Wernick was eager to put on the record the fact that he personally refused to meet with the company more often than he agreed, and even walked out of a National Arts Centre gala last Oct. 3—an event headlined by pop singer Diana Ross—to avoid proximity to SNC-Lavalin executives.

“There were email requests for a meeting in May of 2017, and I didn’t take the meeting. There were email requests for a meeting in August of 2017, and I didn’t take the meeting. There were email requests for a meeting on Sept. 18 [2018], that’s the meeting I took, which is registered,” he said. “I ran into SNC executives at the NAC gala. I do remember the evening; Diana Ross was there. They had bought a table at the gala. As soon as I saw that they were there, my wife and I left the event and went home, and missed a good dinner.”

It was a glimpse inside the way the powerful interact—and evidently sometimes don’t—around Ottawa. That culture can seem opaque to outsiders. Yet Wernick said the Wilson-Raybould affair could be cleared up quite easily, and without the formal judicial inquiry some opposition MPs are urging. He said the investigation already launched by the federal ethics commissioner is sufficient. The question: Were his own conversations with Wilson-Raybould, and her interactions with Butts and Trudeau, the sort of consultations with an attorney general that are allowed, or did those discussions intensify into the kind of pressure that’s not permitted?

“This is a relatively simple matter in its essence,” Wernick said. “If you strip away all of the hyperbole and the rhetoric, it’s about whether a minister felt inappropriate pressure. And that can be traced to specific conversations and meetings, and I think the ethics commissioner could get to the bottom of this fairly quickly.”

Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick said a Sept. 17, 2018, meeting between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould, which has emerged as a key event in the SNC-Lavalin affair, was actually in response to cabinet tensions over the direction of the promised recognition and implementation of an Indigenous rights framework.

The framework was meant to enshrine the Constitution's section 35, which affirms Aboriginal rights, in federal law, allowing First Nations to reconstitute their governance structures outside the Indian Act. Trudeau announced the framework during a speech in the House of Commons in February 2018.

Wernick said the prime minister met with Wilson-Raybould to discuss ""very serious policy differences"" between the former justice minister, Bennett and other ministers over the framework.

""He was aware because he had been briefed both by the Privy Council Office and his political staff that there was something of a policy standoff among his ministers,"" said Wernick during testimony before the justice committee, Thursday.

""There were different views on a very significant thing. And we were trying to find a way, essentially I would call it a form of conciliation or mediation, to bring people together.""

The committee is holding hearings into the SNC-Lavalin affair, which were triggered by a Globe and Mail report that alleged Wilson-Raybould was pressured by the PMO to intervene in the criminal prosecution of the Montreal-based engineering giant.

Wilson-Raybould is expected to testify next week.

Wernick said that he took the lead on the Indigenous framework file because Trudeau and senior PMO officials were consumed by trade negotiations with the U.S.

He said Trudeau was growing ""impatient"" in September with the slow pace of work on the framework, which was then facing a nascent organized resistance that echoed the early days of the Idle No More movement.

""He was concerned we were losing momentum and traction heading into the last year of the mandate on the rights framework,"" said Wernick.

Trudeau, Wernick and Wilson-Raybould's meeting on Sept. 17, 2018, came about a week after the Assembly of First Nations held a forum to discuss the framework. The forum turned disastrous for the federal government after Crown-Indigenous Relations officials released a draft discussion paper that was widely panned by First Nations leaders as ""insulting,"" boosting grassroots opposition to the initiative.

AFN National Chief Perry Bellegarde said in a Sept. 11 speech during the forum that the Trudeau government, which wanted to introduce the framework by the fall, needed to slow down the process.

First Nations leaders wanted Wilson-Raybould to lead file

In a speech at the University of Saskatchewan on Sept. 13, Wilson-Raybould seemed to take a swipe at the discussion paper on the rights framework produced by Bennett's department.

""But words are also easy, cheap ... too often we see the tendency — especially in politics — to use important words that have real meaning and importance, carelessly,"" said Wilson-Raybould, according to a transcript of her speech.

""We see 'recognition' applied to ideas that actually maintain 'denial.' We see 'self-government' used to refer to ideas or processes that actually maintain control over others.""

A month earlier, in late August, high-profile First Nations leaders and legal experts wrote a letter to Trudeau calling for a reset of how Bennett was handling the co-development process for the framework.

The letter stated a preference for dealing with Wilson-Raybould to place the process on ""the proper path.""

Bennett had led the engagement process with Indigenous groups across the country following Trudeau's speech in the House of Commons on Feb. 14, 2018 announcing the framework.

Bennett was caught up in a mini-scandal that July during the AFN election in Vancouver — where the framework became a campaign issue — after she met with Alberta chiefs on the same morning ballots were being cast for the next national chief.

Wernick said the Sept. 17 meeting between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould marked the beginning of the end of efforts to table the framework that fall. He said the issue was then referred to the cabinet sub-committee on reconciliation and later to cabinet.

""There was a decision not to proceed with the rights and recognition framework,"" he said.

CBC News reported in mid-November that the framework would not be tabled.

Wernick said cabinet had decided to focus on the promised Indigenous languages legislation, which was tabled in late January, and Indigenous child welfare legislation, which has yet to be put on the notice paper.

On Nov. 29, Wilson-Raybould delivered a speech in Vancouver where she expressed frustration with the resistance she faced within government in her push for Indigenous rights.

""Within government, when discussing matters of Indigenous rights, one still often finds a seeming disproportionate focus on 'risk' — speculation that the sky may fall,"" Wilson-Raybould said, according to a transcript of the speech.

Wilson-Raybould didn't want to be 'Indian Agent'

Bennett's office, referring to a December 2018 statement on the issue, indicated that the government is still committed to getting the framework ""right,"" while pushing other policy changes.

In his testimony, Wernick praised Bennett and defended her against ""vile"" social media criticisms.

""I am deeply hurt on behalf of Minister Bennett that her reputation has been trolled over the last little while,"" said Wernick. ""There has been no Canadian who has worked harder on Indigenous reconciliation than the honourable Carolyn Bennett.""

Wernick also denied a Globe and Mail report that said he privately rebuked Wilson-Raybould over her speeches on Indigenous rights.

""I am telling you, it didn't happen,"" he said.

Wernick said he has known Wilson-Raybould for 15 years and considered her a ""partner, ally and friend."" He said Wilson-Raybould never wanted to take on any Indigenous affairs roles in cabinet because she didn't want to be the ""Indian agent"" over her people.

""We walked the path together ... through many episodes in the journey toward Indigenous reconciliation,"" said Wernick.","Wilson-Raybould battled Bennett, other ministers over Indigenous rights framework",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/raybould-wernick-framework-1.5029144

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is backing Craft for the post, and she also has the support of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters. They say President Donald Trump has been advised that Craft’s confirmation would be the smoothest of the three candidates he is considering to fill the job last held by Nikki Haley.

Craft, a Kentucky native, was a member of the U.S. delegation to the U.N. General Assembly under President George W. Bush’s administration. She is also friends with McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, and thanked Chao for her “longtime friendship and support” at her swearing-in as ambassador.

As U.S. ambassador to Canada, she played a role in facilitating the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Trump’s first pick to replace Haley, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, withdrew over the weekend.

Trump is also considering U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell and former U.S. Senate candidate John James of Michigan for the post.

Nauert’s weekend withdrawal from consideration came amid a push within the administration to fill the position given a pressing array of foreign policy concerns in which the United Nations, particularly the U.N. Security Council, is likely to play a significant role. From Afghanistan to Venezuela, the administration has pressing concerns that involve the world body, and officials said there had been impatience with the delays on Nauert’s formal nomination.

Trump said Dec. 7 that he would pick the former Fox News anchor and State Department spokeswoman for the U.N. job, but her nomination was never formalized. Notwithstanding other concerns that may have arisen during her confirmation, Nauert’s nomination had languished in part due to the 35-day government shutdown that began Dec. 22 and interrupted key parts of the vetting process.

With Nauert out of the running, officials said Pompeo was keen on Craft to fill the position. Although Pompeo would like to see the job filled, the vacancy has created an opportunity for him and others to take on a more active role in U.N. diplomacy. On Thursday, for example, Pompeo was in New York to meet with U.N. chief Antonio Guterres.

Three other officials said both Pompeo and Bolton favor demoting the U.N. position to a sub-Cabinet level position, and Grenell has suggested he isn’t interested in a non-Cabinet role. The officials were not authorized to discuss internal personnel deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Haley had been a member of the Cabinet and had clashed repeatedly with former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others during the administration’s first 14 months. Bolton was not a Cabinet member when he served as U.N. ambassador in President George W. Bush’s administration, and neither he nor Pompeo is eager to see a potential challenge to their foreign policy leadership in White House situation room meetings, according to the officials.

Chris Sands, director of the Center for Canadian Studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, describes Craft as warm and gracious and said she is often underestimated.

“She’s always, ‘Oh, you know, I’m not the policy expert.’ But she has a disarming quality. She’s not a policy intellectual, but she’s more emotionally astute and so I think she is more effective than she comes off,” Sands said.

Craft is married to billionaire coal-mining executive Joe Craft, and they are major Republican donors.

Craft has been ambassador during a low point in relations. Last year Trump called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau weak and dishonest, words that shocked Canadians.

363,Empty,2019-02-22T15:31:58Z,The inaugural FP500/Forum Research Business Barometer poll reveals perception in Corporate Canada that we gave up a lot to get little,"It took Canada 17 months of grinding, teeth-gnashing, often round-the-clock negotiations to hammer out a new trilateral trade deal with the United States and Mexico, but that doesn’t mean Canadian business leaders have warmed to it.

Half the executives surveyed for the inaugural FP500/Forum Research Business Barometer poll say they think the original North American Free Trade Agreement was better for the Canadian economy.

“The perception is that there were a lot of concessions made to the U.S. on dairy, on drug patents and things like that,” said Lorne Bozinoff, president of Forum Research. “People are sensitive to those concessions and I don’t know that there was enough promotion of the deal’s benefits. So we gave up this, but what did we get? And I don’t think it’s enough to say it could have been a lot worse.”

The survey of 48 randomly selected executives of FP500 companies took a broad look at subjects ranging from emerging technology to the #MeToo movement and cannabis legalization. Trade, however, was a big area of concern.

A little more than half (52 per cent) of the executives said they viewed the 24-year-old NAFTA deal as better for the economy than the new deal, branded the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, by U.S. President Donald Trump. Just five per cent believed the new agreement was better for the economy, while a third of respondents viewed the two deals as the same.

Asked to evaluate just the USMCA’s effect on the Canadian economy, nearly 40 per cent said it would be positive, while 36 per cent believed it would be negative.

“It’s possible that what they are saying is that NAFTA is technically a better agreement than the USMCA, but, at the end of the day, it’s not going to make much difference overall,” Bozinoff said.

A range of factors, including exchange rate fluctuations, fiscal policy changes, shifting consumer preferences and offshore competition make measuring the economic value of a trade deal “a very hard thing to do,” said Robert Wolfe, professor emeritus at Queen’s University’s School of Policy Studies in Kingston, Ont.

The maturity of both the U.S. market and the U.S.-Canada free-trade relationship also means any impact from a revamped deal is bound to be “incremental,” he added.

“When business looks at USMCA versus NAFTA, the real thing to consider is USMCA versus nothing,” Wolfe said. “Nothing would have real impacts on productivity and efficiency, because anything that disrupts North American supply chains can’t be good.”

Many of the new elements in the USMCA draw heavily on the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 11-country Asia-Pacific free trade deal abandoned by the Trump administration in 2016. Among the similar elements are stronger intellectual property protections, new labour and environment obligations, and rules for digital trade and e-commerce.

Some of the biggest changes were in the automotive industry, where new minimum wage and regional content requirements were established. Higher de minimis thresholds or duty free limits for online shopping, which were fought by Canadian retailers — are also part of the agreement.

“It’s a mixed bag as with any trade deal,” Wolfe said. “Some people will win, some people won’t. It doesn’t surprise me that some (executives) see it as a little better, some see it as a little worse. Because the truth is, that’s about right.”

Despite volatile negotiations in which Trump officials publicly criticized Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the U.S. slapped tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, almost three quarters of executives surveyed (70 per cent) said they saw the U.S. as a reliable trading partner, with 27 per cent describing it as “very reliable.” About 20 per cent said the U.S. was not reliable.

What’s more, half the executives said the amount of U.S. business they do had stayed the same over the past six months while 18 per cent said it grew, suggesting the strained relations between Canada and the U.S. had little impact on established trade flows.

And though the federal government has renewed efforts to diversify trade, the uncertainty of the negotiations drove only 23 per cent to look for trade opportunities outside the U.S.

It’s a mixed bag as with any trade deal. Some people will win, some people won't Robert Wolfe, professor emeritus at Queen’s University’s School of Policy Studies

“North America is a mature economy. A good portion of our businesses should be looking for diversification into higher-growth regions like Asia and increasingly Africa,” said Dan Ciuriak, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation.

Through rules of origin requirements and other measures, the new trade agreement is “designed to fence in activity into North America,” he said, adding that other features still favour production inside U.S. borders.

“The place to look for the impact of the new NAFTA is not in trade directly, but in investment,” Ciuriak said. “The uncertainty about future market access into the United States promises to lower foreign direct investment aiming to serve the North American market coming to Canada.”

The byelection in York–Simcoe is one of three scheduled for Monday. Ballots will also be cast in the riding of Burnaby South in B.C. — where federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is in a struggle for his political future — as well as in Outremont in Quebec.

The federal Conservatives have held York–Simcoe, just north of Toronto, since 2004 and won it by a considerable margin of 12.5 points over the Liberals in 2015.

Tory candidate Scot Davidson said Saturday he's confident the affluent riding will stay blue on Monday.

""We've had a great team of volunteers going door-to-door. And you know, it's been –15 C, –20 C, wind blowing — good old York–Simcoe weather. But that didn't stop us from knocking on over 16,000 doors,"" he said.

Davidson was joined by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer at an afternoon rally attended by dozens of supporters in Sharon, Ont.

Scheer said that the current SNC-Lavalin controversy embroiling the Lilberals will only sway more voters to Davidson's camp.

Shaun Tanaka, who also ran the Liberals in the riding in 2015, said she believes voters are hungry for a change. (CBC)

The candidate running beneath the Liberal banner in York–Simcoe, however, said voters in the riding aren't focused on mudslinging in Ottawa.

""To be honest, that's not what we are hearing at the doors. What we're hearing at the doors are issues about families, and the challenges that families face,"" said Shaun Tanaka, who also ran in the 2015 federal election.

""I think what is going to affect the vote are the issues that matter to people in York–Simcoe,"" she said, adding that residents in the riding haven't had a representative in the House of Commons for nearly six months.

The seat has been vacant since Sept. 30, 2018, when former Conservative MPP Peter Van Loan formally retired from politics.

""I think our riding is ready for a change,"" Tanaka told CBC Toronto.

Undoubtedly, the Tories are looking for a major win in York–Simcoe with a federal election looming in October. CBC polls analyst Éric Grenier wrote last month that the riding has been 20 points more Conservative than the rest of the country as a whole in the last three elections.

""If the Conservatives are in a position to form a government, York–Simcoe is the kind of riding they should expect to win with at least 55 per cent of the vote,"" Grenier said in a piece published on Jan. 10.

Though she admits she's facing a steep uphill battle, NDP candidate Jessa McLean said she hopes to ""change how we look at what is possible from our governments and from each other.""

NDP candidate Jessa McLean faces a tough challenge in a riding where the New Democrats have struggled to gain traction. She said her campaign has been about changing the conversation around the important issues in York–Simcoe. (CBC)

365,Empty,2019-02-25T17:25:42Z,Scheer says it is clear now that Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin successfully lobbied the government for the criminal code to be changed to avoid a criminal prosecution.,"OTTAWA—Canadians should be outraged that Liberal politicians made any attempt to influence the outcome of a criminal case, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says. Scheer introduced a House of Commons motion Monday afternoon that would demand Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appear at the Commons justice committee to explain his role in allegations former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was pressured not to proceed with a criminal prosecution of Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

“Quite simply what we’ve seen unfold over the last two weeks is a textbook case of government corruption with those at the very top of the Prime Minister’s Office implicated in what could very well be the obstruction of justice,” Scheer said in a news conference before introducing the motion. Scheer said Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick’s testimony to the justice committee last week made it clear that SNC-Lavalin successfully lobbied the government for the Criminal Code to be changed to allow for remediation agreements. Those allow companies to avoid a criminal prosecution in exchange for accepting responsibility for wrongdoing, paying fines and reparation to any victims, relinquishing any financial benefit from the actions and showing changes to prevent misdeeds from being repeated. Striking such an agreement would mean SNC-Lavalin could avoid a criminal prosecution in Canada for allegations it bribed officials in Libya to win contracts there.

Scheer said the Liberals launched “an unsolicited, co-ordinated and sustained effort by the PM himself to get the former attorney general to change her decision. “Canadians need to be outraged at the suggestion that politicians were putting pressure on independent agents of the Crown, independent legal officers, to try to get a better deal for well connected friends of the Liberal party,” Scheer said. “That is unacceptable and we need to be outraged about this because of the implications it has on the entire justice system across the country.”

The Liberals don’t appear ready to support the Conservative motion to call Trudeau to testify. The motion would not be binding in any event, and a Commons committee can’t summon a sitting MP to appear before it. Arif Virani, the Liberal parliamentary secretary to the minister of justice, said in the House of Commons there isn’t a need for the Commons to inject itself into the proceedings of the justice committee. If the committee wants to call certain witnesses the committee members can decide who they want to hear from, he said. “Committees of this house do exemplary work,” said Virani. “We’re confident that the committee hearings will continue to be thoroughly and fairly conducted and will provide Canadians with the answers and information that they seek.” Thus far the committee has heard from Wernick, deputy justice minister Nathalie Drouin and current Justice Minister David Lametti. Lametti replaced Wilson-Raybould in the job in January, when she was shuffled to veterans affairs. She resigned from cabinet altogether a few days after the allegations of improper pressure were first raised, but continues to sit as a Liberal MP. She is expected to testify at the committee this week but no date or time has been confirmed. Trudeau denies any improper conduct occurred and that any conversations on the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin were done with Wilson-Raybould knowing the final decision was hers alone.

Was it effective?,"The United We Roll convoy is heading back west after a two-day protest on Parliament Hill to complain that the federal government's energy and environmental policies are hurting Alberta's beleaguered oil and gas sector.

But critics are divided on whether or not the convoy was as effective as it could have been, given that some of its participants seemed more interested in protesting Ottawa's immigration policies than arguing for specific fixes for Alberta's oilpatch.

​The United We Roll convoy started its journey in Red Deer, Alta., on Feb. 14 and made stops and held rallies along the way to the nation's capital.

It arrived in Ottawa on Tuesday morning. It held rallies on Parliament Hill, featuring speeches from Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, among others.

Lori Williams, an associate professor of policy studies at Calgary's Mount Royal University, says the convoy succeeded in raising the profile of some of the concerns among Albertans, specifically that the rest of the country seems to take for granted Alberta's economic contribution.

""But the problem was some of the participants were engaging in messages that were arguably racist, questions about that racism got raised, and then it became a matter of defending whether they were racists or not,"" she said. ""Now that's not the message they wanted to focus on.""

Glen Carritt, lead organizer of the protests and owner of an oilfield fire and safety company in Innisfail, Alta., told CBC Radio's The Current the protesters want the Liberal government to scrap the carbon tax and two pieces of legislation now before the Senate. Bill C-69 would overhaul how Canada does environmental assessments of energy projects. Bill C-48 would ban oil tankers from loading or unloading at ports on the northern coast of B.C.

But many participants also held signs protesting Canada signing on to a non-binding UN compact on global migration. The 36-page document lays out a collaborative approach to dealing with growing global migration and has 23 objectives for treating migrants humanely and efficiently.

Scheer opposes Canada's participation, warning it could erode Ottawa's sovereign authority to make decisions on immigration. But the UN document has also become a magnet for extremist and even racist anti-immigrant elements.

Carritt, who is also an Innisfail council member, maintains that his convoy was made up of, and supported by, grassroots Canadians who are simply fed up with a federal government they believe is disconnected from their concerns — and that there are legitimate reasons to oppose the UN migration compact.

Violence rejected

He said the movement is open to anyone angry with the Liberal government, as long as their actions are not violent.

""We've been having rallies out in Alberta for four months and, you know, they're just not listening to us out here. So, you know, we wanted to get this convoy out there so that our government would realize that Canada is connected and reunited, and what this convoy proved was that that is what happened.""

Another convoy was originally created by a group that calls itself Canada Action, which cancelled the plan and refunded thousands of dollars in donations after that effort became associated with extremist elements in the Yellow Vests Canada movement.

Carritt originally referred to his convoy as a ""yellow vest convoy"" but renamed it United We Roll after it, too, was linked to people spewing hateful rhetoric against Muslims and immigrants.

Former Alberta MP Monte Solberg, who served as a Conservative cabinet minister, also spoke on CBC Radio's The Current. He said it's not unusual for anti-immigrant sentiment to creep into such debates.

'It's an old story'

""Well, it's an old story. I mean, whenever the economy is bad, we seem to see people reach for this and it's unfortunate. You know immigration has been one of the things that made Canada unique and strong, and a lot has been done to ensure that the immigration system in Canada is one that really helps build the economy,"" he said.

""But it's also true that people have legitimate concerns about people walking across the border, and the prime minister's very unfortunate tweet about welcoming people to Canada.""

Williams said the convoy seemed to come to Ottawa with very strong demands, but not a lot of clarity or realism about what they'd like to be done.

""You can have lots of people with lots of energy, but if the message isn't clear, then that detracts from the point that they're trying to make,"" she said.

""The image, if you like, of sort of redneck Albertans could have been exacerbated by some of the people that participated in this protest. On the other hand, it sounds like a lot of people heard a message that they hadn't heard before.""",Controversial convoy rolls back to Alberta as some wonder: Did the message get lost?,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/convoy-success-mixed-messages-united-roll-ottawa-alberta-williams-solberg-1.5028399
367,Empty,2019-02-21T12:00:00Z,Federal opposition parties resumed their demands this week that Trudeau let former cabinet minister Jody Wilson-Raybould speak to allegations that she felt pressured to avert a criminal trial for Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.,"OTTAWA - “In the matter of solicitor-client privilege, the member opposite must know that there are real dangers of unintended consequences, particularly on the two court cases currently wending their way through the courts.”

The Conservatives and NDP want Trudeau to waive that privilege so Wilson-Raybould can offer her side of the story.

Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from cabinet last week, has said she cannot comment because she is bound by solicitor-client privilege, which still applies even though she’s no longer the justice minister and attorney general.

Federal opposition parties resumed their demands this week that Trudeau let former cabinet minister Jody Wilson-Raybould speak to allegations that she felt pressured to avert a criminal trial for Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

Spoiler alert: The Canadian Press Baloney Meter is a dispassionate examination of political statements culminating in a ranking of accuracy on a scale of “no baloney” to “full of baloney” (complete methodology below).

So is it true that revealing the discussions between Wilson-Raybould and the prime minister or members of his staff and cabinet have “unintended consequences” on the two cases?

Those involve the fraud and bribery case against SNC-Lavalin in connection with its work in Libya nearly a decade ago, and the company’s appeal of the decision by federal prosecutors not to negotiate an agreement that would let it avoid a criminal trial in that case.

But in response to such a demand from Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer during question period on Tuesday, the prime minister said doing so could harm two court proceedings involving SNC-Lavalin.

SNC-Lavalin is facing fraud and bribery charges in relation to business ties between it and Moammar Gadhafi’s regime in Libya and could be excluded from future government contracts here and elsewhere if convicted.

The federal justice minister is unique in that whoever holds the position is also the attorney general, the government’s top lawyer. In that vein, the government can consult the attorney general for legal advice and those discussions can be protected from disclosure.

But the Globe and Mail first reported this month, citing unnamed sources, that Wilson-Raybould felt pressured last fall to intervene and get federal prosecutors to offer the company a deal that would see it pay a fine rather than face a criminal trial. She refused.

Federal prosecutors in October rejected SNC-Lavalin’s request to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement and pay for the criminal case to be dropped. The company has since appealed that decision and is waiting to find out whether a court will hear its request for a review.

These are the two cases Trudeau mentioned in response to Scheer.

The Liberals have admitted to numerous private discussions about SNC-Lavalin, including a meeting that Wilson-Raybould had with Trudeau in September and another between her and Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former principal secretary, in December.

Trudeau and Butts have denied directing or otherwise pressuring Wilson-Raybould, who was shuffled out as justice minister and attorney general to veterans affairs last month in a move widely seen as a demotion. She resigned from cabinet Feb. 12.

While Wilson-Raybould has refused to talk about those discussions publicly, citing solicitor-client privilege, she says she has hired former Supreme Court judge Thomas Cromwell to advise her on what she can say.

Trudeau has similarly said that he is consulting Wilson-Raybould’s replacement, Justice Minister David Lametti, on what parts of their conversation can be safely revealed.

WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY

Whether solicitor-client privilege applies to interactions between the attorney general and other officials depends on the circumstances — and when it is invoked, the circumstances that give rise to the claim of privilege should be spelled out, says Toronto lawyer Lee Akazaki of Gilbertson Davis LLP.

That hasn’t happened in this case, aside from Trudeau saying that he told Wilson-Raybould that the decision whether to stop SNC-Lavalin’s prosecution was up to her and that the potential economic ramifications of a guilty verdict for a major company were raised.

That makes it hard to asses the degree to which waiving solicitor-client privilege could affect the criminal case and judicial review.

Assuming the attorney general was asked for advice about the ongoing prosecution, Akazaki says that advice “should be kept confidential in order to prevent any appearance of interference by the executive branch of government in an ongoing judicial proceeding.”

That is particularly relevant in a criminal case or judicial review such as those facing SNC-Lavalin, said Andrew Martin, an expert on legal ethics at the University of British Columbia, who added that once privilege has been waived it can’t be restored.

“I imagine it would inform SNC-Lavalin’s arguments on the judicial review, depending on what was said,” Martin said, “and they could probably use what was said as part of their application for judicial review.”

University of Ottawa law expert Elizabeth Sanderson, who previously served for many years as a federal-government lawyer, echoed the view that SNC-Lavalin’s lawyers could turn around and use any disclosed conversations between Wilson-Raybould and others in their defence.

All of which assumes, she said, that the discussions did touch on the details of the case and were not simply an attempt by Trudeau or his staff to get the former attorney-general to use her powers to intervene.

“There’s a real distinction between talking about the evidence or the legal opinion they developed to say why they think they have to pursue this case, which may reveal some of their strategy in litigation, versus a flat-out: ‘Don’t pursue this case.’ Which has nothing to do with the case.”

THE VERDICT

Any analysis of the prime minister’s assertion about the impact of waiving solicitor-client privilege is muddied by the fact neither Wilson-Raybould nor Trudeau have elaborated on the nature and context of the discussions that took place around the SNC-Lavalin case.

Still, the fact the case was discussed at the highest levels of government does raise the very real prospect that the contents of those discussions could have an impact on the proceedings and thus any waiver should be carefully considered.

“I think what he said is quite fair,” said Martin. “Don’t get me wrong, it’s politically convenient. I don’t know that he’s unhappy with this answer. But it is the correct answer.”

Akazaki said it is imperative the government provide more information about the nature of the discussions between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould, but that when it comes to the prime minister’s comment: “Based on what we know at the present time, it is accurate.”

The statement is correct based on what the prime minister has said, but he’s keeping crucial details to himself. For that reason, Trudeau’s comment ranks as “a little baloney.”

You’re lucky, I replied. I just can’t keep the ice in my drinks from melting – just one of the hardships at our all-inclusive resort in the Caribbean.

That got me thinking that I really should share all my difficulties so that you understand what I’m going through down here while you cope with snow and frostbite. (I check the Canadian weather every day; that’s just how thoughtful I am.)

First of all, before you leave for a Caribbean destination, you have to decide where to go that has a government you don’t feel obliged to boycott, or a hurricane season corresponding with the vacation days you have to use up.

You’re now on the plane but have to wait while they de-ice it. And there are no more free snacks for coach class!

First of all, before you leave for a Caribbean destination, you have to decide where to go that has a government you don’t feel obliged to boycott.

You finally arrive, and after a big inhale of tropical air, it’s crash time in your room –after confronting the 500 pillows on the bed and the towels in the shape of swans, sprinkled with flower petals. The room doors have banners reading Return Guest or Anniversary or Honeymoon.

The first challenge here begins early, and it takes you a day or two to learn it. It’s called Claiming a Deck Chair. Do you want chairs in the sun in the shade? You have to take extra pieces of clothing or books and place them on the chairs in order to claim them as yours.

So far, none of our “stakes” has gone missing, even the most impressive ones such as inflatable floating devices for children. A simple round ring is so “last year.” We have seen giant inflatable unicorns, small unicorns, large ducks, small ducks, rings made to look like doughnuts, rafts, or sun and fish.

Then it’s time for the breakfast buffet. Do you know how hard it is avoid overeating when it’s all free, and presented beside carved watermelons? And your empty plates are removed so quickly you can’t even remember that your first course was chocolate croissant, your second was mango and guava, and your third was a made-to-order omelette.

After breakfast, it’s time to claim your beach chair. You have to be out of your hotel room while weekly fumigation takes place. You haven’t seen any bugs, so it must be working.

In the afternoon, you must hone your skills fending off aggressive souvenir vendors after a warm-up fending off excursion and resort amenity sales staff.

Another hardship is the period between lunch and dinner set-up, when the buffet is inaccessible and you have to acquire food and drink from the swim-up bar or seaside grill or Coco Café or the lobby bar.

In the evening, there’s music and dancing, with dancing for children first. What sympathy I have for the staff who have to do the same dances with different children every night, and the same crafts at the young Explorers’ Club! But think how hard it is for us to get the children back after experiencing adult deck chair freedom.

And finally, you know how hard it is to type this on my iPhone without tipping my floating unicorn?

So you can see that it is really hard for those of us who help cut down on winter traffic by leaving the icy roads to you. You’re welcome.

But let’s get real: It’s not as though most people are leaping out of bed in the morning having dreamed in their precious sleeping hours of the Shawcross Doctrine.

While it is the job of Ottawa insiders to report and consume every detail and do their best to interpret how it’s affecting the Justin Trudeau government’s political fortunes, for everyone outside the beltway, assessing the prime minister and his officials in this an election year comes down to two things: the Stink Factor and the Stick Factor.

To recap: There have been allegations Trudeau and his then-principal secretary Gerald Butts pressured now-former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to interfere in a decision over whether to prosecute Canadian engineering firm SNC-Lavalin on fraud and bribery charges arising from past dealings in Libya, or whether to instead negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement.

The former would see the company, if convicted, banned from bidding on lucrative Canadian government contracts for 10 years. The latter would see SNC-Lavalin avoid a trial in exchange for admitting responsibility, giving back any profits earned from wrongdoing, and paying a major fine. The situation reportedly led Wilson-Raybould to resign as a cabinet minister. Days later, Butts was gone as well.

Based on what we know, the stink factor is putridly gag-worthy.

Based on what we know, the stink factor is putridly gag-worthy, not necessarily because of the steady stream of details regarding who said what to whom, but because fundamentally, this comes down to the perception of a cabinet minister – a person at the senior-most level of government – being punished for not doing what the Prime Minister’s Office wanted on a criminal matter.

Sure, her successor, David Lametti, and Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, are stepping forward now to offer committee testimony nuancing the tone and tenor of the discussions between Wilson-Raybould and officials, and Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau. But that cannot erase the overwhelming view that she was dropped from her portfolio unceremoniously for not following orders.

It’s the type of thing people might have expected from former prime minister Stephen Harper and his PMO, but this wasn’t supposed to be Trudeau’s style. He campaigned on a promise of a kinder, more respectful, fairer, more open and transparent government, not one that would appear to engage in a raw, cynical exercise of power.

Canadians aren’t impressed. Two of three polls in the last week show the Liberal party sinking in voter intention. Trudeau’s personal brand – arguably the most dominant part of the current “Liberal” label – is similarly deteriorating. The Conservatives, seizing upon this gift from the political heavens, have pulled ever-so-slightly ahead in the horserace while leader Andrew Scheer leverages the opportunity to show his stuff grilling Trudeau during Question Period.

But how long will it linger? What’s the Stick Factor? In the last two weeks, this government has gone through several cans of air freshener in attempts to eliminate the general smell emanating from 80 Wellington Street, with little success.

The constant drip-drip-drip of news isn’t helping. Making things worse, the way scandals are covered has evolved.

The constant drip-drip-drip of news isn’t helping. Making things worse, the way scandals are covered has evolved. Governments, their advisers and caucus used to be able to brace for a few days or weeks of bad coverage, then wait for the media cycle to turn. But in the age of social media, the end of the story isn’t determined by an assignment editor. Video clips of Wilson-Raybould standing up in the House of Commons to request the opportunity to “speak her truth,” and those of Trudeau obfuscating in response to direct questions, will be shared and shared, giving the story a viral staying power.

Even if people get bored following a complicated scandal (and they do), there will be cumulative effects. Trudeau can never smell as clean (politically speaking) as he once did. That cleanliness was a major reason Canadians turned to him in 2015. Come October, it may be that the best the Liberals can hope for is an electorate that collectively holds its nose when voting.

The only answer that makes any sense is: because he could,"There is no calm for the Liberals as the storm of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s upcoming appearance at the justice committee rumbles towards them.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons Monday he has waived solicitor-client privilege, freeing the former justice minister to talk about “relevant matters” as long as she does not touch on two court cases involving SNC-Lavalin.

Meanwhile, Wilson-Raybould said in a letter to the committee chair that she is willing to testify at the “first opportunity,” but wants to make sure there is clarity on possible constraints on what she can say — which suggests it may not be in the next couple of days.

While we don’t know when Wilson-Raybould will appear at committee, we do know she wants 30 minutes for an opening statement. You don’t need half an hour to say that the whole SNC-Lavalin saga, and recent allegations of political interference in the justice system, are just a big misunderstanding.

On Monday afternoon the committee heard from a former Saskatchewan judge who has gone on record as saying the affair should be investigated by the RCMP if there is evidence Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to another portfolio over her refusal to reconsider her position on asking the director of public prosecutions to offer SNC a deferred prosecution agreement. Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond has said a police investigation would be necessary to restore public confidence in the administration of justice, calling the prospect of the attempted influence over a prosecution “not only immoral, (but) illegal.”

Last week I suggested that Wilson-Raybould’s appearance at cabinet and Liberal caucus might auger a closing of ranks and an attempt by all sides to tamp down more controversy. After the clerk of the Privy Council’s unconventional committee appearance last week and Wilson-Raybould’s letter of intent, I’m less sure.

The appearance at committee of Michael Wernick, Canada’s top bureaucrat, suggested he thinks there is nothing to see here — that Canadians should have faith in the system because laws are “demonstrably working” when it comes to prosecutorial independence, lobbying and government ethics. “The shields held,” he said last Thursday.

As to his own conversation with Wilson-Raybould on December 19th last year, he made clear he believes it was neither immoral nor illegal. He said he told the then-attorney general her colleagues and the prime minister were “quite anxious” about the future of SNC and discussed whether a deferred prosecution agreement for the company was still an option. “I can tell you with complete assurance that my view of the conversation is that it was within the boundaries of what is lawful and appropriate,” he said. “I was informing the minister of context.”

The adjudicator of whether Wernick, and perhaps even the prime minister himself, crossed any lines will be the ethics commissioner. If prosecutors agree with Turpel-Lafond, the affair may even end up before the courts and be settled by a judge.

But what perplexes me is why Wernick, the prime minister, and senior advisers Gerald Butts and Katie Telford even discussed a remediation agreement for SNC after Wilson-Raybould made clear she was not disposed to negotiate one, when a perfectly sound plan B was already being worked on.

As my colleague Gabriel Friedman revealed in the Post on Saturday, the department of Public Services and Procurement is finalizing changes to the Ineligibility and Suspension Policy under the Integrity regime. This word salad governs whether corporations convicted of crimes can bid on federal projects.

SNC’s fear is that a conviction on corruption charges for bribing Libyan officials could lead to a 10-year ban on access to government infrastructure projects — the source of around 15 per cent of its $9 billion in revenue in 2017.

But the changes being contemplated by the government could reduce the ineligibility period from the automatically mandated 10 years to a debarment at the government’s discretion.

This policy change has been in the works for years — the public was invited to comment back in fall 2017 and the government says the update is being “studied and finalized.” A statement in the revised policy consultation said it is expected to take effect in “early 2019.”

One lawyer Friedman quoted said the debarment could conceivably be reduced to six months, a year or even no ineligibility at all. The proposed changes would widen the scope of offences that could lead to debarment, including human trafficking and environmental violations. The idea is that a one-size-fits-all punishment must be made more flexible if the range of offences is broadened.

SNC chief executive Neil Bruce has said the failure to secure a DPA would likely lead to three to four more years of court battles because the company considers itself not guilty.

But unless I’m missing something, a DPA would require an admission of culpability.

Under the new integrity regime, the company would also have to admit to wrongdoing before throwing itself on the mercy of the Registrar of Ineligibility and Suspension at Public Services. But, in that event, the company could claim mitigating circumstances, because the executives who perpetrated the alleged corruption have left and steps have been taken to ensure there is no repeat of the errant conduct.

So if the government already had an alternative to a deferred prosecution agreement that is expected to become policy in the next month or so, why did the prime minister and his most senior advisors risk flirting with immorality, if not illegality?

As Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asked Monday, if the decision to grant or refuse a deferred prosecution agreement was Wilson-Raybould’s alone — as the prime minister maintains — why did he apply “relentless pressure” to get her to change her mind?

The only answer that makes any sense is: because he could.

That’s 358 years. It was finally solved by the British mathematician, Andrew Wiles, after decades of recondite theorizing, endless computation, and manic determination (Jacob with a Numbers Angel). He beat Fermat at last.

Or is thought to have done so. I’m certainly in no position to rule on Mr. Wiles’ wily exegetics. For intricacies of this altitude, and for a cool head when under potential fire from the unruly brigands of number theory, this is the point when we dilettantes at the Post throw the switch, light up the Bat Signal, veer it west and beckon Dr. C. Cosh.

I make my own grade-school allusion to Mr. Fermat and his riddle only to suggest that the scale of the problem, its enduring challenge to the very best of minds and its resistance to definitive resolution invokes a disturbing comparison to a current teaser of equally daunting perplexity: the bottomless challenge of solicitor-client privilege.

Can Ms. Wilson-Raybould speak? Or can she not? Evidently she can speak in cabinet — for she did

The entire harem of lawyers in the civil service, the covey of external academic superstars, the top-rate attorneys in practice available for consultation on a phone call from the prime minister, the current attorney-general and his cohort of legal ninjas, the bar societies of all the provinces and territories, and at least one retired Supreme Court justice hired to represent the former attorney general, Ms. Jody Wilson-Raybould — all seem unequal to the problem. They languish. It is a real snorter.

Can Ms. Wilson-Raybould speak? Or can she not? Evidently she can speak in cabinet — for she did. In caucus? I’m unsure. In the justice committee? Evidently the authorities have not delivered a ruling on that. The prime minister can speak. And does so variously every day. Sometimes he even speaks for Ms. Wilson-Raybould. The clerk of the Privy Council can speak. Gerald Butts can speak, at least to the point that he may deny he has done anything wrong or untoward.

Can it be that solicitor-client privilege is an unfathomable, impenetrable legalistic black hole from which no light can emerge that it is currently and conveniently for all sorts of reasons made out to be? Apparently it must be so for certainly up to now it has held within its irremediable grasp all the key information that could settle the crisis and upon which a government’s fate depends.

One other feature of the week was the prime minister’s determinedly robotic turn in Wednesday’s question period. He has a very high bar when it comes to self-embarrassment.

He showed none whatsoever in absolutely ignoring the specific questions being put to him, and issuing a nearly identical and fully irrelevant answer to every single different inquiry during question period. Opposition leader Andrew Scheer asked about 15 particular questions and to each one the prime minister gave, with minuscule variation, a gauzy non sequitur about his concern for jobs and the middle class and something about the rule of law. He could just as easily have risen and said “it’s raining in Tanzania now” or “cats have four legs and a tail” for all the connection his answers had to the questions before him. The Liberals sometimes applauded the travesty, thought we must believe — they are human — there were inwardly ashamed of his pure witless evasions.

One other feature of the week was the prime minister’s determinedly robotic turn in Wednesday’s question period

Meantime if “jobs for the middle class” were the prime minister’s heart’s desire, he might have stepped out of the Commons and said at least a hello to the gathering of truckers who had driven all the way, in coldest February, from Alberta to Parliament Hill. They were there to describe how things are for working people in Alberta (and other provinces) since the oil industry has been battered by world prices, the fire in Fort McMurray, the killing of pipeline projects, the stalling on the remaining Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, and the flight of capital (another multi-billion-dollar oil company announced this week that it was packing up for the U.S.).

Most of them were salt-of-the-earth types, not the professional agitators, perpetual demonstrators and seasoned road-blockers that constitute Canada’s protesting class. There are two groups: those who make a living out of protest (see above); and those who protest (and only as a last resort) because they can’t make a living. The former in fact, are very much the reason the latter had to come to Ottawa.

It wouldn’t have hurt Justin Trudeau to extricate himself from the pointless metaphysics of solicitor-client privilege and wander out to shake a few hands and have a couple of chats with real people in real language about what they’re feeling, what they’re going through and what they might be seeking from his government. If a prime minister can make it to We Day revivals, or Women in the World #MeToo congratulatories to exchange progressive bon-mots with such eminences as Katie Couric, Tina Brown and Mira Sorvino, surely a few minutes with a handful of Western Canadian truck drivers, heavy-equipment operators and laid-off electricians shouldn’t be too much of a burden.

They travelled over 2,000 miles by truck; he had, at most, a few hundred yards on foot. And their only concern was jobs, the very jobs he was so repetitiously insisting were his prime concern during the woeful performance in question period.

In one sense, and a very real sense, a couple of well-meant hellos to these folks, a bit of listening to pick up their sense of things, might very well have had more value and more substance than all the artful, posturing theatrics of the past two weeks on SNC-Lavalin and Jody Wilson-Raybould’s still enigmatic dilemma. As between the two venues — the protest outside, the farce within — I know where reality lies.

A footnote: the plastering of the convoy with the tag that it was “fringed” or “infiltrated” by white supremacists and all sorts of other odd, despicable types was a cheap one exercised by many in the media. The main purpose of this group, and the people who organized and executed the trip, was clear as day, and as important as any issue in the country at present. If you’re going to characterize protests by whatever fringe elements may or may not attach to them, please do it universally.

In separate statements Thursday, Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach announced they would not to seek a third mandate but will remain as MPs until the election.

The decisions represent the latest blow to the third-place party, which has already seen a slew of MPs leave or announce their decision not to run for another term in October.

That list includes Alberta MP Linda Duncan, Ontario MPs Irene Mathyssen and David Christopherson, Quebec MPs Tom Mulcair, Helene Laverdiere and Romeo Saganash, and B.C. MPs Kennedy Stewart, Sheila Malcolmson and Fin Donnelly.

Boutin-Sweet and Quach were both elected for the first time during the so-called Orange Wave in 2011, when the NDP under then-leader Jack Layton rode historic gains in Quebec to become the Official Opposition.

The 63-year-old Boutin-Sweet, who represents the Montreal-area riding of Hochelaga, said representing her riding ""requires a lot of time and energy"" and she doesn't have the energy she had eight years ago.

Thirty-six-year-old Quach, who represents the riding of Salaberry—Suroit southwest of Montreal, said she was leaving for family reasons as she is pregnant with her second child and her young daughter is preparing to start school.

""I'm convinced the NDP has a future here in the riding, in Quebec and in Canada,"" Quach added. ""Many of us share the same values of solidarity, commitment and protection of our common good.""

The dual departures still underline the NDP's recent struggles, particularly in Quebec.

Not only has the party suffered several poor byelection results under current leader Jagmeet Singh, it has also had trouble raising money while its support in the polls has fallen.

Nine months after the body came into being, SJOBA organised its first Scooter Motorcycle SJOBA Rally on March 8, 1981. While the first edition of the rally saw more than 40 riders competing, the second edition also saw the introduction of cars and jeeps in. The rally, which started as a one-day long affair, will see its 32nd edition being held over three days starting March 1 later this year

“The first meeting of SJOBA was held with 19 members on July 19, 1981 and the founding members were keen on organising a sporting event. Unlike other sports, motorsports gives an opportunity to a young rider to compete against an older rider and vice versa; this was the main reason we decided to hold the first SJOBA Rally in March, 1982.,” recalls Sarin, adding how he would accompany his brother Ranjit Lal Sarin to chalk out the route. “We also came out with a souvenir publication, which we used to raise funds for advertisements to conduct the rally,” adds Sarin.

The first rally, which was flagged off from the St John’s High School, Sector 26, was meant only for the scooter/motorbikes. The four-wheelers were introduced in the second edition. The first route of the rally saw riders traversing from Chandigarh to Kasauli-Dagshai-Chail and back to Chandigarh on the same day.

This year, the rally will be conducted for the first time in the plains with the new route covering places like Baddi in Himachal Pradesh and Garshankar in Punjab apart from seeing a night stage.

“We started with the stage format and a couple of women riders too competed in the second edition of the rally. As the number of participants grew in the coming years, we made it a two-day affair in 1996. After getting the affiliation with Federation of Motor Sports Club of India (FMSCI) in 2000, we also introduced the time-speed-distance (TSD) format in 2007 apart from converting the rally to a three-day long drive in 2006, which meant that the city residents could also see the rallyists in action. Nowadays, more and more riders are competing in the TSD format too and that is good for rallying. This year we have also introduced the night stage apart from conducting the rally in plains in Punjab,” said SPS Ghai, one of the founding members of SJOBA.

Champions Speak

With rallyists like five-time SJOBA champion Suresh Rana to celebrities like Gul Panag, the rally has seen some of India’s top ranked rallyists in its 31 editions. Rana, who is a multiple winner of Raid-De-Himalaya, will be making his return to SJOBA this year after missing the rally for some years. “The best thing about SJOBA Rally is that it helps you prepare for the more tougher rallies with the same kind of terrain and competitiveness. It is a short rally in terms of number of days as well as route but that makes it more competitive too. I am making a return to the rally after some years and I will be driving a Gypsy this time instead of Grand Vitara. The fact that the rally is being held in plains will make the rally more open and it will be a exciting thing to compete in the night stage too,” shares Rana, who is based in Manali.

Kalka biker Mohit Verma, a three-time winner in the rally in the motorbikes format with his first title coming in 2011, sees the rally as a big stepping stone in his racing career. 28-year-old Verma, who became the only Indian rider to win the Raid-De-Himalaya, Desert Storm, Dakshin Dare and SJOBA Rally in 2014, is currently away from the circuit due to an injury.

“If you are a beginner, the SJOBA Rally puts you in competition against experienced riders and a rider can take him time to master the format and return back strong in the next edition. When I won the title in 2011, it was one of my first titles and gave me a lot of confidence. In 2014, when I won the titles in all the rallies, it meant a lot for me. I suffered an injury in 2015 but those wins are always special for me,” shared Verma. Two-time winner in TSD format, Jagmeet Gill also believes the same. “Winning the rally twice in the TSD format as a former student means a lot for me. I had competed for the first time in 2009 in the rally. As a rallyist, one enjoys the tough competition in this rally,” shared 34-year-old Gill.

Woman Power

Over the years, SJOBA Rally has seen more than 50 women participants competing as riders as well as navigators. Last year, the rally saw riders like Sarah Kashyap, Anita Krishan and Suzanne Bull competing in the Extreme Moto category apart from some woman riders in the TSD format. Kashyap, who had moved to Dubai last year, is the only Indian female rider to complete Raid-De-Himalaya and Desert Storm.

The 33-year-old competed for the first time in the rally in 2015 while riding a Bullet. Last year, Kashyap finished first in the ladies category and 11th overall in Moto Extreme category. “I first heard about SJOBA rally when I was kid. I never thought I will compete in the rally one day. When I competed in the rally in 2015, it was my first rally ever and I had never raced before that. I kept falling off the motorbike and I even got a heat stroke after which the organsiers asked me if I wanted to continue. I got an appreciation award that year and it motivated me. I have competed in the rally three times so far and it has laid the foundation for many cross-country rallies for me. It was easily the stepping stone for Raid-De-Himalaya and Desert Storm and taught me the required skills. The rally has new routes every year and it poses fresh challenges every year,” shares Kashyap.

Former Miss India and Bollywood actress Gul Panag too competed in the TSD format in the rally in 2010 with her two cousins and an aunt. Panag acted as the navigator for her cousin Simrat and they won the event in the women’s category in TSD format. “It was an experience to remember for all of us. My team consisted of my two cousins and aunt and all four of us competed in the TSD format. Being the navigator, I was responsible for guiding my cousin about the route and also keep a track of others things. It was a different challenge in every stage and we enjoyed a lot competing in such a rally. It is good to see more and more women riders competing in such events,” shares Panag.

Logistics Control

There is a lot of logistics involved in the rally that sees close to 80 riders competing in the 4WD Extreme, Moto Extreme and TSD categories apart from spectators stage SSS.

Vishal Sharma, the present president of SJOBA, says their task begins with charting out the route. “The chalking of route begins 40-50 days prior to the rally and we do the recce of the whole route more than five times. Then there is the task of making rule books and log books for the route. Once I was officiating as a marshal and sitting on a hill top. A group of monkeys came and took my equipment,” he laughs.

Another SJOBA member Vivek Bansal handles the communication part of the rally which means setting up the communication channels and radio for the drivers. “I am Ham Radio operator and the toughest part in SJOBA rally is to provide coverage in the valleys. Most of the times, we sit on hilltops to get full coverage. Once while officiating at Barog, we had a slide shave when lightning struck my radio and other equipment,” shares Bansal.

Kshitij Sharma, secretary, SJOBA, too has seen the action from close. “This year, more than 140 SJOBA members will act as volunteers and we have got close to 80 entries. The event has been successful because of the efforts of all the members as well as riders,” says Sharma.

The Way Ahead

With new sponsors supporting the rally, it will see the night stage happening this year. As Manmohan Lal Sarin proudly shows the first souvenir, he is quick to add, “The rallying gods have been kind to us in all these years. Apart from one incident in the starting years when a car skidded down and the death of a rider in an accident some years later, the rally has been conducted smoothly. When a rallyist died in an accident, we were deeply saddened and thought about discontinuing the rally.

But then Brother Meredith told us to remain calm and see it as a mishap, which can take place in any sport. When the car of a competitor fell into a khud, Jimmy Sehgal, one of the competitors and leader at that point, stopped and helped the rider. Such heartwarming incidents have given strength to the organisers and rallyists.”

‘My first win at SJOBA will always be special’

SPS Garcha, 65, still remembers the first time he competed in the SJOBA rally. It was the first edition of the rally in 1981 and the 1971 batch alumnus of St John’s was also actively involved in organising the rally. Garcha, who started competing in motorsports in 1977, became the first winner of the Scooter/Motorbike Open SJOBA Rally in 1981 and went on to become the national champion for five successive years from 1982 to 1987.

Garcha won the rally on a Jawa motorcyle and was told not to compete in the following editions of the rally to give others a chance.

“I was actively involved in planning the route and doing the recce for the rally. I used to have a 1966 JAWA motorbike at that time. After the first stage in the morning, we had lunch at Solan with me in the lead but on the eay back , my bike’s rear brakes got heated. As the route was uphill, I removed the brakes and continued. Riding uphill does not require much of rear brakes and when I reached Barog, the brakes had cooled down and I completed the last stage. I have very find memories of my first win,” says Garcha.

The motorsports champion also used to run a garage in those days. The following years saw him working closely with the Federation of Motor Sports Club of India (FMSCI) and officiating in many rallies besides working as the federation’s regional director. A senior steward and technical delegate with FMSCI, the former rallyist is still involved in charting the route and officiating at the SJOBA Rally. “In the 1980s, we would read books and magzines to learn about various rules and the various formats of a rally. Since the rally was held only in Stage Rally format, it would mean spending hours chalking out the route and understanding the map. There was less traffic and most of the roads were tracks. Despite tech advancements, the core of the racing has remained intact. That’s why a lot of new riders compete every year,” adds Garcha.

Looking back at his long and adventurous innings, Garcha remembers an incident during the Raid De Himalaya. “I was officiating as one of the stewards of the course when one of the cars did not cross the next point. Knowing that something was wrong, we reversed and sure enough, I saw skid marks. It was close to midnight but we launched a search for the car.

Finally. More than 16 months after he cruised to victory in the NDP leadership race, the 40-year-old politician from Ontario clinched his first federal seat in a British Columbia byelection Monday.

Not only will Singh now be able to lead his party from the floor of the House of Commons, he may also have saved his political career, for defeat in Burnaby South on Monday — as many NDP insiders have put it — was simply not an option for the third-place party. Singh’s victory came in one of three byelections held Monday, as voters in key battleground areas cast ballots against the backdrop of the lingering SNC-Lavalin scandal. In York-Simcoe, the Conservatives hold onto a Greater Toronto Area riding that has been a lock for the party since 2004. And here in Outremont, a diverse and multilingual district at the heart of the Island of Montreal, voters returned to their long-established tradition of electing Liberals, 12 years after Thomas Mulcair’s breakthrough here became the symbolic forerunner to the unprecedented success of the “orange wave” election in 2011.

The NDP leader campaigned against a Liberal government he accuses of cosying up to corporate friends, falling short on affordable housing and failing to take climate change seriously. The riding was previously held by Kennedy Stewart, an NDP MP who won by about 500 votes in 2015 and resigned the seat last year to run for Vancouver mayor. David Coletto, chief executive officer of Abacus Data, said a Singh victory is the first bit of good news the NDP has had in a long time. Under Singh’s leadership — which began when he cruised to victory in the October 2017 leadership race — the NDP has stalled in the polls, seen a parade of sitting MPs quit or announce they won’t run again in the general election, and experienced a sharp drop in fundraising from more than $18 million in 2015 to roughly $5 million last year.

Singh’s entry to the House of Commons gives the party a chance to change the narrative, Coletto said. “It gives them a huge opportunity to pivot and to start rebuilding his own reputation,” he said. “Low expectations can be a really powerful tool, because it’s easier to meet them.” Singh’s chances may have been boosted by the SNC-Lavalin scandal, which the NDP has used to portray the Liberals as a band of faux-progressive allies of big business. Combined with a Liberal stumble — candidate Karen Wang was replaced by former MLA Richard Lee partway through the race — and the possibility that People’s Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson snags votes from the Conservatives’ Jay Shin, the riding looked primed for a Singh win, said political scientist David Moscrop. “Burnaby South is sort of cooked for him to win,” he said Monday morning. Meanwhile, the results in York-Simcoe pointed to victory for Conservative candidate Scot Davidson. For 14 years, the riding north of Toronto was home to Peter Van Loan, a Harper-era cabinet minister who resigned from the House of Commons last year. That continued Monday with Davidson on pace to beat Liberal challenger — and second-time candidate — Shaun Tanaka. With such a record of Conservative voting, Coletto said he is looking to see how Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party — and local candidate Robert Geurts — performs in the riding. “The most important signal we get from tonight is how well does Max Bernier’s party do,” he said, adding the party could make an impact in all three byelections. “That will give us an indication of the potential effectiveness of his party,” he said. Meanwhile, Outremont was a Liberal stronghold for decades, until Mulcair won it for the NDP in a 2007 byelection. It is therefore hallowed turf for New Democrats, who see Mulcair’s success as the symbolic toehold for the “orange wave” in 2011, when the party was lifted to its best-ever federal election result by overwhelming success in Quebec. But now that Mulcair has left politics, local lawyer Rachel Bendayan wrested Outremont back for the Liberals Monday night. By late Monday, she had a sizable lead over Julia Sanchez, an economist who worked for decades in international development, who campaigned on an environment-focused platform for the NDP. One factor in the race may have been voter reaction to the SNC-Lavalin affair, which has a strong local component given the company is headquartered nearby in downtown Montreal and is a significant employer in the province. Shachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute not-for-profit polling firm, said while early polling has suggested the Liberals have taken a hit during the controversy, SNC-Lavalin is seen in a different light — as a big employer worth saving — by many in the province. But regardless of its impact Monday, it is too early to conclude whether the controversy surrounding the company and Justin Trudeau’s office will linger into the fall general election, Moscrop said. “I think this is a reminder to the Liberals that, boy, you don’t want this in the news in October,” he said. “The sooner you deal with this completely, the better.” Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

Tomorrow night, party leader Jagmeet Singh finds out if he's secured his first-ever seat in the House of Commons — staving off what almost certainly would be a mortal threat to his leadership.

And while he's waiting to hear the results in the riding of Burnaby South, he'll also be watching anxiously as the returns come in from Outremont, one of three ridings holding byelections Monday night. The riding of York-Simcoe, in the northern part of the Greater Toronto Area, is expected to remain in Conservative hands, but the other two seats are seen as up for grabs.

For Singh, the stakes in Burnaby South are substantially personal: a win there may be the only way to silence the internal grumbling about his leadership that threatens to follow him into a general election campaign.

For the NDP itself, Outremont is symbolic: losing the Montreal-area riding held by former leader Tom Mulcair until his resignation on Aug. 3, 2018, would send a dire signal to voters and prospective candidates alike about the party's ability to hold at least some of the Quebec base that made it the Official Opposition in 2011.

Singh isn't believed to be a lock to win Burnaby South. In the 2015 federal election, the Liberals came within 547 votes of the winning NDP candidate, Kennedy Stewart, who resigned the seat in September 2018 for a successful run at Vancouver's mayoralty.

But New Democrats, publicly and privately, are expressing confidence about Singh's chances in the riding. ​Singh has put in the work; he and his team estimate they have knocked on over 30,000 doors in the riding since launching his campaign back in August.

""Biting my nails? No,"" said Quebec NDP MP Pierre-Luc Dusseault. ""I mean, from what we heard on the ground now — in Burnaby, especially — things are good. So I am not too stressed about this one.""

""Once you spend a lot of time or get to meet Jagmeet, you'll like him and he'll be a great addition here in the House,"" said B.C. New Democrat MP Wayne Stetski.

""We will certainly be winning in Burnaby. We have a tight race in Outremont, but we have a great candidate,"" said Ontario NDP MP Charlie Angus.

The stakes for Singh

Losing Burnaby South would put Singh in a bad place. His profile in federal politics has been held back by his absence from the Commons. The CBC's Poll Tracker puts the party's national support at just 14 per cent, while its recent fundraising performance has been dismal.

With an October federal election bearing down, nervous New Democrats have put Singh on notice. Last month, CBC News reported that several senior members of the federal caucus warned Singh back in June that he won't be able to hang on as party leader if he loses in Burnaby South.

""He absolutely must do well, win that seat. Because if he doesn't, if he happens to lose, I don't see how he can stay on as leader,"" said Karl Belanger, former national party director and principal secretary to Mulcair.

Some New Democrats see a win in Burnaby South as the only way to silence the self-destructive party chatter about Singh's limits as a politician — grumbling that former NDP strategist Farouk Karim compared to ""shooting yourself in the foot.""

""I mean, you're not helping yourself,"" he said. ""Once people see you as a winner, things change. Everything is a domino effect. People have a better perspective on who you are.""

New Democrats are less confident of their chances in Outremont. Earlier this month, CBC News reported that three separate polls showed the party struggling in Quebec, scene of its spectacular ""Orange Wave"" breakthrough in 2011. The party won 16 seats in Quebec in the 2015 federal election and the Quebec contingent makes up the largest provincial grouping in the federal NDP caucus.

Those three polls all put the party underwater in Quebec — below the 12.2 per cent of the vote the party captured in Quebec in the 2008 federal election, when Mulcair was the province's sole NDP MP.

That's bad news for the party's Outremont candidate, Julia Sanchez — and worse news for the party itself, which is struggling already with the fact that more than a quarter of its caucus members have decided they won't be running in October.

On Thursday, two Quebec New Democrat MPs — Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach — announced they will not seek re-election later this year.

""Losing Outremont will be emotionally difficult, not only for Tom Mulcair, but for a lot of New Democrats across the country,"" Belanger said.

A glass half full

Some New Democrats are describing the party's byelection prospects as a glass half full — suggesting that a win in Burnaby South coupled with a loss in Outremont would represent nothing more than a symbolic changing of the guard.

""A new generational leader comes up at the Burnaby byelection, while we lose the riding of the former leader. So it's energizing,"" said Karim. ""I think people will like it and people can't wait to see Jagmeet in action in the house and to energize the base towards the election.""

But that spin underestimates Outremont's symbolic value to New Democrats — and the demoralizing effect a loss there would have on a party that still needs a foothold in Quebec.

""If you combine a loss in Outremont with the recent results in other byelections that happened in Quebec recently, with the current polling, the prospects of NDP MPs returning to Parliament from Quebec en masse are very slim,"" said Belanger.

""It is very symbolic because it was the first seat won by an NDP MP in Quebec in a general election and obviously became the beachhead that led to what became the Orange Wave in 2011.""

The hunt for candidates

A loss in Outremont could make it much harder for the NDP to attract top-quality candidates, said CBC News poll analyst Eric Grenier.

""They already have a number of incumbents who said they're not running again. They need some good candidates, they need some fresh faces,"" he said.

""But if they're not able to show that they're actually able to win, to get support in the province, are they going to have good candidates? Are they going to be able to make the case that they are the ones who can represent Quebecers in the House of Commons?""

Grenier said that if the NDP loses Mulcair's Quebec seat, it should fervently hope to at least come in a close second.

""Quebec is so important to the NDP that they need to have a sign that they still have a chance to be competitive in the province.""

Jagmeet Singh, the first non-white leader of a major political party in the country’s history, must win the byelection in Burnaby, a city east of Vancouver, in order to get a seat in parliament and be in position to go up against the Canadian prime minister in this year’s general election.

While parties often decline to challenge a leader seeking a seat, both the Liberals, Conservatives and the newly-formed People’s party are running candidates in Burnaby South.

Mr Singh, the former human rights lawyer-turned-politician surprised his party – and the country – when he wrapped up the leadership race with a decisive first ballot win more than a year and a half ago. His quick rise in federal politics has excited voters across the country.

“His leadership can be seen as refreshing. People saw him as this very telegenic, easy-to-like guy, who might be able to compete on the celebrity level with Trudeau,” said Lori Turnbull, the director of Dalhousie University’s school of public administration.

But since his leadership win in late 2017, he and his progressive party have fallen into disarray. Sitting parliamentarians have resigned; others have indicated they won’t seek re-election. To make matters worse, the plurality of the seats currently held by the NDP are in Quebec, a province where support for the party has plummeted.

Dreams dashed

With party veterans fleeing, haemorrhaging finances and weak poll numbers, the rookie leader has the daunting task of salvaging and reconstituting the party, ensuring a battle-ready machine for the country’s election later this year.

Some of Mr Singh’s challenges can be attributed to his absence in the House of Commons: despite leading the party, he remains seatless.

“Because he doesn’t have a seat, he hasn’t really been given a lot of opportunity to indicate what his message is. He’s not in the house with the rest of the [leaders]” said Turnbull. While touring across the country seems like a good idea, she said,Mr Singh can’t be seen trading barbs with other party leaders.

Some feel that Mr Singh’s status as the first non-white leader of a major political party has also prompted unfair criticism of his tenure. While newly minted political leaders in Canada get “put through the wringer”, the treatment of Mr Singh has been disgraceful, said Rick Smith, executive director at the progressive Broadbent Institute and a former NDP staffer.

Racist nonsense

At the same time, the problems gripping the party are not Mr Singh’s alone.

The broader weakness of the party also raises questions about the future ambitions of the party in Canada’s left-of-centre politics. Long seen as the “conscience” of the country’s political system, the party increasingly has to compete against the Liberals to its right – and the Green Party to its left.

Monday’s test will be politically existential for Mr Singh: as he canvasses neighbourhoods, party members have said Mr Singh’s continued leadership is unlikely if he fails to win. – Guardian",Canada’s first non-white party leader seeks path to challenge Trudeau,The Irish Times,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/canada-s-first-non-white-party-leader-seeks-path-to-challenge-trudeau-1.3803123
379,Empty,2019-02-24T20:39:22Z,"As policy wonks look to turn the issue in their side's favour in the federal election, here are a few things they could consider","With housing affordability dominating discussions in living rooms and coffeeshops across the country, policy wonks in Canada’s political parties are looking for some way to turn the issue in their side’s favour in the federal election scheduled for the fall.

“I’m not sure there will be direct measures” on housing in next month’s budget, Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters in Victoria, B.C. a few weeks ago. That could mean the government is saving popular policies for an election campaign later this year, that it will stand pat on the house market, or that it is considering some kind of indirect measures.

Whatever the plan, here are a few policy ideas the government could consider.

Allow longer amortization periods

Since 2012, a 25-year amortization has been the maximum for anyone looking for a CMHC-insured mortgage. As housing affordability worsens, some have called for the government to reintroduce the option for 30-year terms.

A longer amortization period will increase the amount of interest the buyer pays, but it also allows people to spread the mortgage cost over more years. For example, a hypothetical $300,000 mortgage on a 30-year amortization period with an interest rate of four per cent would result in a monthly mortgage payment about $150 cheaper than a mortgage on a 25-year term. However, the buyer will end up paying about $40,000 more in total interest payments over the life of the loan. Some potential buyers struggling to get into the market might jump at that deal.

Adjust the stress test

The stress test, known as B20, requires borrowers to show they can handle interest rates two percentage points above the current rate and has resulted in about 20 per cent fewer mortgage originations among younger Canadians.

Some home builders and mortgage professionals have called for the stress test to be reduced by a half a percentage point or a whole point, which would boost the spending power of most buyers. Others have called for scrapping the test entirely.

The stress test doesn’t just affect new buyers, but anyone renewing their mortgage. If a homeowner is renewing their mortgage and fails the stress test, they lose the ability to shop around and have to renew with their current lender, potentially costing them a discount.

Bigger first-time home buyer credits

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh — campaigning for a byelection in the housing crisis ground zero of Burnaby South — has urged the government to double the first-time home buyer’s credit, taking it from $750 to $1,500.

Singh also proposed some relief to renters by proposing a subsidy for anyone paying more than a third of their income on rent payments.

Build affordable housing

Conservative MP Tom Kmiec, the party’s deputy finance critic, repeatedly refers to the distinction between housing affordability and affordable housing. Housing affordability refers more generally to the state of the market and whether a family making an average income can reasonably expect to purchase a house. Kmiec says the government’s policies to cool off the housing market have actually hurt the average Canadian’s chance of affording a house.

Affordable housing refers to government-subsidized housing for low-income people which can help housing affordability more generally, as the supply increases and prices come down.

Singh’s NDP have promised to build 500,000 affordable housing units over a 10-year period, if elected. The Liberal government’s $40-billion housing strategy is based around a “right to housing,” and the plan hopes to get 500,000 Canadians out of housing that is either unaffordable or inadequate. Oppositions parties say the plan has been moving too slowly to have a tangible effect on broader housing affordability issues.

Do nothing

It may not be sexy and, in fact, it may not even be possible for vote-hungry politicians to pledge to do nothing, but some experts say it’s the right path.

Policies that affect the housing market, like the stress test, take time to work, and even longer to show results, and it might be safer to wait for more data before making any policy changes, said Kyle Dahms, an economist at the National Bank of Canada, in a recent interview with the National Post.

The election hasn’t yet been called, but both parties have already staked out key areas of support throughout the province, leaving Calgary up for grabs, according to a study by ThinkHQ Public Affairs.

“The premier does very well in Edmonton, the capital region, and doesn’t do quite as well outside the two major cities,” said president Marc Henry.

“They’re quite evenly matched in Calgary. Calgary’s going to be the battleground for the election. (Jason) Kenney’s going to take most of the seats outside of the two major centres. (Rachel) Notley’s going to take most of the seats in Edmonton and it’s going to come down to who wins Calgary is going to be who the next government is.”

The study also showed that despite efforts by the NDP to draw a stark contrast in leadership between Kenney and Notley, the underlying premise that the premier’s popularity outweighs that of the Opposition leader doesn’t hold up.

When it comes to approval, Notley sits at 44 per cent, compared to Kenney at 43 per cent. But she also suffers from higher disapproval ratings than Kenney, at 51 and 45 per cent, respectively.

“If (the NDP) were going to run on their record, they would have a much more difficult time than running on the leader,” said Henry, pointing to “controversial” policies of the NDP government, including the introduction of a carbon tax and raising the minimum wage.

“I think that there’s some overestimation of how popular Premier Notley is. Her approval numbers are good, but they’re about the same as Jason Kenney,” he said. “The two of them are actually quite evenly matched going into the election.”

Henry said that despite her higher disapproval rating, Notley polls better among undecided voters.

The study surveyed a non-random sample of more than 1,100 people, including about 400 in Calgary, through an online research panel between Jan. 31 and Feb. 6.

It was weighted to reflect gender, age and region of Alberta, according to population figures from Statistics Canada. A probability sample of this size would have a margin of error of +/- 2.9 percentage points at a 95 per cent confidence interval.

In Calgary, the NDP’s vote share is polling near what they achieved during the 2015 election, yet the governing party still trails the UCP by about 15 to 20 points, according to Henry.

He said Notley’s approval ratings are more impressive, in general, than the NDP’s polling numbers.

“So there are more people who think that they like Premier Notley than are planning on voting for them. That’s reversed for Jason Kenney. There are more people planning on voting UCP than there are people who approve of Jason Kenney,” Henry said.

“She’s probably the best tool that they have during the election and they would be wise to focus attention on her. I just don’t think that it’s panacea. It’s not going to necessarily solve the problem that they have.”

On Thursday morning, Transportation Minister Brian Mason said photo radar has been used as a revenue generation tool more than it should be, and as a result, changes are being implemented.

“I’m not going to say we’re going to shoot the cash cow, but we’re going to put it down humanely,” Mason said.

“It is not being optimized to improve safety outcomes on our highways and our roads.”

READ MORE: Alberta will review photo radar amid concerns it has become a cash cow

Starting in June, photo radar will be banned immediately beside spots where the speed limit changes on highways.

Also in June, photo radar on high-speed, multi-lane highways won’t be allowed unless there is documented proof of safety concerns.

Municipalities, who take in the lion’s share of photo radar revenue, will also have to present a clear plan to use photo radar, backed up by collision data to prove it’s being used at high risk locations.

“Those jurisdictions — whether they be a municipality or police force — that deploy photo radar must be held accountable to ensure the first two principles are followed,” Mason said.

Mason said Edmonton motorists likely will not see a major change in how photo radar is used in the Alberta capital, but that could happen next year.

“It’s not a complete final report that allows us to make a final conclusion or a final set of policies,” Mason said. “So there’s more work that needs to be done.”

Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson said he believes the city is already compliant with the stricter guidelines. He said the city is transparent about where photo-radar revenue goes.

“It’s important not to generalize about all municipalities. I can’t speak to what other municipalities do but in Edmonton, all of the money that comes in goes into a dedicated reserve,” Iveson said.

“We are also transparent about where that money goes and all of the money gets reinvested in traffic safety.”

“Edmonton is looked at as one of the leaders in traffic safety in the country, so I think the auto-speed enforcement is part of that,” added police chief Dale McFee.

There are 27 municipalities using photo radar, and the report says they generate about $220 million a year in revenue while reducing collisions by about 1.4 per cent.

The review found Calgary spent 2.7 million hours on photo radar and generated $38 million, while Edmonton spent 3.7 million hours at photo radar locations and generated $50.1 million.

The minister said photo radar can been an effective tool to improve traffic safety if used correctly.

“Some would say photo radar should be outright banned. I don’t think the data we do have, the limited data that we do have and the information, supports that conclusion,” he said.

“It does indicate there is a significant, although relatively small, improvement in traffic safety as a result of photo radar.”

In May 2017, the NDP government said it would review photo radar in Alberta after concerns the program was a “cash cow.”

The City of Edmonton has said automated enforcement is “proven to reduce speeding and change driver behaviour, thereby reducing collisions and the resulting injuries and fatalities.”

In 2018, 378,619 photo and laser radar tickets were issued in Edmonton. That’s a decrease from 458,508 in 2017, 522,780 in 2016 and 498,227 in 2015.

Last month, Alberta’s Freedom Conservative Party, led by Derek Fildebrandt, called for an end of non-red light photo radar across the province.

Fildebrandt slammed the Alberta NDP for the use of the program, which he called “a cash-cow scam-of-a-tax on drivers.” He pointed to a report compiled by his party that he said highlighted the “serious abuse of photo radar in municipalities across Alberta.”

In response, the office of the Minister of Transportation sent a statement to Global News.

“Since the beginning of the review, it’s been our goal to make sure that photo radar is used to ensure the safety of Alberta’s roads, not as a revenue tool,” the statement read.

“We’ve been continuing to consider how best to operationalize the results of our study, and will have more to say on the actions we’re taking later this month. We will also be releasing the report alongside these actions.

“Our government will continue to support safe roads, while also ensuring that the rules are administered fairly.”

Municipalities with 5,000 residents or more can run photo radar through their local police or RCMP. Some municipalities in Alberta have abolished the practice.

Most of the money from a photo radar ticket goes to the municipality. The province receives 16.67 per cent of the fines and 15 per cent goes to victim services.

Allison Jones, The Canadian Press





TORONTO -- Ontario issued a directive Thursday to Hydro One, ordering it to pay its CEO no more than $1.5 million per year -- substantially less than the partially privatized utility had proposed.

Hydro One and the government have been at loggerheads over executive compensation, with the company refusing repeated requests to slash the CEO pay below $2,775,000.

Energy Minister Greg Rickford had asked Hydro One last week to come up with a revised executive compensation framework that set its CEO's salary and incentives no higher than $1.5 million, but the utility didn't budge.

Rickford took the step Thursday of issuing a formal directive that compels Hydro One to set the CEO's base salary no higher than $500,000 with a maximum of $1 million in incentives. Those incentives must be dependent on meeting certain targets, including reducing transmission and distribution costs.

The Tories have promised to reduce electricity bills by 12 per cent.

Rickford said he was scheduled to have a discussion Thursday afternoon with the board chairman about the directive, but warned that ""there isn't any room to negotiate on this.""

""We're frankly focused on a directive that we think reflects a fair parameter for compensation for the CEO and the board of directors,"" Rickford said. ""I don't know how we could be more clear.""

The directive also requires that the Hydro One board chair be paid no more than $120,000 and board members be paid no more than $80,000 per year.

Hydro One issued a brief statement in response, confirming it had received the directive.

""The board will continue to focus on its CEO search,"" it said.

Less than two hours after Rickford announced the directive, the Progressive Conservatives sent a fundraising email about it to supporters, touting their action and asking for money.

""The board of Hydro One is trying to hire a new CEO,"" the email in Premier Doug Ford's name said. ""You know what they want to pay? $2.7 MILLION per year. For one person! We told them it's a flat-out no. But they didn't listen. So we are directing them.""

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the way in which the Tories have handled Hydro One seems to be about raising money for their party.

""I guess they're trying to appeal to their base, who I guess are folks that don't like to see CEO's of Hydro One having big salaries,"" she said.

Hydro One had said its proposed compensation framework took into account the need to attract, retain and motivate highly-qualified leadership at Ontario's largest electricity transmission and distribution provider, noting it is responsible for more than $25 billion in assets and annual revenues of nearly $6 billion.

But Rickford said that the compensation levels in the directive are reasonable, more closely aligning it with corporations such as Ontario Power Generation, which produces about 50 per cent of Ontario's electricity.

""Moving forward, I am confident that Hydro One's board of directors will continue to take steps to earn the trust and confidence of the people of Ontario,"" he said in a statement. ""I believe Hydro One's best days are ahead, and the corporation will emerge stronger than ever while respecting Ontario's electricity customers.""

The Progressive Conservatives campaigned hard against Hydro One salaries in last year's election campaign, dubbing then-CEO Mayo Schmidt the ""six-million-dollar man."" Soon after they were elected, one of the government's first acts was to force Schmidt's resignation.

After Schmidt was forced out, the utility's entire board resigned and downgrades and lower values of Hydro One shares followed.

Last month, Hydro One and American utility Avista Corp. announced they were cancelling a planned merger, after regulators in Washington state said the deal would not sufficiently safeguard customers from the whims of the Ontario government.

Jill Bennett has more... View full cove…","BC Ferries was pulled into the fight over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project on Friday, as the National Energy Board (NEB) issued a decision saying that the project should move ahead.

In its decision, the NEB recommended that the ferry fleet take major steps to slow down and minimize underwater noise in order to protect marine life off the B.C. coast, including the southern resident killer whale population.

The recommendation was one of 16 included in the new decision, which also recommended similar changes for marine shipping vessels and whale watching boats.

READ MORE: National Energy Board rules Trans Mountain expansion project should be approved

BC Ferries said it is already working on reducing underwater noise, but the NEB called for those plans to be accelerated.

“Every vessel we build is quieter than the last, so we want to make sure we’re doing what we can to reduce underwater noise from our ferries,” BC Ferries spokesperson Deborah Marshall said.

Slowing down vessels and making them quieter aren’t necessarily connected, she added.

WATCH: Coverage of BC Ferries vessels on Globalnews.ca

“Some of our vessels like a “Spirit”-class vessel, for example, have what we call controllable pitch propellers, and when you slow down a vessel with [those propellers], they actually create more noise,” Marshall said.

Last summer, the company released a report saying it has reduced underwater noise on its vessels through improvements in hull design and by using different types of propellers.

“This is going to be a long process,” the report said. “We build our ships to operate for decades, more than 50 years in some cases. New, quieter ships will therefore arrive gradually in the Salish Sea.”

Replacements for BC Ferries’ older C-Class vessels will be built between 2022 and 2030, the report said.

WATCH BELOW: NEB reconsideration report says killer whales will likely be impacted

BC Green Party leader Andrew Weaver said the recommendation could lead the province to invest in new technology for the ferry fleet to address noise and speed.

“One of the things I would like to see us exploring is ferries that have different forms of combustion or actually electric ferries as we more forward,” he said.

Marshall said two vessels that are currently being built will be powered by electric-hybrid technology.

She was also noted that only a few ferry routes actually cross through the shipping routes to which the NEB’s recommendations are aimed, but added that BC Ferries is still taking the recommendation seriously and that it will work with the board and the province to find solutions.

READ MORE: B.C. indigenous and environmental groups blast NEB approval of Trans Mountain pipeline

Critics of the decision — and its recommendations — noted that the NEB’s calls to slow down ferries and other vessels is meant to offset the projected seven-fold increase in tanker traffic that the pipeline expansion is expected to generate off the B.C. coast if it’s realized.

The tankers will all carry diluted bitumen from the coast to offshore markets, which environmental lawyers argue would pose more risk to the orca population than underwater noise and vessel speed.

“They know and they’ve already said and everyone has admitted that this project amounts to a death sentence to the southern resident orcas,” Eugene Kung of West Coast Environmental Law said. “But what the board has said is that this is justified under the circumstances because of what they are arguing is the economic benefits.”

Increasing ferry service

The recommendation came as the province also announced Friday it would increase sailings on 10 ferry routes serving coastal communities, including Bowen Island, Texada Island, Gabriola Island, Quadra Island, Haida Gwaii and Prince Rupert.

The routes are the same ones that the previous Liberal government cut in 2014. The NDP said the restored sailings would bring back 2,700 round-trip sailings.

“For years, people living in coastal communities saw ferry fares increase and services cut,” Minister of Transportation Claire Trevena said in a statement.

READ MORE: Washington state is converting its ferries to hybrid-electric. Will BC Ferries follow suit?

“Quality, affordable ferry services are a necessity, not a luxury,” she continued. “That’s why we’ve turned the ship around – first by rolling back ferry fares on small coastal routes and now by reversing cuts to services that were making it difficult for people to get around.”

Those routes are expected to start returning as early as the spring, with more services set to be restored over the next year, the province said.

Premier Rachel Notley announces something. UCP Leader Jason Kenney cancels it.

This is mythical politics, since Notley may not be around to do the things she announces, and Kenney doesn’t have the authority to cancel anything.

That doesn’t stop either of them.

Last week, the NDP unveiled a huge deal to supply solar electricity to government facilities.

Kenney said he may ditch that if there are subsidies involved and it doesn’t look economical.

On Tuesday, Notley announced a $3.7-billion deal over three years to lease railcars for oil transport.

Kenney said Wednesday he’ll definitely cancel that one. He planned to call both Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railways to warn them not to waste any money on preparations.

Shortly after that, Notley announced a $2-billion methanol plant for the Grande Prairie area. Kenney now has that ball in his court.

Notley assumes she’ll still be premier. Kenney assumes he already is.

Another more common feature of Alberta campaigns also began Wednesday — the traditional battle over health care.

Kenney announced, and theatrically signed, a health-care guarantee for Albertans.

Alberta conservatives always make such election pledges to cut costs while improving service.

But it would be unwise to assume this is just political talk. Apart from the policy issues, Kenney has a deeply personal reason for reforming the system.

At an Edmonton news conference, he talked about how his father died in 2010 after a 14-hour wait at Rockyview General Hospital’s emergency room without treatment.

Kenney said his dad sat in a waiting room chair for many hours without being seen, diagnosed or tested.

A relative arrived and managed to get him into a hallway bed. The next day, his father was admitted but suddenly died — “and the tests hadn’t even come back yet.”

Kenney said his family has never understood why the most expensive system in Canada could let that happen to a person. He refuses to be “shouted down by interest groups” that defend the status quo.

He says the system is good but far from perfect, and nobody should suffer in pain without help.

Brian Jean, the former Wildrose leader whom Kenney beat for the leadership, often tells an equally emotional story about how his son died after months in hospital without being properly diagnosed.

Jean won the Wildrose leadership eight days after Michael Jean passed away at 23.

Reforming the health system in his son’s memory, Jean said then, was one major reason he stayed in politics despite the grief.

Jean never got to take action on health care. Kenney may. He’s clearly serious about improving surgery wait times and emergency room logjams.

Kenney said the UCP will not reduce spending but would cut administration. Any savings would go to the front lines.

Health Minister Sarah Hoffman pointed out that Alberta health administration costs are actually low, even though overall spending is the highest per capita in the country.

The main reason is high wages and salaries that were established when Alberta was rich and largely debt free.

Kenney, who says he will not cut public sector pay, seems to suggest that any new money for the front lines would have to come from savings elsewhere. There would presumably be no annual funding increases for inflation.

Hoffman says that alone would spell disaster for the system.

Conservatives have often started this debate, only to stumble in the face of fierce opposition.

Ralph Klein abandoned his Third Way privatization plan. Premier Ed Stelmach’s Tories spent years trying to contain the beast they created with Alberta Health Services.

For reasons both personal and ideological, Kenney would not be likely to stumble. He is determined to achieve much better results without pumping in more money.

So far, the language is deceptively mild. But this could soon become a health holy war unlike anything since the PCs tore down the old health regions.

385,Empty,2019-02-21T11:24:14Z,A third of Canadians say science on vaccines isn't 'quite clear': poll Brantford Expositor Strong majority of Canadians support mandatory vaccinations for children entering school: poll Global News View full coverage on Google News,"As B.C. battles an outbreak of exquisitely infectious measles, a new poll suggests a third of Canadians are questioning the science behind vaccines.

The Angus Reid Institute online survey found that 29 per cent of those polled are of the opinion that the science on vaccinations against deadly childhood infections isn’t “quite clear.” And the skepticism rises with age, with 36 per cent of Canadians over 55 believing the science isn’t entirely convincing.

A further one-quarter — 26 per cent — believe there is a “real risk of serious side effects” from vaccinations, even though such bodies as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note that side effects from childhood vaccines, for the most part, are minor (such as a sore arm, slight fever or fussiness) and serious reactions rare (occurring in less than one out of a million doses with the diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus vaccine, for example.)

Still, the majority (74 per cent) polled agreed that people campaigning against vaccines are “irresponsible” and seven in 10 Canadians, whether or not they have children at home, said they would support mandatory immunizations, removing a parent’s right to opt out.

These aren’t hard-core anti-vaxxers — these are people who are being exposed to the misinformation and want to do the best for their kids, but feel conflicted

Twenty per cent of parents who have children under the age of 12, meanwhile, said it should remain a parent’s choice. Conservatives were twice as likely as Liberal or NDP voters to agree the choice should be that of the parent.

Even though a third of Canadians said they were unsure of the science around vaccines, they weren’t necessarily saying it’s wrong, or misleading, said Angus Reid’s executive director Shachi Kurl.

“If you are somebody who has not always understood why a flu shot works one year and not the next, or why some vaccines appear to be more effective than others, there can be some confusion about the clarity of the science,” Kurl said.

“We’re also in an era now that has a higher propensity, and a higher level of skepticism towards the so-called experts,” she said. “It may be that what we’re seeing is the reflection of people saying, ‘well, no I don’t think the science is quite clear, and just because it’s science doesn’t mean that it is by definition clear.’ We see this in the climate science debate, and other debates as well.”

That said, the hesitancy doesn’t appear to have much bearing over whether people think vaccines work, Kurl said. Nine in 10 agreed that vaccines are effective at reducing the risk of diseases spreading, and 83 per cent said they would vaccinate their own children, without reservation. Five per cent were against vaccinating their children outright.

If you are somebody who has not always understood why a flu shot works one year and not the next, or why some vaccines appear to be more effective than others, there can be some confusion about the clarity of the science

Globally, measles cases have spiked 30 per cent since 2016, a resurgence experts have pinned at least partly on the anti-vaccine rhetoric pervasive on social media.

In Canada, one tenth of children are going unvaccinated, meaning 750,000 young Canadians have no immunity whatsoever against diphtheria, whopping cough, tetanus and measles.

No parent in Canada can be forced to have his or her child vaccinated. Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick have mandatory school entry laws, but all three allow non-medical exemptions on religious or conscientious grounds and, in Ontario, those exemptions are rising.

The new survey found that, by almost a three-to-one margin, Canadians believe vaccinations should be mandatory, and not the choice of parents. That view held on both sides of the political aisle. “It’s not as though there is a strong civil liberty or a libertarian view that is coming through wholly on one side of the political spectrum or divide,” Kurl said.

Still, the data overall reflects some of the tension between those who believe vaccines are valuable “and those who have some degree of uncertainty,” said Timothy Caulfield, a professor of health law and policy at the University of Alberta.

“These aren’t hard-core anti-vaxxers — these are people who are being exposed to the misinformation and want to do the best for their kids, but feel conflicted, and feel that the data isn’t certain,” Caulfield said.

“The science around vaccines isn’t unclear — the science is tremendously well established,” he said. People have argued vaccines are the single greatest achievement of biomedicine. “They save millions of lives every year,” Caulfield said.

“One would hope that every Canadian would embrace that reality.”

The Angus Reid survey was conducted in early February among a randomized sample of 1,723 Canadian adults. A sample of this size has a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press

Shortly after becoming Premier, Doug Ford demanded changes to his Ontario Provincial Police security detail because he didn’t trust the rotating cast of officers, according to newly disclosed court records.

Internal police e-mails filed in Ontario Divisional Court also show that the Premier’s office was interested in retrofitting a van for his travels, relaying a $50,000 cost estimate to the OPP.

Ontario Provincial Police Deputy Commissioner Brad Blair submitted the internal e-mails to bolster his claim that Mr. Ford and his office have interfered in police operations. The senior officer is asking the courts to order the province’s Ombudsman to review the hiring of Mr. Ford’s friend, Toronto Police Superintendent Ron Taverner, as the next OPP Commissioner.

Story continues below advertisement

Deputy Commissioner Blair, who was also a front-runner for the position, went public with his concerns in December, alleging that “inappropriate political interference or cronyism” could impact OPP operations. In his filings and correspondence, he alleged the Premier’s office directed a sole-sourced “off-the-books” request for the OPP to refit an executive van for the Premier’s use. He further alleged the Premier relayed to police that he wanted a meeting with then-OPP Commissioner Vince Hawkes to ask him to replace a rotating security detail for Mr. Ford with permanent bodyguards, and if not, ""perhaps a new Commissioner would.”

Deputy Commissioner’s Blair’s most recent court filings, made on Feb. 15, include internal e-mails about Mr. Ford’s concerns and an estimate for the van overhaul. The Premier’s office says, however, he should not be accessing those records and making them public.

“It is extremely troubling that Mr. Blair is apparently using his office to obtain confidential information and documentation and then filing such documents in a public court record to further his own personal agenda in the court process he himself initiated,” said Simon Jefferies, a spokesman for the Premier.

In an e-mail to The Globe, the spokesman added that the allegations about off-the-books purchase requests by the Premier’s office “are a complete fabrication by Mr. Blair and are categorically false.”

NDP MPP Taras Natyshak released a statement saying the van proposal is “wildly inappropriate"" when the government is implementing budget cuts elsewhere. ""It’s the gravy train for Ford, and cuts for everyone else.”

The OPP e-mails filed in court show that in mid-July, just a few weeks after the Progressive Conservative government had taken power, Mr. Ford expressed concern about his shifting cast of police-assigned bodyguards. In an e-mail to his supervisor, an officer assigned to Mr. Ford relayed the Premier’s displeasure as he prepared to travel to a first ministers meeting.

“[W]hat ... is going on? I’m going to Moncton with 3 officers I don’t know. This is too much. ... I keep getting new people in the truck. I just want my own protection team,” Sergeant Terrance Murphy wrote what Mr. Ford told him after he picked him up to go to the airport. He reported the Premier saying he had no faith in newly assigned bodyguards.

“I have not formed the trust with them. I have asked for my own detail of officers who I trust already. It feels like I’m not being heard, like I’m getting f***ed around by the OPP, and I’m getting more pissed off,” the e-mail reads.

“I’m going to call the Commissioner and sort this out,” the Premier then said, according to the e-mail.

In the July e-mail exchange, the police officer quotes Mr. Ford as saying he wanted to meet the then-OPP Commissioner “so he can see how serious I am about this. If he can’t sort this out, then maybe a new Commissioner can make it happen.”

The Premier’s office defended Mr. Ford’s request and again took issue with the release of internal e-mails related to security.

“These types of requests are made by politicians of all stripes, at both the federal and provincial levels of government,” said Mr. Jefferies. “Internal police reports are by definition, in our opinion, highly confidential documents.”

The Globe and Mail reported this week a senior government official warned Deputy Commissioner Blair in December about publicly disclosing any more sensitive OPP materials as part of his court bid.

Story continues below advertisement

The OPP e-mail exchanges filed in court further reveal that on Nov. 21, when the hunt for a new commissioner was concluding, the OPP received an e-mailed cost estimate of $50,696 for the interior redesign of an executive van for the Premier’s potential use.

A Mississauga company called A1 Mobility had provided this estimate – which involved installing WiFi, leather seats, a mini-fridge, a couch and a TV – to an executive assistant in the Premier’s office, who in turn relayed it to the police force.

Deputy Commissioner Blair has alleged in court documents that this cost estimate was relayed in a potential contravention of police procurement policies. The Premier’s office says these assertions are “categorically false.”

“As has been repeatedly stated by the Premier, he requested the OPP look into the possibility of obtaining a cost-effective used van for purposes of working and travelling the province,” said Mr. Jefferies. “The e-mails sent to the OPP from a member of the Premier’s Office staff are not an official procurement of a van, instead they are a cost estimate and reveal an effort to minimize expense.”

Mr. Jefferies said the retrofit has not happened. OPP Staff Sergeant Carolle Dionne said the police force would not comment about matters that are being litigated, including what happened to van-retrofit request that was received by the OPP.","Doug Ford demanded changes to his OPP security detail, according to court filings - The Globe and Mail",The Globe And Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-doug-ford-demanded-changes-to-his-opp-security-detail-according-to/

Dewar, who represented the riding of Ottawa-Centre for almost a decade, died earlier this month from brain cancer. He was 56.

The gathering at Dominion-Chalmers United Church featured music Dewar loved — like Bob Marley — as well as prayers and tributes from friends and family.

Among those in attendance were his former federal NDP colleagues Murray Rankin, Hélène Laverdière and former party leader Tom Mulcair, as well as his successor as Ottawa-Centre MP, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna, Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson, and several city councillors. Ontario provincial opposition leader Andrea Horwath also attended.

The ceremony opened with a piano medley of Dewar's favourite songs, and a special blessing from Claudette Commanda, an Indigenous elder and good friend of the family.

""To you, Paul, may your beauty guide us, in healing, in reconciliation and in community,"" she said, acknowledging the gathering was on the unceded territory of the Algonquin people. Commanda said she was honoured Dewar lived on the lands of her people, because he understood and respected their traditions.

A memorial service was held Saturday for former Ottawa Centre member of parliament Paul Dewar, who died on Feb. 6. (Radio-Canada)

His wife's 'bubble of joy'

Dewar's wife and two sons spoke of the effect he'd had in their lives.

""I feel your spirit around me even though you are gone,"" Julia Sneyd said as she read aloud her letter to Dewar, adding her husband lived 80 years, but just compressed it into 56.

""As we shed tears of sadness for a life too short, tears of joy for a life fully lived and tears of hope for a better world ... You will always be my bubble of joy.""

Sons Jordan and Nathaniel recounted road trips, dance parties and musical evenings they'd shared with their father — saying it was his everyday actions that taught them the most meaningful lessons.

The family ended their tribute by telling the crowd ""Smile and play, laugh and dance, give and share.""

Dewar's siblings remembered a young boy in love with the world around him. He was a high energy and active child, his brother and sisters said.

""[He was] always alive and in touch with every person, problem or policy he came in contact with,"" his older sister Cathy Dewar said.

""To the end, Paul loved life.""

Politics in his DNA

Reverend Brian Cornelius, who led the service, recalled Dewar crying the last time they spoke, not tears for himself, but for youth in need in the community because of his deep concern for disadvantaged teens.

""Politics were part of his DNA,"" Cornelius said, recounting a time he saw Dewar approach a young man and ask ""so what should we do about the Senate?""

When his diagnosis was given, Dewar's outlook didn't change, Cornelius said.

""He faced the reality of death, and chose to walk back into life.""

Gavin Charles, part of the team Dewar worked with on Parliament Hill during his time as an MP, spoke of a team builder who wanted the best for his nation.

Watch: Paul Dewar explains his interest in youth

Former Ottawa Centre MP Paul Dewar, who has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, has started a new project to support young leaders called Youth Action Now. Its first major event is Thursday night at the Adult High School. 0:45

""He was honest and frank and loving and kind,"" Charles said. Dewar's encouragement to his team was always ""To do good work, but mostly to do good.""

Dewar was a champion for human rights during his time on the Hill, pushing for more humanitarian aid and help for refugees.

Dewar's farewell message

Before his death on Feb. 6, Dewar wrote a letter that his family posted on Facebook. He said his illness made him truly appreciate the beauty in the world.

""I told you that I thought my illness was a gift and I genuinely meant that. In this time in between, I got to see the wonder of the world around us.""

Politics was a family affair for the former teacher. His mother was former MP and Ottawa mayor Marion Dewar. Paul Dewar won the Ottawa Centre riding for the NDP in the January 2006 federal election, taking over from former NDP leader Ed Broadbent. He was defeated in 2015 by McKenna.

After going public with his diagnosis about a year ago, Dewar created Youth Action Now, an initiative to raise money to help engage young people to get involved in their communities. That movement will be among his lasting legacies.

NDP, Liberal and Green party house l…","VICTORIA — MLAs from all parties overseeing the legislature agreed to hire a retired judge to probe more allegations of wrongdoing at the capital, on the same day that a new report claiming misuse of taxpayers’ money was released by Speaker Darryl Plecas.

The review by the retired judge is in addition to a workplace review and a forensic audit by the B.C. auditor general, and in addition to a separate police investigation. NDP House Leader Mike Farnworth said the co-operation between his party, the Liberals and the Greens was necessary for the good of the legislature.

“I think all three parties around that table take this issue very seriously,” he said. “I know everyone likes to think we’re always at each other’s throats, but the reality is we have to come together on this issue … The public demands that.”

The legislature spending scandal began in November when clerk Craig James and sergeant-at-arms Gary Lenz were suspended and escorted out of the building by police. After investigating both men for almost a year, Plecas released a bombshell report in January into alleged misspending by both men.

James and Lenz responded Feb. 8 denying they had done anything wrong, arguing Plecas himself approved many of the expenses and that they followed proper policies.

Plecas rebuts James and Lenz

On Thursday, a new report by Plecas chips away at the explanations provided by James and Lenz.

For example, Plecas highlighted an August 2017 Legislative Assemblies Business Continuity Network “conference” in Washington state, which James and Lenz attended with 10 other people, including their wives, and dignitaries from Scotland. James, in his earlier response to the Speaker, maintained this trip was legitimate and useful.

But Plecas alleges Washington state isn’t a member of their network, and there was no conference to attend there. Plecas alleges an “earthquake preparedness” event on James’s itinerary was actually a whale-watching expedition. The itinerary also notes the group was learning about large-scale evacuations at Safeco Field in Seattle, but Plecas claims the reality is they attended a baseball game there — expensing $1,073.32 for 13 tickets.

Plecas wrote that he thinks James and Lenz didn’t properly watch taxpayer funds.

“The most charitable interpretation of all of this is that Mr. James and Mr. Lenz really did, and do, consider that all these activities — the innumerable ‘business-continuity’ meetings and trips; the myriad of purchases; the electronics; the benefits and bonuses, and so on — were all proper and necessary business expenses,” he wrote.

“I disagree, and I expect the vast majority of ordinary British Columbians do too. If Mr. James and Mr. Lenz do think that, I believe it shows a lack of judgment, and a repeated pattern of decision-making that is utterly unacceptable in senior executives of a public institution.”

LISTEN: This week on the In The House podcast, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the 2019 provincial budget. Did the B.C. NDP present a prudent plan or did government miss a key opportunity to fulfill its agenda?

Plecas said Thursday he will recuse himself from future investigations, and was happy a retired judge will be hired to take over.

“I’m extremely happy of the decision to have a jurist do an independent review,” he said. “This was incredibly complex.”

Eye-raising expense allegations

Plecas’s original report included many eye-raising allegations, including a $13,000 wood-splitter and trailer that James had stored at his home, lavish overseas trips, a $1,000 piece of luggage, $5,000 in magazine subscriptions, questionable retirement benefits and large-scale payouts of cash in lieu of vacation time.

As a result, MLAs voted to authorize a forensic audit into legislature spending, as well as an independent workplace review.

Two special prosecutors are overseeing an RCMP probe into James and Lenz. Neither man has been charged with any crime. Plecas has said additional allegations were given to police outside of his report, but has refused to make them public.

Thursday’s meeting in Victoria, where MLAs voted to release Plecas’s new report, was crashed by Mark Andrews, the lawyer for suspended clerk James, who said he was also speaking for suspended sergeant-at-arms Lenz. He urged MLAs not to release the new report until it’s provided to the two suspended officials for comment.

“They should be given the opportunity to respond to any further allegations or comments by the Speaker or (his chief of staff Alan) Mullen before those reports are published,” Andrews said.

However, the report was released, and in it he alleged that James and Lenz took multiple trips to visit the same people, all the while claiming they were comparing best practices with new officials. It says taxpayers paid $4,059 to put up two Scottish officials in an expensive Victoria hotel, and they were each given a $232 jade bear for coming here to provide their expertise, even though James and Lenz had spoken to these men on earlier trips.

“What this behaviour invites is a conclusion that many of these trips are no more than useful justifications for reciprocal international visits, substantially underwritten by the public,” Plecas claims in his report.

‘No reasonable explanation’

Plecas has also alleged that James filled his truck — twice — with wine, beer and spirits, and delivered them to former speaker Bill Barisoff in Penticton. In his response, James said that Barisoff paid for the liquor.

Plecas said he found a copy of a June 2013 cheque for $370 from Barisoff, but questioned whether that would pay for the large shipments of alcohol.

“Moreover, Mr. James has provided no reasonable explanation as to why it would have been appropriate for the most senior officer of the legislature to drive up to Penticton to sell wine and deliver a desk and chair to the former speaker, stay overnight at the Penticton Lakeside Inn and drive back the next day, billing all of the expenses to the taxpayers along with his very high salary for two days of work,” Plecas writes.

Plecas also took particular aim at James for having a $10,000 trailer and $3,000 wood-splitter delivered to his property but paid for by the legislature as emergency equipment. James said in his response it was properly approved and he was asked to store it at his home due to a lack of space at the legislature.

But in his second report, Plecas included photos of a concrete pad constructed at James’s home, which he said has many large trees in the 10,500-square-foot backyard. He said the wood-splitter showed signs of being used at James’s home.

“That a committee on which Mr. Lenz and Mr. James sat approved the recommended expenditure as part of purported disaster planning is not, in my view, an answer,” wrote Plecas. “Committees generally place their trust in senior management that expenditures are appropriate and necessary, until that trust is brought into question or broken.”

The second Plecas report also took shots at James and Lenz for other expenses, such as $500 Bose headphones that James said were for an ear condition on flights but Plecas said are still not a business expense.

Cash for vacations unnecessary

Plecas also said he felt neither Lenz nor James worked very hard and could have taken their holidays rather than cashed out payments.

“There was no legitimate reason they couldn’t take their holidays in accordance with the applicable policies rather than bank them and cause the legislature to pay them out,” wrote Plecas.

The new report also includes several pages in which Plecas highlights statements attributed to him in the Lenz and James reports, flatly denies the comments and subsequently in numerous occasions accuses both men of lying.

“My motivation here is, and always has been, rooting out what I see as endemic misconduct by these two officers, and in doing so, shedding light on and hopefully improving systemic practices and protections in this important public institution,” Plecas says in the report.

MLAs on the legislature committee didn’t vote Thursday to change the status of James or Lenz, both of whom remain on paid suspension.

However, Plecas told reporters he thinks both men shouldn’t be allowed back to their jobs.

“These are very highly paid senior officers and the legislature and the public are entitled to absolutely scrupulous conduct from them that does not undermine the trust placed in them, and the dignity and reputation of the legislative assembly,” he wrote in his report.

Farnworth said MLAs want the process with the judge completed quickly. “We are certainly not looking at a year or two years, we want this to be done as expeditiously and as quickly as possible,” said Farnworth.

MLAs voted in February to increase protections for whistleblowers in the legislature, allow the merit commission to audit hiring and place the administrative functions of the legislative assembly under the province’s Freedom of Information law.

389,Empty,2019-02-21T01:04:46Z,"The provincial government's budget included new funding, but B.C. Teachers' Federation president Glen Hansman says more is needed.","One day after the B.C. government unveiled its budget, the head of the union responsible for public school teachers called for “an honest conversation” about the resources needed to fill education service gaps around the province.

Glen Hansman, the president of the B.C. Teachers’ Federation, said the budget’s new money for K-12 public schools was not enough, and stemmed from student enrolment growth and a Supreme Court ruling that went against the government. He likened it to a freeze on operational funding.

“There’s lots of good stuff in that budget, don’t get me wrong. But K-12 operational, we’re concerned that we’re not seeing the change that teachers and parents and others have been waiting for for a long time,” Hansman said in an interview.

Included in the budget was an additional $182 million for schools in 2019-20, as part of a three-year, $550-million boost for the education ministry. That includes $58 million over three years to reflect the 2016 Supreme Court of Canada ruling on class size and composition, which effectively reversed the then-provincial Liberal government’s 2002 setting of working conditions and staffing levels in B.C. schools.

Rob Fleming, the minister of education, said the latest budget puts B.C.’s education system in better shape than ever before with record levels of funding.

“I am proud that Budget 2019 ensures our education system will have the highest school operating and capital funding ever,” Fleming said in a written statement.

“This budget provides nearly $6 billion to public schools, so school districts can support increased student enrolment, provide more supports and services, and continue to hire teachers and other educators.”

But Hansman said more is needed. Yet to be developed is “any sort of provincial game plan” to ensure educators have up-to-date and accurate teaching materials to support B.C.’s brand new curriculum, including its Indigenous components, he said.

Meanwhile, there are waitlists in many schools for special needs designation assessments, and the ability to accommodate kids who are designated depends on the district, he said. Also, schools are still waiting for the supplies, lab equipment and new technology the premier called for in his mandate letter to Fleming, Hansman said.

“All that stuff seems to be on hold” as the province continues an ongoing review of the school funding formula, Hansman said. While the BCTF was among those calling for that review, “certainly nobody has been calling for operational funding to be, in effect, frozen pending (its) outcome,” he said.

Fleming said last year that his government’s efforts to hire several thousand teachers was likely the biggest hiring spree of educators in the province’s history. But Hansman said that hiring was linked to the Supreme Court ruling.

“That didn’t come about because of government benevolence or any action that the current NDP government took,” he said.

Hansman did offer the government an A+ letter grade for $2.7 billion it devoted over three years to seismic upgrades, repairs and expansions for schools, and he applauded several other items.

“There’s a lot of stuff external to the K-12 budget that we’re excited about. All the investments in child care and the elimination of interest on student loans and the affordability measures are all things that are going to be good for our recruitment and retention efforts here in B.C.”

Hansman’s comments on the budget come amid negotiations over the teachers’ contact, set to expire in June. On that topic he sounded positive.

“Bargaining will play itself out and at the end of the day, the province is in a very good financial situation. We’ve got the strongest economy in Canada and there’s a balanced budget here and there’s a surplus and so there are dollars,” he said.

Fleming said that in total, about $3.7 billion had been provided to support the renewal of collective agreements that will be negotiated under the province’s Sustainable Services Negotiating Mandate.

That mandate applies to public sector employers and it seeks to balance wage increases with the province’s bottom line.

The 2019 NDP budget is built on a foundation of wishful thinking that ignores the realities of B.C.’s economy and the world around us.

Horgan came to power two years ago on promises of $10-a-day daycare, a $400 renters’ subsidy and a general pledge to make life more affordable. Since then, he has introduced 19 new or increased taxes, gone back on his daycare and rental subsidy promises and done nothing to effectively respond to growing housing unaffordability. British Columbians had high hopes for real solutions and concrete action in 2019.

Unfortunately, these hopes were dashed on Tuesday as Horgan revealed a do-nothing provincial budget featuring a significant increase in government expenditures, still no renters’ rebate, a watered down child care benefit that won’t kick in until the end of 2020 and a speculation tax that treats 1.6 million B.C. homeowners as speculators until proven innocent. In the next year, taxes are going up nearly $1,100 per person. This will also be the year of the now-infamous “double dip” as the NDP continues to charge MSP while simultaneously charging its higher replacement, the Employer Health Tax.

It’s not all bad news though. The proposed rate increase for foster parents and home-share providers is long overdue. We also welcome eliminating student loan interest and providing new funding for youth mental-health supports to expand B.C. Liberal initiatives like the Foundry. Unfortunately, those small measures will do little to solve the systemic affordability problems left unaddressed in this budget.

The people of British Columbia are starting to feel duped. This government’s actions have raised the cost of living and jeopardized the economic growth on which the NDP has pinned all hopes of paying for their spending spree going forward. You’ll have less money to spend and it will be harder than ever for those struggling with the affordability crisis to secure their futures.

Finance Minister Carole James is barely balancing her budget despite the fact that, since taking power, she has increased taxes by billions on individuals, homeowners and businesses. She and Horgan blindly spent the healthy surplus left behind by the former B.C. Liberal government and got lucky with a lucrative transfer payment from the federal government. If not for that federal transfer, B.C. would be facing an $800-million deficit today.

Perhaps worst of all, this budget demonstrated no long-term vision or economic plan for our province. The B.C. Chamber of Commerce stated that business confidence has plummeted, with the number of businesses that believe this government supports them dropping by half over the past two years.

With no actions laid out in this budget to stimulate investment or private-sector growth, that measure of confidence along with economic growth may fall even further. The NDP admits B.C.’s economy will be slowing down, with housing starts and other measures decreasing but takes no responsibility for causing the downturn.

With 2019 as the year of the double dip, along with a slew of other new and increased taxes hitting our wallets, people across this province are going to start to feel the impact of this government placing the financial burden for their fiscal irresponsibility on the backs of hard-working British Columbians, businesses and municipalities. Over the next three years, the NDP will have increased taxes by $1,568 per person since coming to power. There are storm clouds on the horizon, but the NDP blindly insists everything is OK. It’s not.

We deserve a government that grows the economy and focuses on real opportunity for all of us. We deserve better.

""We're still hopeful there will be a separate announcement before the end of the fiscal year, but we're trying hard to crunch numbers now and see what we can carry forward past March.""

B.C. has 80 recognized search and rescue groups with 2,500 volunteers who respond to over 1,800 incidents annually across the province.

Funding for incident response is guaranteed by the province but funding for volunteer training, public education programs is unpredictable.

'On the radar' says NDP

When asked about the absence of SAR funding in the budget, Finance Minister Carole James said the NDP's plan for SAR is still under discussion.

""[It's] certainly on the radar of the minister and those discussions, I know, will continue, to make sure we can provide support for the incredible volunteers and the incredible organizations.

""We're getting into avalanche season and we've seen the incredible work that they provide in communities,"" she said.

Current funding model

In 2016, the Liberal government announced a one-time grant of $10 million for B.C. SAR, and the association received another $5 million from the NDP last year.

This money has gone towards avalanche safety education, peer support and training for SAR volunteers, as well as replacement safety equipment like rope. Volunteers pay out of pocket for their personal attire.

The association has been in discussion with the province since 2013 about the need for guaranteed funding to continue operations. B.C. SAR was hoping for a yearly commitment from the NDP in Budget 2019.

392,Empty,2019-02-21T14:00:06Z,Opinion: Bill Tieleman offers a behind-the-scenes glimpse at the electoral reform referendum from the perspective of the winners,"“Strategy is the single most important element in a political campaign.”

— Hawaiian political strategist Bob Oshira

How was proportional representation defeated in a decisive third British Columbia binding referendum – despite it having a clear lead in the polls and full support from the New Democratic Party provincial government, its B.C. Green Party allies and several prominent advocacy groups?

And how did a result that two major polling firms called “too close to call” after mail-in balloting ended on Dec. 7, 2018, turn into a 61 to 39 per cent drubbing of proportional representation?

As president of the official opponent group, the No BC Proportional Representation Society, and leader of two previously successful defenses of our current First Past the Post electoral system in 2005 and 2009, as well as strategist for Fight HST, which eliminated the Harmonized Sales Tax in a 2011 referendum, I have a fair bit of experience to draw conclusions from.

Three reasons are important:

1. Campaign strategy matters greatly.

2. Clarity tops confusion.

3. Strategic advertising moves opinions.

Here’s what happened.

Just after the provincial election in May of 2017, pollsters Ipsos found that 54 per cent of respondents wanted to change to a proportional representation electoral system, while just 20 per cent supported our current First Past The Post system and 26 per cent were undecided.

By May 2018, the Angus Reid Institute polling found that 57 per cent of respondents wanted to change from our First Past the Post electoral system to some form of Proportional Representation, with just 43 per cent in favour of FPTP.

But that was before any campaigning started and before the government announced in June 2018 the ballot question and outlined that not one but three different forms of proportional representation would be voted on – two of which did not exist anywhere in the world.

And that changed everything.

Prior to the official campaign period starting July 1, both sides began vigorous efforts to influence public opinion – but with very different approaches.

As a lifelong New Democrat, I was happy to accept an offer from Suzanne Anton, the former B.C. Liberal attorney general, to join me, along with our neutral colleague from the past two referenda, retired ex-deputy minister Bob Plecas. As the three Society directors we were ably aided by veteran political strategist and fundraiser Jess Ketchum and our campaign coordinator Kent Verge, with experience in provincial and federal elections.

Anton, Plecas and I spoke at dozens of events across B.C. and did countless media interviews, with a central campaign backed by local volunteers, generous personal donors and very strong Chinese-Canadian and South Asian campaign teams that clearly moved votes in many key ridings – as the final results showed.

Our strategy was to emphasize a non-partisan – or cross-partisan – appeal to voters from all three major parties who shared our belief that FPTP had served the province well, despite our political differences. Just the fact that obvious adversaries like Anton and myself were willing to work together was newsworthy.

It was also very important that former NDP Premier Ujjal Dosanjh was an early supporter, as were some labour and party activists, showing voters that support for proportional representation was far from unanimous within the NDP. In fact, polling showed about 35 per cent of NDP voters favoured FPTP.

And former NDP Premier Glen Clark publicly stated during the campaign that he would vote for FPTP.

Meanwhile, B.C. Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson and his caucus strongly fought proportional representation in the Legislature and at the riding level. Business groups such as the B.C. Chamber of Commerce also publicly criticized the referendum process and supported FPTP, fearing the instability of proportional representation.

The proportional representation Yes side had to overcome an early split between two conflicting groups but did eventually consolidate to create Vote PR BC as the official proponent group. It also brought together some unions, advocacy groups like the Broadbent Institute, LeadNow, Dogwood Initiative, the Canadian Federation of Students and both the BC NDP and BC Green parties.

But it tellingly lacked noticeable support from businesses or prominent B.C. Liberals.

And the proportional representation side was firmly tied to government decisions on the ballot and proposals drafted by NDP Attorney General David Eby and the referendum campaigns of Premier John Horgan and Green leader Andrew Weaver. But despite some criticism of the process, the pro-rep side started well ahead.

The differences in campaigns were soon even clearer.

Our No campaign started quickly with a hard-hitting series of specially targeted ads on social media attacking the confusion and complicated consequences of voting for a dramatic change.

There was a strong emphasis on the disturbing results of European elections, where proportional representation has allowed far-right parties in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and other countries to gain seats in parliament, giving them enormous influence or even the balance of power without winning significant geographic seats.

While proportional representation did not create extremism, we pointed out, it did enable extremists to enter parliament, gain a platform for their hateful views and stoke anti-immigrant attitudes by merely obtaining five per cent or less of the cross-country popular vote.

By comparison in the United Kingdom’s 2015 election, the far-right U.K. Independence Party took 12.6 per cent of the vote but only one of 650 Parliamentary seats, thanks to First Past the Post – which demands winning MPs have strong local support, not country-wide marginal votes.

[UKIP was all but wiped out in the following 2017 election, dropping to just 1.8 per cent and no seats.]

But Vote PR BC’s pre-campaign approach was not advertising to sell proportional representation to voters or counter our arguments but instead apparently focused on voter identification, using phone banks and canvassing to build a database for use in the eventual mail balloting period.

Vote PR BC presumed its base was strong enough to win without advertising reinforcement – so long as their voters turned out – but that turned out to be an error.

And these strong differences carried through even more clearly in the official campaign period of July 1 to Dec. 7, 2018.

The No side relied heavily on strong, repeated messaging in media, backed by powerful strategic advertising developed by our campaign in concert with Curve Communications – the firm founded by former Vancouver city councillor George Affleck. We also relied on very accurate opinion research polling by Ipsos that tested our campaign messaging and attacked the foundations of proportional representation, namely that it:

• was complicated and confusing;

• led to extremists winning seats with a tiny fraction of votes as in Germany, Austria and other European nations;

• would lead to loss of local representation and more party-controlled seats coming from pools of candidates used to create proportionality; and

• could adopt systems proposed that were untried or little used – with two of the three B.C. models untested anywhere and mixed member proportional only in four countries – while most pro-rep countries use proportional representation list systems – which were never on the ballot or seriously considered;

• compared poorly to First Past the Post, which by comparison is simple, stable and successful – the foundation of democracy in the United Kingdom for centuries and many other countries around the world.

That advertising – partly funded by significant personal donations from individual British Columbians – ran on TV, radio online and in print – and it was also controversial.

The most prominent ad showed scenes from Europe talking about the problems of extremism under proportional representation, ending with marching soldiers and the sound of their boots – and it hit a major nerve, with criticism claiming it was unfair.

But in our view it was both very accurate – and absolutely necessary to wake up voters. It started a vigorous province-wide discussion of extremism, which resonated particularly in immigrant communities.

The ad was needed because British Columbians were never excited about this referendum. Nor had they been widely consulted or informed because of a rushed process that met the NDP and Green parties’ legislative agreement timetable – but it didn’t create the social consensus needed for such a significant change.

To get around that, the government had already reduced the need previously set out in the Referendum Act to achieve 60 per cent of all votes and get 60 per cent of all 87 ridings to at least vote in favour of change – the standard set for both 2005 and 2009 votes.

Instead a vote of just 50 per cent plus one would change our entire electoral system, without any need to win regional riding support, meaning Metro Vancouver could technically make the decision because of the huge number of voters there.

And the rush job meant there were over 30 “details” left to be determined after the referendum should it pass – including providing riding maps; the number of votes each voter would have – one or two; and how many candidates per riding – with a range of from one to seven, depending on the system chosen.

Those facts informed our second and third television and social media ads.

The second showed a woman trying to reach her local MLA by phone only to find the office had been closed – a fair comment on the fact that under the proposed mixed member proportional system, 40 per cent of MLAs would come from pools of candidates, not directly elected locally in geographic ridings.

The third ad was simplicity itself – actual British Columbians were filmed reacting to proportional representation – and not surprisingly, they said it was “complicated and confusing” – which re-confirmed for many voters their existing worries about changing systems to something they did not understand. Together the three ads encapsulated all of the concerns voters had about proportional representation – and reminded them why it was important to cast a ballot.

While we were working hard to win votes, some political observers and media maintained the theory that the NDP government was actually trying to “lose the referendum.”

That idea met with great derision from our team. Without question the entire process had been set up to help the proportional representation side win – it just wasn’t either sufficient or a good enough strategy – but we objected repeatedly to the unfair advantages given.

More importantly, our core messages of complicated and confusing proportional representation – especially by comparison to simple, stable and success First Past The Post – were amplified by our advertising, which was also driven by our private polling.

Ipsos pollster Kyle Braid showed us that shortly after our aggressive advertising campaign began, we were doing much better, but still 20 per cent behind our goals.

But by August we had taken a lead, with 41 per cent definitely or likely voting FPTP, to 28 per cent definitely or likely voting proportional representation and 27 per cent still undecided; and by November we continued trending upward as the ballot deadline approached, leading by 43 to 29 points, with 21 per cent undecided.

And an Ipsos exit poll after voting closed Dec. 7 had us winning with 59 to 41 per cent, just two points off the actual results, also showing that the referendum was not at all, as some said, “too close to call”!

While our numbers clearly showed the Yes side sliding into trouble by August, by comparison to our campaign, they did not run a significant advertising campaign in traditional media – TV, radio, print – and made a limited social media effort.

Their strategy was, apparently, to continue identifying supportive voters via telephoning and canvassing and focus on getting them to mail in their ballots. Their social media campaign was reactive to our messaging – and sometimes their supporting groups wrongly used personal attacks.

The pro-rep campaign intent appeared to be to low-ball the entire referendum and win with GOTV – get out the vote – with a relatively modest voter turnout that would maximize its efforts.

But the pro rep strategy was a mistake – it did not make adjustments, as Carville advises.

One simple story to illustrate that. While buying groceries in late November, a young male clerk of South Asian descent asked me about what my “No Pro Rep” button on my jacket meant.

I told him it expressed my strong opposition to proportional representation.

He quickly replied: “Oh, that’s how extremists get elected.”

I heartily agreed, as it was very clear our messaging was reaching far and wide. And outside Metro Vancouver we heard equally strong concerns about losing local MLAs to party lists and urban votes.

In the end, a combination of factors led to the second crushing defeat in nine years for proportional representation.

Our volunteer team worked closely for a year, running a strong central campaign based on tested messaging that reflected the concerns of voters, combined with powerful advertising. We achieved the best possible result – the very wide margin of victory needed to ensure that proportional representation is off the political agenda.

Justin Trudeau’s chief of staff, Katie Telford, and principal secretary, Gerald Butts — who quit last week, denying any improper PMO conduct — spoke to Jody Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff, Jessica Prince, a PMO official said late Friday.

The prime minister dodged several direct questions about why he, his former principal secretary Gerald Butts and Wernick continued to speak to Jody Wilson-Raybould about a possible remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin for months after the director of public prosecutions had rejected it. ( Riley Smith / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

Prince answers to Telford within the ranks of political staff. The Prime Minister’s Office would not detail the nature of their exchange. But privy council clerk Michael Wernick told a committee during his testimony Thursday that the conversation among staffers for each office — whom he did not name — may be raised by Wilson-Raybould as a concern if and when she ever goes public.

“I can’t get into any actual details of the conversation itself,” said Trudeau spokesperson Cameron Ahmad. “Any conversations that were had, whether it was this one or any of the other ones that have been referenced, all fall under the category of what the prime minister has described and, frankly, what the clerk described as appropriate conversations where everything was discussed in a proper way.”

Article Continued Below

Until now it had not been clear that Telford had any contact with the SNC-Lavalin file. The PMO has previously said Telford never spoke to Wilson-Raybould directly on the matter. Wernick defended the actions of Trudeau, his senior aides and himself on the file, but conceded Wilson-Raybould may have seen things differently. “How she interprets or perceives those conversations, she can tell you next week. “I can tell you my view very firmly is that they were entirely appropriate, lawful, legal. I’m prepared to submit to the judgment of the ethics commissioner on that,” Wernick testified. The Conservative official Opposition said there may be grounds for the RCMP to investigate whether pressure put on the former attorney general in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution amounted to obstruction of justice. Conservative MP Michael Cooper, a member of the Commons justice committee, told reporters it was clear based on Wernick’s testimony Thursday that Wilson-Raybould was subjected to pressure to negotiate a remediation agreement with the Quebec company long after the director of public prosecutions rejected it. “I think there’s certainly a strong basis to be made for an RCMP investigation,” Cooper said.

The Conservatives went further in question period Friday, charging that efforts by Trudeau and his senior aides to make Wilson-Raybould “change her mind” crossed the line. “With everything we now know, how is this not obstruction of justice by the prime minister?” said Conservative MP John Brassard. Government house Leader Bardish Chagger highlighted Wernick’s testimony that Trudeau had always made clear the final decision on any deferred prosecution the SNC-Lavalin rested with Wilson-Raybould. On Friday, Trudeau was asked if he viewed any of Wernick’s interactions with Wilson-Raybould as applying undue pressure on her, but he declined to pass judgment. He pointed to “mechanisms to look into exactly those kinds of issues. We have an ethics commissioner who’s pursing an investigation, we have a parliamentary committee.” Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith broke ranks with his party mid-week and voted to support the opposition’s unsuccessful call for a judicial inquiry because he said he doesn’t believe the ethics commissioner has a mandate to get to the heart of the matter. Ethics commissioner Mario Dion said he would look at a possible breach of section 9 of the Conflict of Interest Act, which prohibits a public office holder from seeking to influence a decision of another person so as to improperly further another person’s private interests. Erskine-Smith said when it comes to the merits of a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin, “whether or not an intervention (by the PMO) may have been justified in substance, the real question is the nature of that intervention. Specifically, was undue pressure exerted, contrary to the constitutional convention of attorney general independence? “In the end, citizens deserve the truth,” he said. “The truth, like confidence in our public institutions, depends on a serious commitment to openness and transparency.” Trudeau has not yet committed to lifting the limitations of solicitor-client secrecy on Wilson-Raybould, saying he awaits legal advice from her successor, David Lametti. On Friday, Trudeau urged Canadians to “heed” the testimony of Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant, who serves as the prime minister’s deputy minister and secretary to cabinet. Wernick said the former attorney general may have felt pressure to “get it right” on the SNC-Lavalin prosecution but that nobody applied inappropriate or undue pressure. He rejected suggestions the director of public prosecutions had already dismissed the option of a remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin, and even suggested it continued to be an option. “The decision had not already been made,” Wernick told reporters, defending his conversation with Wilson-Raybould on Dec. 19. “She had and continued to have authorities under the law, and it is entirely legal and lawful and appropriate under the Shawcross doctrine to inform a minister of the context in which she’s taking a decision.” Speaking in St. John’s Friday morning, Trudeau dodged several direct questions about why he, Gerald Butts and Wernick continued to speak to Wilson-Raybould, the then justice minister, about a possible remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin even after the director of public prosecutions had already rejected it. Trudeau repeatedly answered by declaring the “fundamental responsibilities of any government” is to protect and promote jobs while upholding institutions, respecting the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. Trudeau called Wernick “an extraordinary public servant who has served this country under governments of different political stripes with integrity and brilliance.” Trudeau added Wernick “is someone who we need to heed very carefully when he chooses to express himself publicly.” Wilson-Raybould — who has stated she hopes to be able to “speak my truth” — is expected to appear before the justice committee next week. Lametti said Friday, “We are working to try to find a way such that the former attorney general can, in fact, speak. We are doing our level best to do that.” Wernick, who is not a lawyer, all but scoffed at Wilson-Raybould’s claim to be bound by solicitor-client privilege. The blunt-talking privy council clerk said the matter was “never” discussed at cabinet, and that no solicitor-client privilege attaches to the discussions because Wilson-Raybould was never “advising” the government on the matter. He said the only thing that ever took place were “lawful” discussions about the impact of potential criminal liability on the company.

A ban on corporate and union donations has made selling the tickets a challenge.","The Progressive Conservatives’ decision to enlist lobbyists to peddle $1,250 tickets to Doug Ford’s upcoming fundraiser suggests the governing party is selling access to the premier, charges Democracy Watch. Duff Conacher, co-founder of the non-partisan organization that advocates for democratic reform and government accountability, expressed concern after the Star first revealed the Tories urged lobbyists to sell tickets to Wednesday’s fundraiser.

Ontario Progressive Conservative leader Doug Ford: “We’ve put fundraisers together that are $25-spaghetti dinners as you know, so we have the freebies, we have the $25-fundraisers, and then we have the big fundraiser,” the premier said of the event, which should make the Tories $2 million. ( Aaron Vincent Elkaim / THE CANADIAN PRESS file photo )

“The PC Party asking lobbyists to sell high-priced tickets to the premier’s fundraising event shows that the Ford government is willing to sell access to the premier for cash, and to trade favours with lobbyists, in violation of the interests of the people of Ontario,” he said. Conacher, an adjunct professor of law and politics at the University of Ottawa, said the governing party will “feel compelled to return the favour by protecting the interests of the lobbyists’ clients. “That means the public interest will be violated.”

“I can tell you one thing: no one can influence Doug Ford. No one can influence my ministers or my caucus,” he said during a trade mission to Washington. “We’ve put fundraisers together that are $25-spaghetti dinners as you know, so we have the freebies, we have the $25-fundraisers, and then we have the big fundraiser,” the premier said of the Toronto Congress Centre event Wednesday that should make the Tories $2 million.

“We have to run campaigns.” As disclosed by the Star on Thursday, the Tories appealed to lobbyists for help due to the tightened rules around political fundraising introduced in 2016 by the previous Liberal government. The ban on corporate and union donations has made selling tickets a challenge. Until the changes three years ago, which were triggered by a Star probe of Liberal political fundraising excesses, companies could purchase entire tables for dinners and then give the tickets to employees, associates or clients. But now, each ticket must be paid for by an individual. In an email appeal to clients obtained by the Star, Chris Benedetti, a principal at Sussex Strategy Group, a firm run by Conservatives and Liberals, said the company “has been asked to help with the event.” “The event is $12,500 for a table of 10 ($1,250/person). To reserve a table, please let us know, and we can assist you in assembling individual registrations to then be sent in as a package,” he wrote. Benedetti, registered to lobby for 60 different companies at Queen’s Park, said he was contacted by the PC Ontario Fund last month. “I have not spoken to anyone in the premier’s office about this event, and no one in the office or any other government office has been in touch with me to encourage sales or otherwise,” he said. Another lobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wants to continue to do business with the Tories, said there has been “tremendous pressure” on his company to sell tickets. “You’re really made to feel that you’re not pulling your weight if you don’t sell a table or two,” the consultant said. NDP MPP Taras Natyshak (Essex) said Friday that “Doug Ford’s threat-based racket looks like cash-for-access on steroids.” Green Leader Mike Schreiner said that “when big money gets its hands on our politics, it eats away at democracy.” Marcus Mattinson, the PC party’s director of communications, has said “dozens of individuals have been assisting the party with fundraising for decades, and this event is no exception.” In November, the Tories repealed a section in the campaign finance reform bill that forced donors to “certify, in a form approved by the chief electoral officer, that the person has not acted contrary” to the ban on unions or corporations making donations in the name of members or employees. That new loophole means a company or union could, theoretically, make a political contribution in someone else’s name. The government has emphasized it only made the amendment because the disclosure form was a nuisance to contributors.

After weeks of embarrassing leaks — including revelations in the Star about a new health “super agency” and the opposition NDP’s unauthorized release of a draft government bill — Elliott will table legislation on Tuesday.

“There’s no real surprise in the sense that I’ve said from the beginning that we need transformational change in health care in Ontario,” the minister told reporters Monday at Queen’s Park. “We have some significant problems that we’re dealing with when we have over 30,000 people who are waiting for long-term care beds,” said Elliott. “We have 1,200 people every day in hospitals across Ontario who are receiving health care in hallways and storage rooms; and the wait-list for mental health and addictions is way too long,” she said.

Article Continued Below

Confirming what the Star first reported on Jan. 17, Elliott said as part of the restructuring there would be a new “super agency” overseeing how health services are delivered. “What we really need to do is focus our health-care system on the patient. That’s what the centre of all of this is about — to make sure that patients’ needs are considered and thought of first and foremost.”

Article Continued Below

The minister emphasized that the head of the new super agency would not be a patronage appointment. “We are thinking about the people that we are going to be appointing to the agency. We are wanting to make sure that we are connecting with people that are knowledgeable about our health-care system so that’s what we are concentrating on,” she said. “We are finalizing our appointments ... it is going to be a professional person.” In recent months, the Tories have been criticized for appointing friends of Premier Doug Ford, including Toronto police Supt. Ron Taverner, 72, the proposed new commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, whose party’s obtaining of draft legislation led to a mid-level government bureaucrat being fired on Feb. 4, said she’s worried about what the revamped system will look like. “They better close this idea of a super agency that’s going to take away the local specifics around what people need in their communities,” said Horwath. “We’re very, very concerned about that,” she said, warning of increased “privatization” in health care. The draft bill, which Elliott downplayed as a “very early” version, would give the new super agency unprecedented powers to contract out health services. One of the leaked documents, titled “agency review weekly status report,” indicates the government has used focus groups to gauge acceptance of the health-overhaul plan. Some 20 existing health agencies are expected to be folded into the new body. Robert Benzie is the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

Advocacy will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services — and Minister Lisa MacLeod has said she will also personally assume such duties — and it will create roundtables to give youth a voice. Meanwhile, MacLeod came under more fire Thursday for changes to the province’s autism services, but said the government will go ahead with its plan that is meant to clear the 23,000-child wait-list for services, and ensure more children receive support for services. As of April 1, families will qualify for up to $20,000 a year for each child under 6 — up to a lifetime maximum of $140,000. Children older than that can access up to $5,000 a year up to age 18, to a lifetime maximum of $55,000. However, amounts are based on a sliding scale depending on family income, and only those earning less than $55,000 in net income will qualify for the entire amount. Intensive therapy for children with severe needs can cost up to $80,000 a year, and some families are bracing for a drop in support from the government. Parent Sarah Farrants of London, who made the trip to Queen’s Park, said “there was no hope in there today” from PC MPPs. “Listening to them and watching them applaud her (during question period), there’s no hope for parents.” She and mom Brandi Tapp later met personally with MacLeod to outline their concerns. “We told Lisa that it took 96 days with the Liberals,” to get the former government to improve the system, said Farrants, whose 3-year-old son is on a wait-list for autism therapy. “We’re not going away. These are our children.” “I would prefer to go back on the wait list than to move forward with this program,” Tapp added. “She is offering sub-standard therapies to 23,000 children so she can look good on paper by clearing the wait list.” NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said parents feel “betrayed” by Premier Doug Ford, who “promised families so much” during the election campaign. “This premier has done nothing to offer anything to parents,” Horwath said. “The promises were big, but the result was nil.” MacLeod — noting the province is spending $321 million on its autism program, up from the $256 million the Liberals budgeted — said “I understand that there are a lot of parents who are concerned about this plan, but there are a lot of parents who are going to be relieved with this plan.” She said it’s “heartbreaking” to hear from upset families. “As a mother, I can appreciate parents fighting for their children,” she added. “As the minister, I have to make sure I am supporting as many children as possible.” With files from Rob Ferguson Kristin Rushowy is a Toronto-based reporter covering Ontario politics.

Economists at major banks recently joined geographers in comparing Vancouver and Toronto when it comes to the ratio of condo units to number of households.

While population growth in Vancouver has been lagging that in Toronto, there are more newly completed but unoccupied condo units in Vancouver, according to Stephen Brown, a senior Canada economist at London-based Capital Economics. He found that at the end of last year, there were some 2,000 such units, compared to 1,500 at the beginning of 2018.

“By contrast, in Toronto, the number of (newly completed and unoccupied) units is just 500, despite the population being 2.5 times larger. … The supply situation will probably get much worse. There are currently 42,000 units under construction in Vancouver, compared to 71,000 in Toronto. Vancouver is therefore building 1.2 units for every person that arrived in Vancouver in the past year, compared to just 0.5 units in Toronto.”

In Toronto, Benjamin Tal, an economist at CIBC Capital Markets, agreed that population growth in Vancouver has lagged while “supply, mainly in the high-rise segment, has risen sharply. The number of completed and unabsorbed units in Vancouver is on the rise. In the third quarter (of 2018), the ratio of units under construction to household formation in Vancouver was elevated … while Toronto was still in line with long-term averages.”

At Vancouver-based Urban Analytics, managing principal Michael Ferreira, who tracks data about new multi-family projects, pegged the number of “completed and unsold units” in Vancouver at just 223 at the end of 2018, “which is nowhere close to being an oversupply situation.” Across Metro Vancouver, said Ferreira, “there are fewer than 1,000 unsold condominium units either under construction or completed and move-in ready.”

Other critics argue that estimates of oversupply don’t necessarily take into account the demolition of older units, which reduces the total supply.

As well, census numbers used in some studies do not count the number of temporary foreign workers and students moving into cities, said Anne McMullin, CEO and president of the Urban Development Institute (UDI), which represents developers. She also noted that investors rent out units that form an important secondary rental market.

“We also have to look at building for population growth for the next 10 years, not just now,” said SFU professor of real estate finance Andrey Pavlov.

LISTEN: Professor Andrey Pavlov and lawyer Wes Mussio join Housing Matters podcast host Stuart McNish to discuss the B.C. real estate speculation tax and vacancy tax.

Pavlov said the number of homes stuck in the permit approval process in the Lower Mainland was estimated to be 108,000 in 2017. He has been unable to get updated information from municipalities, but said clearing this backlog would greatly increase supply and potentially bring down prices.

The provincial Ministry of Finance said housing starts are at near-record highs, and noted the previous Liberal government projected 27,521 housing starts across the province in 2018, but the actual number was 48 per cent higher, totalling 40,857. The historical average is closer to 30,000 units, which is what the NDP budget is forecasting by 2021.

Andy Yan, director of SFU’s City Program, looked at all housing starts in Metro Vancouver, including co-ops, condos, rentals and homes, going back more than a decade, and found that after a plunge in 2009 (following the credit crisis), the number of housing starts steadily rose from around 15,000 to 20,000 between 2010 to 2015. The number spiked to almost 28,000 in 2016 and then started to fall to 26,200 in 2017 and again to 23,400 in 2018.

It is the opposite of what had been happening ahead of the peak, when several factors came together, said Yan. Now, “we are in an era of declining assessments. Interest rates are going up. Credit is harder to obtain, as is global capital.”

Instead, the New Democrats get to spend, with an easy thanks and a tip of the hat to their arrogant and uncomprehending predecessors.","VICTORIA — Finance Minister Carole James wrapped up her budget presentation this week with a motion to spend a further $375 million in cash on hand before the March 31 ending of the current financial year.

The one-time funding would be targeted at worthy causes, from medical research to high-speed internet connections for rural and Indigenous communities.

Such supplementary estimates, as they are known in legislative parlance, were precluded by budget law so long as the province was carrying an accumulation of debt from past operating deficits.

But the direct debt was paid off last year, freeing the finance minister to begin diverting end of the year surpluses to top up existing programs and fund new ones.

The spending estimates still need supplementary approval by the legislature, a likely outcome given the majority in the seat count for the NDP-Green partnership.

The largest item on the list is $100 million for Kitimat and 25 other local governments along what the New Democrats are calling “the LNG corridor” in northwest and north central B.C.

The money is ticketed for infrastructure and planning for future projects, as a down payment of sorts on the anticipated benefits of LNG development.

Local governments elsewhere in the province will be in line for a further $40 million in grants to rehabilitate and upgrade water, waste water and storm water systems, develop tourist attractions, and other infrastructure projects.

Next on the list is $89 million in grants to organizations specializing in research in health and the life sciences. The goal being to help them to attract and retain researchers as well as lever $200 million in additional funds from external sources.

Then comes $50 million to expand high-speed internet connections, something taken for granted in urban B.C., for some 200 rural and Indigenous communities.

This, too, comes with expectations of attracting additional money from the broadband fund of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.

James also seeks approval for $30 million in incentives to encourage British Columbians to switch to clean energy vehicles, a further $30 million to treat contaminated sites, and a $20 million top up to NDP child-care initiatives.

There’s a request for $5.5 million in additional funding to maintain tuition-free programs for adult basic education and English language learning.

Last on the list is $8 million in additional funding for the civil resolution tribunal, which is central to NDP hopes of reining in ICBC’s legal and court costs; plus $2.4 million to begin implementing recommendations of the recent task force on jobs in the mining sector.

The $375 million won’t exhaust the entire budget surplus for the year. Other leftover money will be used to retire the much larger capital debt.

Such are the end-of-the-fiscal year rewards that a government can dole out when the direct debt is paid off and the budget is in surplus.

The New Democrats made the $1.2 billion payment on the direct debt last year. The direct debt topped out at almost $16 billion early in the B.C. Liberal term of government.

Mike de Jong, the last Liberal finance minister, did most of the heavy lifting to retire the debt, a point James acknowledged during her budget day media conference.

“It certainly was the focus of the previous finance minister,” she conceded. “I’ve been quite clear about giving him credit for the focus that he put on it.”

Then the nod to her own government’s follow-through on debt retirement and surplus budgeting, reflected in continued “strong growth” and “fiscal responsibility.”

She also took a dig at the Liberals for their narrow focus on surpluses and debt reduction, to the exclusion of other priorities.

“Getting rid of the operating debt means those resources can be used for programs and services and supports,” said the finance minister.

“Having the operating debt paid off means we can utilize, through supplementary estimates, the dollars and the resources when the economy is doing well to support people in B.C. We believe that will help us continue to see that economic growth.

“It’s really the different approach that we’re taking compared to the previous government,” she continued. “To us, having a surplus simply for the sake of a surplus without having supports in place for people doesn’t make good sense.”

A surplus simply for the sake of having a surplus. That’s a tough but defensible assessment of the Liberal approach during their last few years in government.

When the Liberals lost their legislative majority and with it their hold on power in 2017, the audited financial statements for their last full year in power would show a $2.7 billion surplus.

Their final budget and three-year fiscal plan, tabled on the eve of the election call, included a further $2.6 billion in operating surpluses, forecast allowances and contingency funds.

Yet with all that fiscal room to move, de Jong and his colleagues presided over a government that picked fights with the disabled over passes, dragged its feet on a long-overdue increase in income assistance, and could not see its way clear to eliminate bridge tolls, a stance that contributed to the loss of a half dozen seats.

Had the Liberals spent even a fraction of those cash reserves, they might still be in government.

Instead, the New Democrats get to spend, with an easy thanks and a tip of the hat to their arrogant and uncomprehending predecessors.

The Opposition party is also calling for an investigation by the province’s ethics commissioner into the governing New Democratic Party and AHS.

Standing behind a lectern and in front of signs that stated “Rachel Notley. Fighting For You,” the premier spoke at Lethbridge’s Chinook Regional Hospital on Saturday, flanked by nurses as well as Environment Minister Shannon Phillips.

The UCP called it a “partisan campaign event” that violated AHS rules surrounding the use of its public facilities.

“AHS facilities shall not be used for any political activity, including, but not limited to use for the purposes of canvassing, campaigning, making political announcements, touring and other activities,” AHS rules state.

“During an election campaign, political parties are not permitted to use AHS facilities as a backdrop or host location for any campaign event or activity.”

While the Alberta election looms this spring, an election has not yet been called.

Notley’s spokeswoman, Cheryl Oates, said in a statement that “not a single tax dollar went to this announcement.”

“The nurses who came to speak out about the dangers of Jason Kenney’s plan to privatize health care, came on their own time because this issue is important to them,” Oates said.

“We were not aware of the 2012 AHS memo outlining their policy on events like this. We understand the concern and will ensure future partisan events are not done at AHS facilities.”

Oates further noted on Twitter that “the event was done in a public area of the hospital.”

UCP House Leader Jason Nixon called use of the hospital “an unethical abuse of public resources.”

“Saturday’s NDP campaign event was not just a clear violation of AHS policy, but it also seems probable that the premier and her staff broke Government of Alberta rules that prohibit them from using their influence to host a partisan event in a public hospital,” Nixon said.

“I have written to Alberta’s ethics commissioner to ask for an immediate investigation into this event and I’m calling on Alberta Health Services and the premier’s office to explain this clear violation of AHS policy for the benefit of the Notley NDP.”

During the event, Notley spoke out against Kenney’s comments earlier in the week about allowing some private companies to carry out publicly funded health-care procedures, according to the CBC.

“Mr. Kenney wants to cut & privatize our health care system,” Notley said following the news conference in a tweet, which included photos from her appearance at the hospital.

“In Lethbridge, that would mean not hiring 203 nurses. Nurses who wouldn’t be there when you need them.”

Great to visit Chinook Regional Hospital today.

In a statement, AHS said its political activity policy, which came into effect in March 2012, “is designed to maintain AHS’ non-partisan role in healthcare delivery, and to protect our staff and patients.

“The policy outlines that during an election campaign, AHS sites should not be used as a backdrop or host location for any form of campaign event or activity,” AHS stated. “The event at Chinook Regional Hospital in Lethbridge was not organized by AHS and participants were not representing AHS.”

An AHS spokesperson did not provide comment when asked if any employees could potentially face repercussions for participating in the news conference.

Kenney took to Twitter to criticize Notley for holding the event at a public hospital.

“It is an unethical abuse of public resources for the NDP Leader to hold a partisan news conference in a public hospital, as she did today,” he wrote Saturday.

“Those are party, not government signs. This is explicitly prohibited by AHS policy. Stop campaigning at public expense. Call the election.”

According to AHS’ policy statement, the public health body “recognizes the personal right of AHS representatives to participate in political activities.”

“AHS representatives may publicly support or oppose any political activity, political party, candidate, or cause in a personal capacity provided they do not use AHS work time or resources . . . or do so while representing AHS,” the organization states.

The Code of Conduct for employees of the Premier’s Office and cabinet ministers states that staff “may not ask employees of the Alberta public service to engage in any activity that is inconsistent with the Code of Conduct and Ethics for the Public Service of Alberta or the Public Service Act.”

The Canadian Press





LETHBRIDGE, Alta. -- A spokeswoman for Alberta Premier Rachel Notley appeared to acknowledge the poor optics of a weekend appearance Notley made at a hospital, which the Opposition says broke rules prohibiting political activity at health facilities.

Cheryl Oates posted on Twitter on Sunday that while Saturday's event was in a public area of the Chinook Regional Hospital in Lethbridge, the premier's office will ensure future campaign events are not done at Alberta Health Services facilities.

A picture Notley posted on Twitter of the event showed her standing at a podium with the message ""Rachel Notley, fighting for you"" on it, with health-care workers standing behind her.

United Conservative House Leader Jason Nixon said in a news release that Notley's NDP government and AHS should be investigated by the province's ethics commissioner for what he called a ""partisan campaign event.""

AHS policy states that elected officials may access their facilities for the purpose of carrying out their duties, provided they don't engage in political activity.

The health agency tweeted Sunday that the Notley event was not organized by AHS, and that participants were not representing the agency.

""The AHS Political Activity Policy, which came into effect in March 2012, is designed to maintain AHS's non-partisan role in health-care delivery, and to protect our staff and patients,"" the health agency said in a separate tweet Sunday.

An Alberta election must happen before the end of May, and Notley could call a vote at any time.

""The NDP's use of a public hospital to launch a partisan attack is an unethical abuse of public resources. Alberta's hospitals belong to Albertans, not to the NDP,"" Nixon said in his statement..

Nixon also suggested Notley and her staff broke government rules that prohibit them from using their influence to host a partisan event in a public hospital.

United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney called the event ""an unethical abuse of public resources.

""Stop campaigning at public expense. Call the election,"" Kenney challenged Notley on Twitter.

Oates said on Twitter that ""not a single tax dollar"" went to the announcement.

""The nurses who came to speak out about the dangers of (Kenney's) plan to privatize health care, came on their own time because they are worried about what he will do to front-line services,"" she stated.

Kenney responded by posting that his party will maintain a ""universally accessible, publicly funded health-care system.""",Opposition accuses Alberta premier of breaking rules with event at hospital - CTV News,Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/opposition-accuses-alberta-premier-of-breaking-rules-with-event-at-hospital-1.4310811

A Calgary justice says the B.C. government should have waited until the law was in force to file the constitutional challenge, saying the claim was both ""premature and inappropriate for consideration by the court.""

B.C. filed the statement of claim in Alberta's Court of Queen's Bench in May 2018, challenging the constitutionality of Alberta's Preserving Canada's Economic Prosperity Act.

The act, also known as Bill 12, gained royal assent on May 18, 2018, but has not yet come into force on proclamation.

It requires exporters to obtain licenses, and gives Alberta's energy minister the power to decide how much fuel is exported, how it's transported — by pipeline, rail or tanker truck — and whether direct shipments to be stopped altogether.

""The Government of Alberta introduced and supported the Act because it asserts British Columbia is responsible for ""delays"" to an expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline … Alberta seeks to utilize powers under the Act to punish British Columbia, and to exert pressure upon British Columbia,"" B.C.'s statement of claim reads.

B.C. said a significant percentage of the fuel it consumes comes from Alberta. It adds any disruption could cause irreparable harm, both to the economy and to health and safety in remote communities that depend on a reliable fuel supply.

B.C. could resubmit once bill is proclaimed

But Calgary Justice R.J. Hall, in a decision dated Friday, said the claim of B.C.'s attorney general was made too early as the bill hasn't actually been proclaimed yet.

""Should the Alberta government proclaim the act in force, the [Attorney General of B.C.] may recommence a claim,"" Hall wrote.

Alberta Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd said the government is pleased the challenge was struck down.

""This law remains available if necessary. In the meantime, we're encouraged by Friday's NEB decision and are taking decisive action to move more oil by rail until new pipelines are built … we call on the Government of BC to recognize our shared interest in moving our natural resources to new markets as we support their efforts to export LNG,"" she said.

The bill is just one of the province's weapons in its political battle over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which Alberta's NDP-led government has accused B.C.'s NDP-led government of blocking.

""Albertans, British Columbians and all Canadians should understand that if the path forward for the pipeline through B.C. is not settled soon, I am ready and prepared to turn off the taps,"" Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said when the bill passed last May.

On Friday, the National Energy Board reiterated its approval of the $7.4-billion pipeline with new recommendations to protect the environment in B.C.

B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman took to Twitter to reiterate B.C.'s concerns with the project.

This project is not in the best interests of the tens of thousands of people who depend on our coast for their livelihoods.<br><br>We're going to continue to assert our right to defend BC's env't in court & will continue to insist the federal gov't take BC's concerns seriously. —@GeorgeHeyman

The Green Party of Ontario has raised $10,310 from 32 donors.

To be the biggest fundraiser in the party's history, the dinner would have to raise more than the record $2 million that Patrick Brown brought in during his Toronto leader's dinner in 2016.

Ford's party is trying to build on its fundraising momentum from the election year of 2018, during which the PCs amassed far more in donations than all the other parties combined.

The PCs raised $9.2 million in 2018, according to data compiled by CBC News from the Elections Ontario website, tallying donations at all levels: to the provincial party, to riding associations and to individual candidates.

Total donations to the NDP in 2018 amounted to $4.2 million, according to the Elections Ontario database. The Liberals reported $3.5 million in donations and the Green Party $1.05 million.

The PC party's 2018 fundraising total included $5.5 million logged as election-period donations and $3.7 million reported as annual contributions.

That's separate from another $2.4 million raised in 2018 by the four candidates in the PC party leadership race: Ford, Christine Elliott, Caroline Mulroney and Tanya Granic Allen.

The PCs have been the top fundraisers in each of the past three years, amassing a record $12.9 million in 2016 and collecting more than the Liberals and NDP combined in 2017

All parties are raising far less now than they did before 2017, when the Wynne government banned corporate and union donations.

To make up the shortfall, each party now gets an annual per-vote allowance funded from the provincial treasury, but Ford has promised to end that practice.

A news conference for reaction to the decision was facilitated by advocacy group Stand.earth and included members of the Union of B.C.

'The gauntlet has been thrown down'

They said they were outraged by the decision and further motivated to fight the pipeline from ever being built.

""A complete dog's breakfast,"" said Phillip in describing the process that produced the NEB's latest report.

He called the report a flawed process and vowed that there would be further lawsuits involving the project.

""The gauntlet has been thrown down,"" he said.

Prime Minister push

Berman said the decision supporting expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline ""is the direct result of the Prime Minister's Office telling the board and federal bureaucrats to ""get to yes.""

She said in a news release that scientific evidence filed with the board shows there is not enough data to ensure the safety of salmon runs or endangered orcas.

Berman says the board also failed to address the climate impacts of the Trans Mountain expansion, which will increase the number of oil tankers in the port of Vancouver from about five per month to at least 34.

Despite Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's argument that the pipeline is in the best interests of Canada, Berman vows Trans Mountain ""is not in the public interest and will never be built.""

The NEB said the project would cause ""significant adverse environmental effects"" on the southern resident killer whale population, and while a worst-case spill from the pipeline or an oil tanker is not likely, ""the environmental effects would be significant.""

It said though that the project and its risks are justified in light of the benefits of the pipeline.

Last year, the Progressive Conservative provincial government announced that it intends to take over ownership of Toronto's subway network. The province would control construction of subway infrastructure and maintenance, while the city would keep revenue generated by the subway system.

Transportation Minister Jeff Yurek has argued the upload would allow for a more efficient expansion of the existing network. Earlier this month, the province and city have reached ""terms of reference"" for negotiations for the upload.

The plan is bitterly opposed by some transit riders, city councillors and the provincial NDP. They argue that the city needs to maintain its control over subways to ensure that it has a say in future development of transit and other infrastructure around subway stations.

The problem is not that the city owns the subways, critics argue, but that the TTC has been chronically underfunded since the mid-1990s, when former premier Mike Harris's government cut provincial subsidies for the service.

Yurek responded to Friday's protest on social media, calling it ""NDP fearmongering.""

""A subway upload will get new transit lines built faster,"" he wrote on Twitter.

For its part, TTCriders says the upload will result in higher fares, poorer service and generally more ""chaos"" during peak hours.

""There's going to be a loss of accountability if the transit system doesn't stay integrated and in Toronto's hands. Why would an MPP in Parry Sound or Kenora care about investing in our system the way that we need?"" said Pizey-Allen.

Push for public awareness campaign

Toronto councillors Josh Matlow and Joe Cressy intend to introduce a motion next week that would see the city launch a public information campaign ""regarding the importance of retaining control of Toronto's subways.""

The campaign would include ads on TTC vehicles and in stations, as well as a series of public consultations to help residents better understand the consequences of transferring control of the city's subways to the province.

""Torontonians should also know that with Toronto's subway, the province would gain control of lucrative air rights above stations and adjacent properties, owned and paid for by Torontonians,"" reads the motion, titled ""Save Our Subway: Ensuring Torontonians Know the Facts.""

Matlow has also posted an online petition calling for the TTC's subways to remain under the city's ownership. It has garnered more than 3,250 signatures since it was posted on Feb. 15.","Transit advocates, union members protest plan to upload TTC subways to province",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/transit-advocates-union-members-protest-plan-to-upload-ttc-subways-to-province-1.5029377
407,Empty,2019-02-21T00:36:36Z,"Advocates and Metro Vancouver mayors say lobbying will continue after HandyDart funding, measures to tie fares to income left out of budget.","Two initiatives that could make transit Metro Vancouver more accessible and affordable were missing from Tuesday’s provincial budget.

The region’s mayors have been advocating for funding for HandyDART, the door-to-door shared-ride service for people with disabilities, and a break on transit fares for people with low incomes and youths.

“We would have liked to have seen those programs included in this year’s budget,” said New Westminster Mayor Jonathan Coté, who chairs the Mayors’ Council on Regional Transportation.

For the past couple of years, both the council and TransLink, the regional transportation authority, have argued that the provincial government should help pay for HandyDART.

TransLink has invested money in expanding HandyDART service as part of its 10-year regional transportation plan, and made some changes following a review to improve the quality of service.

However, Coté said the majority of HandyDART trips are related to health services, such as dialysis or specialist appointments, and seeing some investment from the Ministry of Health would make sense.

“We think there is an argument to be made that there should be better support through the provincial government, just like the provincial government mainly funds those services throughout other parts of the province,” he said.

“That’s been a longstanding issue that the Mayors’ Council and TransLink have advocated for better support there.”

The budget did include some extra money for transit — and HandyDART — improvements, but for communities outside Metro Vancouver. It adds $21 million over three years for B.C. Transit to expand bus services in 30 urban and rural communities and make improvements to help seniors and people with disabilities.

We also discuss the CleanBC plan, BC Green leader Andrew Weaver’s budget response and the BC Liberals struggling to define themselves within the budget debate.

Beth McKellar, co-chair of the HandyDART Riders Alliance called the lack of specific funding for HandyDART in Metro Vancouver “very, very disappointing” because the service is in demand.

“There are people who want to sign up for HandyDART every day because they need it,” she said.

Coté said he hopes increasing demand for HandyDART service will prompt more serious conversations with the province about a long-term, sustainable funding model so that TransLink can continue to provide the service.

Providing discounted transit passes for people with low incomes and free transit for youths under the age of 18 has been discussed around the Mayors’ Council table, Coté said, and such initiatives have been adopted in other major cities.

“I think the Mayors’ Council is very interested in the idea, but it’s something we strongly feel would be most appropriately funded through a provincial poverty reduction strategy,” Coté said.

Such a strategy was outlined in the budget, but details about the specific programs therein were not released. It’s expected that the public will hear more in the coming weeks.

Viveca Ellis, campaign organizer for #AllOnBoard, has been lobbying for a regional plan and provincial funding for making transit affordable and accessible for all people in the region.

“In the budget documents and the information that we have right now, we didn’t see anything specifically related to transit affordability and accessibility to transit for low-income people in the TransLink service region or any other region,” Ellis said.

“We’re looking forward to the release of the poverty reduction plan and seeing what will be addressed there in terms of affordable transit.”

Coté said the Mayors’ Council will move forward by formalizing their position on reducing transit fees for low-income earners and youths this spring.

“We do expect continued discussions on that regard there and hopefully future inclusion in budgets in coming years,” he said.

The budget did follow through on promised funding for major transportation infrastructure projects, including the Broadway subway line, for which $1.12 billion has been allocated over the next three years. The total cost of that project is $2.83 billion.

408,Empty,2019-02-22T02:03:18Z,First Nations have been lobbying for a share of provincial gambling revenues for 20 years as a way of providing socioeconomic benefits to their communities.,"VICTORIA — The New Democrats this week announced “the largest agreement with First Nations in B.C. history,” a plan to divert hundreds of millions of dollars in gambling proceeds to Indigenous communities.

The first $200-million instalment in the $3-billion, 25-year plan will be paid this spring to a First Nations partnership that will redistribute the money to member communities.

All 203 of B.C.’s recognized First Nations are eligible for a share, though to collect they need to sign up with the First Nations Gaming Revenue Sharing Limited Partnership, scheduled to be up and running this April.

The partnership, wholly owned and controlled by First Nations, will distribute the money under guidelines laid down by the three major First Nations organizations in the province through their gaming commission.

Eligible uses for the funds are six-fold: Health and wellness. Infrastructure, safety, transportation and housing. Economic and business development. Education, language, culture and training. Community development and environmental protection. Capacity-building, fiscal management and governance.

The rules also preclude direct distribution of any of the money to individuals.

Recipient First Nations are required to report annually to the partnership with an audited financial statement on how the money was spent in their communities.

LISTEN: This week on the In The House podcast, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the 2019 provincial budget. Did the B.C. NDP present a prudent plan or did government miss a key opportunity to fulfill its agenda?

First Nations have been lobbying for a share of provincial gambling revenues for 20 years as a way of providing socioeconomic benefits to their communities.

The breakthrough contribution is calculated at seven per cent of gambling revenue, currently running at about $1.4 billion a year. The first instalment is front-end loaded to cover two years’ worth of funding. The funding formula laid down by the First Nations Gaming Commission provides for a three-way split on the global amount, currently estimated at $100 million a year.

Half, in the range of $50 million, will be reserved for each First Nation, or about $250,000 apiece.

A further 40 per cent, about $40 million, is to be distributed on the basis of population. There being about 150,000 Indigenous people in B.C., it works out to $265 or so per capita.

The remaining $10 million will be evenly split among several dozen communities that are recognized as especially needy because they’re geographically remote. The annual payout is expected to fall between $250,000 and $2 million, depending on how the various factors in the formula work out.

For those First Nations that fail to join the partnership straightaway for whatever reason, their designated share will be banked for three years before being distributed to the active partners.

The same will apply where funding is being withheld from a given First Nation because of failure to comply with accountability requirements.

The New Democrats have assured First Nations this will be all new money.

There will be no reduction in pre-existing funding agreements such as last year’s $550-million commitment to build 1,750 units of housing for Indigenous people on and off-reserve.

Nor does the seven-per-cent commitment to First Nations mean any change in the long-standing allocation of 31 per cent of gambling revenues to a special health account, or the dollars ticketed for community grants and local governments.

Any money left over will continue to go into general revenues, to pay for other programs.

The commitment to the revenue-sharing partnership flowed from the summit meeting last fall between Premier John Horgan and his cabinet and First Nations leaders.

That was also where the New Democrats promised to make B.C. the first province in Canada with legislation harmonizing its laws and policies with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

According to the terms of the agreement, the B.C. bill is supposed to be “not dissimilar” to an equivalent piece of federal legislation, currently before the Senate.

The federal measure originated three years ago as a private member’s bill from Romeo Saganash, an NDP MP from Quebec.

But after gaining endorsement from the federal Liberal government, which initially dragged its feet on UNDRIP legislation, the Saganash bill passed through the House of Commons last spring.

Bill C-262 obliges the national government, in consultation with Indigenous peoples, to “take all measures necessary to ensure that the laws of Canada are consistent with UNDRIP.”

It further dictates that “the government of Canada must, in consultation and co-operation with Indigenous peoples, develop and implement a national plan to achieve the objectives of UNDRIP.”

Those ambitions notwithstanding, the federal bill provides what looks to be a leisurely time frame for implementation.

The federal minister for Indigenous and northern affairs is given 20 years to update parliament annually on fulfilment of the aforementioned two objectives.

It is unclear whether the “not dissimilar” provincial legislation will provide that much leeway in B.C.

The NDP government bill, currently in the drafting stage, is supposed to be “in place,” meaning enacted into law, no later than the fall session of the provincial legislature.

UNDRIP consists of 46 separate articles, the most controversial of which guarantees “free, prior and informed consent” to First Nations over land use and resource development within their traditional territories.

409,Empty,2019-02-22T17:28:00Z,"Much-awaited ruling is expected to bring strong reaction from Alberta and B.C. governments, still embroiled in a bitter legal battle — and the business community, oil sector workers, First Nations and environmental advocates.","The National Energy Board ruled Friday that the project can move ahead despite “significant” environmental effects because the project’s benefits are in the public interest.

CALGARY AND VANCOUVER—Advocates and opponents of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion stood their ground Friday as a renewed review of the contentious project recommended approving it.

The NEB also added 16 recommendations for the federal government, including measures to manage cumulative effects on the Salish Sea, offset underwater noise, prevent ships from striking marine mammals and fish, respond to oil spills, consult with an Indigenous advisory committee, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The recommendations aren’t legally binding, and Steedman said they are considered “important advice to government.”

If the project is to go ahead, it must comply with 156 conditions, the board said. The regulator found marine shipping traffic from the pipeline project would harm killer whales and Indigenous cultural uses related to the whales, as well as release “significant” greenhouse gas emissions.

Speaking in Calgary, the board’s chief environmental officer Robert Steedman said the expansion should be approved.

However, the board also said the risk “can be justified in the circumstances, in light of the considerable benefits,” as long as there are measures to minimize harm.

The NEB report is one of the factors the federal government will consider when deciding whether to move forward with the project.

The decision was being closely watched by industry, First Nations, oil sector workers and environmentalists — and it serves as a reminder of the bitter ongoing legal spat between Alberta and British Columbia. While Alberta Premier Rachel Notley welcomed the ruling as an “important step” toward resuming pipeline construction, B.C. Premier John Horgan said in a statement that he is still “convinced Trans Mountain is not in the best interests of British Columbians.”

The NEB’s much-anticipated ruling is the culmination of its rebooted review of the Trans Mountain expansion project. The federal government now owns and operates the project after purchasing it from Kinder Morgan in May 2018.

“We have to not let it be politicized. We have to make sure we get it right so when the project starts again, which I hope will happen, that it stays going and shovels stay in the ground.”

She said her NDP government will continue to pressure Ottawa to properly complete consultations with Indigenous groups.

But she said she is “cautiously optimistic” about the project’s future, calling the NEB’s conditions and recommendations “achievable,” and not something that will hold up construction.

In Alberta, the writ could drop for a provincial election any day, and Notley said she doesn’t expect to see Ottawa approve the pipeline before that campaign begins.

Friday’s NEB report comes just months before a federal election, when issues around Alberta’s oilsands, the environment and climate change and economic development will likely be at the fore as the Liberal government in Ottawa defends its record on one of its most controversial files.

In response, in September, the federal government instructed the NEB to reconsider its recommendation to approve the project. This time, it asked the board to examine the impacts of increased marine shipping traffic on the species at risk, including critically endangered southern resident orcas.

In August, a federal court overturned the expansion’s approval, saying the federal government’s attempts to consult First Nations were flawed and it had ignored the risks posed by oil tankers.

B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman also vowed that the government would “continue to assert our right to defend B.C.’s environment in court.”

The Alberta government, business groups and some First Nations leaders see the project as a major economic opportunity. Other First Nations, the B.C. government, environmental groups and the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby are concerned about its impact on the environment, and its infringement on the rights of Indigenous groups who haven’t consented.

United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney shot back that the NDP government hasn’t done enough to combat opponents to the pipeline, including the B.C. government and “their special-interest allies.”

“We should not celebrate this as some great victory. What we should do is ask ourselves, ‘How is it that we ended up in this situation?’”

However, Kenney also inaccurately claimed that the NEB added “16 more conditions ... that did not exist before” when, in fact, Friday’s NEB ruling removed one of the conditions issued in its previous report, and the 16 recommendations aren’t legally binding, meaning they do not technically have to be met for the project to continue.

The NEB report is one of the factors the federal government will consider when deciding whether to move forward with the project. Cabinet has 90 days to make the decision, but it’s possible that they will ask for an extension.

But Mount Royal University policy studies professor Duane Bratt said that decision is essentially a foregone conclusion.

“I can’t imagine how the government would not approve this given that they approved the previous NEB report that got quashed by the courts, and they own the pipeline,” he said.

“How do you reject a project that you own and that now has been approved by the regulator?”

Bratt said he expects to see further legal challenges to the project.

Tzeporah Berman, spokesperson for environmental non-profit Stand.earth, issued that message to the federal government Friday.

“If you rush a decision … ignoring Indigenous rights, climate and the threat to orcas, we will see you on the campaign trail this year, in the streets and in the courts,” she said.

Federal Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Friday that a decision on the pipeline will be made “once we are satisfied that the Crown has adequately fulfilled its duty to consult.”

The Trans Mountain expansion would involve building a second 1,000-kilometre pipeline from Sherwood Park, just outside of Edmonton, Alta., to Burnaby, B.C., following a similar route as an existing one that has been there since 1953. It would increase the pipeline’s capacity from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000 barrels per day.

According to the NEB, benefits of the pipeline include jobs created across Canada, “considerable revenues” for governments and more market access for Canadian oil.

The report also says the regulator considers response planning for an oil spill “adequate.” A large spill would cause major adverse effects, it adds, but “such an event is not likely.”

In an interview with the Star on Friday morning, federal Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, MP for Saanich-Gulf Islands in B.C., questioned why the NEB did not consider an economic report submitted by Unifor, a union that represents many workers in the oil sector, including the oilsands. That report alleged the project is exaggerating the number of jobs and economic benefits of the project.

“I will be demanding of cabinet and in the House (of Commons) how the NEB thinks the economic benefits — that they have never studied — outweigh the significant negative impacts they found,” May said. “They say it will be jobs all over Canada — find me a study that says that.”

Chief Judy Wilson, elected leader of Neskonlith First Nation near Chase, B.C., said the Federal Court of Appeal’s order that Ottawa redo consultations has not been satisfied. Simply speaking to elected leaders like her is not truly representative of the Indigenous community on a given territory, she said, and the Supreme Court has affirmed that.

The Trans Mountain pipeline runs through the larger Indigenous nation of Wilson’s people, the Secwepemc Nation. But the various elected band councils in the nation have seen some sign agreements with Trans Mountain, while others remain opposed.

“What I’m hearing from some of the others, who have signed, I feel they’re coming from a place under duress,” she said, speaking in Vancouver on Friday. “It will provide them some money to deal with the needs in their communities, but in our community the elders were very clear: It’s about the water, about protecting the Earth and the salmon, over any monetary decision.”

Reacting to Friday’s NEB ruling, Eugene Kung, a lawyer for Vancouver-based West Coast Environmental Law, questioned whether the federal regulator’s decision to recommend the project could truly be considered independent, given the federal government’s $4.5-billion purchase of the project.

“The process was a foregone conclusion from the start, from the rushed timeline, to the refusal to consider the economic and climate change case,” Kung told the Star in a phone interview.

The B.C. government is still before the courts with a reference case seeking a ruling on whether it has the right — as it says it does — under Canada’s Constitution to restrict what flows through the province. The Constitution does allow the federal government jurisdiction over interprovincial infrastructure, however, it also gives provinces the power to regulate for the environment.

That case has not yet been decided, and the B.C. NDP remains staunchly opposed to diluted bitumen flowing through the 66-year-old, 1,110-kilometre oil pipeline from Alberta.

“Before any cabinet decision is made, I would expect and hope this government make its business case public because it’s now the public’s money, and be transparent about how it’s being spent. That’s the opposite of what the NEB has done. The NEB has just created more distrust. It’s an industry-captured regulator.”

The NEB heard from 118 intervenors at a reconsideration hearing, including 52 Indigenous groups and individuals and eight federal government departments. Another 81 intervenors filed written evidence, the board said.

The board also held 25 individual sessions in Calgary, Victoria and Nanaimo for Indigenous intervenors to discuss their concerns orally.

Provincial Departments of Social Development were from 2013 unable to absorb social work graduates into the system due to a lack of funding. This led to the current backlog and an increase in the number of unemployed social workers and auxiliary social workers.

""Since implementation of the scholarship programme in 2007, provincial Departments of Social Development were able to absorb social work graduates. However, since 2013, provincial departments were unable to absorb social work graduates due to lack of funding and this led to the current backlog in the absorption of social work professionals,"" Oliphant said.

By the end January 2019, a total of 3 969 social work graduates, who benefited from the social work scholarship programme, were still unemployed.

""It should be noted that this figure excluded those who funded their studies through other loans, bursaries and other means, hence the call for registration in the database.

""Government, through the Department of Social Development, is aiming to develop an interdepartmental human resources planning and management strategy,"" said Oliphant.

The strategy is to be informed by the National Development Plan (NDP) vision, which encompasses the employment of social workers as part of 55 000 social service practitioners to be required in the country by the end of the year 2030.

Social workers and auxiliary social workers, who qualify and are interested in registering on the database, are encouraged to manually submit a correctly completed registration form to their respective provincial Department of Social Development offices. Electronic submissions will not be accepted.

There are clearly marked deposit boxes at district and service offices within various provinces.

Registration forms can be accessed from all official Department of Social Development online platforms including www.dsd.gov.za, Facebook Page @SocialDevelopmentZA and Twitter @The_DSD.

The database forms can be downloaded as follows:

- Unemployed Social Worker - FORM A

- Social Auxiliary Worker - FORM B

In order to improve the accuracy of the database, the Department of Social Development may integrate data from the database with that of the Department of Labour to determine the exact unemployment rate among unemployed qualified social workers and social auxiliary workers.",South Africa: Hope for Unemployed Social Workers,Allafrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201902220401.html
414,Empty,2019-02-25T16:15:46Z,Jennifer McKenzie has resigned as leader of the New Brunswick NDP a day after members voted for a leadership review.,"Jennifer McKenzie, who tried to move the New Brunswick NDP back to its socialist roots, has resigned as party leader, a day after members voted to hold a leadership convention before the end of August.

In a statement Monday, McKenzie said she was resigning ""effective immediately.""

""The NDP has by a vote this week determined that there will be a leadership convention within the next six months,"" she said. ""I have decided not to participate in such a leadership contest.""

McKenzie has been leader since August 2017 and led the party to a dismal showing in the provincial election last September, when the NDP won no seats.

On Sunday at Moncton's Darts Club, 95 delegates took part in the vote on whether to hold a leadership convention.

The vote was close, with 52 in favour and 43 against, said Danny Légère, who holds a labour seat on the NDP provincial council. He said the results of the 2018 election definitely affected the leadership review.

""At the end of the day, there are some who feel that leadership may be a factor in that,"" he said.

In a Monday afternoon scrum, Jennifer McKenzie told reporters she's proud of the work she did before resigning as leader of the NDP. (CBC)

In a Monday afternoon scrum, McKenzie admitted she was surprised by the result and said she's ""not part of that vision"" of where the party wants to go.

Despite the vote Sunday, McKenzie could have remained leader until a convention, when she could have run against other candidates to try to keep the post. But she chose to resign immediately and said she won't run again for the leadership.

In her statement, McKenzie said she was ""thankful,"" for the opportunity to be leader. Despite the disappointing results of the Sept. 24 election, she said she was glad that the party had a full slate of candidates and that more than 50 per cent of them were women.

McKenzie finished third in Saint John Harbour, the riding represented by the last NDP member of the legislature, Elizabeth Weir, who retired from politics in 2005.

In 2018, the NDP received more than 19,000 votes provincewide, a 60 per cent drop from 2014 and its worst result in a New Brunswick election in 44 years.

McKenzie campaigned on a return to the NDP's socialist beginnings, promising universal childcare, pay equity, home care, better nursing home ratios and pharmacare.

This was a shift from what former leader Dominic Cardy pushed for. He alienated some people by endorsing the Energy East pipeline and distancing himself from unions. He's now a minister in the Progressive Conservative government.

""I was the new kid on the block, and the party was renewing itself and going back to its socialist roots,"" McKenzie said ""That is something that's quite new and different. We haven't seen that for a long time in this province and it's going to take some time to sell.""

In 2018, the NDP received five per cent of the popular vote, down from 11 per cent when Cardy was leader.

The NDP appears to have missed the wave that propelled the two other alternative parties (the Green Party and People's Alliance) to greater success. The Greens had 11 per cent and the Alliance had 12 per cent of the popular vote last election, and each won three ridings.

McKenzie said people may have chosen Green over NDP because there has been confusion about what sets them apart.

""[The Greens] are not a socialist party, they're not a party to the left,"" she said. ""Because we haven't had a lot of socialism and socialist policy in this province, people did not understand the difference.""

4 leaders in 14 years

Since Weir resigned in 2005, the NDP has had four leaders, including McKenzie, who ran for the leadership unopposed.

No date has been set for the leadership convention, which has to be held in the next six months.

The vote was by secret ballot, Légère said, but some people did voice their disagreement with the results.

""Some felt that we shouldn't be changing leaders as often as we do. It wasn't good for the party, that we needed consistency. Some felt otherwise.""

Legislature is an opportunity to reopen discussion on MLA term limits, says Green Party leader Andrew Weaver.","The alleged spending scandal at the B.C. legislature is an opportunity to reopen discussion on MLA term limits, says Green Party leader Andrew Weaver.

Weaver introduced a private member's bill on Thursday that, if passed, would limit MLAs to three terms.

""We start to see issues emerge when people have been [in office] a long time, and we are seeing that play out right now in the B.C. Legislature,"" he told the host of CBC's On The Coast.

Weaver clarified that he was referring to the alleged misuse of taxpayers' money by senior legislature staff. He said problems are more likely to arise when long-time MLAs become complacent.

Time for 'rejuvenation'

Several prominent members of the legislature have been in office since the 1990s.

Former speaker Linda Reid has been a B.C. Liberal MLA since 1991. Former B.C. Liberal deputy premier Rich Coleman was first elected in 1996 and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth has only missed one term since he was first elected in 1991.

Weaver said term limits would allow a new generation of MLAs to come forward with new ideas and tools to shape public policy.

""We need to foster innovation, we need to foster new ideas and that doesn't happen unless there's a rejuvenation of the place,"" he said.

Liberal MLA says bill ill-conceived

The bill passed its first reading with every MLA in favour except one, B.C. Liberal Ralph Sultan, who was first elected in 2001.

Sultan said protocol dictates that many private member bills are voted through unanimously at the first round but he broke with etiquette in protest of what he called ""grandstanding,"" by Weaver.

Sultan called the bill ill-conceived and said good government needs a balance of rookies and old-timers.

""If you had a three-term limit the entire NDP front bench would be decimated, you'd have no Carole James, no John Horgan, no Adrian Dix and I say government would be much the poorer as a result, so experience does count for something.""

This is not the first time Weaver has raised the question of term limits; he brought a similar bill forward in 2017.

Weaver said the BC Liberals decided not to bring the bill for debate that year, but he hopes this year's bill will see the light of day again.

The ""Don't Steal #OURsubway Day of Action"" was organized by the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113 — which represents some 11,500 TTC workers — along with the union-connected transit advocacy group TTCriders and the Toronto Labour Council.

Participants handed out flyers to subway riders in an effort to raise awareness about the impending upload, while ATU Local 113 members wore T-shirts over their uniforms that read ""Don't Steal Our Subway"" while on the job.

""Ripping the TTC Subway from the rest of our public transit system will create havoc for riders, add unnecessary bureaucracy to our system and take local control away from city transit planning,"" said Carlos Santos, president of the union.

Shelagh Pizey-Allen, spokesperson for TTCriders, said the group hopes to encourage transit users to ""call the premier, call their MPP and tell them: 'Don't steal our subway, fund it instead.""

Last year, the Progressive Conservative provincial government announced that it intends to take over ownership of Toronto's subway network. The province would control construction of subway infrastructure and maintenance, while the city would keep revenue generated by the subway system.

Transportation Minister Jeff Yurek has argued the upload would allow for a more efficient expansion of the existing network. Earlier this month, the province and city have reached ""terms of reference"" for negotiations for the upload.

The plan is bitterly opposed by some transit riders, city councillors and the provincial NDP. They argue that the city needs to maintain its control over subways to ensure that it has a say in future development of transit and other infrastructure around subway stations.

Protesters carried an effigy of Ontario Premier Doug Ford outside Queen's Park station. (CBC)

The problem is not that the city owns the subways, critics argue, but that the TTC has been chronically underfunded since the mid-1990s, when former premier Mike Harris's government cut provincial subsidies for the service.

Yurek responded to Friday's protest on social media, calling it ""NDP fearmongering.""

""A subway upload will get new transit lines built faster,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Don’t let the NDP fearmongering mislead you. A subway upload will get new transit lines built faster. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/onpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#onpoli</a> <a href=""https://t.co/FAMelnpIqk"">pic.twitter.com/FAMelnpIqk</a> —@JeffYurekMPP

For its part, TTCriders says the upload will result in higher fares, poorer service and generally more ""chaos"" during peak hours.

""There's going to be a loss of accountability if the transit system doesn't stay integrated and in Toronto's hands. Why would an MPP in Parry Sound or Kenora care about investing in our system the way that we need?"" said Pizey-Allen.

Push for public awareness campaign

Toronto councillors Josh Matlow and Joe Cressy intend to introduce a motion next week that would see the city launch a public information campaign ""regarding the importance of retaining control of Toronto's subways.""

The campaign would include ads on TTC vehicles and in stations, as well as a series of public consultations to help residents better understand the consequences of transferring control of the city's subways to the province.

""Torontonians should also know that with Toronto's subway, the province would gain control of lucrative air rights above stations and adjacent properties, owned and paid for by Torontonians,"" reads the motion, titled ""Save Our Subway: Ensuring Torontonians Know the Facts.""

Matlow has also posted an online petition calling for the TTC's subways to remain under the city's ownership. It has garnered more than 3,250 signatures since it was posted on Feb. 15.","Transit advocates, TTC workers stage 'Save Our Subway' protest against province's upload plans",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/transit-advocates-ttc-workers-stage-save-our-subway-protest-against-province-s-upload-plans-1.5029377

On Friday, the NEB stated that the project is in the best interest of Canadians, but that if the federal government wants to approve it, they need to consider 16 new recommendations. The board had already made 156 others.

Some of the new recommendations revolve around reducing ferry noise and ensuring the safety of southern resident killer whale populations in the Salish Sea. It's stated in the report that an increase in tanker traffic could hurt not just whales, but also Indigenous culture, while creating more greeenhouse gas emissions.

Red Deer Mayor Tara Veer says the NEB's statement is a positive step in the right direction.

""It is a priority for Red Deerians, Albertans and Canadians to get energy to market, and to ensure the most safe transport of our natural resources,"" she says.

""It's imperative that the federal government fulfill the additional consultations with Indigenous persons that are necessary in order to see the project come to fruition.""

Veer also touched on the announcement this week from Alberta Opposition leader Jason Kenney that he would shelve Premier Rachel Notley's plan to use rail cars while we wait for a pipeline.

""I think it's imperative to note that our ultimate objective is pipeline construction, and certainly railway cars highlight the economic desperation in our province,"" says Veer. At best, it is is an interim solution, because the safest and most efficient transport of energy product is by pipeline.""

Rick More, CEO of the Red Deer and District Chamber of Commerce, says he's feeling a lot more confident today that Trans Mountain will get built than before the latest report.

""It's good news, but it was good news last time so I wouldn't get too excited. It's preliminary good news, let's just say that,"" says More.

""Timing wise, for the NDP, they would probably be glad to see this happening, but I dont know where we are with the rail cars if this goes ahead.""

Should Justin Trudeau's cabinet approve the project, it would triple the capacity of the existing line between Edmonton and Burnaby to about 890,000 barrels of oil per day.

A number of Indigenous groups have already stated they will continue to fight in hopes of preventing the expansion project from seeing the light of day.

""This is a new world we're living in and it's time for the city of Toronto to help lead the discourse,"" Coun. Joe Cressy said in an interview at his city hall office.

Cressy, who represents Ward 10, Spadina-Fort York, has put forward a motion that is set to be debated at the next city council meeting on Tuesday, Feb. 26. It calls for city staff to develop a policy on data collection and recommends public consultations be part of the process.

The motion comes as questions continue about a planned development by Sidewalk Labs, a sister company of Google, which proposes a ""smart"" neighbourhood on the waterfront that would also collect data about people's movements.

The proposed development has prompted critics to push for assurances the information collected will not be used to violate people's privacy, but Cressy said that's only part of what led to him to put forward the motion.

If you use your Presto card to take the subway, then hop on a downtown streetcar, for example, the city knows where you've been and the route you took, he said.

The downtown councillor said as new technologies continue to emerge, there will be be many more ways to collect personal information.

The Sidewalk Labs proposal, including heated sidewalks, affordable housing and infrastructure for autonomous vehicles, is planned for Quayside, an undeveloped area east of downtown along Toronto's waterfront.

Sidewalk Labs responds

The company sent CBC a statement.

""We welcome the motion being introduced by Councillor Cressy,"" it reads in part.

""We hope that our project will set a new standard for responsible data use, as articulated in our data proposals we released last year.""

Cressy's motion was released on Thursday, the same day two executives from Waterfront Toronto were questioned by a federal government standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics regarding the Sidewalk Labs proposal.

Before hearing from the executives, an NDP MP who's vice-chair of that committee spoke to CBC's Metro Morning, saying the federal government is keeping a close eye on the Sidewalk Labs proposal.

""What is the financial base of Google's power? It's data,"" Charlie Angus told host Matt Galloway.

Angus referred to ""the rise of this culture of surveillance capitalism"" and said questions need to be asked about the development in what he called ""the most valuable real estate in North America.""

Here's the full interview with Angus:

NDP MP Charlie Angus says Sidewalk Labs should take questions before the House of Commons standing committee on information, privacy and ethics. Angus also describes why he thinks the project should be paused. 8:58

Cressy said he wants the city to have a policy to ensure data collection, use and storage ""is used for the public good, not private gain,"" pointing to other cities, including Barcelona, that have already implemented data governance policies.

He's concerned that personal information could be shared or sold, possibly resulting in ""somebody not getting a bank loan or a life insurance policy or not being accepted into a college or university,"" he said.

Premier Doug Ford suspended the Lanark—Frontenac—Kingston representative from caucus yesterday after he reportedly replied ""yada yada yada"" in response to remarks from NDP caucus members about the struggles of parents of children with autism.

Laura Kefalas, an Ottawa parent who has a 7-year-old son with autism, was at Queen's Park at the invitation of Ottawa Centre NDP MPP Joel Harden.

She gave Harden permission to highlight her family's case during the debate, but said she was disappointed with how Progressive Conservatives received it.

Minister for Children, Community and Social Services Lisa MacLeod responded to Harden — but not before making an attempt at what she called ""levity,"" quipping about a hockey game both she and Harden were scheduled to attend.

""She made some joke about missing a hockey game,"" Kefalas said.

""It's so disrespectful. She has no compassion for the damage that she's leaving in her wake.""

The two Ottawa MPPs sparred over autism funding at Queen's Park Wednesday. 1:45

Her son Noah was on the waitlist for autism services for years, and is finally getting the therapy he needs, she said — but under the province's new funding structure, those services are set to end May 24.

Later in her response, MacLeod said, ""I have an obligation as the minister responsible for this program, to ensure that we allow every child in Ontario the opportunity to get some level of support.""

MacLeod declined a request for an interview on CBC's Ottawa Morning.

'A Band-Aid solution'

Though she's glad Hillier is facing consequences for his words, Kefalas said the suspension rings a bit hollow.

""It's kind of like another Band-Aid solution to a much larger problem,"" she said, pointing out Ford's own history of disparaging people with autism.

In 2014, while still serving as a Toronto city councillor, Ford faced fierce backlash due to comments he made about a mental health agency that aimed to help youth with autism.

Premier Doug Ford reportedly told people at a 2014 a public meeting a home for developmentally disabled youth had ruined a neighbourhood. (Nathan Denette/Canadian Press)

Hillier's remark became a catalyst for parents who were at Queen's Park yesterday, many of whom already feel that the province is not listening to their concerns about funding for autism services.

Throughout the debate, MacLeod has said the goal of the new funding structure is to clear the 23,000 children on the provincial waitlist for autism services, and more equally distribute the available money to a higher number of families.

But for Kefalas and many others, it's just not working.

""Right now we're being dropped into nothing … as of May 24, everything ceases to exist for my son,"" she said.

Brace yourself.,"When Kyle Hamilton got a phone call asking him to support a UCP candidate in the upcoming provincial election, he asked about the candidate's platform. When the caller didn't answer his question, he got suspicious.

Hamilton: Can you do me a favour and say, 'Carrot?'

Caller: Uh, no problem ... I just wanted to take a second and ask if you'd vote for Marjorie Newman and the UCP in the upcoming election.

Hamilton: So you're actually a recording?

Caller: Haha. Oh goodness, do I sound that bad?

Hamilton: Kind of.

Hamilton was annoyed that he was having a conversation with a robot — or at least a series of pre-recorded responses being pushed by an operator.

""I'm really irritated by it,"" said Hamilton, a 28-year-old Edmontonian who is volunteering for the NDP in this campaign.

""It disregards everything I would say other than, 'Yes, I will vote for you,' or 'Yes, I will donate to you.'""

The 2019 provincial election hasn't been called, but parties are already in full campaign mode. If you haven't received a phone call from a human/robot, you have likely been spammed with a political text message, seen party videos on your Facebook feed or watched old-fashioned campaign ads on television.

And it's just going to get more intense. Here's what you need to know about the messages and messengers in the 2019 campaign.

You used to call me on my cellphone

Despite the National Do Not Call List, it's not unusual to get calls soliciting political support. And they're completely above-board.

The do-not-call list exempts registered charities, people pushing newspaper subscriptions and political parties.

Is the woman who sent this text message really named 'Kate'? We wonder. (James Evans/CBC) In 2019, it's become even more common for parties to reach you by text.

But the effectiveness of such strategies is often questioned.

Najib Jutt, a political strategist with the government relations firm Statecraft Partners, said text messages may be better than phone calls because they're less intrusive and people can deal with the text whenever they want.

But at the end of the day, any campaign that simply blasts information at voters is not very useful, he said.

""You're not convincing people to continue the conversation with their circles, which is really what needs to be done in political campaigning,"" Jutt said.

""People are looking for better engagement …To me, whatever way a candidate or party can really engage with potential voters is where the best spend of money is.""

Telephone town-halls and old-fashioned door-knocking allow voters to ask questions and get answers from real people. But Jutt knows that's sometimes seen as an outdated approach. At this point, most parties really just want data.

New advertisers on the block

This will be the first election cycle where third-party advertisers may have a real impact. Also known as Political Action Committees (PACs), many people are most familiar with these groups in relation to U.S. politics, where they're known for pumping huge amounts of money into elections with no financial restrictions imposed.

A PAC in Alberta is any group that plans to spend at least $1,000 on political advertising. The groups have long existed here — but it was only after an NDP bill put an end to corporate and union political donations that PACs became more important in Alberta politics.

The ""big money"" aspect of these groups applies in Alberta, too, with some of these groups raising more than $1 million per year.

""Third-parties do have to identify who they are but they don't have to identify who they're supporting, even though the ads would be pretty clear in that respect,"" said Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Mount Royal University in Calgary.

Last fall, the group Shaping Alberta's Future ran a series of radio advertisements that sounded like a radio call-in show, with callers telling a ""host"" that they ""gotta scrap the carbon tax"" and that they need a leader who ""will stand up for Alberta.""

In November, the group also purchased a wrap-around advertisement that appeared as the front page of the Edmonton Journal.

The website for Shaping Alberta's Future clearly states the group supports conservative politics and UCP Leader Jason Kenney. But the PAC's ties to the Motor Dealers' Association of Alberta have raised controversy and the NDP has asked the province's elections commissioner to investigate its operations.

All donations to third-party advertisers are listed on their financial disclosure forms, which are published on elections.alberta.ca

Meanwhile, groups such as the Alberta Teachers' Association, which will not support a particular political party but will run ads on election issues, are also listed as third-party advertisers. The ATA raised about $270,000 between December and February.

We love to hate

Despite calls from political parties to keep the campaign civil, there's ample evidence that negative ads will play a role.

""Research has shown that negative ads work and that's why they continue to be used,"" Bratt said.

The NDP has published an aggressive website called ""The Truth About Jason Kenney,"" with ominous black, white and red imagery and direct attacks on the UCP leader's political history.

The NDP's new website isn't exactly subtle in its criticisms of Jason Kenney. (thetruthaboutjasonkenney.ca)

Bratt also warned the election is likely to see the rise of anonymous Twitter accounts — which operate in a medium where direct attacks on political opponents are an almost natural part of the discourse.

The Unite Alberta account on Twitter started as a pro-Jason Kenney account before the Progressive Conservatives and Wildrose voted to come together. The account was known for aggressive comments and it was unclear who was writing the tweets.

The account has since shifted and is now identified as the official account of Jason Kenney's office. It more recently courted controversy by publishing a list of people it said were NDP staff, trying to highlight partisan tweets from government staff during their work hours.

Since many NDP staffers seem to spend their days (and nights) tweeting, have attempted to create a Twitter list using public data. Some openly disclose that they work for the NDP Govt, but others do not reveal (trying to look organic?). <a href=""https://t.co/MK6ZEJB6Cx"">https://t.co/MK6ZEJB6Cx</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ableg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ableg</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/abpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#abpoli</a> —@UniteAlberta

Fake news is a real thing

There's no shortage of political coverage on the Internet. So with mainstream media outlets, and well-established blogs, meme generators and Facebook posters, it's likely even the most discerning reader can be duped by something that's completely fabricated.

But Jane Lytvynenko, a BuzzFeed breaking news reporter and writer of a weekly Fake News Quiz, says readers who genuinely want to learn about events need to be even more careful about stories that have some elements of truth — and many more elements of slant and opinion.

""Look for headline and image combinations designed to spark anger,"" Lytvynenko said. ""Is the image of a politician that's attached to the story have their face distorted in almost a caricature kind of way? Is the headline giving me just enough information to be angry?

""As you read the story, is there any original reporting in there? Did the public actually speak to the parties involved that they're promoting, or is it more of an overview with an opinion slant?""

All that advice, however, will only be useful to people who want to think critically about the media they're consuming.

A charter school in northwest Calgary is urging the premier to take action to fix its dilapidated building.

The Foundations for the Future Charter Academy was initially approved for modernization in 2012. But two years later, an engineer's report found the publicly funded school in Montgomery would be too expensive to fix and needed a total replacement, says board chair Jeff Wilson.

""There's cracks in the masonry, there's sinkholes appearing,"" he said, adding that the condition of the building has become a health and safety issue.

Under the NDP government, no progress has been made, and every year that nothing gets done, the building falls into more disrepair, he says.

""And I think that that's probably the biggest fear of our entire community because what then? The minister of education will have to find a home for 840 students overnight and there's not just extra high schools kicking around,"" Wilson said.

""In this school, we clearly have a shrinking timeline, and that's why I think regardless of an election year or not this is an issue that needs to be raised and needs to be addressed.""

Wilson says he believes the inaction could be due to the fact that it's a charter school.

In a statement, Education Minister David Eggen says his department is working with the public and Catholic school boards to try to find a new space for the students. And he says the province remains committed to the project.

But Wilson says he's skeptical that the province is serious about taking action, and suggested it's the premier's office preventing Eggen from doing so.

""He alone holds the hammer, and, unfortunately, by his own admission, the premier has tied his hands behind his back,"" Wilson said.

He says a letter from Eggen suggested both sides should continue to meet and discuss solutions — an approach Wilson says has been frustratingly unproductive since the NDP took power.

""It would appear that the government of the day is only interested in doing the same thing over and over again,"" he said.

Wilson says he's frustrated that his school's needs get ignored while other schools are modernized or new ones built.

""We're a part of the education community in this city. We just want our students, who are Alberta students, to be treated that way. It's that simple.""

423,Empty,2019-02-25T20:59:03Z,Her intention was apparently to use hospital space to trash her opponent. It was obviously improper and literally indefensible,"We bring you word today of a modest pre-election kerfuffle in Alberta, an event perhaps no bigger than the breath of a butterfly. On Saturday, New Democratic premier Rachel Notley, who will be up for re-election in the next few months, made an appearance at the Chinook Regional Hospital in Lethbridge. A premier can find a lot of excuses to visit a hospital. The election campaign has not yet officially begun, and I do not suppose anybody would have done more than grumble if Notley cooked up some pretext for a meeting with health workers, or perhaps even a photo-op with some shiny new sci-fi equipment purchased with government dollars.

But when the premier’s comms team announced Friday that Notley would be using hospital space to “make a statement and answer questions in response to Jason Kenney’s recently announced plans to freeze health care spending and explore privatization of Alberta’s health care system,” that attracted attention. Notley’s intention was apparently to use hospital space to trash her main electoral opponent.

And she did exactly that, with uniformed hospital staff clustered around her. She spoke surrounded by signage that did not read “Government of Alberta,” or anything nonpartisan of the kind, but that instead had the party slogan that is already appearing on NDP election signs around the province: “Rachel Notley. Fighting For You.”

There was no effort at all to give Notley's visit a phony nonpartisan character

This event was obviously improper and literally indefensible. Alberta Health Services, the authority which operates the province’s hospitals, has a policy that is pretty clear. If AHS lacked such a policy, Notley’s action would still be both gross and dumb; but it has one. And that policy says that “AHS facilities shall not be used for any political activity, including, but not limited to, use for the purposes of canvassing, campaigning, making political announcements, touring, and other activities.”

To the degree that there is any exploitable ambiguity about this rule, which is not restricted to official campaign periods, Notley’s communications brainiacs seem to have gone out of their way to destroy it. There was no effort at all to give Notley’s visit a phony nonpartisan character. Her intention to attack a political opponent was explicitly declared. Notley’s communications director Cheryl Oates kinda-sorta-quasi-non-apologized for the event, tweeting “we understand the concern and will ensure future campaign events are not done at AHS facilities.” Conservatives were not slow to notice that Oates had seemingly admitted that the premier had indeed held a “campaign event” in violation of AHS policy.

Alberta has a law mandating fixed election periods, but not specific dates. This provides enough elasticity to allow a premier to hop around the province weeks before an election, making generous infrastructure announcements while keeping the starter’s pistol in its holster. Notley is doing just this, and it is in line with Alberta’s traditions. The Chinook Hospital appearance was a subtly higher, less-familiar level of banana republicanism. Even a Progressive Conservative government of the bad old days would probably have had second thoughts about organizing a Two Minutes’ Hate against the opposition leader in a hospital atrium.

Those bad old days were pretty bad, when it came to politicians of the government party preening with, on and within public works and abusing institutions to obtain re-election. One legitimate reason to vote for Notley’s New Democrats is — or was — that they put a stop to the worst excesses of this sort. Certainly no one should expect a premier or any other politician to behave like a saint. Scheduling pork announcements for maximum convenience and making use of control over the election date: these are all in the game. Even the NDP’s emerging strategy of making the election brutally personal is to be expected. You know I have never been a pious ninny about “negative campaigning.”

But this is a case in which stupidity is the generous explanation for a premier’s conduct — walking into that hospital, seeing the campaign signs, going ahead with the press conference, and never sensing a problem of optics (the politician’s euphemism for “ethics”). More likely she just didn’t care, because the breach of policy will be litigated, and the reporters’ barrage of freedom-of-information requests answered, only after the election.

Moreover, as I write this, there hasn’t been any sign of an actual apology for the Chinook fiasco, as opposed to a promise that it will not happen again now that the NDP has gotten the benefit from it once (in a city that is bound to be in play electorally). Indeed, the New Democrats seem determined to campaign further on the incident, emphasizing how frightened those poor nurses are of the hatchet-wielding monster Jason Kenney. Albertans have never watched a New Democratic government run for re-election, but B.C. and Saskatchewan know what it looks like when the party of labour triumphant pulls out all the stops. It’s not likely to get prettier.

424,Empty,2019-02-21T19:16:30Z,Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick says his conversation with the former justice minister was within the “boundaries” and did not cross any line.,"In a remarkable appearance before the justice committee, Michael Wernick, the clerk of the privy council, denied the allegation at the heart of a controversy that has rocked Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government: that Wilson-Raybould was improperly pressured to use a deferred prosecution agreement on the Quebec company.

OTTAWA—Jody Wilson-Raybould was under pressure to make the “right” decision on the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin but at no time did she face undue influence, says Canada’s top civil servant, insisting all discussions with the former attorney general were legal and appropriate.

He said that Wilson-Raybould likely felt pressure to “get it right” but he bluntly told MPs Thursday that there were no grounds for the suggestions that she was the focus of improper pressure on a court case that has political and economic overtones for the government.

Wernick speculated that Wilson-Raybould’s concerns may centre on three meetings held last year — including one where he conveyed “context” about the “consequences” a criminal prosecution of the company might have.

Opposition MPs have charged that Wilson-Raybould’s refusal to bow to that pressure cost her cabinet post as justice minister in a January cabinet shuffle. Wilson-Raybould has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations, but pointedly told the Commons Wednesday that she hopes she has an opportunity to “speak my truth.”

Still he conceded that impressions of improper influence are subjective and that federal ethics commissioner Mario Dion — who has launched his own probe of the affair — will have to decide whether those interactions crossed the line.

“It is my conclusion and my assertion, based on all the information I have, that there was no inappropriate pressure on the minister of justice in this matter,” Wernick said.

Wernick’s testimony had Ottawa spellbound, as he tackled head-on the controversy that has consumed the nation’s capital for the last two weeks and did it in a blunt-spoken manner not usually used by public servants.

The 37-year public servant grabbed attention from the moment he sat down at the microphone, with an eyebrow raising opening statement expressing concerns about the direction of the country and the “rising tide of incitements to violence” and his fear of political assassination in the coming federal election.

Then Wernick got to the manner at hand as he batted aside the suggestions that the former justice minister was subject to undue influence on the SNC-Lavalin file and if she felt she was, she had ample opportunities to report it but did not.

And he said that Wilson-Raybould is not bound by solicitor-client privilege, undermining the reason that she herself has cited for not telling her version of events.

Wernick predicted that when Wilson-Raybould appears before the committee next week, she will “express concern” about three events, all of which “were entirely appropriate, lawful, legal,” he said.

The first was a meeting on Sept. 17 between himself, the prime minister and Wilson-Raybould. Wernick said that, at the time, Trudeau and his top advisers were consumed with NAFTA negotiations, and that he was assigned to help mediate “a very serious policy difference” on the government’s Indigenous rights framework between Wilson-Raybould and Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett. The Sept. 17 meeting with Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau was held to discuss that matter, Wernick said.

Just two weeks earlier, the director of public prosecutions had decided not to proceed with a deferred prosecution in the SNC-Lavalin case. But Wilson-Raybould had the power to overturn that decision.

Wilson-Raybould told the prime minister that a deferred prosecution agreement “was not a good course and she had no intention of intervening,” Wernick recalled. In turn, the prime minister told Wilson-Raybould the decision to intervene in the case was hers alone, he said.

“(Trudeau) indicated that it was entirely her call to make, that she was the decider,” Wernick said.

“That is a message that the prime minister conveyed to the minister on every situation that I am aware of when it came up.”

The next event he predicted Wilson-Raybould would raise was a conversation between her chief of staff and officials from the Prime Minister’s Office on Dec. 18. Wernick, however, said he was not there and is not aware of what transpired.

Finally, Wernick highlighted his own conversation with Wilson-Raybould on Dec. 19. Wernick said he wanted to “check in” with her on SNC-Lavalin and the possibility of mediating the criminal charges against the company, as well as other legal issues before the government.

“I conveyed to her that a lot of her colleagues and the prime minister were quite anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press about the future of the company, the options that were being openly discussed in the business press about the company moving or closing,” Wernick said.

Asked later if he pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the case and halt the SNC-Lavalin prosecution, Wernick said no — he doesn’t believe he improperly pressured her.

“There’s pressure to get it right on every decision, to approve, to not approve, to act, to not act. I am quite sure the minister felt pressure to get it right,” he said.

“Part of my conversation,” he added, “was conveying context that there were a lot of people worried about what would happen, the consequences — not for her — the consequences for the workers in the communities and the suppliers.”

But he insisted that his conversation was within the “boundaries” and did not cross any line.

“So I can tell you with complete assurance that my view of those conversations is that they were within the boundaries of what’s lawful and appropriate. I was informing the minister of context. She may have another view of the conversation, but that’s something the ethics commissioner can sort out,” he said.

And if Wilson-Raybould truly had concerns about any of these interactions, Wernick said there were “multiple, multiple, multiple” occasions when she could have raised it with Trudeau — at cabinet meetings or by telephone — or she could have gone directly to the ethics commissioner herself.

But NDP MP Murray Rankin pressed Wernick, questioning whether the subsequent meetings with Wilson-Raybould were evidence of “continued political pressure thereafter to change the tune.”

Wernick said that judgment lies with the ethics commissioner, a role that he said was created for these very “ethics and government issues.

“If this is not the kind of issue an ethics commissioner is there for, why do we have one?”

Wilson-Raybould declined to speak with the Star Thursday, saying she had to attend a meeting.

The MP for Vancouver-Granville has said little so far, citing solicitor-client privilege. Wilson-Raybould has sought advice from former Supreme Court judge Thomas Cromwell on how much she can say while respecting the bounds of cabinet confidentiality and solicitor-client privilege. The government is also weighing whether to waive that privilege.

But Wernick challenged Wilson-Raybould’s rationale for staying quiet. He noted that he’s not a lawyer but based on his long experience in government, said it doesn’t appear that solicitor-client privilege applies to her situation. He said she was not acting as a solicitor and the matter was never discussed at cabinet.

“She was not advising the prime minister, the prime minister said at every occasion verbally or in writing that she was the decider. So she was not giving legal advice to the prime minister,” he said.

During his own appearance at the committee earlier in the morning, Justice Minister David Lametti said that discussions between the prime minister, cabinet ministers and the attorney general on the issue would be routine and appropriate.

“The attorney general can’t be an island,” Lametti told the committee Thursday morning, while stressing that the final decision about prosecutions rest with the attorney general.

“An attorney general can speak with cabinet colleagues about a variety of different considerations that might be pertinent to his or her decision in any particular case,” he said.

Lametti, who took over as attorney general and justice minister last month, was the first witness as the justice committee began its own investigation into the controversy, one opposition MPs charge is limited because the Liberals refuse to call Trudeau’s own aides.

He walked a cautious line, refusing to comment on the meetings that Trudeau and his officials had with Wilson-Raybould, saying he wouldn’t “speculate” on those discussions or even whether they took place.

Lametti said while he had a general understanding of the issue as a Quebec MP, he had no conversations with the prime minister on the file prior to taking on the role of justice minister. Asked whether he has come under pressure since taking the post, Lametti responded, “I have not.”

But he defended the use of deferred prosecutions — a new element of Canada’s justice system — calling them an “important tool in the tool kit.”

He said it’s another way for serious criminal behaviour to be prosecuted without “endangering innocent third parties” such as employees, pensioners and contractors because it doesn’t put the viability of a company itself at risk.

Wilson-Raybould is expected to make her own appearance before the justice committee next week. But just how much she can say remains a question mark.

Lametti would not tell the committee whether he expected a decision on solicitor-client privilege in time for Wilson-Raybould’s appearance.

Trudeau himself conceded Thursday that Canadians want to know about the allegations swirling around his government but getting those answers will depend on legal advice on how much can be said on the matter.

“Solicitor-client privilege is a key tenet of our justice system. There are serious potential consequences if we lift that privilege. That is why myself and the former minister are receiving advice to see how we can proceed,” he said.

But the combination of no guidelines, much leeway, and the Speaker himself going along with some of the spending, poses a challenge in employment law in the matter of firing.","VICTORIA — Along with much well-placed indignation, Speaker Darryl Plecas mustered some effective sarcasm in his second report on the suspended senior officers at the legislature.

For instance, his send-up of an August 2017 business junket between B.C. and Washington state, led by clerk of the legislature Craig James along with sergeant-at-arms Gary Lenz.

The James version dressed up part of the trip as a fact-finding tour on earthquake and tsunami preparedness, despite including a whale-watching trip in Victoria and attendance at a Seattle Mariners baseball game.

“Mr. James writes, ‘we were offered tickets to a baseball game,’” as Plecas put it in one of his more droll passages.

“That is only true to the extent that all members of the public are technically ‘offered’ tickets to events in exchange for full payment.”

B.C. paid for 13 tickets to the Major League Baseball game at a cost of more than $1,000.

Nothing funny about it from a taxpayer point of view, as Plecas himself acknowledged: “If this weren’t so serious, it would be the stuff of comedy.”

But it does raise the question of how the legislature should proceed in light of the two Plecas reports with their evidence of a sense of entitlement gone wild.

James and Lenz have denied any wrongdoing, nor have they been charged, never mind convicted.

LISTEN: This week on the In The House podcast, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the 2019 provincial budget. Did the B.C. NDP present a prudent plan or did government miss a key opportunity to fulfill its agenda?

Still, the clerk and sergeant-at-arms were appointed by the legislature, they were suspended with full pay by the legislature, and they could be fired by the legislature.

All it would take is for government house leader Mike Farnworth to table a motion to that effect. With leave, it could be voted on immediately and the deed would be done.

But there would also be consequences, legal, financial and otherwise.

The positions of clerk and sergeant-at-arms both come with considerable leeway and few guidelines.

The legislature, 25 years ago, deliberately exempted the senior officers from oversight by LAMC, the legislative assembly management committee. The committee, urged six years ago to add those positions to its purview, neglected to do so.

All of which sets up a problem that Plecas himself alluded to in the later passages of his second report.

“The most charitable interpretation of all of this is that Mr. James and Mr. Lenz really did, and do, consider that all these activities — the innumerable business continuity meetings and trips; the myriad of purchases; the electronics; the benefits and bonuses, and so on — were all proper and necessary business expenses,” he wrote.

He was quick to add: “I disagree, and I expect the vast majority of ordinary British Columbians do, too.”

I expect he’s right about the public reaction.

But the combination of no guidelines, much leeway, and the Speaker himself going along with some of the spending, poses a challenge in employment law in the matter of firing.

Wisely, LAMC has put on retainer Marcia McNeil, a Victoria-based expert in employment law. Readers may recall her as the author of a devastating post-mortem on the health firings, the workplace debacle that played out over several years in the B.C. Liberal government.

I gather her advice to proceed cautiously contributed to the carefully phrased motion passed by LAMC at the end of a more than 2½-hour and mostly in-camera meeting Thursday.

The motion from NDP house leader Farnworth called on the committee to first prepare “a list of specific areas of concern” arising from the two reports from the Speaker as well as the written responses and legal submission from the two senior officers.

Once the list of concerns is complete, Farnworth and house leaders Mary Polak of the Liberals and Sonia Furstenau of the Greens are to “develop and recommend an independent review process conducted by an eminent jurist.”

The jurist, probably a retired judge of the Supreme Court, would be asked “to determine if the clerk or sergeant-at-arms has engaged in misconduct in the course of carrying out their duties.”

The findings would be submitted “for consideration and adoption by the legislative assembly.”

Plecas left not much doubt that if it were up to him, they would already be fired.

Near the end of his report, he wrote that if James and Lenz really do think that what they did was proper and necessary, “I believe it shows a lack of judgment, and a repeated pattern of decision-making that is utterly unacceptable in senior executives of a public institution.”

But Plecas is not in charge of the matter anymore, as the Farnworth motion made explicit: “The Speaker voluntarily stated that he shall recuse himself from any development or oversight of the independent review process.”

In a followup media conference, Farnworth, speaking for all three leaders, made a point of emphasizing the recusal, strongly suggesting it was the end of Plecas’s involvement in the affair.

But that didn’t stop the Speaker’s right-hand man, chief of staff Alan Mullen, from calling a news conference Friday to predict that the eminent jurist thing should be wrapped up in 10 days or so and meanwhile more exposé reports were in the works.

“British Columbians are screaming loud and clear, ‘Please don’t stop, please keep going,’” said Mullen. “And oh my goodness, are we going to keep going? Well that’s a big yes.”

Just when the three house leaders thought they’d finally got a lid on things.

The regulator imposed 156 conditions on the project (it listed 157 conditions when it first approved the project in May 2016) while also handing Ottawa 16 new non-binding recommendations it says would help mitigate marine safety risks that could result from an expanded shipping terminal near Burnaby, B.C.

Robert Steedman, the chief environmental officer of the NEB, said Friday that conditions in the Salish Sea along B.C.'s coastline are already so badly degraded from centuries of human activity that the addition of just one more tanker per day would have a minor impact on the endangered southern resident killer whale population.

Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi welcomed the NEB's report calling it a ""major milestone"" and said Ottawa is committed to doing the ""hard work necessary to move forward in the right way on TMX.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his cabinet have 90 days to respond to the NEB report — they can either approve it or kill the taxpayer-owned project outright.

But despite the legislatively mandated response time, Ottawa has said it will not impose constraints on Indigenous consultation efforts — meaning a firm date for a final decision remains elusive.

The NEB re-do was prompted by a Federal Court of Appeal decision last summer that quashed the Trudeau government's initial cabinet approval of the expanded pipeline, sending Ottawa back to the drawing board on two key matters: Indigenous consultation and marine-related environmental assessment.

The 1,150-kilometre expansion project would nearly triple the existing pipeline's capacity to 890,000 barrels a day. It would allow pipeline shipments from Alberta's oilpatch to coastal B.C., and then to markets in Asia. Tanker traffic from the Westridge Marine Terminal would increase from about five vessels a month to one a day.

Dr. Robert Steedman, chief environment officer at the National Energy Board, releases the board's reconsideration report on marine shipping related to the Trans Mountain expansion project in Calgary, Alta., Friday, Feb. 22, 2019. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)

With pipeline capacity severely constrained, oilpatch boosters have long demanded a new pipeline to tidewater that would allow Canadian producers to fetch prices closer to the going world rate for oil — which could boost government revenue.

According to research from the nonpartisan Conference Board of Canada, an expanded Trans Mountain would lead to 802,000 person-years of employment and $46.7 billion in government revenue over the next 20 years.

The think-tank estimates that most of those gains would come about through higher prices for Canadian oil.

'We categorically disagree'

The NEB announcement doesn't mean the project is in the clear. Environmentalists and other project opponents warn a spill on the coast would be disastrous and say increased greenhouse gas emissions driven by pipeline exports could threaten Canada's commitment to the Paris agreement on climate change.

Anti-oilsands activist Tzeporah Berman, who works with the Standearth green advocacy group, said the project ""is not in the public interest and will never be built.""

Judy Wilson, chief of the Neskonlith First Nation and secretary treasurer of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, said the coalition of B.C. Indigenous peoples opposed to the pipeline expansion will not back down in the face of the regulator's approval.



""We categorically disagree with the National Energy Board,"" she said. ""We still say no to the project. Not only did they not listen to the Indigenous concerns, they're not even listening to our orcas.""

(Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press)

The Federal Court of Appeal said the NEB, in its initial May 2016 recommendation report, did not adequately address the impact a substantial increase in tanker traffic could have on area whales, or the threat of a spill of diluted bitumen from a tanker.

""Today, following an intensive 22-week reconsideration process, the NEB submitted its report on the project with an overall recommendation that the Trans Mountain expansion project is in the Canadian public interest and should be approved ... This report marks an important milestone as the government follows the Federal Court of Appeal's guidance,"" Sohi said.

""Moving forward, the [cabinet] will make a decision on TMX once we are satisfied that the Crown has adequately fulfilled its duty to consult. We are hopeful the work we are doing will put us in a strong position to make a decision within the NEB's legislated timeframe.""

Dooming whales 'to oblivion'

While the federal Liberals vowed to be guided by the NEB in approaching the project, B.C. NDP MP Murray Rankin said the regulator's decision was ""not acceptable"" and compared its recommendations to mitigate the project's risks to ""changing the deck chairs on the Titanic.""

""They're prepared to consign the southern resident killer whales to oblivion. Perhaps that's in the national interest where you live, but it's certainly not where we live,"" Rankin said, adding he suspects there will be further legal action against the project.

""I can predict with confidence environmental organizations are not going to take this sitting down,"" the Victoria-area MP said.

NDP MP Murray Rankin and Conservative MP conservative Jamie Schmale react to the decision by the National Energy Board over its approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. 1:08

Conservative MP Shannon Stubbs, the party's natural resources critic, said the NEB decision is good news for the many energy workers who have faced layoffs in recent months due to historically low oil prices — but she demanded a clearer timeline from the Liberal government on when construction of the project would resume.

""Today's recommendation from the National Energy Board, while positive, does not get us anywhere closer to the pipeline getting built. All it does is put the decision back in the hands of the same Liberal cabinet that failed to start construction in the first place,"" she said.

The original proponent of the expansion, Kinder Morgan, halted all essential spending last spring after the B.C. NDP government launched a series of legal manoeuvres designed to thwart construction.

Amid the uncertainty, Ottawa agreed to buy the project for $4.5 billion. On the very day Kinder Morgan shareholders agreed to sell most of the company's Canadian assets to Ottawa, the Federal Court of Appeal quashed approvals, demanding changes before construction could resume.

The court found the federal government's Phase 3 consultation process with Indigenous peoples was a ""failure.""

Neskonlith Chief Judy Wilson says Indigenous concerns were not taken into account over the National Energy Board decision. 1:05

It called federal consultants glorified ""note-takers"" who recorded the concerns of Indigenous communities without acting on them.

The previous Crown consultation team believed, erroneously, that it could not add more conditions to the project than those the National Energy Board (NEB) already imposed as part of its Phase 2 consultation, the court found.

The federal government tapped retired Supreme Court justice Frank Iacobucci to lead renewed talks with Indigenous communities. Iacobucci and his team of 60 consultants will be empowered to turn feedback into action where possible.

As of Wednesday, the consultation teams had spoken already with three-quarters of the 117 communities that will be affected by the project's construction.

A Calgary justice says the B.C. government should have waited until the law was in force to file the constitutional challenge, saying the claim was both ""premature and inappropriate for consideration by the court.""

B.C. filed the statement of claim in Alberta's Court of Queen's Bench in May 2018, challenging the constitutionality of Alberta's Preserving Canada's Economic Prosperity Act.

The act, also known as Bill 12, gained royal assent on May 18, 2018, but has not yet come into force on proclamation.

It requires exporters to obtain licenses, and gives Alberta's energy minister the power to decide how much fuel is exported, how it's transported — by pipeline, rail or tanker truck — and whether direct shipments to be stopped altogether.

""The Government of Alberta introduced and supported the Act because it asserts British Columbia is responsible for ""delays"" to an expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline … Alberta seeks to utilize powers under the Act to punish British Columbia, and to exert pressure upon British Columbia,"" B.C.'s statement of claim reads.

B.C. said a significant percentage of the fuel it consumes comes from Alberta. It adds any disruption could cause irreparable harm, both to the economy and to health and safety in remote communities that depend on a reliable fuel supply.

B.C. could resubmit once bill is proclaimed

But Calgary Justice R.J. Hall, in a decision dated Friday, said the claim of B.C.'s attorney general was made too early as the bill hasn't actually been proclaimed yet.

""Should the Alberta government proclaim the act in force, the [Attorney General of B.C.] may recommence a claim,"" Hall wrote.

Alberta Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd said the government is pleased the challenge was struck down.

""This law remains available if necessary. In the meantime, we're encouraged by Friday's NEB decision and are taking decisive action to move more oil by rail until new pipelines are built … we call on the Government of BC to recognize our shared interest in moving our natural resources to new markets as we support their efforts to export LNG,"" she said.

The bill is just one of the province's weapons in its political battle over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which Alberta's NDP-led government has accused B.C.'s NDP-led government of blocking.

""Albertans, British Columbians and all Canadians should understand that if the path forward for the pipeline through B.C. is not settled soon, I am ready and prepared to turn off the taps,"" Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said when the bill passed last May.

On Friday, the National Energy Board reiterated its approval of the $7.4-billion pipeline with new recommendations to protect the environment in B.C.

B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman took to Twitter to reiterate B.C.'s concerns with the project.

This project is not in the best interests of the tens of thousands of people who depend on our coast for their livelihoods.<br><br>We're going to continue to assert our right to defend BC's env't in court & will continue to insist the federal gov't take BC's concerns seriously. —@GeorgeHeyman

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said she's ""cautiously optimistic"" there will be shovels in the ground this fall on the project.

Police say they've closed an investigation dating back to spring 2017. That's when investigators started looking into claims that an HWAD nomination meeting was rigged in favour of federal Conservative staffer Ben Levitt when it should actually have gone to local lawyer Vikram Singh.

Investigators say they uncovered forms that ""appeared to have been falsified"" from the credentials table, where Singh and challenger Jeff Peller have always maintained party officials tipped the scales in Levitt's favour. They even found that one person who appeared to have voted that night died a week earlier.

The forms from the credentials table were ""all marked in what appeared to be a similar manner.... These ballots were all votes for Ben Levitt,"" said police. Police said they interviewed people named on the forms and found they didn't actually attend the meeting and did not vote.

Police seized more than 61 items as evidence, including 1,800 PC Party ballots, 345 credentials referral forms and 1,648 pages of email correspondence. They also interviewed nearly 150 witnesses from multiple jurisdictions and executed 15 judicial authorizations.

But in the end, police say, there wasn't enough to charge anyone.

""Hamilton police have reviewed the matter with the Crown Attorney and at this time, there is insufficient evidence to proceed with the laying of criminal charges,"" police said in a media release Monday.

""During the extensive investigation, several persons of interest were identified. Two arrests were made, but those individuals were subsequently released unconditionally. Hamilton police have reviewed the matter with the Crown Attorney and at this time, there is insufficient evidence to proceed with the laying of criminal charges.""

Vikram Singh, a local lawyer, won the total of seven other voting tables, but Levitt won based on the credentials table. (vsingh.ca)

Singh isn't upset about the lack of charges, and instead expresses gratitude that volunteers and voters supported him.

""I have full faith in Hamilton Police Service, and the detectives who spent countless hours on what appears to be an extensive and thorough investigation,"" he said.

""This story is something to reflect on, for the public and the electorate, to ensure we improve our system.""

The PC party, meanwhile, said Premier Doug Ford wasn't leader of the party when the nomination battle happened, and fixed the mess when he did become leader.

He was ""elected leader of our party on a promise to clean up the mess left behind by Patrick Brown,"" the party said in an email. ""He took immediate action to set aside the nomination and reopened it under a transparent and fair system.

""Questions surrounding the allegations contained in the police report should be directed to Patrick Brown. ""

The HWAD matter dates back to a May 7, 2017 nomination meeting at Ancaster High School.

Levitt, Singh, Peller and Jobson Easow all wanted to run for the PC party in June 2018 in the newly drawn riding. Police found Singh, a Dundas lawyer, won the combined vote of the seven regular voting tables. Levitt's win mainly came from the credentials table, which was staffed by Dykstra, Stanley and PC staffer Logan Bugeja.

Patrick Brown was still Ontario PC party leader. Singh and Peller appealed to the party to investigate, which the party refused. Both then went to the courts and asked for a judicial review.

In court documents, Dykstra said the party felt Singh ""inspired mistrust"" and ""didn't fit the right demographic."" He also said the party could pick whoever it wanted, regardless of who won at a nomination meeting.

Peller eventually dropped his challenge. Singh continued, and went to court to try to unveil a surreptitiously recorded conversation between himself and some party insiders. The court turned that down, saying the conversation had been part of trying to reach a settlement.

The party was also successful in getting the court to rule that Singh hand over $136,315 for legal costs over the secret recording.

In the end, Singh dropped his challenge too. Levitt asked for another nomination meeting, which he won. Singh wanted to run for that nomination but his application wasn't accepted.

The HWAD incident was just one of several PC nomination challenges at the time. In the end, Brown was ousted from the party following sexual misconduct allegations. Doug Ford became the leader, and eventually premier. NDP candidate Sandy Shaw won HWAD.",Dead person voted but no fraud charges coming after Hamilton police investigation,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hwad-1.5032490
429,Empty,2019-02-21T19:16:01Z,The Kingdom Hearts franchise returns with its Disney characters and complex story line.,"Kingdom Hearts shouldn’t be a good video game. First off, it features an odd hodgepodge of Disney characters like Mulan and Aladdin, along with Mickey, Donald, and Goofy. They’re joined by figures from the popular game series Final Fantasy like Cloud, a mercenary who wields a massive sword, and new ones developed specifically for Kingdom Hearts.

If that’s not enough, Kingdom Hearts features a complex story line involving goodness and darkness and multiple worlds.

But Kingdom Hearts doesn’t just work, it excels. When the first game was released in 2002, it quickly gained a massive following, selling millions of copies within its first year.

Last month, the latest installment, Kingdom Hearts III, was released. It had some high expectations to live up to, putting its developers at game publisher Square Enix, under pressure.

“Fear kills creative ambition, so when coming up with ideas, we tried to have as much fun as possible,” Tai Yasue, co-director of Kingdom Hearts III, said via email.

And if developers were concerned that their audience would lose interest after a decade, they surely no longer are. Kingdom Hearts III was the best-selling video game in January, the second time it’s topped the monthly best-seller charts since Kingdom Hearts II led the field in April 2006, according to NPD Group. In fact, consumers spent more than double the amount of money on the new game in its first month of release than they did on from Kingdom Hearts II during its initial month.

NDP Group declined to provide more details about the sales performance of Kingdom Hearts’ latest installment. But signaling its popularity, Square Enix said it shipped over 5 million copies within its first week—making it the fastest start ever for a game in the Kingdom Hearts franchise.

Disney, which bought Pixar in 2006, owns the copyright to the Kingdom Hearts games. Those are then developed and published by Square Enix for an undisclosed amount. Recently, Disney CEO Bob Iger explained the thinking behind the deal by saying that he prefers turning over Disney’s characters to third-party publishers because his company lacks a history of creating hit games.

As it has done in the past, Kingdom Hearts takes chances with its latest game that at first glance, at least, feel strange. Many of the ideas are aimed at attracting new users, rather than just catering to older fans.

For example, in an effort to appeal to the Instagram generation, the protagonist, Sora, carries a smartphone that players can use to snap in-game photos and selfies. The battles also incorporate new, complex moves inspired by Disney’s theme park attractions — think of the spinning teacups hitting nearby monsters or giant pirate ship swinging back and forth to attack enemies.

In another appeal to younger users, the developers included characters from a number of newer Disney films like Frozen, Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, and Big Hero 6. Although older films like Hercules and Toy Story are also included, older fans don’t get the same nostalgic punch as earlier titles.

The new Kingdom Hearts can be compared to Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, another aging franchise that is trying to keep up with the times without alienating existing fans. However, rather than using smartphones and flashy fighting moves, Breath of the Wild opted for a more expansive world in which players can explore as much (or as little) as they like while keeping fighting sequences similar to previous versions while increasing the difficulty.

On the other hand, new Kingdom Hearts players don’t get much hand holding. The new game assumes players know all of the previous history.

Yasue notes that there is a “Memory Archive” feature that is accessible through the top menu and title screen in Kingdom Hearts III to help fill in the gaps. It has “a few short movies that will give you an outline of what happened earlier in the series,” Yasue said.

That said, Kingdom Hearts’ latest installment still retains most of its charm. There’s an earnestness in the characters and stories, which focus on the importance of friendship, overcoming obstacles, and being a good person.

“Kingdom Hearts is a story with a lot of heart (no pun intended!) and the themes explored in the series are ones that everyone, regardless of age or background, can relate to,” Luigi Priore, senior director at Disney Games, says via email. “Friendship is at the center of it all—something we feel is beautifully captured in how the fans have created such a positive and passionate community.”

The developers also made sure the release was technically proficient by today’s standards. The different locations like the snowy Arendelle of Frozen or Olympus of Hercules, hold up against other recent games that place a larger emphasis on creating beautiful, detailed landscapes. Getting the Pixar worlds to look close to their movie counterparts was challenging.

Priore likened the endeavor to “working on several feature films all at the same time.”

Kingdom Hearts III is just another stepping stone, though.

Says Yasue, “While this is the end of the [current] story arc, this is not the end of Kingdom Hearts.”

Correction: The original article incorrectly stated there was a 14-year gap between the release of Kingdom Hearts II and III. The gap was 13 years. The article also stated 5 million copies were sold. There were 5 million copies shipped. The article originally identified Frozen, Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, and Big Hero 6 as Pixar films. They are Disney films.","After 14-Year Gap, ‘Kingdom Hearts’ Video Game Returns With Big Sales",Fortune,http://fortune.com/2019/02/21/kingdom-hearts-3-release/

Rhodes's final day with the CFL club was Wednesday. He had announced Feb. 11 that he was stepping away from the organization. He recently ended a term as chairman of the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce.

Three other candidates — Arundeep Singh Sandhu, Joel Mullan and Sant Sharma — had been running for the UCP nomination in the new southeast Edmonton riding since the summer.

UCP Leader Jason Kenney told an Edmonton news conference Thursday that a rule allows him to appoint up to four candidates, to allow high-profile people like Rhodes to run.

""We believe it is in the best interests of Edmonton-Meadows and of Edmonton to have a candidate of his tremendous calibre carry the conservative banner in the next election,"" Kenney said.

He said the appointment of Rhodes is supported by the UCP constituency association in Edmonton-Meadows.

""I don't think that we should exclude people of Len's calibre from the opportunity of public service simply because their professional obligations don't allow them to run for a nomination for six or 12 months,"" Kenney said.

Rhodes doesn't live in the southeast Edmonton riding. His home is in St. Albert, which borders Edmonton on the northwest side.

""I want to work with Jason. I want to work with the party,"" Rhodes said. ""It's more than one person. It is a party and we're going to be a team. But we're going to be aligned and we're going to work together.""

Candidates Mullan and Sharma attended the news conference. Sandhu did not.

'Shame on me for sticking around'

A couple of UCP members tweeted that they are leaving the party over Kenney's move. Natalie Pon is close friends with one of the people running for the nomination.

""Shame on me for sticking around the UCP and volunteering my time for as long as I did after the May AGM,"" she said on Twitter. ""I was naive and stuck around for a friend. Now I have no reason to.""

Longtime conservative Warren Mitchell said on Twitter he ""was walking away. Jason Kenney and his team treat people like crap.""

""Now I find out that after Jason told one of my best friends [Arundeep Singh Sandhu] for over a year that he would get a fair nomination, he broke his word by sending [Allan Hallman] to deliver the news,"" Mitchell tweeted. ""Didn't have the courage & decency to do it himself.""

Mitchell and Pon declined requests for interviews.

431,Empty,2019-02-22T15:00:07Z,It will go to a $14-million campaign for relocating Sunny Hill Health Centre for Children.,"ANOTHER RECORD: First-time co-chairs Carman Chan, Isabel Hsieh and Pao Yao Koo hit a home run when the Chinese community’s 24th annual For Children We Care gala reportedly raised a record $4.1 million. That will go toward a $14-million campaign for relocating the development-and-rehabilitation Sunny Hill Health Centre for Children to the B.C. Children’s Hospital’s main campus.

Last year’s event brought in close to $$3.4 million, which exceeded 2017’s by $836,000. Contrasting the hospital’s fiscal prudence, the gala’s theme was Versailles, the extravagant palace and estate that helped bankrupt 18th-century France and send King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette to the guillotine. Conductor Ken Hsieh and the Metropolitan Orchestra entertained gala-goers with music from Parisian Jacques Offenbach’s 1858 Orpheus In The Underworld that also enlivens the cancan dance. Happily, the gala’s fundraising co-chairs proved that they could-could and did-did.

FOR PAINT JOBS WE CARE: Open Road auto dealer Christian Chia showed a $500,000-range Rolls-Royce Cullinan SUV at the For Children We Care gala. Viewers included the event’s third-time presenter, Peterson development firm executive chair-CEO Ben Yeung. Few buyers of the off-road-capable Cullinan would likely subject its flawless, porcelain-like surface to damage along bush-and-rock-flanked trails. Ditto when parking by night in certain DTES zones, including one where developer-to-be Yeung located his fresh-from-varsity dental practice.

STARRED: Local self-made billionaire Jim Pattison and entertainers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have received Hometown Stars from the Canada Walk of Fame organization. The local ceremony followed a flossier one in Toronto where Paul Anka and investments supremo Warren Buffett serenaded Pattison with Frank Sinatra’s My Way. Rogan and Goldberg were lauded here by fellow walk-of-famer Howie Mandel. Also by teacher Mike Keenlyside from Point Grey Secondary where their stars will be embedded. Of their alma mater, “Everybody needs to know that Seth was a dropout and didn’t graduate,” Goldberg cracked.

When John Oliver Secondary grad and legendary toiler Pattison was asked if he really ought to be at work during daylight, he replied: “The answer is: Yes.” As for working for Pattison as former NDP premier Glen Clark does, successor John Horgan said: “I’ve got a job right now, but that’s an option.” That option would doubtless pay more than his current $205,400.16 salary. Meanwhile, Horgan and others might heed Pattison’s words: “Do the little things well and the big things will follow.”

BEAR FACTS: Another billionaire hit town recently. That was Seaspan Marine Corp. head Dennis Washington whose US$6-billion-range net worth is close to Pattison’s but whose 332-foot yacht Atessa IV overpowers the latter’s 150-foot Nova Spirit. Washington arrived for the premiere of Great Bear Rainforest, an Imax movie executive-produced by his son and Seaspan ULC executive chair, Kyle. Its director, Ian McAllister, met the younger Washington three years ago at a luncheon for the Pacific Wild Foundation that McAllister co-founded. Rather than conventional digital shooting, three-decade Bella Bella resident McAllister argued for Imax’s costlier 70mm film system that promises worldwide access to young audiences. The picture’s own young characters include Mercedes Robinson, who lives in 350-population Klemtu and retrieves DNA from trees where bears scratch themselves. Of her debut movie role, Robinson said: “You can get a lot of information from bears … who are guardians of the eco-system and have the ability to make it thrive and make the land more healthy.” When grown up, “I hope to provide information to the younger generation so that they protect the (bears’) territory and save it from those taking it from them.”

NEED FOR SPEED: B.C. Women’s Hospital Foundation president-CEO Genesa Greening and board chair Karim Kassam reported $300,000 was raised at the recent Illuminations luncheon. That’s where guests were illuminated regarding thousands of women plagued by slow-to-diagnose health concerns. A tenfold increase in research funding is said to be needed to address complex chronic diseases that are up to nine times likelier to affect women than men.

MEADOW MONEY: Attending the luncheon, the B.C. lieutenant-governor and former Women’s Hospital Foundation board member, Janet Austin, called the hospital’s researchers “some of the best in the world.” Then, pointing to retired Vancouver police inspector Bob Usui, who is one of her 35 ceremonial aides de camp, she told guests: “People think he is the lieutenant-governor, not me.” Her joke likely reminded some of an earlier LG, David Lam, who claimed that children sometimes misheard his title as “left-handed governor.” As for research-funding, Austin sounded in tune with rancher-predecessor Judith Guichon by saying: “Money is like manure — no good if it isn’t spread.”

NEW CARR: Bonhomie, not money, was spread on Great Northern Way recently with Gillian Siddall’s induction as Emily Carr University of Art and Design’s second president and vice-chancellor. She succeeds 22-year incumbent Ron Burnett who oversaw the much-enlarged academy’s move from Granville Island.

(the BS-Line), this is far from a done deal. The unfolding corruption scandal at SNC-Lavalin and the company’s proprietary role in SkyTrain technology puts this Millennium Line extension in question. The underlying assumptions that have been used to justify the subway also do not add up, regarding projections of growth, ridership or technology performance of various options.

The recommendations for a SkyTrain subway to UBC are based on a report that updates the 2012 SNC-Lavalin/Steer Davies Gleave report. Since SNC-Lavalin is the main supplier of SkyTrain throughout the region, it is not surprising SkyTrain was their recommendation, and since the current update is based on the 2012 report, it would come to the same conclusion again.

The Expo and Millennium Lines are a proprietary unconventional railway, of which the technical patents are owned by Bombardier and the engineering patents owned by SNC-Lavalin.

“Only seven lines have been built in almost 40 years, with only three seriously used for urban transport. Why is Metro Vancouver now the only region in the world that continues to build with SkyTrain?” asks Malcolm Johnson of the group Rail for the Valley.

Given SNC-Lavalin’s proprietary rights for SkyTrain technology and its ongoing criminal prosecution for fraud and corruption that could result in a ban from bidding on government projects in Canada, the mayors requested confirmation that other companies beside SNC-Lavalin could competitively provide SkyTrain technology.

SNC-Lavalin is already banned from bidding on Word Bank projects due to corruption, and Bombardier is also being investigated.

There also are the questionable underlying assumptions of growth and ridership projections used to justify a SkyTrain subway.

Simple solutions that could be implemented immediately have been avoided to reinforce the narrative that a subway on Broadway is the only option to serve ridership to UBC and that the system is already at capacity. Commuters have been held hostage for over a decade to justify this scheme.

Alternate routes such as along Fourth Ave. have been under-served while increased commuters from the opening of the Evergreen Line have been dumped on Broadway rather than diverted to other less-congested routes with express or expanded B-Line buses.

Also, the mode comparative costs have been biased to SkyTrain. UBC Professor Patrick Condon has shown how LRT tram systems throughout Europe and North America are built for under $50 million per kilometre, while the evaluation report vastly inflates costs to $282 million per kilometre.

The $4-billion SkyTrain subway 7.1-kilometre extension from Arbutus to UBC would be about $563 million per kilometre. Both LRT and subway estimates include a 30- to 50-per-cent contingency, even though the subway has much more risk of unknowns with underground streams and utilities to divert.

The whole 13-kilometre SkyTrain subway from VCC to UBC would be at least $7 billion. If LRT was used, the whole route could be continuously built without a transfer point for much less than the $2.8 billion already committed for the phase to Arbutus. However, that option is not part of the updated report.

If they proceed with the subway, it will be enormously disruptive and damaging to local businesses all along the route for years. Many business owners are already panicking, knowing that even with a bored tunnel there will be cut and cover at every station and for utilities. And it is still a possibility of a bait and switch like SNC-Lavalin did for Canada Line when approvals were for boring while the resulting contract was for cut and cover. There is a lot of money at stake.

Of course, the biggest money is in the development along the line. Development is really what this is all about.

But this anticipated development is not needed to meet growth and will mostly serve the global capital that will further undermine affordability. The subway extension from Arbutus to UBC is predicated on using development fees to help fund it. This will require large amounts of density bonusing for luxury condos at UBC, Jericho Lands, station areas and other sites, on top of rental development that is exempt from development fees.

So rather than development fees going to pay for civic amenities like replacement of community centre facilities at Jericho Hill, it will be going to pay for the provincial, federal and TransLink responsibilities of transit funding. This is an encroachment onto the municipal tax base. Already, TransLink is getting a regional property tax and development fee to pay for the subway’s first phase to Arbutus.

In October 2016, Green Vancouver Coun. Adriane Carr brought forward a motion, seconded by NPA Coun. Melissa De Genova, that opposed the use of development fees to fund transit. It was voted down by Vision. But now both incumbents and their parties (except for Coun. Colleen Hardwick) voted for the subway extension that included funding from development fees.

Vancouver city staff have confirmed that the number of projected new units is beyond that justified for projected population growth. And existing zoned capacity is already well beyond what is needed to meet projected growth to 2040. Yet the rush to rezone continues.

These policies go back to the failed EcoDensity policies of 2007. Former NPA mayor Sam Sullivan copyrighted the name and his then-director of planning, Brent Toderian, defined the program. After the 2008 election, when Sullivan and the NPA were wiped off council except for one seat, he said that he was a victim of density. But Vision, which promised to reconsider EcoDensity, just rebranded it with Toderian as the Greenest City.

Then Vision also approved the regional change from the Livable Region Strategic Plan to the Regional Growth Strategy. This included regional designation of Frequent Transit Development Areas that Broadway, like Cambie, is destined to become if the subway is implemented.

From 2007, the city was warned that making density and growth a primary objective would lead to massive displacement. Demolition of existing affordable rentals, character/heritage houses, secondary suites, and small businesses, would be replaced with much more expensive new construction. And that has come to pass with an affordability crisis as predicted, that will be expanded with the Broadway subway, BS-Line, corridor planning currently underway.

Sullivan now is a provincial MLA as the B.C. Liberal critic for municipal affairs. He is proposing to take away municipal land-use authority on areas around transit to further expedite this tower development agenda. The B.C. budget makes reference to expediting delivery of development project approvals, so the NDP may be looking at encroaching on municipal land-use authority too.

All this just goes to show that bad ideas are not necessarily left or right politically and can continue through various regimes. Although Vision was wiped off council in the last election, without different directions to staff from the new council, we will continue to have more of the same. But the Broadway subway is not a done deal yet and this can be turned around like the freeways and urban renewal schemes of the 1960s.

FA can be further enzymatically converted in other commercially interesting molecules, such as vanillin and bioplastics. In several organisms, these transformations often start with a common step of FA activation via CoA-thioesterification, catalyzed by feruloyl-CoA synthetases (Fcs). In this context, these enzymes are of biotechnological interest for conversion of lignin-derived FA into high value chemicals. In this study, we describe the first structural characterization of a prokaryotic Fcs, named FCS1, isolated from a lignin-degrading microbial consortium. The FCS1 optimum pH and temperature were 9 and 37°C, respectively, with Km of 0.12 mM and Vmax of 36.82 U/mg. The circular dichroism spectra indicated a notable secondary structure stability at alkaline pH values and high temperatures. This secondary structure stability corroborates the activity data, which remains high until pH 9. The Small Angle X-Ray Scattering analyses resulted on the tertiary/quaternary structure and the low-resolution envelope in solution of FCS1, which was modeled as a homodimer using the hyperthermophilic nucleoside diphosphate-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase from Candidatus Korachaeum cryptofilum. This study contributes to the field of research by establishing the first biophysical and structural characterization for Fcs, and our data may be used for comparison against novel enzymes of this class that to be studied in the future.

Currently, the vast majority of scientific articles related to Fcs concentrate on its application for vanillin production, when combined with the action of an enoyl-CoA hydratase/aldolase [ 29 – 35 ]. In addition to that, there is literature focusing on the description of Fcs transcriptional regulatory mechanism and its role in FA degradation [ 36 – 39 ]. Currently, there is no solved structure of prokaryotic Fcs, as well as, a gap of studies analyzing the biophysical properties of this enzyme. In this study, it is presented a comprehensive biophysical characterization and low-resolution envelope, along with the structural stability and biochemical characteristics, of a Fcs, namely FCS1, which was derived from a lignin degrading consortium.

Physiologically, this class of enzymes is of particular importance in the sensing of aromatic molecules by microorganisms and activation of respective pathways. The product of the reaction catalyzed by Fcs, feruloyl-CoA, binds to a MarR-family transcriptional repressor and effectively abrogates its ligation to the DNA, thus enabling the expression of genes related to the degradation of FA and other related p-hydroxycinnamic acids in several species [ 23 – 27 ]. Recently, the metagenomic profiling of a lignin-degrading consortium, originated from soil of a sugarcane plantation [ 28 ], revealed the major metabolic pathways related to degradation of phenolic compounds, including a number of putative sequences correspondent to Fcs, denoting the catabolism of FA and other p-hydroxycinnamates.

In prokaryotes, FA catabolism occurs via four major pathways: non β-oxidation, β-oxidation, non-oxidative decarboxylation, and side-chain reduction [ 22 ]. The first two pathways employ Fcs as initial step, by catalyzing the CoA-thioesterification of FA in feruloyl-CoA, with ATP consumption. The subsequent reactions direct the intermediates towards ring fission by the central metabolism, usually via vanillin and, posteriorly, through the protocatechuate 4,5-cleavage pathway.

Several research groups are currently focusing in strategies for lignin valorization, mainly exploring chemical catalysis and biological degradation approaches. The latter revolves around “mimicking” nature’s strategies for lignin degradation and consequent carbon cycling, mainly through the identification, characterization and improvement of lignin-degrading organisms and their enzymes. Traditionally, white-rot fungi are the best characterized lignin degraders and there is extensive literature on the enzymatic mechanisms of fungal lignin peroxidases [ 9 , 10 ]. Recently, bacterial degraders have also been the focus of research, not only concerning their capability of lignin depolymerization, but also the catabolism of aromatic molecules derived from its breakdown [ 11 – 13 ]. Therefore, there is great opportunity for genetic and metabolic engineering of microbial pathways, aiming the conversion of lignin in value-added products [ 14 – 16 ]. FA is the precursor of subunit guaiacyl in lignin biosynthesis, is near ubiquitous in plant cells walls of various grasses, where it endows structural rigidity and resistance by cross-linking to pentosan, arabinoxylans and hemicelluloses [ 17 ]. As biorefineries adapt to meet the cellulosic ethanol production goals, it is expected that FA, as other cinnamic acid derivatives, will play a major role as resources for bioproducts. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated the successful production of vanillin [ 18 – 20 ] and bioplastics [ 21 ] from FA derived from lignin streams and lignocellulosic biomass.

In comparison with first generation biofuels, which utilize sucrose or starch as source of fermentable sugars, the lignocellulosic biomass-reliant second-generation counterparts are considered more cost-effective and less threatening to food security and land usage policies [ 2 ]. Nevertheless, the full implementation of second generation biorefineries is hindered by considerable technological and economical hurdles, including feedstock recovery, biomass pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation optimization and biofuel separation [ 3 , 4 ]. In this context, lignin conversion and valorization has emerged as a possible solution for both cost-effectiveness of second-generation biorefineries and excessive reliance on petroleum-derived chemicals [ 5 – 7 ]. It is predicted that the amount of lignin residue from cellulosic biorefineries solely in the USA will reach as much as 62 million tons per year [ 8 ], denoting the great opportunity of valorizing this stream into high-market compounds.

Lignocellulosic biomass harbors a barely explored mine of fermentable sugars and aromatic polymers as structural components. The cellulose and lignin fractions represent the first and second most abundant sources of organic carbon on Earth, respectively, rendering lignocellulose as an attractive possibility for alternative resource of fuels and chemicals [ 1 ].

The ELS measurements were performed on a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern) [ 61 , 62 ]. The measurements were performed using a fixed FCS1 concentration of 13.4 μM (1 mg/mL) in 20 mM acetate–borate–phosphate buffer adjusted at different pH values. FCS1 was incubated overnight in the corresponding buffer prior to ELS measurements.

The Fluorescence emission measurements were performed on a steady-state spectrofluorometer model Cary Eclypse Varian. FCS1 concentration was 5 μM (0.38 mg/mL) in 20 mM acetate–borate–phosphate buffer adjusted at different pH values (pH 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10). FCS1 was incubated overnight in the corresponding buffer prior to measurements. The three tryptophan residues of FCS1 were excited at 295 nm (20 o C) and the fluorescence emission was measured from 300 to 450 nm. The buffer contribution was subtracted in each of the experiments. The measurements were made in triplicate and the average values reported.

The CD spectra were measured using a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter. FCS1 concentration was 10 μM (0.75 mg/mL) in 20 mM acetate–borate–phosphate buffer adjusted at different pH values (pH 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10). FCS1 was incubated overnight in the corresponding buffer prior to measurements. All spectra were measured using a 1 mm quartz cuvette at 20 o C over the wavelength range from 190 to 270 nm. For each pH value, eight scans (obtained on degree scale, mdeg) were averaged to form the final CD spectrum. Furthermore, CD measurements were collected at pH 7 and different temperature values (20, 60, 70 and 90 o C). The buffer contribution was subtracted in each of the experiments.

The SAXS measurements were performed at the SAXS beamline of National Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS, Campinas, Brazil). SAXS measurements for FCS1 were performed at 1 and 5 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer adjusted at pH 7. The samples were centrifuged at 16,000xg for 10 min (at 4 o C) and then loaded into a 1 mm path length cell made of two thin parallel mica windows and maintained at 20 o C during the measurements. The wavelength of the X-ray beam was 1.48 Å and the sample-to-detector distance (1 m) was adjusted to record the scattering intensity for q values ranging from 0.013 to 0.340 Å -1 . A total of five successive frames of 60 s were recorded for each sample and buffer scattering was measured before each sample scattering. The X-ray patterns were recorded employing a two-dimensional CCD detector (MarResearch, USA) and the integration were performed by the FIT2D software [ 56 ]. The scattering of water measured on the same sample cell was used to normalize the data to absolute scale. The distance distribution function was evaluated using the GNOM software [ 57 ]. At least eight dummy atom models (DAMs) were calculated using the DAMMIN software [ 58 ] without imposing any symmetry restrictions, and the resulting models were compared with each other using the DAMAVER software [ 59 ]. The CRYSOL software [ 60 ] was used to generate theoretical scattering curves from the three-dimensional structures. The atomic coordinates of the low-resolution model of FCS1 are available from the corresponding author upon request.

The hydrodynamic radius (R H ) of the FCS1 was determined by dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer, Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK). This system employs a fixed scattering angle of 173 o . DLS measurements for FCS1 were performed at 1 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer adjusted at pH 7. The hydrodynamic radius was converted to molecular mass (kDa) considering a spherical molecule and using the Zetasizer software.

The servers for remote protein homology detection HHPRED [ 49 ] and PHYRE2 [ 50 ] were used to search for homologs for FCS1 in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [ 51 ]. Molecular model for FCS1 was built using homology-modeling methods and the MODELLER software [ 52 ]. The alignment of the amino acids sequence of FCS1 against the amino acids sequence of NDP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Candidatus Korachaeum cryptofilum (ckcACD) [ 53 ] was used as input to the MODELLER software, together with the atomic coordinates of the latter (PDB 4XYL, dimeric structure) used as template. The homology model was modeled as a dimer. The template (PDB 4XYL) has 4 chains (A, B, C and D). The chains A and B served as templates for the chain A of our model (monomer), while the chains C and D served as templates for the chain B of our model. Sequences were aligned with Protein BLAST [ 54 ]. Conservation analysis was conducted with T-Coffee [ 55 ] software using 1.002 sequences with E-value < 1e-100.

For thermostability determination, purified FCS1 in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 was incubated at room temperature, 25, 37, 45, 70 and 85°C for 15, 30 and 60 min. For evaluation of enzyme stability in different pHs, 400 ng of purified FCS1 was incubated for 1, 5 and 24 h in 20 mM ABF buffer, pH 7.0–10.0, at 4 ºC. Residual activity was assayed as described in the enzymatic assay topic (incubation at 37°C for 10 min) and immediately read at 345 nm.

The enzymatic activity in a range of pHs was assayed in either 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pHs 5.8–8.0) or 20 mM (acetate-borate-phosphate) buffer (pHs 7.4–9.4). After stopping FCS1 reaction by heat inactivation (70°C for 15 min), the was pH neutralized to 7.8 by adding a highly ionic strength buffer (phosphate buffer at 2 M). Then, the volume of 150 μL of each reaction were collected and absorbance at 345 nm was read immediately. As controls, reactions without added enzyme were used for each temperature and pH value evaluated. All reactions and controls were made in triplicate and the average values reported. All initial assays were conducted with an additional control containing FA and heat-inactivated enzyme.

The temperature range from 15°C to 90°C was chosen for determination of FCS1 optimal temperature. A total volume of 200 μL reactions (as described above) were incubated at the temperature range in a T100 thermocycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) for 5 min, using the assay do conditions described above.

For determination of kinetic parameters of FCS1, the above reaction was assayed with substrate concentrations ranging from 0.05 mM to 0.50 mM. Mathematical adjustments were made using the software Graph Pad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software) to calculate the parameters. The assays were performed in triplicate and at least three independent experiments were carried out.

The enzymatic assays were adapted from previously described methods [ 47 , 48 ], the schematic reaction was included in S1 Fig . The reaction mixture (200 μL) contained 2.5 mM of MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM of FA, 2.0 mM of ATP, 0.4 mM of coenzyme A, 40 ng of purified FCS1 and 100 mM of potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.8. The activity assay was initiated by the addition of the enzyme and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Following incubation, 150 μL of the reaction were used to read the absorbance at 345 nm due to formation of feruloyl-CoA (ε 345nm = 1.9 x 10 4 M -1 cm -1 ), using an Epoch2 Microplate Reader spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).

The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole) containing 0.3 mg/mL of lysozyme, 1 mM of DNase and 5 mM of phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Following incubation at room temperature for 1 h, under agitation, the cells were disrupted in ice bath by an ultrasonic processor (10 pulses of 30 s at 30% duty cycle; Ultrasonic Homogenizer 4710 Series, Cole-Palmer Instruments). The soluble protein fractions were obtained by centrifugation for 1 h and 30 min at 8,000 rpm, 4°C, and the resulting supernatant was filtered once in 0.45 μm and twice in 0.22 μm filters. The final solution containing the protein of interest was purified by affinity chromatography in AKTA Start system (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) using a 5 mL HiTrap Chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) charged with Co 2+ and pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Elution of FCS1 was achieved using a 0–100% linear gradient of buffer B (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole). Afterwards, the eluted protein was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/600 GL column (GE Healthcare) in buffer C (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl). Buffer Exchange and protein concentration were performed using Amicon device (Merck, USA). The concentration of purified FCS1 was measured by DeNovix DS-11 spectrophotometer (ε 280nm = 43,570 M -1 cm -1 ) (Uniscience, USA) and by Bradford quantification [ 46 ]. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed using a 12.5% gel in a Mini-PROTEAN Tetra System electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R250 for 3 h and distained in distilled water overnight.

The cells from a single colony of E. coli BL21 (DE3) containing the construction pET28a-FCS1 were grown in liquid LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/mL) for 16 h at 37°C and 200 rpm. 8 mL of the overnight culture were used to inoculate 800 mL of fresh LB-kanamycin medium, followed by incubation at 37°C and 200 rpm until the optical density (OD) at 600 nm reached a value of 0.6–0.8. To induce recombinant protein expression, isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, followed by incubation at 30°C, 200 rpm for 4 h. After expression, the culture media was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, 4°C for 15 min and the cell pellet was kept at -20°C.

FCS1 sequence (GenBank accession: MG214406) was retrieved, codon-optimized, synthetized and cloned as previously described [ 28 ]. This previous work also showed the enzyme applicability for bioproduction of vanillin, together with an enoyl-CoA hydratase/aldolase. The domain architecture of the enzyme, named FCS1, was further evaluated using the Pfam and SMART databases [ 40 – 42 ]. Calculation of biochemical and biophysical parameters for the putative protein sequence were performed via Protparam [ 43 ] online tool. The annotation of orthologous groups was done by comparison against the EggNOG 4.5.1 database [ 44 ]. The phylogenetic tree was built with MEGA 7 [ 45 ].

Importing prescription drugs from Canada has long been seen as an easy solution to skyrocketing drug prices for U.S. patients.

But now that President Donald Trump and Democrats are pushing to make those cross-border sales legal, Canadian health experts are issuing a dire warning: It could destroy Canada's drug market.

Story Continued Below

Attempting to fill the United States' needs with pharmaceuticals from its much smaller northern neighbor could sap supplies in Canada, creating shortages and driving up prices in a government-run health system that itself is struggling to make drugs affordable, opponents of the import proposals say. And the result, they say, would be little if any relief for high prices in the United States.

“The Canadian shelves would run dry,” said Steve Morgan, a Canadian health economist who has advised the government on pricing reform.

The drug industry has cited such concerns as justification for blocking importation by U.S. wholesalers, pharmacies and consumers. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration strongly discourages importing drugs even for personal use, saying it can't ensure they are safe.

But the idea is gaining momentum, as evidenced by five bills in Congress — including one promoted by presidential contender Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — while states like Vermont are barreling ahead with their own plans.

Sanders, a long-time champion of importation, has the most far-reaching plan, S. 97, which would allow wholesalers and licensed pharmacies to buy from FDA-approved counterparts in Canada. He argues that Canada’s fears are unfounded.

“For years the pharmaceutical industry has tried to scare Canadian officials into thinking that U.S. importers would drain the drug supply in Canada,” a Sanders spokesperson said. The bill attempts to head off such a scenario by barring drug companies from retaliating against Canadian pharmacies that sell medicines to U.S. buyers at lower Canadian prices. Identical language is in companion legislation by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who has launched drug pricing hearings this year as chairman of the House Oversight Committee.

GlaxoSmithKline and other big manufacturers have threatened such penalties in the past after internet pharmacies shipped cheaper medicines across the border. Some of those pharmacies scaled back after being forced to report shipment details while others struck deals with storefront pharmacies to avoid scrutiny.

But clamping down on drugmaker retaliation won't address all the possible consequences of widespread imports. Even if pharmaceutical companies don’t pull their stock, it’s far more likely that Canadian prices will jump with the boosted demand while U.S. prices remain largely unchanged, said former FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan, who is now director of the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy.

Even narrower proposals to allow American consumers to personally import drugs — such as S. 61 and H.R. 478 by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) — would have to overcome hurdles. Canadian pharmacists can’t accept American prescriptions, meaning patients would need to line up a Canadian doctor to co-sign their prescriptions — which is not an accepted practice up north, said Joelle Walker, director of public affairs for the Canadian Pharmacists Association.

“Even if the legislation did pass for Americans, it’s not going to be as simple as going through Canadian pharmacies,” Walker said. “And I assume it’s not inexpensive to get a Canadian physician to see you and sign a prescription.”

What the extra requirement could do is drive business to online pharmacies — a fast-growing market that both Canadian and American regulators have criticized as a potential conduit for counterfeit or ineffective medicines, as well as shipments of illicit prescription painkillers.

The Canadian government so far has held its fire, perhaps because none of the bills are likely to pass soon. It's instead focused on a variety of price-lowering initiatives, with a national election coming this fall. One such plan would change the formulas used to set domestic prices through the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, which has only partial power over the cost of medicines and can't dictate the cost of generic drugs or what wholesalers and pharmacies pay for products. Partly for this reason, Canadians pay more for drugs than Europeans in government-run systems.

Sanders' staff has discussed his plan with the Canadian embassy and consulted with experts on the country’s drug system. But Walker said it's hard to imagine Canadian lawmakers and regulators are pleased with such ideas. Besides the Canadian Pharmacists Association, which has come out against U.S. import proposals in the past, Canadian patient advocacy groups and providers would need to sign off. And on top of federal regulators in Ottawa, Canada has regional pharmacy boards — known as provincial colleges — that ultimately issue guidance and standards for pharmacists in the various provinces.

The bureaucratic and legal landscape isn't much friendlier in the United States. A federal judge already struck down Maine’s attempt at letting citizens buy their own drugs across the border. Vermont’s similar plan, passed last year but yet to take effect, has to pass muster with the Department of Health and Human Services, where Secretary Alex Azar has frequently criticized even limited personal imports as potentially undermining strong U.S. safety standards.

Even when HHS announced a working group last year to explore importing certain drugs, Azar and FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stressed its narrow goals — saying the group would explore bringing in a medication only when it had a single U.S. manufacturer and evidence existed of supply problems or price gouging.

It comes down to FDA's limited capacity to oversee imports, said former commissioner McClellan.

“It’s an issue that has come up over and over again — FDA’s inability to ensure the safety and effectiveness of a[n imported] drug,” he said. Even doing that in narrow circumstances would require scaling up the agency’s resources and gaining access to each step of the supply chain.

Morgan said U.S. policymakers should be focused on fixing the broader health system instead of buying drugs from Canada.

“Why bother to import medicines from the country with the second-highest prices in the world? That is Canada. We’re second only to the United States in drug prices,” Morgan said.

There’s no question that Americans are paying too much for drugs, says Amir Attaran, a health-law specialist at the University of Ottawa who’s closely watching U.S. lawmakers’ efforts. “But ... tapping out your neighbor is a nasty, rotten thing to do.”",Canadian shelves ‘would run dry’ if U.S. imports drugs,Politico,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/21/canada-prescription-drugs-1188578
435,Empty,2019-02-23T16:31:10Z,Liberals pounce! The post Trump announces new nominee for U.N. ambassador appeared first on Hot Air.,"As is his way, President Trump announced on Twitter Friday evening that he’s made a decision on who will fill the vacancy created by Nikki Haley’s resignation. He’s chosen to nominate the current ambassador to Canada, Kelly Knight Craft, to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. She has some heavy-hitters in her corner.

The opening came up when former Fox News producer and State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert dropped out of consideration due to a personal issue – allegedly her nanny is in the U.S. legally but lacking the proper visa for work. By the way, how is it in 2019 that nominees for top jobs in government are still getting sidetracked because of employment issues with household staff? This allegation conjured up memories of the first purge of nominations due to domestic help issues back in the days of the Clinton administration.

I am pleased to announce that Kelly Knight Craft, our current Ambassador to Canada, is being nominated to be United States Ambassador to the United Nations…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2019

As I said, she has some heavy-hitters in her corner. She even has the backing of Nauert’s boss, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Craft emerged as the front runner for the post after being backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, officials said.

Nikki Haley tweeted out her approval, too.

Congratulations to Kelly Craft. She’s done a great job representing us as @USAmbCanada and we know she’ll be a strong voice for America at the United Nations. #USstrong🇺🇸 https://t.co/5zude3JVXs — Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) February 22, 2019

Craft is the current U.S. ambassador to Canada. Pompeo’s statement was brief and to the point.

“Ambassador Craft has been an outstanding advocate for America’s national security and economic interests in Canada and she is extremely well-qualified to do the same at the United Nations,” he continued. “I look forward to her confirmation and continuing to work with her at the United Nations.”

McConnell’s statement included a mention that Craft is a native of Kentucky.

“Kelly Craft is a strong advocate for American interests and will be a powerful representative of our great nation at the U.N.,” his statement read. “She has a long record of service to her state and the nation and I’m confident she will continue to serve with distinction as America’s voice to the world at the United Nations. I was proud to recommend this remarkable Kentuckian to President Trump.”

So, who is she? Let’s go to her bio for a little more information.

A third-generation Kentuckian, Ambassador Craft demonstrates a deep commitment to her home state by serving in several leadership roles with the Salvation Army of Lexington and the Center for Rural Development, a non-profit dedicated to economic development in rural Kentucky. She also served on the Boards of Directors for the Kentucky Arts Council, the Lexington Philharmonic, YMCA of Central Kentucky, and the United Way of The Bluegrass. With a deep commitment to education, Ambassador Craft has served on the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees, and co-founded the Morehead State University Craft Academy for Excellence in Science and Mathematics which nurtures the academic talents of young Kentuckians. In the private sector, Ambassador Craft founded a successful marketing and business advisory firm providing leadership advice to businesses in her community and across the country. In 2007, President George W. Bush appointed Ambassador Craft as an alternate delegate to the United Nations General Assembly.

She certainly has more experience than the relatively inexperienced Nauert. She’s a former Bushie and she’s been instrumental in putting together the Trump administration’s replacement to NAFTA, now known as USMCA. She will come under fire from the climate change extremists on the left as she takes a reasoned, moderate view of scientific findings in line with most conservatives. She doesn’t sign on to the hysteria that the world will soon end if the U.S. doesn’t agree to cripple our economy with excessive regulations and government overreach. Oh, and her husband is president of a coal producer and a big donor to Republican candidates, including Trump. The horror.

She faced early scrutiny, however, after she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that she believed scientists on “both sides” of the climate change debate. “I think that both sides have their own results, from their studies, and I appreciate and I respect both sides of the science,” Knight Craft had said. According to Open Secrets, a non-profit group tracking political contributions, Knight Craft’s husband, Joe Craft, who is president of coal producer Alliance Resource Partners, donated $1 million to Trump’s 2017 inauguration fund. He also donated $371,100 to Republican candidates during the 2018 election cycle, according to Open Secrets.

I can hear the snarling and gnashing of teeth now from our environmental betters on the left. Here’s a good example from California Rep. Ted Lieu. His district includes Beverly Hills, you know, the Hollywood celebrities who preach the gospel of climate change yet haven’t given up their private jets and mansions.

Dear @USAmbCanada Kelly Craft: Here are both sides: Side 1: We have 12 years to significantly reduce greenhouse gases or our children face catastrophic consequences. Side 2: We have 20 years to significantly reduce greenhouse gases or our children face catastrophic consequences https://t.co/gHgVc5OGvE — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) February 23, 2019

We’ll see how Craft’s nomination hearing goes. As long as McConnell can keep Senate Republicans together, she should be able to win a floor vote. Maybe she can even get the vote of coal country’s Senator Joe Manchin.",Trump announces new nominee for U.N. ambassador,Hotair.com,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/02/23/trump-announces-new-nominee-u-n-ambassador/
436,Empty,2019-02-21T21:19:05Z,"Premier Doug Ford’s governing Progressive Conservatives have enlisted high-powered lobbying firms to help sell tickets to the party’s swank fundraising dinner next week, the Star has learned.","Premier Doug Ford’s governing Progressive Conservatives have enlisted high-powered lobbying firms to help sell tickets to the party’s swank $1,250-a-plate fundraising dinner next week, the Star has learned. Billed by PC Ontario Fund chair Tony Miele as “the biggest fundraiser in our party’s history,” Wednesday’s event at the Toronto Congress Centre on Dixon Rd. could bring in more than $2 million.

Premier Doug Ford during question period at Queen's Park in Toronto on Feb. 19, 2019. The Ontario PC party is hosting a fundraiser next week but tightened rules around political fundraising make it harder to sell tickets. ( Steve Russell / Toronto Star )

But the tightened rules around political fundraising introduced by the Liberals in 2016 following a Star investigation — including a ban on corporate and union donations — have made it challenging to sell tickets. While companies could once purchase entire tables for such dinners and then distribute them to employees, associates or clients, each ticket must now be paid for by an individual, which has put pressure on those tasked with selling. In an email appeal to clients obtained by the Star, Chris Benedetti, a principal at Sussex Strategy Group, a prominent firm run by Conservative and Liberal lobbyists, said the company “has been asked to help with the event.”

“The event is $12,500 for a table of 10 ($1,250/person). To reserve a table please let us know and we can assist you in assembling individual registrations to then be sent in as a package,” Benedetti, who did not return messages seeking comment, said in his missive. Sources say senior aides to Ford have been personally shaking the trees — after office hours — encouraging lobbying firms to be “team players” and sell tickets to the premier’s keynote speech. According to one lobbyist, political parties of all stripes have been helped with fundraisings. The use of lobbyists to help politicians raise money, when they in turn often seek help from politicians, could be perceived as troubling. According to the integrity commissioner, who regulates lobbyists at Queen’s Park, “lobbying occurs when an individual or group is paid to communicate with a public office holder in an attempt to influence” public policy. Benedetti — an influential consultant registered to lobby for 60 different companies at Queen’s Park, including the Canadian Nuclear Association, Aecon, Enwave, and NextBridge — said he was contacted by the PC Ontario Fund last month.

“I have not spoken to anyone in the premier’s office about this event, and no one in the office or any other government office has been in touch with me to encourage sales or otherwise,” the lobbyist said. “When fundraising events are advertised that might be of interest to our clients, Sussex has provided notice of such along with their description. We do this for a variety of events, including conference, industry consultations, and other notable occasions that are of interest to our clients and contacts,” he said.

“Our role as volunteers is simply to help ensure that the most up-to-date information gets out to individuals with a prospective interest in attending. Sussex receives no compensation or benefit from this voluntary participation.” One veteran Tory, who has already bought a ticket, said his phone has been ringing off the hook with different consultants trying to unload tickets. “I’ve had friends from three lobbying firms call in the last day or two trying to get me to buy more. I told them I’m maxed out,” said the insider, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of incurring the wrath of Ford’s office. Another lobbyist, who asked not to be identified because his firm is also selling PC tickets, said consultants have always assisted political parties with their fundraisers regardless of who is power. “We’ve done it for the Liberals; we do it for the Conservatives,” he said, noting consultants also volunteer their time on all of the major parties’ campaigns during elections. “This is how it works.” Marcus Mattinson, director of communications for the party, emphasized there is nothing untoward about lobbyists selling tickets. “In order to achieve successful events, the … fund has always relied upon long-time party activists, supporters, and others to assist in these efforts and sell tickets,” said Mattinson. “Dozens of individuals have been assisting the party with fundraising for decades, and this event is no exception,” he said. Ford’s office agreed there is no quid pro quo for those lobbyists pounding the pavement to raise money for the Tories. “Premier Doug Ford takes his cues from the people and governs for the people,” said press secretary Simon Jefferies. “He is the most accessible politician in the country, and will listen to any Ontarian who wants to bring forward a suggestion or offer feedback,” said Jefferies, stressing Ford does not just attend dinners for well-heeled backers. “Doug Ford has been hosting spaghetti dinner fundraisers across Ontario at a cost of $25 per person,” he said. “These events have been massive successes, and provide an opportunity for grassroots party supporters to help the party prepare for the next election.” Robert Benzie is the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

437,Empty,2019-02-21T00:06:39Z,The budget is the last before a federal election in October.,"OTTAWA: The Canadian government will unveil its budget for the 2019/20 fiscal year on March 19 and outline ways to provide more access to prescription drugs, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said on Wednesday, confirming a report from Reuters.

The budget is the last before a federal election in October. Polls suggest the ruling Liberals could have trouble winning a second consecutive parliamentary majority.

“We’re going to talk about our twin goals of ensuring that our pharmaceutical system is both appropriate in terms of its costs and that we find a way for better coverage for all Canadians,” Morneau told reporters.

Reuters reported on Jan 31 that the budget would propose a limited expansion to the universal healthcare system in the budget to cover part of the cost of prescription drugs.

Although Canada has a publicly funded health care system, prescription medication is largely covered by private insurance and public plans that are geared primarily toward the old and the very poor.

“We have a system that doesn’t provide all Canadians with access,” Morneau said.

The Liberals came to power in late 2015 promising to run modest budget deficits to help fund investments in the economy. The party now declines to say when the budget will be balanced.

Last October the government forecast the 2018-19 deficit at C$18.1 billion (US$13.76 billion), smaller than the revised C$18.8 billion in the February 2018 budget.

“We believe it’s very important for us to continue to be fiscally responsible and that will be demonstrated in our budget,” Morneau said.

When pressed about the continuing deficits, Liberals say that a more important indicator is the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is forecast to continue dropping gradually.

TODAY:

As a special four-day summit on abuse prevention in the Catholic Church opens in Rome this morning, the scope of the crisis might best be described as both huge and hazy.

The bar is set very high for the Pope's first global summit on protecting youth from abuse in the Catholic Church, and officials have been trying to temper expectations.

A central question as the SNC-Lavalin affair unfolds is what Jody Wilson-Raybould aims to accomplish.

Missed The National last night? Watch it here.

Murky numbers

How big is the problem of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church?

No one but the Vatican knows.

Last summer, Pope Francis wrote an unprecedented letter to the world's 1.2 billion Catholics apologizing for the church's abandonment of ""the little ones,"" and asking for the laity's help in ""uprooting this culture of death.""

But as a special four-day summit on abuse prevention opens in Rome this morning, the scope of the crisis might best be described as both huge and hazy.

National churches have been taking their own approach to accusations of abuse that often stretch back decades.

In the United States, there has been a sudden burst of transparency, with 96 of the country's 178 dioceses releasing lists of ""credibly accused"" priests and other church employees over the past six months, some 2,600 names in all.

The past week alone saw the Diocese of Oakland, Calif., release a list identifying 45 accused priests, Catholic brothers and deacons, dating back to 1962. While church leaders in Brooklyn, N.Y., made 108 names public, albeit most of them belonging to now-deceased priests. And in Virginia, the Diocese of Richmond disclosed the names of 42 accused clergy — all either dead or no longer active within the church.

This, however, appears to be the tip of the iceberg.

In the spring of 2017, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops reported that it counted 6,721 clerics who had been ""credibly"" or ""not implausibly"" accused of child sex abuse since 1950. The website BishopAccountability.org, which tracks abuse allegations, notes that its database contains just under 3,900 names, meaning that more 40 per cent of the U.S. accused remain unknown to the public.

(To date, the amount of money paid out in settlements to U.S. victims is in excess of $4 billion, with new cases being filed on an almost daily basis.)

The situation is even murkier in other nations.

Canadian dioceses have yet to follow the lead of their American counterparts and release comprehensive lists. But Sylvia's Site, a blog dedicated to cataloguing known cases of abuse via news reports and court records, lists 373 Canadian clergy.

Putting a dollar figure to all those cases is difficult, but the amount must be staggering. In the fall of 2017, CBC News counted 56 sexual abuse lawsuits against Catholic diocese before the courts in New Brunswick, seeking tens of millions in compensation. And last summer, it came to light that church authorities in London, Ont., had paid out $15 million in mostly secret payments to 50 victims of 12 priests.

BishopAccountability.org has a database of accused priests and brothers in the Republic of Ireland that contains 93 names, well short of the 1,500 or more who have been reported to authorities there since 1975.

The site also maintains lists for the Pope's home country of Argentina — 70 names — and 122 accused clergy in Chile.

The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the church tribunal that handles abuse cases, says that it has received 3,420 ""credible"" allegations against priests worldwide over the past decade — enough to overwhelm the system.

Meanwhile, many large Catholic nations like France, Italy and Mexico have disclosed next to no data about the abuse allegations they have received.

And several of the bishops in attendance at the Pope's Rome summit have downplayed the extent of the problem in their homelands. For example, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, who was among the first speakers this morning, has spoken out against the idea of zero tolerance, saying that some past offenders have ""turned out to be very good priests.""

This meeting in Rome isn't supposed to forge a consensus, let alone a comprehensive abuse policy, it is simply being billed as a step in a long process.

Much work remains to be done, even by Pope Francis.

In December 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission into Canada's residential schools recommended that the Pope formally apologize for the Catholic Church's role in running 72 per cent of the institutions.

More than three years later, survivors are still waiting.

""I am sure that he has in his heart the ... suffering of these people,"" Canada's Cardinal Marc Ouellet told the CBC yesterday. ""That would be also my hope, that one day he could come. It's up to him.""

Tempering expectations

The bar is set very high for the Pope's first global summit on protecting youth from abuse in the Catholic Church, writes reporter Thomas Daigle in Rome.

The gaggle of several dozen reporters and photographers near St. Peter's Square, trying to push forward to get closer to the front of the crowd, was the first sign of an over-hyped event.

The pack was waiting for sexual abuse victims to exit a meeting they had hoped to have with the pontiff. But Francis never showed up.

And that could be a sign of disappointment to come.

By the Pope's own recent admission, ""the problem of abuse will continue"" after this highly anticipated conference involving nearly 200 senior Catholic clerics and officials.

The Meeting on the Protection of Minors — as it's officially called — got underway today and runs until Sunday. And those involved are tamping down expectations.

Anyone hoping Catholic bishops will ""change the world"" during this summit will be disappointed, said Father Federico Lombardi, a former papal spokesman who is acting as the event's moderator.

He told me the expectation should rather be for ""many new ideas and concrete models"" for protecting minors to emerge.

So much for the hopes of victims of clerical abuse. Our recent trip to Verona, 500 kilometres north of the Vatican, highlighted the deep and painful scars that remain for survivors of abuse, even decades later. And it showed how for some, expectations for the summit go far beyond what will likely happen.

Clergymen at Verona's Antonio Provolo Institute — a Catholic-run school for deaf boys — sexually and physical abused at least dozens of students between the 1950s and 1980s. One man told me that when he was 6, a priest started sodomizing him every night.

Ahead of the Pope’s unprecedented global summit on preventing abuse of minors in the Catholic Church, The National speaks to survivors taking their heartbreaking stories straight to the Vatican. 5:21

A group of Provolo victims and supporters is headed to Rome to demand compensation for the horrific abuse they endured. Their spokesman, Marco Lodi Rizzini, said giving them money ""is the only thing"" the Church can do for the survivors.

The next few days will show what the Pope and his cohort are willing to do to stop the abuse.

At Issue

A central question as the SNC-Lavalin affair unfolds is what Jody Wilson-Raybould aims to accomplish, writes The National co-host Rosemary Barton.

We are in our second week of double At Issues. And, I will be honest, we briefly considered another one on Tuesday.

The SNC-Lavalin affair is that kind of story. We could foreseeably try to analyze what is happening every day, and whether it is big news or incremental changes.

So where are we with this story?

We have allegations, two resignations, and frankly little clarity about what actually happened.

What I find even more perplexing, though, is the end game for one of the main players, Jody Wilson-Raybould.

I mean, it's obvious what the Prime Minister wants: to contain allegations he maintains are false.

But for Wilson-Raybould it seems more bewildering.

This week she sought to speak directly to cabinet colleagues. She also talked to her caucus colleagues. She continues to seek legal counsel on what she can divulge.

And then there is her line from yesterday, that she wants to ""speak her truth.""

The question, then: can she ""speak her truth"" and still be a Liberal MP?

Does she want to damage the government? Or does she simply want to defend her reputation, her sense of what is right and wrong and ethical?

Chantal Hébert makes a suggestion in her column this morning about how the resignation of Gerald Butts from his job as Principal Secretary to Prime Minister may go some way to helping resolve the crisis. ""His departure could pave the way for Wilson-Raybould to become part of the solution to the government's problem rather than the source of an ever-expanding river of troubles.""

Clearly we all have lots of questions.

Until we hear from Wilson-Raybould, which could happen as early as next week, we may not have any real answers.

For now, we will work with what we have. Andrew Coyne, Chantal and Shachi Kurl join us tonight on At Issue.

See you all then.

Feb. 21, 1984: Life in Syria under Hafez al-Assad

Thirty-five years ago Syria was a power-broker, not a basket-case. Its sickly dictator Hafez al-Assad inspired enough fear and fidelity that crowds would carry his Cadillac limo through the streets of Damascus. And bigwigs like Donald Rumsfeld and Geoffrey Howe, the British foreign secretary, came calling looking for solutions to Lebanon's troubles. The Journal's Ann Medina captures what now pass for the good old days.

440,Empty,2019-02-21T18:38:21Z,"As Democrats increasingly embrace single-payer options, the GOP ""realizes"" that ObamaCare is what the people want.","Sometimes, I am gobsmacked when I watch conservatives talk to each other. Take, for example, Kevin Williamson of the National Review trying to explain why Republicans should examine some European health care systems. Basically, this is a reaction to the increasing popularity of Medicare-for-All or similar single-payer systems among Democrats and Democratic office-seekers. For Williamson, a lot of liberals are clueless and don’t understand that Europe has a variety of approaches to providing health care and that most of them don’t resemble the “national-monopoly provision on the British-Canadian model.” In other words, maybe we can have a European system after all, and maybe Republicans should begin exploring a new approach.

But once he begins describing the situation, he quickly gets to the nub of the problem. What Americans seem to want is a system of private insurance that is regulated to ensure that everyone is covered, even if they are horrible insurance risks. Since you can’t compel private companies to operate at a loss, this necessitates a “complex regime of mandates, regulation, and subsidies.” In other words, what people want is something exactly like the Affordable Care Act.

Here’s the thing: Republicans, and most Americans, say they want a system in which insurance companies are obliged to cover expenses associated with preexisting conditions. They also want insurance to be provided privately in the market. I have a very hard time seeing how you can have both of those things without having an individual mandate, without which the underlying incentives all but ensure a dysfunctional insurance market. You’d have no incentive to sign up for a plan and pay premiums until you came down with something expensive. This is the Republicans’ dilemma: They hate the Affordable Care Act, but they want certain benefits (choice of private insurers, coverage of preexisting conditions) that more or less necessitate something like the basic structure of the ACA — which is to say, a necessarily complex regime of mandates, regulation, and subsidies. Such systems are more the norm in much of the world than is the national-monopoly model. They have significant deficiencies of their own, and some strengths, too, which would be worth understanding as we proceed.

If the Republicans hadn’t demonized the Affordable Care Act, they could use it for their alternative model to what the many Democrats will be pushing for on the 2020 campaign trail. This shouldn’t surprise us. The Affordable Care Act was modeled on the Massachusetts health care law that was established while Mitt Romney was serving as governor of the Bay State. And the Massachusetts law was based on a 1993 plan the Heritage Foundation promoted (very disingenuously) as an alternative to HillaryCare. So, we’ve been here before.

The Republican dilemma is that they hate the only solution that would approximate what they actually want. They hate it because President Obama signed it into law. They hate it because they’ve lied about this law nonstop for more than a decade and those lies are very internalized.

The result is that they’ve boxed themselves out of the health care debate. They really want to be defending the Affordable Care Act or something nearly identical to it. They want to defend this kind of system because they very much prefer it to the “national-monopoly provision on the British-Canadian model.” But they can’t really defend the status quo because they told everyone that the status quo was a Marxist-Leninist takeover of the American economy.

The Democrats will defend the Affordable Care Act against attacks, but they won’t defend it for long against better alternatives. So, how do the Republicans position themselves? They can try proposing something like the Affordable Care Act and call it something else. Maybe introducing some Swiss or German elements would give them some cover to attempt this, although they’d still be proposing “European health care.”

Williamson comforts himself that the people, at least for now, still seem to prefer a system of private insurance. But if the Republicans can’t defend that kind of system because it requires the subsidies and regulations of ObamaCare, then they can’t advocate for what the people want.

That suggests to me that the consensus on health care will soon move to the left. In a tug-a-war, things don’t remain contested when one side lets go of the rope.",ObamaCare Is Looking Better and Better to Republicans,Washingtonmonthly.com,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/02/21/obamacare-is-looking-better-and-better-to-republicans/

The p…,"After reporting a record number of B.C. real estate audit assessments in 2018 – amounting to $140.7 million – the Canada Revenue Agency is expected to receive a treasure trove of data from the B.C. government tying home ownership to income declarations.

The province is estimating it will collect $642 million over the next four years from the newly implemented BC speculation and vacancy tax, aimed at satellite families and those who leave their secondary urban homes empty for most of the year.

Whether these 2019 budget estimates hold water will partly depend on what the government deems to now be the “most advanced auditing processes in the country,” thanks in part to a suite of new efforts to collect information on home ownership.

Complex audits are bound to follow the submission of speculation tax declaration forms, policy and tax experts suggest.

The annual 2% tax against a satellite family’s assessed home value is designed to bridge a policy gap that has led to tax avoidance attributable to trends in global migration and the internationalization of B.C. real estate.

In essence, satellite family breadwinners earn income abroad while having their families live in B.C. The household thus pays little income tax in Canada but utilizes social services, the bulk of which is paid for by such taxes.

B.C. real estate audits lucrative for the taxman

In 2015 the CRA augmented its compliance program for B.C. and Ontario real estate audits. Last month the agency issued a report claiming it had collected $140.7 million from 1,417 real estate audits in B.C. alone, from April, 2018, to December, 2018. That’s $99,294 per audit, well above the three-year average of $45,182 per B.C. audit, and miles ahead of Ontario’s average of $17,241 per audit.

Tax collectors are getting more efficient, it appears, as 1,470 B.C. real estate audits from April 2015 to March 2016 generated only $18.5 million in evaded taxes.

In B.C., $173.4 million of the $310.4 million recovered in taxes – from 6,861 audits since April 2015 – is income tax related (lifestyle audits of owners of expensive homes and capital gains assessments on home sales). The other portion relates to unreported GST on sales and house flipping. Ontario’s 31,749 real estate audits since April 2015 brought in $547.4 million. Overall, the CRA also applied $70.9 million in penalties for knowingly making false statements.

The $642 million estimated new tax revenue is payment of the speculation tax only. The B.C. government says it has not assessed the amount of tax from unreported worldwide income or capital gains could be recovered from the data it collects for the speculation tax. After Ministry of Finance experts declined an interview request from Glacier Media, the government said it does expect the speculation tax auditing process to help identify overseas tax evasion and thus the ministry is expected to flag audit leads for the CRA.

Out migration and expensive homes

B.C. technically defines a satellite family as one in which reported worldwide household income is greater than local income.

Satellite family arrangements can be observed by looking at investor-class immigrant “out-migration.”

A government study of the now defunct federal investor immigrant program (foreigners paying an $800,000 loan for permanent residency), favoured by Chinese nationals, showed “out-migration” rates of investor immigrants after 10 years was 26.2 %, well above any other immigrant stream.

As an example, from 2006 to 2010, Canada admitted 13,151 investor immigrants and 34,544 of their spouses and dependents. According to the 2016 census, there remained only 7,590 of those investor immigrants and 27,370 spouses and dependents, showing a disproportionate number of breadwinners left the country within five years.

The average assessed value of homes owned by investor class immigrants in Metro Vancouver, in 2018, was $1.78 million for those admitted by the federal government and $2.2 million for those entering via Quebec, according to a recent Statistics Canada study. Furthermore, recent investor immigrants (since 2009) own single detached houses with average values of either $3.11 million for federal investors or $3.30 million for Quebec investors.

Of 121,650 investor immigrants admitted since 1986 and still declaring residency in Canada, 52% are now located in British Columbia, per census data.

Tax tries to close “bad tax setup”

Satellite family arrangement have given rise to wealthy people – often foreign nationals or recent immigrants – with access to foreign sources of money having a greater advantage in owning homes in Metro Vancouver than local income earners, said Josh Gordon, assistant professor at Simon Fraser University’s School of Public Policy.

Foreign money inflows into real estate by various means have decoupled housing prices from local income earners, Gordon contended, pointing to widely available data of the Vancouver real estate phenomenon where relatively low incomes are reported in some of the most expensive neighbourhoods in Canada.

Gordon said the purpose of the speculation tax is to close the gap on a “huge subsidy” due to a “bad tax setup.”

“It’s a tax avoidance problem, not purely tax evasion. This arrangement is perfectly legal and that’s the problem,” he argued.

“Over time much of the expensive property will come to be owned by people outside the labour market,” said Gordon.

Gordon said presumably higher consumption based taxes paid by satellite families are an inadequate substitute for any unreported or even reported worldwide income.

“Those families will be using the education and health care system for much of their life. The purchase of a couple luxury vehicles does not capture the services they will consume,” said Gordon, adding that even if worldwide income is diligently declared and paid (minus the home country’s tax assessment), Canada’s social systems are still disadvantaged.

Richmond’s Andersen Tax LLP international tax accountant Steven Flynn said at first glance the speculation tax should be able to capture those families whose breadwinner is not filing Canadian taxes. Should a satellite family try to file a speculation tax exemption, the federal and provincial governments should be able to cross reference low income to high property value, via the auditing system, said Flynn.

For satellite families, “in general terms, by filing for an exemption under the B.C. speculation and vacancy yax, you’re admitting to a government agency that you’re a Canadian resident for income tax purposes. The expectation is the individual is subject to Canadian income tax of their worldwide income,” said Flynn.

Some audits of overseas spouses could be tricky, said David Duff, professor and director of the LL.M. in Taxation program at University of British Columbia’s Peter A. Allard School of Law.

Duff said people make arrangements to ensure that they are not residents in Canada for tax purposes. So one could remain a non-resident for tax purposes even if their de facto Canadian household pays the speculation tax.

“The key is that they’re not residents for Canadian tax purposes. Residence for tax purposes is not the same thing as citizenship or permanent residence status,” he explained.

Opaque, if not non-existent, spousal status; children (students) put on the title of homes; income transferred by the non-resident spouse from offshore corporations; and cash “gifts” to the family makes for a difficult gambit for Canadian auditors, should initial red flags, such as low income declarations from expensive homes, arise, Duff said.

“Perhaps the [speculation] tax will trigger real or fictitious separations for tax purposes,” he said.

Flynn said under the federal tax act, overseas cash gifts do not count as worldwide income.

And so, said Duff, “since the CRA has no way to audit this income directly, it will have to rely on whatever information it is able to obtain from the jurisdiction in which the spouse is a resident.”

For instance, according to the Canada-China Income Tax Agreement a person shall be deemed a resident for tax purposes first and foremost if “he has a permanent home available to him.”

If the person has homes in both countries the tiebreaker is where most personal and economic relations lie. If this cannot be determined then nationality determines tax liability.

The agreement eliminates double taxation in the event a person is deemed a resident for tax purposes in both countries (and presumably files tax returns in both countries as mandated to do so).

Polling indicates the BC NDP’s new speculation tax is supported by four in five British Columbians, but the opposition BC Liberals and special interest groups have panned its implementation, citing objections such as allegedly unclear and unfair exemptions and privacy concerns about providing one’s social insurance number.

“I think its revealing that someone would be more concerned about connecting income tax data to property ownership than about widespread tax avoidance,” countered Gordon, who seems confident the tax will do what it is intended to do.

Flynn said collection of a SIN should not be a concern and would appear necessary to make the tax effective.

Bryan Short, director of the BC Freedom of Information and Privacy Association, said his group is “monitoring” the tax.

“If the B.C. government can demonstrate that the collection of SINs is absolutely necessary to the facilitation of the speculation tax, then they are not overstepping boundaries,” said Short, via email.",B.C. real estate audits reveal widespread tax evasion,Vancouverisawesome.com,https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/02/22/widespread-tax-evasion-real-estate-audits-bc/

As part of its research, Marketplace tested two services offered to identity-theft victims by Canada's two credit-reporting bureaus, Equifax and TransUnion, and learned that they won't necessarily prevent the risk of fraud.

Credit monitoring: 'It's a flaw in the system'

The top advertised product for both Equifax and TransUnion is credit monitoring — a service that costs between $11.95 and $29.95 a month, depending on the plan.

Marketplace tested each bureau's recommended plan, at $19.95 a month, by having two producers sign up with both companies. Call-centre staff for the companies said that with these products, clients can expect an email notification whenever ""key changes"" occur to their credit reports, including any inquiries or new accounts opened.

The two producers then applied for six different credit cards — three apiece — with major banks across Canada. As each bank made inquiries into the producers' files, an email notification was only received from one credit bureau — never both — and always one day after the application was submitted.

Some of the sensitive information leaked to Marketplace included credit card numbers, social insurance numbers and addresses — even recent account balances. (CBC)

Equifax and TransUnion both declined requests for an on-camera interview, but each credit bureau told Marketplace through email that financial institutions typically pull credit reports from only one bureau.

This means that in order to ensure consumers are getting a full picture of their credit reports, they would need to sign up for monitoring with both bureaus, at a cost of nearly $500 a year.

""Definitely it's a flaw in the system,"" said Claudiu Popa, a cybersecurity expert and author of The Canadian Cyberfraud Handbook. ""No amount of monitoring will give you 100 per cent guarantee that you're going to be protected against identity theft.""

Even if a consumer does cough up the hundreds of dollars each year, Popa says credit monitoring won't do anything to prevent identity theft.

""It's a reactive system,"" he said. ""In many cases, these provide nothing more than a false sense of security.""

Fraud alerts: 'They definitely didn't protect me'

When Robert Darch had his wallet stolen, the North Vancouver man knew one of the first things to do was to alert both credit bureaus.

""I thought I was doing the proper due diligence that one needs to do when you have your ID stolen or your wallet stolen,"" said Darch.

He says both Equifax and TransUnion placed a fraud alert on his account, which triggers a notice on someone's credit report, saying they may have been a victim of identity theft.

Legislation in Ontario, Manitoba and New Brunswick says that if a fraud alert is placed on someone's credit file, a lender must take reasonable steps to verify someone's identity before a new account can be opened. All other provinces and territories have no legislation around fraud alerts.

With these alerts in place, Darch said he expected someone would call him if there was suspicious activity on his file. ""I thought once you notify Equifax, once you notify TransUnion, there's like a firewall in place and you are protected,"" he said.

It wasn't until CTV News knocked on his door, wanting to know why he was selling illegitimate phones on Craigslist, that he realized the fraud alerts hadn't worked.

Watch Robert Darch explain why credit alerts didn't work for him:

This man signed up for fraud alerts after his wallet was stolen. But he says it didn't work. 1:00

Someone using Darch's identity had managed to open two phone accounts with his personal information, and was selling the phones online under Darch's name.

While Darch was able to quickly clarify the situation with the news crew, he was left concerned that the protection offered by the credit bureaus didn't work.

""I definitely wasn't covered, wasn't protected.""

Marketplace's producers also placed fraud alerts on their accounts in Ontario, where specific legislation exists. And while no credit cards were approved, producers only received phone calls to verify their identity three times out of five.

""I don't think they have any teeth,"" said Darch about fraud alerts. ""I don't think that they are going to protect Canadians. They definitely didn't protect me.""

Both Equifax and TransUnion told Marketplace through statements that it is up to the lending organization to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant.

Equifax added: ""We believe it would be a mistake to discourage consumers from signing up for fraud alerts. We believe fraud alerts are an effective way to help identify fraudulent activity and help better protect consumers against identity theft.""

Canada behind in identity theft protections

Several experts Marketplace spoke with agree one of the best ways to safeguard against identity theft is a credit freeze, which gives the consumer control of their credit by allowing them to lock their file.

Even the consumer won't be able to access any credit until they unlock the freeze. As a result, potential lenders and fraudsters can't open new accounts or even inquire about their credit.

The product is offered for free by Equifax and TransUnion in the U.S. by law — but it's not available in Canada.

""Canadians have the right to know what's happening with their personal information,"" said Popa. ""There's absolutely no reason those same companies should not be offering credit freezes in Canada.""

Claudiu Popa is a cybersecurity expert who believes credit freezes should be offered in Canada — and for free. (Jenny Cowley/CBC)

The U.S. law to mandate free credit freezes passed in May 2018 after a public outcry following the 2017 Equifax data breach, though paid credit freezes had already been available there for more than a decade.

""In Canada, we have yet to catch up,"" said Popa, who would like to see credit freezes applied by default and for free.

When asked why Equifax doesn't offer credit freezes to Canadians, the company said: ""We are monitoring recent changes made to this service in the United States to see how consumers are responding to changes in the lock/freeze capability, as well as changing Canadian consumer needs in order to create the solutions which best meet those needs.""

In a previous statement, Equifax told Marketplace that ""unless it is an industry-wide requirement, it would present a false sense of security to consumers.""

TransUnion did not respond to questions about why it doesn't offer credit freezes in Canada.

Watch as cybersecurity expert Claudiu Popa explains the benefits of a credit freeze:

This cybersecurity expert says a tool known as a credit freeze is likely the easiest and most effective way to protect against identity theft. 0:59

Lenders and creditors pay credit agencies to access customer credit reports. But major banks in the U.S. told Marketplace that if a customer has a credit freeze, they can't access the data and don't have to pay.

Darch believed a credit freeze would have saved him a lot of hassle and embarrassment.

""I don't see a good reason why we can't have that in our country,"" he said. ""And I really wish that would be fast-tracked into place, so other people don't have the misfortune that I've had.""

Ontario credit freeze law in limbo

In Canada, provincial and territorial governments have the power to mandate that Equifax and TransUnion provide credit freezes for Canadians. Marketplace reached out to all 13 provinces and territories, and none have plans to introduce new legislation around the issue.

But Ontario has come close.

Just before 2018's provincial election, the Wynne government had passed legislation that would have forced TransUnion and Equifax to offer free credit freezes to Ontarians. Bill 8, the Access to Consumer Credit Reports and Elevator Availability Act, received royal assent, but the Liberals were voted out of power before the law became active.

The current Conservative government has told Marketplace there are no plans to finalize the legislation.

While still in Opposition, Consumer Services Minister Bill Walker told the Legislature that he supported credit freezes during an April 2018 reading of the bill. ""We have to have the ability to protect our information and know what's being used or what's being given to people out there,"" he said at the time.

But after more than seven months in office, there are still no plans to push the law forward.

After Marketplace reached out to the minister's office multiple times, it released a statement attributed to Walker that said the issue of consumer protection is on its department's radar.

""Consumer protection, as well as ensuring consumers know they can trust the government to implement effective rules, is our top priority.""

When Marketplace approached Walker at a public event for further clarification, he responded: ""I will commit to you that I will go and look at it.""

According to Popa, the issue is one that requires government intervention.

""When it comes to credit-monitoring bureaus, we cannot trust them to give us 100 per cent visibility into the risk of identity theft,"" he said. ""Canadians have the right to know what's happening with their personal information.""",Credit freezes are one easy way to protect against identity fraud — but they're not available in Canada,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-identity-theft-credit-monitoring-freeze-1.4937903
443,Empty,2019-02-22T21:05:56Z,It's already clear where this whole affair is heading,"On Thursday, Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council — the top civil servant in the federal government — came out swinging against the recent allegations that have thrown the Liberal government into disarray. Specifically, after a long, eyebrow-raising introduction that had very little to do with the matter at hand, Wernick acknowledged that former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould had indeed been “pressured” to grant SNC-Lavalin a break from criminal prosecution on bribery charges and move towards a settlement in the form of a remediation agreement. Indeed, he had done some of the pressuring himself. If this was a problem, Wernick said, Wilson-Raybould should have spoken up.

But, Wernick insisted, this wasn’t inappropriate pressure. “I am quite sure the minister felt pressure to get it (her decision) right,” was his delightful turn of phrase. To Wernick, this was somehow materially distinct from the kind of “undue” or “inappropriate” pressure the Liberals have been insisting never occurred.

If this was a problem, Wernick said, Wilson-Raybould should have spoken up

The Liberal defensive lines have fallen back some as this scandal progressed. First, of course, the line was that Wilson-Raybould had not been “directed” — the prime minister himself stuck to that one quite closely for days. It was an odd thing for him to say, as the original Globe and Mail story that kicked this whole affair off had never said the former attorney general was directed, but rather that the Prime Minister’s Office had tried pressuring her. When that non-denial didn’t help, the Liberals shifted gears slightly. Consider Monday’s resignation letter by Gerald Butts, the prime minister’s now-former principal secretary: “I categorically deny the accusation that I or anyone else in (the prime minister’s) office pressured Ms. Wilson-Raybould,” he wrote.

How the Liberals reconcile that categorical denial with Wernick’s subsequent admission that he is “sure the minister felt pressure” remains to be seen. But it’s already clear where this whole affair is heading. Unless Wilson-Raybould ultimately says nothing, or suddenly starts offering complete, if belated denials that she was pressured, the Liberals are going to find themselves arguing that this accomplished Indigenous woman simply overreacted when a series of men tried to pressure her into making a decision that was rightfully hers to make — and if she’d been bothered by the pressure, it was her responsibility to take action.

It would be an interesting response. It’s possible that senior Liberals might even believe there is some truth to it. But if that’s the best they’ve got, it will be something to see feminist, progressive Trudeau resorting to “blame her” as his defence against a scandal that continues to bog down his government.",NP View: Trudeau’s SNC-Lavalin defence is awkwardly shaping up to be ‘blame her’,Nationalpost.com,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/np-view-trudeaus-snc-lavalin-defence-is-awkwardly-shaping-up-to-be-blame-her
444,Empty,2019-02-25T10:00:00Z,"Don’t expect to see the much-discussed national pharmacare plan in the March budget, writes David Olive.","Universal pharmacare has long been in place widely in Europe. The Liberal-dominated Commons health committee called last year for universal pharmacare, because about 20 per cent of Canadians are uninsured or under-insured for drugs. And roughly one in 10 Canadians goes without prescription drugs because they cannot afford them.

In the spring budget, just over three weeks from now, the Trudeau government will once again pass on the chance to finally give Canadians the universal pharmacare that doctors and a multitude of studies have shown is needed to improve patient outcomes and reduce the country’s prescription-drug bill.

That’s not what the doctor ordered, but it is what the insurance lobby wants. And the Trudeau government will oblige the private insurers, who fear having to compete with universal pharmacare.

Morneau will speak glowingly of how the Trudeau government is “filling the gaps” in our patchwork system of drug spending by government, private drug plans, and the $3.6 billion that Canadians spend out of pocket on prescriptions. Actually, Morneau will add complexity to the patchwork system rather than streamline it.

But in his next budget, which was set last week for March 19 , Finance Minister Bill Morneau will reject that holistic solution. He will instead announce narrowly targeted partial coverage of selected patient groups.

A government that has already broken its promise to balance the books by now understandably blanches at the estimated $20.4 billion annual cost of universal pharmacare. But the country’s total drug bill would actually drop by an annual $4.2 billion, according to the federal budget watchdog, due to volume buying by a single provider.

Putting private-sector insurers ahead of the people doesn’t sound like an effective means of winning a tight election contest in October.

The Alberta election campaign hasn’t officially started yet, and already the man poised to win it has effectively declared war on the rest of the country.

As premier, after a provincial election that must be held by May 31, Jason Kenney will demand that Ottawa sunder the federation by withholding transfer payments from provinces that don’t do Alberta’s bidding (that would be B.C., Quebec and to a lesser extent Ontario) by deep-sixing their misgivings about new heavy-oil pipelines in their backyards.

If those pipelines don’t rapidly materialize, Kenney will hold a nationally divisive Alberta referendum on the equalization-payments system. And he wants Ottawa to debauch the Federal Court of Appeal, which ordered a halt to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, by using a Constitutional provision to overturn that decision.

At home, Kenney will set Indigenous communities against each other, favouring pro-pipeline communities with subsidies (that sure sounds like a bribe), and withholding the same from pipeline opponents.

He’ll throw Alberta teachers into confusion over elements of the curriculum that strike him as an NDP socialist plot. And he’ll strip farm workers of recently won means of redress for workplace injuries, on the untested theory that a safe farm is an unprofitable one.

Premier Rachel Notley has already blamed Canada for Alberta’s self-inflicted woes. Expect four more years of the same, only ramped up to firebrand level.

But understand that the next spell of Wildrose Country vitriol is coming from a good place. Kenney says he is simply “moving Alberta from an apologetic or defensive posture to an assertive posture.”

Apologetic? We await with interest a list from Kenney of Alberta’s apologies.

No rush, our patience is infinite.

Tariff-bully Trump: First Canada, now Germany

Canada may soon have an ally in Germany in our mutual despair over the U.S. as a threat to our economies.

Germany is bracing for the same 25 per cent tariffs on U.S. auto imports that U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Canada with in pressuring Ottawa for a makeover of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that neither Ottawa nor Canada’s business community much likes.

The looming tariffs on the German auto sector threaten to pitch Europe’s biggest economy into recession.

Recall that Trump justifies America’s continued 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian steel on the specious grounds that imported Canadian steel girders somehow threaten U.S. national security.

A long-awaited report by Trump’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, a former steel baron, is expected to make the same bogus assertion about imports from Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG.

Likely the best way this turns out is a compromise that imposes quotas on German auto imports, but that would be damaging in reducing the revenues of a key German economic sector.

A more productive outcome would be a German commitment to make more vehicles in the U.S. The Germans already do so, of course.

Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said recently she doesn’t understand how the BMWs built in South Carolina are a threat to U.S. national security. She might be wiser to put ironies aside and accurately broadcast Trump’s tariffs as an attack on Europe, given that the German auto sector assembles vehicles and sources parts widely across that continent.

None of this would be an issue, of course, if only Detroit made cars as well as the Germans, who perfected the internal-combustion engine in the 19th century and have never looked back.

Canada: Scandal Involving P.M. Justin Trudeau Linked to Libya: The cesspool of romancing Jihad.

Posted on by SeekAndFind

Four years ago, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officially leveled corruption and fraud charges against Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin, over alleged criminal acts that occurred while that firm was doing business in Libya. The Globe and Mail broke the biggest scandal since Canadas Adscam scandal, which cost the Liberals dearly in election year 2006. This latest scandal, also breaking in an election year, has to do with the involvement of Justin Trudeau and the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) in the SNC-Lavalin case.

SNC-Lavalin operates in a variety of sectors globally, including mining and metallurgy, oil and gas, and the fraud and corruption charges against it include nearly $48 million in payments made to Libyan government officials between 2001 and 2011.

The case centers around Liberal MP Jody Wilson-Raybould (JWR), who served as Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada from 2015 until January 2019. She was then demoted in a cabinet shuffle to the position of Minister of Veterans Affairs, and suddenly resigned several days ago (February 12) following the Globe and Mail report, which alleged that the PMO attempted to press her to intervene in the corruption and fraud prosecution of SNC-Lavalin in her role as Attorney General, in order to spare the engineering giant  deemed to be a crown jewel in Quebec  from criminal prosecution. The story also indicated that she came under heavy pressure.

Now the Commons Justice Committee will look into whether JWR was subjected to any kind of pressure from Trudeau and/or the PMO. Meanwhile, Trudeaus principal secretary, Gerald Butts, has suddenly quit. Butts is Trudeaus longtime friend, confidante and confidence booster, and some even say that Butts is his brains. Trudeau calls Butts the core of his inner circle. The resignation was over the SNC affair. Criminal charges could also be laid against members of the PMO for obstruction of justice, if its interference is established.

Doing Business with a Jihadist Government:

There is another twist in the criminal case involving SNC Lavalin, and the alleged involvement by Justin Trudeau and the PMO: Libya.

Between 2001 and 2011, a senior executive of SNC-Lavalin established close ties with Saadi Gaddafi, the son of the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The RCMP alleged that as the presidents son, Saadi Gaddafi was in a position of power and able to give a business advantage to SNC-Lavalin in Libya, and that he was a major recipient of SNCs largesse. Court documents allege that the company offered bribes worth $47.7 million to one or several public officials of the Great Socialist Peoples Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin was allegedly busy defrauding Libyan public agencies of approximately 129.8 million. Charges were laid by the RCMP against SNC executive Sami Bebawi and a former SNC executive vice president, Riadh Ben Aissa, who pleaded guilty to charges of corruption and money laundering relating to SNC-Lavalins Libyan operation. Aissa has since been extradited to Canada.

It has also been claimed that SNC paid for lavish trips and more for relatives of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and even had some on payroll to ensure they got lucrative contracts.

Saadi Gaddafi also has other unsavory personal baggage. He was acquitted last year of murdering Bashir al-Rayani, former footballer and coach of Tripolis Al-Ittihad football club. But now Bashirs family intends to appeal Gaddafis acquittal, because they say we could not get justice under his fathers regime, we will get it now, Im confident!

Some more background about the Libyan regime that SNC was allegedly wheeling and dealing with: Muammar Gaddafi seized power in Libya in a military coup detat in 1969. He was known for horrific human rights abuses, a supporter of jihad terror, fervently Islamic and pro‐Palestine, and once stated: Christianity is not a faith for people in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. Other people who are not sons of Israel have nothing to do with that religion .all those believers who do not follow Islam are losers ..We are here to correct the mistakes in the light of the teachings of the Koran. Gaddafi also declared that Iranians are our brothers and fed into the victimology narrative that America was the great oppressor.

So here is the Canadian government involved not only in possible obstruction of justice, but also in trying to cover up the links of SNC-Lavalin with the Gaddafi regime.

As Trudeau scrambles to do damage control, it should be remembered that he has embraced Islamic supremacists, as well as policies of open-door immigration, heedless of the costs of all this to taxpayers. Meanwhile, he perpetually downplays the dangers of jihad, to the peril of Canadian citizens.

Even the Liberal-leaning CBC noted that in the week since the SNC-Lavalin story broke, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has changed his talking points several times, and now risks brand damage. Between the Globe and Mail and the CBC, it doesnt look as if the $600,000,000 bailout package that Trudeau pledged to media, widely considered to be a bribe in an election year, is working in his favor.

In all 46 per cent of respondents said Canada is doing worse since Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government was elected in 2015, while only 22 per cent believed the country is doing better and 27 per cent said things are the same.

A poll conducted by Leger for The Canadian Press indicated the Trudeau Liberals haven’t convinced Canadians the country is doing better under their leadership. ( Riley Smith / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

Leger’s executive vice-president Christian Bourque said these numbers come despite economic indicators showing the country’s economy is performing better than in 2015. Regional concerns particularly in Western Canada over the state of the oil and gas industry, are affecting the way voters are viewing the overall state of the country, Bourque said. “In Alberta, for example, we see that 59 per cent of people believe Canada is doing worse, so there are regional issues affecting that overall number, but it is quite staggering,” Leger said.

The results were weighted to reflect age, gender, mother tongue, region and level of education in order to ensure a representative sample. While a margin of error cannot be associated with web-panel survey data, a probability sample of the same size would have a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

The poll also looked at what issues are most important to Canadians, suggesting pocketbook issues are what is top of mind. Economic growth and jobs topped the issues list for respondents, followed by taxes and finances. When asked whether the Trudeau government has done a good job or a poor job on specific issues, 22 per cent of respondents said they felt the Liberals have done a good job on the economy and employment and another 34 per cent are on the fence. Bourque said the economy is an area the Liberals should focus on as they prepare their campaign messaging for the upcoming federal election, with regional focuses since the level of concern over jobs and the economy varies depending on where Canadians live. “I think they need to demonstrate and spend time crafting out careful messages about how their plan for successive deficits is actually paying off and making our economy better,” Leger said. Another key finding in the survey suggests a hardening of public opinion against immigration in Canada. A total of 44 per cent of respondents said they believe Canada welcomes too many immigrants, and 45 per cent said the same of refugees. Meanwhile, 37 per cent said they believe Canada welcomes “enough” immigrants and only 11 per cent said Canada welcomes too few immigrants and refugees. These were similar to views expressed in a November survey, Bourque says, but notes that a shift has taken place in recent years indicating weakening support for immigration levels. In past years, there seemed to be consensus that Canada is a welcoming country for newcomers, but poll numbers suggest this perspective has changed. The Leger survey shows higher numbers of Conservative voters said they believed Canada welcomes too many immigrants, while Liberal voters are more content with current newcomer levels. There also appears to be little to no differentiation between economic immigrants and refugees, according to the survey results. “I think immigration is becoming a national issue and one that will need to be addressed by all parties in the fall,” Bourque said.

Quebec lawyers try to save immigrant applications amid crackdown

Reuters ^ | February 22, 2019 | by Allison Lampert

Posted on by Oldeconomybuyer

MONTREAL - Lawyers in the Canadian province of Quebec on Friday asked a judge to halt the suspension of almost 20,000 applications by immigrants caught up in a crackdown by the new center-right government.

Draft legislation by the Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) has triggered the suspension of 18,000 applications made under existing laws from immigrants seeking to live in the predominantly French-speaking province. The CAQ, which won power in October, has said that the reforms would improve newcomers integration into the workforce.

Lawyer group Association québécoise des avocats et avocates en droit de limmigration asked Quebec Superior Court Justice Frederic Bachand to order the government to process existing newcomers applications as the bill is being debated.

The CAQ campaigned on a pledge to cut immigration from 50,000 to 40,000 people a year and expel new residents who fail to pass tests on French and Quebec values within three years.

The policy could put Quebec on a collision course with the Liberals of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who are hoping to make gains in the province to offset expected losses elsewhere in a federal election this October.

Last year federal officials stressed that Ottawa had overall responsibility for immigration law in Canada.

The Justice Department says in a reply filed in court last month that Bercovici’s “bold allegations” should be dismissed. Read More: Trudeau’s top aide resigns amid reports of meddling in SNC-Lavalin probe Opinion | Susan Delacourt: Here’s the downside of concentrating power in the Prime Minister’s Office Bercovici has been a source of controversy since Harper appointed her as his envoy to Israel in 2014. She was not a career diplomat — which is not unusual for high-profile ambassadorial appointments — but she faced internal opposition within the foreign ministry for being too pro-Israel. Bercovici is Jewish and a self-described supporter of Israel.

The Harper Conservatives faced frequent criticism that they were too pro-Israel in their Middle East stance, and vigorously rejected the long-held notion in Canadian diplomacy that Ottawa should see itself as an “honest broker” in the conflict between the Jewish state and the Palestinians. Bercovici’s lawsuit alleges she was unwelcomed by the bureaucracy from the moment she was appointed. She was “not only unsupported in her role, but the individual named Defendants as well as countless others within the Public Service, intentionally and maliciously waged a campaign of abuse” against her.

After the Liberals fired her in mid-2016 — as they were entitled to do — Bercovici alleges the government withheld almost $32,000 in pension benefits. She is suing for that amount, as well as millions of dollars in punitive and moral damages. Bercovici’s lawsuit alleges that she reached out to Telford repeatedly through emails and phone calls to deal with her pension issue, but was ignored each time. In her lawsuit, she is seeking $250,000 in damages from Telford for the “intentional affliction of mental suffering.” The motion to add Telford and four senior Global Affairs Canada officials as defendants was filed in December and is to be argued in a Toronto court on Monday. On Jan. 9, the Justice Department filed its reply with the court, arguing that there was no merit to adding five new defendants to the lawsuit. “The Plaintiff’s claims against the proposed individuals is frivolous and discloses no reasonable cause of action,” says the factum filed by the Justice Department. “The allegations made by the Plaintiff do not rise to the level of ‘flagrant and outrageous’ conduct. The Plaintiff has failed to plead any material facts to support her allegations of being ‘sidelined’, ‘threatened,’ ‘undermined’ or suffering ‘personal attacks.’ The Plaintiff makes bold allegations that are devoid of any particulars.” The long-simmering legal drama is unfolding as the Prime Minister’s Office grapples with the resignation of Butts, who served as Trudeau’s principal secretary and most trusted adviser. Butts denied any impropriety but said he was becoming a distraction to the government amid swirling allegations that unnamed officials in the Prime Minister’s Office put undue pressure on the former attorney general in a case involving engineering firm SNC-Lavalin. Butts and Telford were the architects of Trudeau’s rise to the Liberal party leadership and his subsequent 2015 election victory. Natalie MacDonald, Bercovici’s lawyer, suggested the current controversy enveloping the Prime Minister’s Office has resonance for her client. “We have pleaded that Katie Telford, a central figure in the PMO, purposely ignored repeated requests for immediate assistance and intervention with respect to the government’s unconscionable withholding of Ms. Bercovici’s pension monies,” MacDonald told The Canadian Press. “Our client was given no choice but to sue. Given what has come to light in Ottawa in recent weeks, we now question to what extent did the PMO direct the Attorney General to withhold Ms. Bercovici’s pension monies.”

449,Empty,2019-02-22T22:52:00Z,The Star breaks down five key issues in the Doug Ford government’s proposed policing legislation.,"When Ontario’s Attorney General proposed new policing legislation earlier this week, the message was clear: officers are “everyday heroes” who have the government’s unwavering support. “Our police deserve our respect,” said Caroline Mulroney at an announcement at Halton Regional Police Service headquarters, unveiling the Doug Ford government’s proposed plans to “fix” policing laws brought in under the previous government less than a year ago.

Mulroney was backed up by Sylvia Jones, the minister of community safety and correctional services, who said the Liberals’ omnibus policing legislation — known as the Safer Ontario Act, or Bill 175 — was a “disaster” and the “most anti-police legislation in Canadian history.” But hours later once the hefty 363-page legislation landed at Queen’s Park, it became evident the proposed legislation isn’t a complete rewrite of the previous government’s laws, which when passed in March were hailed as “historic” for strengthening police oversight. Some key parts are, in fact, identical.

What it is: Right now, police are expected to notify the SIU whenever it’s reasonable the watchdog’s mandate could be invoked: namely, when someone has died, been injured, or alleges they were sexually assaulted during any encounter with police. If there’s doubt, police are expected to err on the side of caution and let the SIU decide whether the threshold for an investigation has been met. Has it changed from the Liberals’ bill? Yes, though more in the spirit of the legislation’s interpretation. Mulroney specified that police services will no longer be expected to call the SIU for certain kinds of deaths — like when officers are present for a suicide, or when someone dies of a heart attack in their presence — provided its reasonably clear police conduct was not a contributing factor.

Article Continued Below

The intent, Mulroney said, is to spare officers a lengthy and stressful investigation into how they tried to save a life, and free up the SIU’s time and resources to focus on cases core to its mandate. In cases such as deaths and injuries caused by use of force, or allegations of sexual assault, notification of the SIU will still be mandatory. When the watchdog probes cases of an officer unsuccessfully attempting to save a life, “he or she is treated like a suspect,” Mulroney said, and “this is not what the SIU should be doing.” Why it matters: The issue has been a thorny one between police and the watchdog, most recently over to the growing number of officers carrying naloxone, an antidote to opioid overdoses — yet another instance where an officer may fail at saving a life, then become the subject of an SIU probe. But the debate dates back more than two decades, and in 1998 the disputes prompted a review of by former Ontario Superior Court judge George Adams. “The issue of notification must be treated more like that of calling an ambulance — when in doubt, call,” he concluded.

Adams acknowledged the approach would result in unnecessary calls to the SIU, but he said the public would have more confidence in a decision not to investigate if it was made by an independent body. And while the SIU has the reputation amongst many police services for unfathomably long investigations, it does have the ability to examine an incident and decide not to pursue a full-fledged probe — a process called “closed by memo”. This allows the watchdog to at first scrutinize a death, injury or allegation, then decide no probe is needed. This has occurred, for example, in deaths involving an officer administering naloxone. On average, those investigations have been terminated in less than one month. The SIU can also quickly decide not to investigate — as recently happened in the case of Roopesh Rajkumar, the father alleged to have killed his 11-year-old daughter, Riya, after it was discovered he had suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound before OPP officers arrested him (he later died). Under the proposed legislation, it’s likely the watchdog will no longer be called. Though welcomed by police associations this week, the change presents a slippery slope, says Kingsley Gilliam, a founding member of the Black Action Defence Committee (BADC), whose advocacy in the 1980s was a catalyst for the creation of the SIU. The group protested in the streets precisely because they did not want police making the determination on when an investigation was warranted. “Which police officer is going to squeal on his partner to say that he committed a criminal act?” he asked. Issue No. 2 — Suspension without pay What it is: Determining when Ontario’s police chiefs can suspend an officer without pay when he or she is facing criminal charges or serious misconduct allegations. Ontario is the only province in Canada that requires, by law, that an officer must be paid while suspended unless they are sentenced to jail time. Has it changed from the Liberals’ bill? No. Similar to Bill 175, the proposed COPS Act would allow for a few more circumstances in which an officer might be suspended without pay, including for convictions for an offence, even if it’s under appeal, or when an officer is charged with certain serious offences, to be determined in future regulations.

Why it matters: The ability for chiefs to suspend more officers without pay has been called upon for years, foremost by the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police (OACP). The province’s strict stance is widely perceived as both a waste of tax money and, too often, an embarrassment. A few high-profile cases have exposed how officers facing serious allegations have continued to collect a large salary for years. In 2015, a Waterloo Regional Police officer made headlines with a mocking email in which he thanked his service for the perks of his three-year paid suspension — a “dream come true” which included golf, travel and the ability to take a firefighter course. In another case, former Toronto Police Const. Ioan Floria was paid while suspended for 11 years before he was fired last year. Jeff McGuire, executive director of the OACP, said earlier this week that police chiefs did not see what they wanted in the proposed legislation. “It’s not something we relish or look forward to doing,” McGuire said, “but as the managers of the service there are times when, in our opinion, we should have the authority to suspend without pay. And it is very limited right now.” Issue No. 3 — SIU transparency requirements What it is: Requiring that the SIU provide greater details about its decisions to not lay any charges against the police. This would ideally come in the form of a publicly available report, complete with relevant photos, videos, a narrative of the incident and detailed account of how the SIU came to its decision.

Has this changed from the Liberals’ bill? No. This is was a central tenet of the Liberals’ Safer Ontario Act, and its virtually ‘copy-pasted’ into the COPS legislation, though the PC bill does add that “any delays” in the investigation be noted in the required timeline. Why it matters: Up until the high-profile death of Andrew Loku, a Black mentally ill man killed by Toronto police in 2015, the SIU provided limited explanation of its decisions, via a press release announcing whether an officer would be charged. In his 2017 review of police oversight in Ontario, Justice Michael Tulloch had a laser-focus on transparency, and one of his key recommendations was that the agency become “more open, candid, and communicative,” including by releasing detailed public reports “in every case in which it does not lay charges.” He noted there was an “overwhelming need for greater transparency.” The SIU has since adopted a practice of providing far more extensive reports on some cases where no charge is laid, including fatal police use of force. The COPS Act, however, will make this reporting required by law, as the Liberals’ bill would have accomplished. “I’m pleased they kept it in — I’m surprised they kept it in,” said Sandy Hudson, one of the founding members of Black Lives Matter Toronto, which demanded the release of far more information about Loku’s shooting death and all other SIU investigations. “We fought a lot for transparency. It’s something that we need in order to actually understand what is happening in our communities,” she said. She added, however, that the provision of requiring more information is undercut by giving police “far more discretion on when they call the SIU” due to the changes to notification requirements.

Issue No. 4 — Public complaints about police What it is: Revamping Ontario’s independent police complaints agency. Currently, complaints about the police in Ontario can be filed with the Office of the Independent Police Review Director (OIPRD). Established in 2008, the office accepts and screens complaints about police across Ontario, determining whether further investigation is required. If so, the agency either assigns one of its own investigators to the case, or refers it back to the police service in question. The OIPRD also conducts systemic reviews to tackle larger issues within policing in the province. Late last year, the agency wrapped a major probe into the Thunder Bay Police Service’s handling of cases involving deaths or disappearances of Indigenous people. Has this changed from the Liberals’ bill? Yes. The PC legislation acts on a Tulloch recommendation to rename the organization, whose unwieldy title and acronym confuse citizens and police alike. Under COPS, the OIPRD would become the Law Enforcement Complaints Agency (LECA), its mandate would include some special constables and peace officers, and it would retain the ability to launch systemic investigations. Similar to how the complaints body works now, the proposed LECA would receive complaints then either investigate in house, or assign a probe to a police service, including the service where the complaint originated. That’s a departure from Bill 175’s proposed “Ontario Policing Complaints Agency” — the Liberals had demanded that, within a five-year period the agency be fully independent, no longer referring complaints out. Why it matters: As noted in Tulloch’s report, the vast majority of public complaints brought to the OIPRD are referred back to the police service for investigation, which he concluded “erodes public confidence in the complaints process.” During his broad public consultation, the judge found a “deep mistrust of the public complaints process,” and the referral back to police services was “seen as a major impediment to a good-faith and impartial investigation.” Gilliam, from BADC, had lauded recent efforts to make the complaints system fully independent.

“That’s a retrograde move there,” said of the PC’s proposed complaints body, noting the Liberals’ bill would have meant “some semblance of confidence could be restored.” “This is a setback,” he said. Issue No. 5 — SIU power to charge civilians What it is: Determining whether the SIU should be allowed to investigate and charge non-police officers. Currently, the SIU can investigate and charge a civilian, even though its core mandate is to probe the actions of police officers. They can do so if the civilian is involved in alleged criminal activity alongside a police officer. The situation is exceedingly rare, but the watchdog did charge a civilian in 2017: Christian Theriault, who alongside his Toronto police officer brother Michael Theriault, is alleged to have assaulted Dafonte Miller in a high-profile incident in late 2016. Has this changed from the Liberals’ bill? Yes. Bill 175 had provided for the watchdog to continue to be able to investigate a civilian under certain circumstances. The PC bill removes that power. “Police would still be able to investigate in such situations, allowing the SIU to concentrate on its core mandate,” according to Ontario government backgrounder. Why it matters: In the case of the Theriault brothers — who are set to go to trial later this year — the incident was the subject of widespread public outrage, with members of the public and Miller’s lawyer Julian Falconer alleging there had been the “deliberate concealment” of a crime. That’s because the SIU had not been called in to investigate the circumstances surrounding Miller’s severe injuries, including damage to his eye, following an encounter with the Theriault brothers in Whitby; neither Toronto police, who employ Michael Theriault, nor the Durham Regional Police Service, where the incident occurred, notified the watchdog. As pointed out by Falconer and others, the Theriault brothers’ father was employed at the time in the Toronto police professional standards unit. Under the proposed PC system, the investigation into Christian Theriault would have instead been taken over by police, which Toronto lawyer Daniel Brown says would not inspire confidence, given the perception of bias in the case. He says though they are uncommon, there may be other instances where the SIU should be allowed to investigate and charge a civilian in order to ensure public confidence in the probe. “These instances are rare, but given that, why are we so worried about the SIU investigating them?” Wendy Gillis is a Toronto-based reporter covering crime and policing.

450,Empty,2019-02-22T09:00:00Z,"Michael Wernick, Canada's top bureaucrat, testified before the Commons justice committee Thursday, saying he did not inappropriately pressure former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to cut a legal deal with the Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin —…","Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, Canada's top bureaucrat, testified before the Commons justice committee Thursday, saying he did not inappropriately pressure former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to cut a legal deal with the Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin — although he did warn her of the consequences of prosecuting the criminal charges.

More than any other government player said to be involved in this ballooning controversy, Wernick spoke in clear terms about what he saw happening inside the machinery of government as the federal Liberals grappled with the file.

In 2015, the Mounties laid corruption and fraud charges against SNC-Lavalin over allegations it used bribery to secure government contracts in Libya.

In an effort to avoid a criminal trial, SNC-Lavalin lobbied a cross-section of cabinet ministers, MPs, senators, senior bureaucrats and premiers, asking that some sort of remediation agreement be reached that would allow it to avoid a criminal conviction. A conviction would exclude the firm from bidding on future government contracts for up to 10 years — which could financially cripple the company and threaten its continued viability.

Here are five things we learned from Wernick's testimony:

1. Wernick takes aim at Globe story

Earlier this month, on Feb. 7, the Globe and Mail published the initial report that claimed Wilson-Raybould was pressured to direct the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to sign a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — a legal tool resembling a plea deal — with SNC-Lavalin.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, have denied any wrongdoing.

Wernick said Thursday that he thought the Globe's reporting on the matter was inaccurate.

""I'm here to say to you that the Globe and Mail article contains errors, unfounded speculation and, in some cases, is simply defamatory,"" he said.

The article — citing unnamed, anonymous sources — said that Trudeau's senior aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould to intervene and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the high-profile justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs.

‘I'm here to say to you that the Globe and Mail article contains errors, unfounded speculation and, in some cases, is simply defamatory,’ Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council, said. 5:31

While there was much debate inside government about what should be done about the criminal allegations, Wernick repeatedly denied Thursday the claim Trudeau, or officials in the PMO, exerted inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould to cut the company some slack.

""We are discussing lawful advocacy that the minister take a lawful decision, which in the end she did not take,"" he told the justice committee.

""What Canadians need to know is that, despite a massive government relations effort, meetings with MPs, staffers, leaders of the opposition, paid advertising, pressure put through two premiers of Quebec, they didn't get what they wanted. If it's a movie, it's a flop.""

2. The September meeting

On Sept. 4, the prosecution service told SNC-Lavalin, in writing, that it would not negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — paving the way for a trial on the matter at a later date.

Wernick said that in a Sept. 17 meeting between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould — which the clerk said was principally called to attend to another matter before cabinet, namely the drafting of a new framework on Indigenous rights — the SNC-Lavalin matter was raised.

He corroborated the prime minister's account of the meeting.

As attorney general, Wilson-Raybould could overrule the prosecution service, directing it to negotiate an agreement with the company.

Trudeau said Wilson-Raybould asked him that day if he planned to tell her what to do — and he said he told her that any decision on the matter was hers alone to make.

Michael Wernick the Clerk of the Privy Council spoke to the Commons Justice committee on Thursday 3:39

The next day, on Sept. 18, SNC-Lavalin representatives met with Wernick. The clerk said he doesn't remember the substance of the conversation or whether the representatives told him that the public prosecution service had denied a request for a DPA.

On Feb. 12, a week after the Globe and Mail story broke, Wilson-Raybould resigned her cabinet position. Trudeau said he was surprised and disappointed that she quit cabinet, adding that if she felt undue pressure in her role as attorney general, she had a duty to report it to him.

3. Solicitor-client privilege doesn't apply: Wernick

Wilson-Raybould has so far refused to speak publicly about what transpired on the SNC-Lavalin file, saying only that solicitor-client privilege stemming from her time as justice minister forbids her from commenting.

Wernick said Thursday that, while he's not a lawyer, he doesn't believe she should be constrained from telling her side of the story because solicitor-client privilege simply doesn't apply in this case.

""My conclusion, as someone who spends a lot of time in governance ... I do not see where the former attorney general was a solicitor,"" Wernick said.

Michael Wernick the Clerk of the Privy Council spoke to the Commons Justice committee Thursday 0:27

""The prime minister said at every occasion verbally and in writing that she was the decider, so she was not giving legal advice to the prime minister. She was the decider — the full and final decider.""

Wernick added that the matter was never discussed in cabinet and thus, in his opinion, she is also not bound by cabinet confidentiality.

""There was never, never, never a cabinet conversation about the prosecution,"" he said.

4. Wernick warned Wilson-Raybould about the 'consequences'

Wernick revealed Thursday that, in a Dec. 19 phone call with Wilson-Raybould, he did warn of the consequences of not moving ahead with a DPA for SNC-Lavalin.

He said he told Wilson-Raybould that the prime minister and ""a lot of her colleagues"" were anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press — articles warning that the company could close down or move if criminal proceedings went ahead.

""Part of my conversations ... was conveying context — that there were a lot of people worried about what would happen, the consequences, not for her, the consequences for the workers and the communities and the suppliers,"" he said.

SNC-Lavalin is a major firm, a pillar of corporate Canada, and employs more than 9,000 people across the country, including 3,400 in Quebec, 3,000 in Ontario and just over 1,000 in B.C.

The company, which is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange, is widely held by Canadian shareholders, including many of the largest pension plans and mutual funds.

""There's pressure to get it right on every decision. To approve, to not approve, to act, to not act. I am quite sure the minister felt pressure to get it right,"" Wernick said.

""There was no inappropriate pressure put on the minister — at any time.""

In the end, he said, the matter may boil down to an interpretation of what constitutes 'pressure'.

""I can tell you with complete assurance that my view of those conversations is that they were within the boundaries of what's lawful and appropriate. I was informing the minister of context. She may have another view of the conversation, but that's something the ethics commissioner could sort out,"" he said.

5. Wilson-Raybould never wanted an Indigenous portfolio

While Wilson-Raybould disagreed vehemently with Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett on how best to pursue the implementation of a new Indigenous rights framework, she herself never wanted to hold any of the Indigenous cabinet positions, Wernick said.

""She played a very particular role in cabinet. She did not ever want to be the Indigenous affairs minister. She didn't want to be the Indigenous Services or [Crown-Indigenous Relations] minister, and be the Indian agent for her own people,"" he said.",What we learned from Canada's top bureaucrat about the SNC-Lavalin affair,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tasker-five-things-michael-wernick-snc-lavalin-1.5028922
451,Empty,2019-02-21T21:36:16Z,"If she wasn't demoted as punishment, then why?","Let’s cut to the chase: Despite the cascade of revelations surrounding the crisis consuming the Trudeau government, the situation has become much clearer.

From everything we know now, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his top adviser did everything they could to get Jody Wilson-Raybould to block a prosecution against SNC-Lavalin on corruption charges. Their argument — and we have the prime minister’s own statement in the House of Commons on this — was prompted by intense concern over the potential economic impact of the trial, including lost jobs.

Last year the Liberals slipped through a new law specially tailored to let SNC-Lavalin escape such a trial. But the law itself prevents economic concerns from being considered when deciding to apply it. So it would appear that the prime minister was asking Wilson-Raybould to overlook the very rules his government had put in place, even after a decision had been made to proceed with prosecution.

The bitter dispute that has developed centres on whether or not the efforts by Trudeau, and his former principal secretary Gerald Butts, constituted undue pressure. Liberal caucus members, justifiably alarmed at the damage the party has been doing to itself, now seem willing to buy into Trudeau’s insistence that he and Butts acted correctly. But the facts are running against them.

It would appear that the prime minister was asking Wilson-Raybould to overlook the very rules his government had put in place

A timeline that emerged Wednesday undermines Trudeau’s claim. The decision to proceed against Lavalin was made by director of public prosecutions Kathleen Roussel on Sept. 4. Wilson-Raybould had the power to reverse that decision, and Trudeau met with her two weeks later to discuss the matter. He acknowledges that — while he told her it was her decision to make — the economic consequences were raised.

When Wilson-Raybould stuck by Roussel, another meeting was arranged, this time with Butts, on Dec. 5. The get-together came after Lavalin launched an intense lobbying campaign with senior members of the government in the wake of Roussel’s decision. There can be little doubt the focus of the campaign was a desperate attempt to have Roussel’s decision reversed. Only Wilson-Raybould could do that, and she was so worried about the PMO’s actions that she asked Trudeau directly whether he was ordering her to block the case.

He said no, yet six weeks later, there was Butts raising the issue with her once again. What possible reason could he have for doing so unless to make clear that her boss, the prime minister, very much wanted her to change her mind and save Lavalin from its fate, and the political damage to the Liberals likely to flow from it. Leaks from Wednesday’s cabinet meeting — and the continuation of damaging leaks from inside cabinet is another sign of the discord within the party — indicate that Wilson-Raybould felt both Trudeau and Butts acted improperly.

As the Conservative deputy leader, Lisa Raitt, noted Wednesday: “If SNC-Lavalin had already been denied a special deal through an independent process and then the prime minister met with Ms. Wilson-Raybould to reaffirm her authority, the message to her would seem clear — that he’s not happy with the decision and that she should get involved.”

In addition to Trudeau and Butts, Wilson-Raybould also heard from Michael Wernick, the clerk of the privy council, Canada’s top bureaucrat. He told the justice committee Thursday he considered the conversations were “entirely appropriate, lawful (and) legal.”

Allowing her to speak her mind, as she persists in demanding, evidently hasn’t yet entered his list of considerations

Wilson-Raybould believes that, whatever Trudeau and the others might claim, the repeat meetings were clear efforts to pressure her. Despite that belief, she has held to her position, and reinforced it once again Wednesday, even after Butts’ resignation, and after Trudeau pulled a belated apology out of his hat. The prime minister is a great believer in apologies; Wilson-Raybould’s refusal to be swayed by his olive branch must further perplex and frustrate him. Here’s a woman who believes what she believes, and won’t be talked out of it. He clearly can’t figure out how to get his way with her, which is what he still wants. Allowing her to speak her mind, as she persists in demanding, evidently hasn’t yet entered his list of considerations.

He’s in a box now. Wilson-Raybould is scheduled to appear before the justice committee next week. She wants Trudeau to lift all restrictions on what she is allowed to say. His refusal to do so has only strengthened the suspicion he’s afraid of what he’ll hear, or has something to hide. By continuing to keep the gag on, he risks the possibility she’ll cancel her appearance, putting the spotlight squarely on the PMO. If he lets her speak, and she repeats what she allegedly said to cabinet, she puts him in the position of explaining why his justice minister and attorney general felt he was acting improperly, and why he continued nonetheless.

This is a crisis that has become all about Justin Trudeau. He has badly mishandled the affair from the beginning, driving one of his most important cabinet appointments into a rebellion over who is to be believed. He has undermined his oft-repeated claims of devotion to a feminist agenda and Indigenous reconciliation. He is seeking to control the damage via a wall of silence that belies his pledge of an open and transparent administration. He is forcing members of his caucus to choose sides, putting their fear of public fallout against the words of a colleague whose job was to protect and follow the law.

And he has yet to answer why he demoted Wilson-Raybould from her job after she stood up to him. If not as punishment, then why? And if it was indeed punishment, what does that say about Justin Trudeau, his respect for women, and all the talk of higher principles we’ve had from this government?

Payless has 248 stores across Canada, and 2,500 stores in North America.

The company said in a news release after the filing on Monday that it expects these outlets will begin shutting down at the end of March though it intends for “many stores (to) remain open through the end of May.”

“Over the years, we have had highs and lows amidst significant operational and market challenges,” the company said in a recent letter to its customers. “Despite our best efforts to address the rapidly changing retail environment, we — like many other retailers — have been forced to face very difficult choices.”

Payless describes how its goal of maintaining its brand while continuing to reach customers around the world caused it to file for an earlier bankruptcy in April 2017.

This time, mounting debts and a challenging retail market are the source of the company’s woes, and it is costing 2,400 Canadians their jobs. However, the retailer’s stores abroad, including in Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia, will continue to operate.

In its news release, Payless said that the company is “seeking customary initial relief from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and Canadian Court.” It said these relief methods include getting authorization to support its operations during the bankruptcy and to continue paying its employees’ wages, along with maintaining health-care benefits.

It also said it is seeking authorization to allow customer gift cards and store credits to be redeemed until March 11. Returns and exchanges of certain non-final sale purchases made before Feb. 17 of this year will be possible until March 1.

Lauren Jeffords, senior director of corporate communications at Payless, was unable to comment on the impact the closure will have on its Ottawa employees.

Here, from","Mark is at the Oncenter in Syracuse, New York with the great Dennis Miller tonight, so, in lieu of his Saturday movie column and with tomorrow's Academy Awards looming, we thought we'd take a look back at some Steyn Oscar columns of the past. Here, from his Spectator review of twenty years ago, are Mark's thoughts on the 1999 ceremony:

Around the time of his fiftieth birthday, when he was having a little difficulty attracting A-list celebrities, President Clinton opined wistfully to a friend that it would be nice to go to a gala in his honour that wasn't hosted by Whoopi Goldberg. After Sunday's Oscars ceremony, we all know how he feels. I thought she'd have difficulty improving on her last gig three years ago, when after hearing ""Colours Of The Wind"", the overwrought eco-ballad from Pocahontas, she mused that she'd always wondered about the colour of her wind. On the evidence of her tacky commentary on Sunday night, the colour would seem to be grey: it wasn't just windy, it was stale and flat and hung in the air. If you're going to get into the ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" gags a year late, you have to do better than Whoopi's dull quips about A Bug's Life being ""The Linda Tripp Story"". It was a timely reminder that lazy mainstream Hollywood easy-listening liberalism is somehow even more irritating than those unreconstructed Stalinist fellow travellers outside the hall demanding Elia Kazan apologise. Come back, Billy Crystal, David Letterman, Bob Hope, anyone.

The awards themselves, as distinct from the show, were more interesting. Academy voters, for whatever reasons, had chosen to reject precisely the kind of film that, come Oscar time, Hollywood likes best: commercial pap with aspirations. It seems only yesterday that American critics were hailing The Truman Show as surefire Oscar material: who now even remembers it? In the end - that's to say, the final award of the evening - the same fate befell even Saving Private Ryan. The Academy was always going to have a hard job resisting Roberto Benigni, but I felt sorry for Best Actor nominee Ian McKellen, who gives a lovely performance in Gods and Monsters that's as good as anything he's ever done - better even. The villain roles, from Richard III down, can by their very nature never quite tap into that distinctive softness, gentleness of McKellen. This film does, in a way we've never seen before.

He's playing James Whale, the once famous director of Frankenstein (the 1931 Boris Karloff version, still the best), The Invisible Man (the 1933 Claude Rains version, also the best) and Show Boat (the 1936 Helen Morgan/Irene Dunne/Paul Robeson version, likewise). On 29 May 1957, Whale wound up at the bottom of his pool 'in mysterious circumstances', an obscure Gloria Swanson type reduced to playing his own William Holden. And there he lay, more or less, until a 1995 book by Christopher Bram, Father of Frankenstein. To the dying embers of Whale's reputation, Bram served as, er, stoker, and this film is one of the happy results. Most of the events depicted here are fictitious, but Bill Condon directs with a droll, precise command that is as much a tribute to Whale as anything else. We are in the last months of his life, and Whale has time on his hands and, indeed, on his eyelids and in his consonants: to listen to the way McKellen's Whale lingers over his own name 'Hhwwwhhhale' - is to understand the sprawling emptiness of his days. After 1941, he made just one film - a 40-minute adaptation of a William Saroyan play that was never released: this is a man who has had all the time in the world to perfect every detail of an empty existence - or, as Whale puts it, in a line whose delivery ought to have earned the actor an Oscar all by itself, ""My pyjamas are all tailored.""

McKellen holds the picture together with a kind of enervated panache and, even when the surrounding campery gets out of whack, he never does. I wouldn't change a thing, except maybe the title, which I'll bet is one reason why it didn't do as well at the US box-office and at the Oscars as it should have. Father of Frankenstein was much better.

As for Elia Kazan that night two decades ago, Steyn wrote in Mark Steyn's Passing Parade:

Kazan can make a claim to be the father of modern American acting, having brought Stanislavskian techniques to Broadway and then to film through Marlon Brando, James Dean, and Rod Steiger. He was the best theater director of the forties and fifties, and later a fine novelist, and when he walked onstage in 1999 to receive a belated Lifetime Achievement Oscar, he might reasonably have expected the orchestra to be vamping Leonard Bernstein's theme to On the Waterfront for a good ten minutes while Hollywood roared its appreciation. Instead, outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion elderly hack screenwriters led protests, and inside, the likes of Sean Penn sat on their hands. For both Hollywood's ancient D-list Communists and its A-list anti-anti-Communists, there's only one thing about Kazan that matters: he ""named names..."" As the former blacklisted screenwriter Norma Barzman told CNN, ""Elia Kazan's lifetime achievement is great films and destroyed lives, and even a third thing, which is a lasting climate of fear over Hollywood and maybe over the country...""

At gatherings in the arts it's boorish and tedious to become too exercised about communism—no matter how many faraway, foreign, unglamorous people it kills. Elia Kazan was on the right side of history. His enemies line up with the apologists for thugs and tyrants. Whose reputation would you bet on in the long run?

And here's Mark's Spectator column five years later on the 2004 Oscars, the year of Tolkien:

It was a night of triumph for British film. Well, okay, it wasn't. ""UK Overlooked By Oscar Voters"" was the BBC headline. ""Whatever Happened To The Brit Pack?"" wondered The Scotsman. ""Ring Of Failure,"" declared a gloomy Birmingham Post, waking up to the bleak realization that the only Tolkien tourism boom was going to be the stampede to New Zealand to see the actual Shire where the great Kiwi author wrote his famous fantasy.

So it was a crummy night for British film. But it was a great night for British Commonwealth film – New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, even Britain (the one-third of the Best Song written by Annie Lennox, plus make-up man Peter King and set designer Alan Lee, all three sharing in the Hobbit spoils); even my own decayed Dominion picked up Best Foreign-Language Film for Les Invasions Barbares. If the Eurocentric UK press weren't so parochial, it would hail the Oscars as a grand triumph for what the Queen calls ""our Commonwealth family"": if you were a nominee who had the good fortune to be a subject of the Crown, you had a much better chance of taking home a statuette than those poor souls cursed to be free-born citizens of the United States.

Indeed, the Oscars are a much better – or, at any rate, less feeble - advertisement for the Imperial family than the Commonwealth Conference. If I were Her Majesty, I'd make it the theme of this year's Christmas message: start with one of those sappy Oscar-intro things about movies bringing the world together to sit in the dark and dare to dream our dreams, blah, blah, and then put her next to an Alberta key grip and a New South Wales gaffer showing her how to grip and gaff (""Really? How interesting"") and end with her asking Charlize Theron's mum about the night she shot Charlize's dad (""Really? How interesting"").

Billy Crystal had some cute cracks about down under: ""It's official,"" he announced halfway through the night. ""There's now no-one left to thank in New Zealand."" But an opening reference to the Great White North was more pointed: ""All of Hollywood is here. It's like the Canadian Oscars."" Hollywood is the only place on the planet frightened of Canada. New Zealand is still an exotic, remote location, but Vancouver and Montreal are the default backlot. When Clint Eastwood insisted Mystic River, set in Boston, actually be filmed in Boston, it was considered as radical a move as when Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen insisted on filming On The Town in New York. In those days, if they wanted Manhattan or the mid-west or the Rockies or darkest Africa they built a set. Now they just do it in Canada: ""New York"" is Toronto, ""Philadelphia"" is Calgary... The film unions, from the carpenters to the bit-players, are sick of it.

On the campaign trail, John Kerry keeps hammering corporations about ""outsourcing"" and ""exporting"" American jobs. But you'd be hard put to find as outsourced an industry as Hollywood, except maybe children's toys. The only difference is that, unlike the toy makers, the guys making the big decisions at head office in LA seem to have forgotten the basic business rule: KYC – Know Your Customers. All last week, Oscar types were whining that Mel Gibson was stealing their buzz. That's true to the extent that it was a buzz-less Oscars, and on the big night even the frocks were dull, with a pronounced lack of cleavage, save for game gals of a certain age like Jamie Lee Curtis and Susan Sarandon. But the buzz about Mel's movie came from the Hollywooden liberals in the big media who've spent the best part of a year warning that The Passion Of The Christ was going to be the biggest thing on the anti-semitic scene since The Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion. All those liberal columnists who champion the necessity of brave transgressive artists when it comes to giving us a horny Jesus (The Last Temptation Of Christ), a gay Jesus (the Broadway play Corpus Christi) or a Jesus floating in the artist's urine (Piss Christ) have finally discovered a Jesus it would be grossly irresponsible to show to the public.

But what's really hilarious is Hollywood's failure to get The Passion Of The Christ as a business proposition. Until a month ago, the standard line from the studio execs was that Mel Gibson had blown well over 30 million bucks of his own money on a vanity project for him and and a handful of other Jesus freaks. Last week, it racked up the biggest mid-week opening – not just of any film in Aramaic but of any non-sequel movie ever; the only bigger opening gross was for The Return Of The King. Now the new rap on Mel is that he claims to be a Christian but he's making gazillions off his Saviour's suffering. Well, one reason he's making so much is because he doesn't have to share it with any of the big Hollywood muscle who were convinced the fundamentalist weirdo was out of his tree. Unlike all that Miramax pseudo-art-house stuff, The Passion is a genuine independent film: the system wasn't interested, so Mel bypassed it, and he's cleaning up.

How did they get it so wrong? Until 40 years ago, religious movies were a staple of Hollywood. The audience didn't change, Hollywood did. A couple of years back, I was at a conference at Paramount on American values and someone asked why they didn't make more religious pictures. Carmine Zozsora, producer of the Die Hard movies, replied in all seriousness: ""Well, we tried that with The Last Temptation Of Christ, and it didn't work out too well.""

That's the reality behind all that Oscar-night blather about how movies bind us together in stories of our common humanity, etc, etc. In fact, Hollywood defines our common humanity ever more narrowly. Nobody was in the mood for big anti-Bush speeches on Sunday night, and even Sean Penn contented himself with a mere subordinate clause about how actors had known there were no WMDs. But that's all you need. Like Billy Crystal's crack about Bush's National Guard service, it's the celebrity equivalent of a Masonic handshake – a way of signaling that you're in the club. But the club excludes too many people, and, if it carries on like that, the movie biz will be in as much trouble as the music biz.

That's not my main rap against Sean Penn, of course. Bill Murray was not only robbed but weirdly humiliated in his loss by Billy Crystal. As I said in my review, as you watch Mystic River Penn and Tim Robbins seem to be ""furiously tap-dancing for Oscar votes."" More fool the Academy for falling for it.

454,Empty,2019-02-21T11:30:08Z,Bill Morneau’s next budget is likely to tackle skills training for an economy that's leaving workers behind The post Skills training: Can the Liberals go bold in Budget 2019? appeared first on Macleans.ca.,"For his last budget before next fall’s federal election, Finance Minister Bill Morneau is signalling that he plans to highlight skills training. It’s a natural policy gap for the Liberals to try to fill. They’ve made a push to help parents raise kids, through their signature Canada Child Benefit. They’ve put serious reforms in the window for the retirement years by enriching the Canada Pension Plan and boosting the Guaranteed Income Supplement. But for what comes between childhood and retirement—the working years when Canadians increasingly worry about having to adjust to technological change—they haven’t staked nearly as clear a claim to bringing in bold policy.

Yet any election-ready skills announcements in Morneau’s 2019 budget, which he’ll table on March 19, are bound to raise awkward questions about what’s happened up to now—or not happened. Way back in his 2017 budget, Morneau committed $225 million over four years to establish something called FutureSkills Lab, an agency with a mandate to devise new ideas in training for a fast-evolving, technology-driven economy. The name has since been dulled down to Future Skills Centre, but its long-awaited launch isn’t expected until mid-February, when the government is also planning to finally announce the members of a long-promised advisory group called the Future Skills Council.

The ponderous pace at which these modest steps have rolled out suggests Ottawa finds moving decisively difficult when it comes to skills policy and programs. It can be a frustratingly complicated field. The provinces have the main jurisdiction over education, making any federal incursion into it a test of federal-provincial diplomacy. Still, pressure for Ottawa to act is mounting as the pace of workplace change, especially with the spread of artificial intelligence, accelerates. “We’re going to have an increasingly large challenge to retrain or upskill existing workers in our workforce,” says Sean Mullin, executive director of the Brookfield Institute at Ryerson University in Toronto.

Mullin’s think tank on innovation has estimated 42 per cent of Canadian workers are at risk of seeing their jobs eliminated or dramatically changed by automation over the next two decades. And Morneau has repeatedly cited this as a pressing problem. But what to do about it? Mullin casts the challenge in sweeping historical terms. The public school system arose to teach millions what they needed to move from farming to industrial work. As more jobs demanded more sophisticated skills, universities and colleges expanded rapidly. “But we don’t have the system right now to take someone who’s 35, 45, whose occupation or even entire sector is being eliminated, and make sure they continue to be productive members of society,” Mullin says.

Some of the most fully thought-out proposals for skills policy focus, so far, not on mid-career upgrades but on the traditional education system designed mainly for young people starting out. For instance, the Business/Higher Education Roundtable, set up in 2015 by the Business Council of Canada, is urging Morneau to make a big push in what’s called “work-integrated learning.” Building on a $73-million, four-year program to subsidize student summer jobs, which the Liberals launched in 2017, the roundtable is asking the government to put up another $320 million over three years, which would be nearly matched by about $300 million from employers, to give more than 80,000 students a chance at that key early work experience.

Another idea would see the federal government boost support for overseas education. The Study Group on Global Education, co-chaired by University of Ottawa professor Roland Paris, a former foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has been lobbying for federal funding to send many more Canadian students abroad, which the group touts as essential—not some frill—in a globalized economy.

These proposals wouldn’t address the growing anxiety about what to do when, for example, hundreds of middle-aged auto workers in Oshawa, Ont., suddenly find they need to switch jobs. Among the ideas popping up in the pre-budget chatter are so-called “wrap-arounds,” the term used to describe government financial support of, say, child care or transit costs for a working parent who enrols in retraining. There’s also talk of tax incentives for workers to save for taking just that sort of break from work to upgrade skills.

None of these ideas, however, come close to Mullin’s concept of a whole new institutional framework for retraining. Maybe concepts as sweeping as Mullin’s will emerge eventually from the Future Skills Centre or the Future Skills Council—but they’ll be too late for this spring’s budget or the fall election to follow.

Fewer than 100 people showed up for the final day before reversing their trucks and steering their convoy back west. Those who were there, though, were just as committed as when the convoy set out from Red Deer, Alta., last Thursday to deliver its so-called pro-industry, anti-globalism message to Prime Minister Trudeau and his Liberal government.

Pat Mavtie says she was the first to arrive, at 8 a.m. — three hours before the “official” start — to make sure she got her message out to passing rush-hour commuters, a message she made quite clear by wearing it around her neck on a large poster-board: “Hey Trudeau,” it read, “if SNC-Lavalin was in Alberta, would u build us a pipeline.”

The 62-year-old Edson, Alta., resident has worked at jobs in the natural resources sector — oil, coal-mining and timber — since she was 15. “There was always a job in Alberta in those three sectors,” she says. But last Christmas she was laid off.

“It was devastating. I was looking forward to possible retirement by 65, but I concede that’s not going to happen now.”

She’s seeing the same fate for many others in Alberta, Saskatchewan and B.C., as the downturn in the oil and gas sector, for which she blames Trudeau, has impacted all of Western Canada.

“That’s why I’m here.”

Like many protesters on the Hill, she believes the Liberals’ policies on such matters as immigration and the carbon tax are tearing the country apart. “All this talk in the world right now about global warming I think is the biggest farce that we have going.”

Scientists, she notes, have determined that Alberta, for example, was once “a tropical province.”

(Indeed, numerous examples of the fossil record in Saskatchewan and Alberta support the claim they were once far warmer and wetter than they are now.)

“I believe our world goes in cycles and it has nothing to do with the CO2 that’s coming from oil and gas. But somebody out there has made us a target, and if we connect the dots and look worldwide, we may find out that Mr. (George) Soros and his clan have something to do with it. They’re filling their pockets on the backs of Canadian people, and that is not right.”

(Hungarian-American billionaire and liberal philanthropist George Soros has frequently been the target of online right-wing conspiracy theorists whose accusations of him being a “puppet master” of the globalist movement have become very much a part of the mainstream conversation.)

A one-time Cape Bretoner, Michael Hurley arrived with the convoy from Spruce Grove, Alta., outside Edmonton. An iron worker and former oil rigger who’s been out of work since October, he’s been involved with the yellow-vest movement in Edmonton since December. He agrees with Mavtie about the Liberal carbon tax.

“Do you believe paid scientists, or the people who’ve debunked them?” he asks. “From the beginning of time, they’ve had ice ages and they’ve had warm periods. Natural life cycles. But I’m not a scientist. And natural resources are what made this country great.”

Hurley by and large agrees with all the issues raised by the movement: He’s opposed to foreign oil being used in Canada, of media bailouts, and the UN’ Global Compact for Migration. “We are not against legally vetted migration, but what (Trudeau) is doing with this open-border policy … and the UN should have no business in our country or our politics. Our government should be listening to the people and it should be voted on. We should have veto power, because we voted them in, and they’re not listening to everyday Canadians.”

Niki Markowski came from her home near Lake Huron to show her support for Alberta and the oil pipeline, and brought with her a sign that read “Ontario: Yours to Recover” (the opposite side read “Take the Wynne out of Ontario,” from an earlier protest). “You stand up for us and we’ll stand up for you,” she says, “and together we can unite.”

“Canada,” she adds, “is a house, so we should not be letting anybody into our house that doesn’t think the same as us. And if anybody wants to join our house of Canada, we need peace, love joy, happiness, giggles and smiles.

“When honour killings are happening and people think it’s a custody battle, like, come on, guys. Look at how they think.”

(While so-called honour killings do occur in Canada, they are not pervasive. According to the Department of Justice, “at least a dozen” such incidents took place in the 10-year period between 1999 and 2009.)

Ottawan Domenic Shelley has been coming to the Hill weekly for 10 weeks now and is part of a Facebook and YouTube group called Facts VS Feelings. “Justin Trudeau and globalism have to go,” he insists. His overriding concern is Canada’s treatment of its veterans, saying that they’re expected to live on a paltry pension.

“Why all the blood in Normandy? Why all the blood in Beaumont Hamel? Why all the blood in battlefields around the world? What was all that blood for? Was it for Canada or for globalism?”

And Shelley hardly singles out Trudeau or the Liberals for Canada’s ailments.

“I’m 55 years old, and my governments have betrayed us my whole lifetime,” he says. “Mulroney and Chrétien and Harper and Trudeau are the same bird, beating us down and dividing us.

“But the money is the system,” he adds, “and the pipeline is the thing that keeps the economy going. It pays for homelessness and immigration. It pays for veterans.”

He, too, believes climate change is the result of a planetary cycle. “There’s nothing we can do about it, brother. It 200 years we’ll be under 200 feet of ice again. No amount of money’s going to change that. The carbon tax is a total scam, a slush fund.”

Nor is he opposed to immigration. “I love every bit of culture in Canada. It’s a melting pot, it’s a beautiful thing, and we’re being divided by globalism. Canada is the promised land — the last frontier of the promised land — and you can’t have the UN telling us how to run our country.”

The question came to a head over the weekend when documents, including a set of talking points, were released to the media. The documents suggested the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services was trying to control the message given to parents. In one email to staff, a manager in another jurisdiction noted the ministry “has asked us not to stray outside of their messaging.”

The issue boiled over Monday during question period at Queen’s Park.

Lisa MacLeod, the embattled minister of children, community and social services, told the legislature that allegations the program was frozen are “erroneous,” and that if the program had continued under changes introduced by the Liberals, it faced bankruptcy.

NDP leader Andrea Horwath shot back that the province would be be bankrupting families with its new program.

NDP MPP Monique Taylor was ejected from the legislature after accusing the government of “lying” to parents. Ottawa West-Nepean Progressive Conservative MPP Jeremy Roberts, who has a sibling with autism, did not stand up to applaud statements made by Premier Doug Ford and MacLeod, who is the MPP for Nepean. (A spokesman for Robert said he would not comment on the incident.) Ottawa South MPP John Fraser said parents had lost confidence in MacLeod and needed “a fresh set of eyes and ears” on the issue.

Meanwhile, the ministry released a statement saying agencies were instructed last October to bring in only new clients in three priority areas.

“At no point did Minister MacLeod instruct the Ministry of Children, Community and Social services to freeze the wait list,” said the statement. “These families were prioritized for services and supports following changes made to the Ontario Autism Program in January 2018, which placed significant funding pressures on the program budget that could not be supported within the allocated budget. Minister MacLeod secured the necessary investment upon taking office.”

In an interview Monday, Alex Munter, the president and CEO of CHEO, said that as of July 2018, the autism program at CHEO was facing a $8.2 million shortfall in a $25-million program because of the changes introduced in January 2018. As a result of the shortfall, CHEO cut discretionary expenses in the program and imposed a hiring freeze. CHEO also asked the province for more funding. “The shortfall would have had impacted services through CHEO,” Munter said. The autism program is different from the rest of the programs at CHEO, he said. In most other treatment areas, clinicians make decisions. In this program, the government dictates which children get services and how much. The program has been rebooted four times in the past three years and changing criteria has been hard for families, Munter said. But parents who called CHEO would have been told that if their child was not in one of the priority groups they would not be admitted into the program. “The reality is that we were working with a major budget shortage that we were trying to manage,” he said. “I can see why people thought we should have been more public. But we don’t normally start negotiations in a public kind of way. Our first step is to bring it to government.” Munter noted the issue has become a highly polarized, partisan debate. “We’re not going to participate in that.” It is still unclear how much individual families will receive under the new program, known as the “childhood budget,” which is targeted at low and middle-income families. It will depend on how long the child remains in the program. A child who enters the program at age two could receive as much as $140,000, but another child entering the program at seven could only receive as much as $55,000. Many parents are concerned they won’t meet the income test and will get little or nothing.

Sherri Brown, the mother of nine-year-old Quinn, said her son has been on the wait list ever since she moved to Ontario in September 2017 from British Columbia. “Thirty hours a week would change the entire trajectory of his disability. I wish I could afford 30 hours a week. I can’t,” Brown said.

The priority categories set by the province are “cherry-picking” who would receive services, she said. “For our kids, every months makes a difference. To halt a wait list for six months in unconscionable. This is a neurological disorder. Six months is forever.”

Meanwhile, Brown argues that funding for autism should be covered under the province’s Health Ministry, not the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services. “Three independent medical professionals have indicated that Quinn needs this level of treatment. It’s the gold standard of treatment for children with autism,” she said.

“A three-year wait list wouldn’t fly for children with cancer. But it flies for our children.”

In Anchorage, emotionally preparing students for the scary prospect of climate change

Alaska Public Radio Network ^ | February 21, 2019 | By Elizabeth Jenkins, Alaska's Energy Desk

Posted on by Oldeconomybuyer

The Alaska Department of Education and Early Development is in the process of revamping its science standards. It hopes to have a draft released by March. But for the past 13 years, teachers have been working with a curriculum that gives little guidance on how to explain the science behind one of Alaskas most pressing problems: climate change.

This week, were going inside two Alaska classrooms to learn how teachers and students are navigating these difficult conversations.

Bryan Smith is the kind of teacher who goes by his first name in his classroom at Polaris K-12 School in Anchorage. You could call his teaching style eclectic.

Today, his class of high school students are learning about resource extraction by competing to grab Goldfish crackers off of a row of tables. Snatch too many goldfish and you deplete the fishery.

As soon as I saw people taking more than three fish, I knew it was over for me, Kadi LeBlanc, a ninth-grader, said with a laugh.

She says not everyone is playing fair. But she understands the point.

If people are greedy and take more than an ecosystem can handle, by the end no one be able to use that resource, LeBlanc said. Itll be gone.

Later, the class brainstorms helpful values for solving the problem. They list things like communication, planning and following rules or regulations.

It sounds like students are having a good time. But Bryan acknowledges these are tough things to talk about, especially in a resource-dependent state.

Ive got this Upton Sinclair quote above my door: Its difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it, Bryan said.

That quote alludes to the tightrope discussions Bryan has to have with his students. Some of their parents are employed by the oil and gas industry. Bryan says it can be a sensitive topic; the business thats feeding some families is also contributing to an increase in carbon emissions.

So there are the social complexities of teaching about climate change in an oil state, and then there are the emotional ones.

One of the reasons why I suspect other teachers might not want to jump into this, besides it being a political hot topic its heavy and its a real downer, Bryan said.

Bryan says the future can appear increasingly uncertain, dangerous and even scary for kids.

He describes it as taking an unblinking look into the void. Alaska is warming twice as fast as the global average temperature.

So the students in his classroom are given a choice.

And this is where Bryan takes another page from one of the great contemporary works: The Matrix.

He uses an iconic scene from the dystopian sci-fi thriller in class. In the movie, Morpheus tells the protagonist Neo that theres no turning back.

You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe, Morpheus explains. You take the red pill, you stay in wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

Bryan says he has had one student tell a counselor, I dont want want to take this class.

Of course, Bryans not presenting his class of middle and high school students with real pharmaceuticals. Its a metaphor. Take the blue pill and drop the elective science class. Or, take the red pill and learn more about the leading causes of climate change and its effects.

Bryan believes the student who opted out felt like the subject was just too much to handle, and he says thats OK. He wants his classroom to be intellectually and emotionally prepared for the things theyre about to hear.

The projections are grim, Bryan said. Thats why in the past couple of decades scientists have started speaking out publicly.

Bryan admits hes struggled to explain this to his own kids, who are 11 and 14 years old. He feels conflicted, like hes stealing away a piece of their childhood by telling them the truth.

The concern is somewhat valid. The states former Department of Health and Social Services commissioner even put out a report warning about increased anxiety and depression as Alaskans grapple with a changing environment.

Some of Bryans younger students have asked him to dial it back.

They were kids, and they just wanted to go play on the swings and thats fine, he said.

But like Morpheus and Neo in The Matrix, if a student is ready, Bryan wants to them have all the information: Climate change is happening. The future, as projected, looks pretty bleak. Our carbon emissions are a major contributing factor.

But he assures them there are things they can do. The antidote to despair is action, he says.

Still, Bryan has received some push back from at least one of the teens in his class.

It was for an assignment where he asked students to engage in some kind of activity, applying their values to what they learned. So a student made a flyer for an Anchorage neighborhood.

The gist of it was climate change wasnt happening, Bryan said.

But he didnt fail that student because he completed the assignment and applied his values to the task. Unlike carbon emissions, beliefs can be harder to measure.

Some people you wont be able to reach, Bryan said.

But that was one isolated event over the course of seven years of teaching about climate change.

Bryan says most of his students know its occurring, and they genuinely want to do something about it.

Whats the biggest takeaway he wants his classroom to leave with? After a pause, he says he wants them to feel empowered to take some action, whatever that means to them, and then stop thinking about the rabbit hole. Go out and enjoy the sunshine.

Crackers don’t reproduce; fish do. That said, it is possible to over fish some species in some areas. It is happening to the menhaden in the Chesapeake Bay. But what has that got to do with ‘climate change’? And, frankly, if climate change were to bring warming to Alaska, it would be to that state’s benefit. Huge areas which are now virtually uninhabitable by humans would become viable.

Will humans ever wake up? Quite a few already have, but those are the ones you very seldom hear about, and in anticipation of what may be coming down the pike, have built underground Safe location or are moving to what they believe will be fairly safe areas on planet Earth. At least this is what they believe may (or may not) safe their hide. Only time will tell. As we look around worldwide we find events such as too hot in one area, unseasonably cold in another, along with floods, draughts, more destructive and frequent earthquakes as well as volcanic eruptions. Someone in a motorboat going down an avenue in Kuwait City, while they are trying to get rid of locusts and bugs in Mecca. And there are many, many, many more of such unusual events, too numerous to mention them all here, and the biggest share completely unrelated to any human endeavors. Each event considered individually may easily construed to be an aberration, just what you may think by looking at the individual paint strokes of a picture, but looking at the overall and whole picture worldwide, the idea may sink in that there are forces at work way beyond our control.

Unfortunately this is just the prelude of THINGS TO COME unrelated to human endeavors, even so ignorant and dumb politicians including many so called scientists are attempting to tell us otherwise. Passing it off as global warming and since this did take off like a lead balloon, more recently referring to it as CLIMATE CHANGE which of course is true up to a point, as climate does change from one day to the next, yet it does not address the real causes, the two forces most likely in play are complex and completely unrelated to any human endeavors or activities. The most recent but not the only cause for Earths unusual behavior is another GSM or Grand Solar Minimum with the last one, the Maunder Minimum taking place from 1645 to 1715 and the other joining in is the BEGINNING or re-occurrence (repetition) of the 3600 year signature cycle. Having both running concurrent does not bode well for smooth sailing. There is also a good possibility that this re-occurring 3600 signature cycle may also have ushered in or triggered this new GMS cycle of our sun, in the same manner as it has triggered some unusual behavior amongst some of the other planets in our solar system. This 3600 signature cycle is the same cycle which ushered in the TEN PLAGUES and gave the then Egyptian Pharaoh, most likely Thutmose an Excedrin headache. Eventually being document and recorded as the biblical stories of the TEN PLAGUES followed by the EXODUS. Those were worldwide events not just limited to ancient Egypt as by checking historic accounts of ancient China we find that they were plagued by very similar events, such as unseasonable heat or cold spells, along with storms, floods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Anyone who has been paying attention to what is going on a worldwide scale, aside from humans getting into each others hair and attempting to kill each other; one would think it would ring a bell! But has it? As stated earlier, so far by living in the Midwest we have gotten by relatively easy and unscathed. Let us hope it will continue.

The earth would be so over populated, everyone would be crammed in tiny shacks and would starve.” They should have all been thrown in prison for mentally abusing little kids and attempting to scare them. But most of us guys pretty much claimed, even at 12 years old, this is “bull shit”.

I’ve been posting this because the study this guy (Patterson) did was put down EARTH TO COOL DOWN WARNS GEO SCIENTIST

2007 The US MAT.Com Scientific reports from Canada and Greenland has indicated that the the shrinking arctic ice sheets have begun to replace themselves rapidly. Strongly suggesting the earth instead of warming, is beginning to cool down. It is still not known (or proven) if this is the result because of the reduced rate of sun spot activity. Canadian geo scientist Professor R. Timothy Patterson of Carelton University is urging a go-slow on the rush for governments to Play God with global warming legislative blaming this on CO2 (carbon dioxide) discharges. Legislating corrections attempting to control a natural cyclic occurrence caused by; sun spots, the magnetic solar wind, and cyclic earth magnetic polarity reversal, among other natural occurrences including volcanism, meteors etc. Probably plays a very significant role in climate change. Yet ignorantly blaming man made CO2 emissions for climatic change. which is becoming a rapidly discredited and minuscule cause of global warming in his article published by Canadas Financial Post. 6/20/07 Patterson was selected by the Canadian government to study the fluctuations in certain types of fish populations.

While doing so the Canadian Geo-Scientist found a correlation when certain species of fish had high population and then drastic drop offs. He discovered these fluctuations corresponded with sun spot activity and solar radiation vs cosmic activity. When earth cooling occurred. Studying deep fjords along the Western Canadian coast where deep pools of low oxidation water exist. The Patterson study reached deep into the earths recent past of 4000 years of undisturbed sediments. Patterson found that when aquatic activity was highest and lowest in those collected sediments having high aquatic content had matched known solar protection when the magnetic wind was highest, and dropped off when earth magnetic fields activities were lowest.Thus causing cosmic radiation to intensify. Then because the earth became unprotected by its magnetic fields from galactic cosmic activity. Patterson cites several accepted theories which concludes this then created cloud activity during such periods which increased drastically. Thus cooling earth and bringing in its ice ages. In his presentation here is a professor urging more scientific study (like Pope Benedict)is needed. That politicians including Al Gore, of The Earth Is Flat Society, dont know what the hell theyre talking about. Strongly suggesting that the global warming may be caused by exhaling politicos rather than serious scientific examination. Patterson seems to be saying before Canadians start investing in palm trees they should be considering better parkas because what goes up must come down and the Mexicans better move over for a reverse population flow. The story was featured in The Drudge Report, and World Net Daily, which were linked in The US Mats last page. But lost due to source link changes . http://www.theusmat.com/index.htm

458,Empty,2019-02-25T22:07:09Z,Wilson-Raybould said she still needs the government to waive privilege. She also said the committee should get its own legal advice on what can be discussed,"OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has issued an official cabinet order to allow Jody Wilson-Raybould to publicly testify about the SNC-Lavalin affair.

The cabinet order, called an order-in-council, was published Monday evening, and comes on the same day Wilson-Raybould released a letter saying she needs more clarity on the constraints on her speech before she’ll schedule an appearance at the House of Commons justice committee.

The committee has invited Wilson-Raybould to testify about her version of events about the allegation, published in the Globe and Mail, that she was politically pressured to intervene in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The order allows Wilson-Raybould and “any persons who directly participated in discussions with her relating to the exercise of her authority under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin” to disclose to the justice committee information about discussions on that subject that are covered by cabinet confidences or solicitor-client privilege.

It also allows those people to disclose the information to the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, who is also conducting an investigation into the matter.

Cabinet confidence privilege protects information that is the subject of discussion at cabinet meetings or between cabinet ministers. Solicitor-client privilege protects information that is given by the government’s legal advisor.

“However, in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings, this authorization and waiver does not extend to any information or communications between the former Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions concerning SNC-Lavalin,” the order says.

Trudeau had given a vague promise earlier on Monday that he would allow Wilson-Raybould to publicly testify about “relevant matters.”

Wilson-Raybould’s letter to the justice committee — revealed Monday afternoon — said these issues need more attention before she’ll agree to testify.

“I am anxious to appear at the first available time,” she said in the letter dated Feb. 25. “However, I believe that in advance of my appearance, the Members of the Committee and I should have as much clarity as we can in relation to the possible constraints on the matters about which I may properly testify.”

She said she has taken legal advice, but still needs the government to waive privilege. She also said the committee should get its own legal advice on what can be discussed without violating the Parliamentary convention that it not interfere with ongoing court matters.

“I would prefer not to schedule my appearance before the Committee until we all have whatever clarity we can have about these issues,” she said.

I am anxious to appear at the first available time

Wilson-Raybould said that when she does appear, she would like 30 minutes for an opening statement to give her recollection of events, and then would stay and answer questions for as long as the committee wants.

SNC-Lavalin is facing criminal charges for allegedly bribing public officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011. It has also filed a case in Federal Court that challenges the decision made by federal prosecutors last September to not negotiate a remediation agreement. Remediation agreements see a company admit wrongdoing, pay a fine, and obey other compliance conditions, but avoid a guilty conviction in court.

The political controversy centres on whether Wilson-Raybould, when she was justice minister and attorney general, was pressured by Trudeau or his senior staff to order federal prosecutors to stay the corruption case against SNC-Lavalin and instead pursue a remediation agreement. It is a Canadian constitutional principle that attorneys general must not be pressured politically when acting in their role of overseeing the federal prosecution service.

The Commons justice committee started its study of the matter last week, and heard a fiery defence of the government’s side from Michael Wernick, the Clerk of the Privy Council.

Despite Wilson-Raybould’s concerns about solicitor-client privilege, Wernick told the committee he doesn’t see any privilege around the conversations. “I do not see where the former attorney general was a solicitor,” he said. “The matter was never discussed at cabinet, ever. So she was not giving advice to cabinet. She was not advising the prime minister.”

Wernick predicted that Wilson-Raybould will raise concerns about three meetings, including a phone call he had with her on Dec. 19, 2018 — just weeks before she was shuffled out of the justice minister role.

He told the committee he was confident that all the conversations were “lawful.” Yet he also said that in his conversation with her, he told Wilson-Raybould that “a lot of her colleagues and the prime minister were quite anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press about the future of the company.”

The Conservatives sought to turn up the pressure on Trudeau by calling on him to testify at the justice committee. On Monday they introduced a motion that, citing Trudeau’s “alleged direct involvement” in pressuring Wilson-Raybould on the SNC-Lavalin case, called on him to “to appear, testify and answer questions at the (justice committee), under oath, for a televised, two-hour meeting, before Friday, March 15, 2019.”

The Liberals used their majority to defeat the motion on Monday evening by a vote of 155 to 106.

Earlier Monday the justice committee heard testimony from lawyers and law professors with expertise on remediation agreements and the role of attorneys-general in government.

UBC law professor Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a former judge, said that once prosecutors have reached the “decision point” to proceed with a trial, she is skeptical government officials having any legal basis for raising it with the attorney general.

“There is limited lawful authority for anyone to intervene at that decision point, and going forward,” she told the committee.

Turpel-Lafond said it’s fine for government officials to offer their assistance if the attorney general wants more information, but that’s where the limit lies.

“I think when we get beyond that position of the more passive and respectful approach, and we get into a very rigorous position of saying, ‘I challenge you to take a different position,’ I think we are into very serious issues with the rule of law,” she said.

459,Empty,2019-02-21T15:28:00Z,Michael Wernick took opposition MPs to task for jumping on anonymous allegations to accuse the government of obstructing justice,"OTTAWA — Canada’s top bureaucrat launched a blunt and vigorous defence Thursday of the government’s handling of the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, declaring allegations of political interference to be false and even defamatory.

Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, took opposition MPs to task for jumping on the anonymously-sourced allegations to accuse the government of obstructing justice.

He challenged former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould’s assertion that solicitor-client privilege prevents her from responding to the allegations that she was improperly pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to spare the Montreal engineering giant a criminal trial on charges of corruption and bribery related to government contracts in Libya.

Wernick was testifying during the first round of hearings by the House of Commons justice committee into the affair that has rocked the Liberal government, resulting in Wilson-Raybould’s resignation from cabinet last week and the departure of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this week.

The allegations first surfaced in a Globe and Mail report two weeks ago, citing unnamed sources.

I'm here to say to you that the Globe and Mail article contains errors, unfounded speculation and, in some cases, is simply defamatory

“I’m here to say to you that the Globe and Mail article contains errors, unfounded speculation and, in some cases, is simply defamatory,” Wernick told the committee.

From everything he knows, Wernick said the Prime Minister’s Office handled the matter with integrity. There was vigorous debate internally about whether Wilson-Raybould should exercise a legal option to instruct the director of public prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin. That agreement is a kind of plea bargain in which the company would pay restitution but not get a criminal conviction that could financially cripple the company by barring it from bidding on government contracts.

Wernick said those discussions were perfectly legal and didn’t cross the line into improper pressure on the attorney general, whom he noted was repeatedly assured by Trudeau that a final decision on the matter was hers alone.

“We are discussing lawful advocacy that the minister take a lawful decision which in the end she did not take,” he told the committee.

Wernick noted that he’s not a lawyer. But based on his many years experience as a senior bureaucrat under multiple Liberal and Conservative governments, he said he doesn’t believe solicitor-client privilege stops Wilson-Raybould from telling her side of the story.

He said he doesn’t see where she was acting as a solicitor and that the matter was never discussed in cabinet so she wasn’t giving advice to cabinet either.

“The prime minister said at every occasion verbally and in writing that she was the decider so she was not giving legal advice to the prime minister,” he said.

“She was the decider, the full and final decider. She can’t be the fettered solicitor and the battered decider, (as portrayed) in that horrible, vile cartoon at the same time. It’s one or the other.”

Earlier Thursday, Justice Minister David Lametti also told the committee it was appropriate for the Prime Minister’s Office to discuss the matter with Wilson-Raybould.

Lametti, who took over the justice and attorney general roles from Wilson-Raybould in a cabinet shuffle in early January, said the attorney general “is not an island” who can’t talk to cabinet colleagues or government officials before making a decision about a prosecution — provided that the final decision is the attorney general’s alone.

Lametti, who is advising Trudeau about whether he can waive solicitor-client privilege in the issue, also told the committee that privilege does not “inherently” apply to conversations an attorney general has with officials or cabinet colleagues. It applies strictly to instances when an attorney general, as the government’s chief lawyer, gives legal advice to the government.

Speaking in Halifax earlier Thursday, Trudeau said he remains puzzled by Wilson-Raybould’s resignation from cabinet despite her explanations this week behind closed doors to cabinet ministers and the Liberal caucus.

“This is not a decision that remains clear to me,” Trudeau said to reporters in Halifax this morning.

After Wilson-Raybould spoke to cabinet Tuesday and the Liberals dropped objections to calling her as a witness at the justice committee, speculation grew that Trudeau and his former star minister had come to some sort of agreement about what had taken place, but given the prime minister’s comments today that may not be the case.

Wilson-Raybould said Wednesday she would like to tell “my truth” on the matter but it’s not her decision whether to waive privilege and cabinet confidentiality.","Jody Wilson-Raybould wasn’t pressured and is free to talk, says Canada’s top bureaucrat",Nationalpost.com,https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/pm-not-budging-on-snc-lavalin-controversy-dogging-his-government

Trudeau is battling allegations that his officials last year pressured Wilson-Raybould, then justice minister, to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption and bribery trial.

Trudeau insists there was no wrongdoing and said Wilson-Raybould has not made clear her reasons for leaving. In an unusual move, she was allowed to address her Cabinet colleagues on Tuesday, even though she was no longer a minister.

“I continue to be surprised by Jody Wilson-Raybould’s decision ... This is not a decision that remains clear to me,” he told a televised news conference in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.

Trudeau’s version of events was backed up by Michael Wernick, the head of the federal civil service, who was present for several top-level meetings with Wilson-Raybould last year and said nothing untoward had happened.

“There was no inappropriate pressure put on the minister at any time,” Wernick told the House of Commons justice committee on Thursday, saying Wilson-Raybould had had plenty of opportunities to complain had she felt the need to.

Wilson-Raybould, who on Wednesday said “I hope that I have the opportunity to speak my truth”, is consulting lawyers to determine how much she is able to say. She is due to address the justice committee next week.

The Globe and Mail on Thursday said Wilson-Raybould told the Cabinet she had come under improper pressure from officials.

“How she interprets and perceives those conversations she can tell you next week. I can tell you my view very firmly is they were entirely appropriate, lawful, legal,” said Wernick, a civil servant who is not a member of Parliament.

The issue could threaten the ruling Liberals’ election chances this October. Opposition politicians have accused the Liberals of a cover-up and want a full public inquiry.

SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in the province of Quebec province, where the Liberals say they need to capture more seats in the October election to have a chance of holding on to power.

“We believe in the independence of the judiciary and we believe in fighting for good jobs,” said Trudeau.

The prime minister on Wednesday sought to calm restless parliamentarians at a meeting to discuss the resignations of Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau aide Gerald Butts, a major architect of the Liberals’ surprise victory in October 2015, who quit on Monday while insisting he had done nothing wrong.

Trudeau sidestepped questions about how he planned to handle the crisis, party sources said.

Signs of stress remain. Two Liberal legislators voted with the opposition on Wednesday in a failed bid to launch a public inquiry, while a female Liberal member of parliament tweeted her support for Wilson-Raybould, adding the hash tag #IStandWithHer.

Democracy Watch, a Canadian advocacy group, believes Trudeau broke two sections of the Conflict of Interest Act by failing to abstain from a vote held last week in the House of Commons over whether or not to hold a public inquiry into the growing scandal. The Liberals defeated the motion with 159 against and 133 in favour.

“Jody Wilson-Raybould did the right thing by abstaining,” Duff Conacher, co-founder of Democracy Watch and adjunct professor of law and politics at the University of Ottawa, told the Sun. “Democracy Watch will soon file a complaint with the Ethics Commissioner about Trudeau’s vote.”

If Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion takes on the case, this would be in addition to the investigation he is already undertaking in response to complaints by the NDP about the broader concerns around political interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The first section Democracy Watch believes Trudeau violated, subsection 6(2), states that: “No minister of the Crown, minister of state or parliamentary secretary shall, in his or her capacity as a member of the Senate or the House of Commons, debate or vote on a question that would place him or her in a conflict of interest.”

The second, section 21, states: “A public office holder shall recuse himself or herself from any discussion, decision, debate or vote on any matter in respect of which he or she would be in a conflict of interest.”

If found guilty, it would not be the first time for Trudeau.

Congratulations if you had “Canada’s top civil servant rides to Justin Trudeau‘s rescue against Jody Wilson-Raybould” on your SNC-Lavalin Bingo cards.

Appearing before the justice committee, Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick said there was nothing to the idea that when Wilson-Raybould was Canada’s attorney general the PMO tried to pressure her into helping SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution for fraud and corruption. “At every opportunity, verbally and in writing in December, the prime minister made it clear that this was the decision for the minister of justice to take. She was the decision-maker,” he declared. He blasted the Globe and Mail story that first raised the allegations of political interference, saying it “contains errors, unfounded speculation and, in some cases, is simply defamatory.” And he praised Trudeau and his staff for their integrity: “You may not like their politics or their policies or their tweets but they have always been guided by trying to do the right thing, in their own view, in the right way.” (Canadian Press)

Wernick also used his testimony to go well beyond the question of political interference in the SNC-Lavalin case, warning darkly that “somebody’s going to be shot” during the next Federal election campaign, that “trolling from the vomitorium of social media” was making its way into the “open media arena”, and without naming him he singled out Conservative Sen. David Tkachuk who urged the yellow-vested convoyers who descended on the Hill this week to get in their trucks and “roll over every Liberal left in the country. Because when they’re gone, these bills are gone.” Wernick called the Senator’s words “totally unacceptable,” given the Toronto van attack, and said “I hope that you as parliamentarians are going to condemn that.”

Incidentally, Conservatives who fell into fits earlier this month when Liberal MP Adam Vaughan extended a whack-a-mole analogy to suggest someone should “whack” Ontario Premier Doug Ford—whack being what the mobsters say when they kill someone, in case you didn’t know—have been silent on the Conservative Senator’s call for truckers to drive around the country ploughing down Liberals. Candice Bergen, we’re looking at you.

Also, fun fact: no one has ever used the word “vomitorium” on the Hill before, according to Hansard and the Library of Parliament.

Wernick’s statement was overtly political, coming from a civil servant, which didn’t go unnoticed. “Fine. I’ll just say it. Parts of this performance are why politicians like Stephen Harper can plausibly argue the Canadian Public Service is the Liberal Public Service,” tweeted constitutional scholar Emmett Macfarlane. “Some of the Clerk’s comments today amount to cheerleading for the current government.” (Twitter)

John Geddes parses Wernick’s full testimony, which offered “a glimpse inside the way the powerful interact—and evidently sometimes don’t—around Ottawa”:

Then Wernick made the link to how Canadians might process news of Wilson-Raybould and SNC-Lavalin. “I think Canadians need to be assured,” he said, “that their police and investigators with the powers of the state operate independently, and that the prosecution services—the state charging people with offences—are completely independent.” He stressed repeatedly that even though SNC-Lavalin had aggressively lobbied the federal government, the company never did manage to get the remediation agreement it so badly wanted. Wernick was eager to put on the record the fact that he personally refused to meet with the company more often than he agreed, and even walked out of a National Arts Centre gala last Oct. 3—an event headlined by pop singer Diana Ross—to avoid proximity to SNC-Lavalin executives.

On the question of whether Wilson-Raybould will be able to speak freely next week when she appears before the committee, current Attorney General David Lametti, who also testified Thursday, wouldn’t give an answer. (Global News)

Every time Justin Trudeau has tried to free himself from the SNC-Lavalin affair with a new explanation, Wilson-Raybould has been there to hem him back in, writes Andrew MacDougall:

To date, there have been several ifs, many ands, and one lost (Gerry) Butts —with no end in sight. And the next cut might just be the deepest: on Monday Jody Wilson-Raybould rolls into Justice Committee looking to “speak her truth”. Trudeau is clearly not in control of events. But somebody is, and that somebody is…Jody Wilson-Raybould. Indeed, when you beam the SNC mess through the Wilson-Raybould lens, everything snaps into focus. As one wag in London said to me the other day: right now, Ottawa has gone all House of Cards because Jody Wilson-Raybould is going all Frank Underwood. (Maclean’s)

Tariffic news: We’re not sure exactly when Canada ceased posing a national security threat to the United States, but apparently we’re a more docile lot now, and the Trump administration is ready to remove the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum that have mostly served to make things more expensive for Americans. Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., David MacNaughton, said he’s confident the tariffs will be lifted “in the next few weeks” though he hasn’t said why he thinks that. If the tariffs aren’t lifted, Ottawa might just forget to proceed with legislation to implement the USMCA treaty, suggested Transport Minister Marc Garneau: “We will be doing some serious thinking about whether we want to proceed forward with it … you know the situation with respect to steel and aluminum is not yet resolved.” (Global News, CBC News)

464,Empty,2019-02-21T22:03:59Z,His testimony provided a heartening reminder that among the many things for which we ought to be grateful is our public service,"Into what sometimes seems the lair of the mealy-mouthed, there came Michael Wernick, the plain-talking Clerk of the Privy Council and the top civil servant in the country.

The 37-year career public servant was the third witness to testify Thursday at the justice committee allegedly examining the SNC-Lavalin affair and whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his ministers or staff improperly pressured then-Attorney-General Jody Wilson-Raybould to over-rule her director of public prosecutions, stop the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin and instead negotiate with the giant Quebec company the corporate equivalent of a plea bargain, what’s called a deferred prosecution agreement or DPA.

Wilson-Raybould, of course, was shuffled from the justice role to veterans affairs in January. She then resigned from cabinet Feb. 12 after the Globe and Mail reported she’d been pressed by the PMO to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution.

But Wernick’s answer, to summarize, was yes there was certainly pressure and lots of it and no, it was neither inappropriate nor unlawful.

“I’m quite sure the minister felt pressure,” Wernick said, meaning pressure “to get it right.” He exerted some of his own, in fact.

He said he called Wilson-Raybould last Dec. 19 to check on a number of issues, among them the SNC file.

He told her some of her colleagues and the PM were quite concerned with what they were reading in the business press (SNC was loudly fretting about the effects of the prosecution upon shareholders, workers and indeed the company’s very future, and lobbying anything with a pulse) and wondered whether a DPA was still an option.

“If she (Wilson-Raybould) felt (the pressure was untoward or improper) in September, October, November, December,” Wernick said, “she had recourse.

Wernick’s answer, to summarize, was yes there was certainly pressure and lots of it and no, it was neither inappropriate nor unlawful

“She could have called the ethics commissioner any time, any day.

“She could have called the Prime Minister (He is apparently reachable to ministers pretty much 24-7).

“There were several cabinet meetings (in that period); she could have asked for a pull-aside. There were multiple occasions where she could have (done something).”

Wernick didn’t explicitly say this, but a reasonable reading of the whole of his testimony is that to his knowledge, and he has a firm grasp of most files, Wilson-Raybould didn’t suffer any undue influence or intimidation – nothing that, as a capable minister, she shouldn’t have been able to handle.

(In other government roles, Wernick has known her for about 13 years, and considers her an ally and a friend.)

And handle it, remember, she did.

As Wernick pointed out a couple of times, despite the enormous SNC lobbying effort (“they were making the rounds of everyone that month,” he said) and the lobbying of those they lobbied, “The matter is proceeding to trial…The company did not get what it wanted.”

None of this was disreputable, he said.

Deferred prosecution agreements – they’re called remediation agreements in Canada – weren’t sneaked into law. They didn’t spring “from immaculate conception”. The government consulted; there were 370 participants in the consultation, some 70 written submissions. There is certainly a reasonable argument to be made that those who toil for companies, receive pensions, own shares, do subcontracting, etc. shouldn’t pay the price of executive misconduct – in the worst scenario, company failure.

He began, as committee witnesses usually do, with an opening statement some are construing as partisan. I didn’t take it that way

As for meeting with SNC representatives, Wernick said, “The company is not a pariah. It has not been convicted. It has not gone to trial.”

And for all its checkered past, overseas and in Quebec, the pitch SNC “made to me, made to so many people”, is that the SNC of 2018 is not the SNC of the early 2000s, that it has reformed its corporate culture.

“If you boil it down for Canadians as to what’s going on here,” Wernick said once, it’s that “we’re discussing lawful advocacy for the minister to take a lawful decision which she did not take.”

He began, as committee witnesses usually do, with an opening statement some are construing as partisan. I didn’t take it that way.

He spoke first of the things which do worry him – the potential of “foreign interference in the upcoming election”; “the rising tides of incitements to violence” and the casual use of words like “traitor” which has him concerned that “somebody is going to be shot in this country this year, during the political campaign”; “the reputations of honourable people who have served their country being besmirched and dragged through the market square” and the “vomitorium of social media.”

But is he worried about the rule of law in this country?

He is not.

Seven years after the RCMP began investigating SNC, four years after charges were laid, “and up until now, the matter is proceeding to trial.”

The director of public prosecutions made her tough call; the then-AG made hers. The Lobbying Act worked; people know just how many times SNC met MPs, staffers, or government officials and at least the broad strokes of what they discussed. The Ethics Commissioner “self-initiated” his probe into the matter.

For the record, Wernick said everything he has heard the PM, his staff or cabinet ministers say (and he was at some of the meetings with Wilson-Raybould) about SNC is that the decision “was hers to make”.

He has spent decades in and around other prime ministers, Liberals and Conservatives. “They are always guided by trying to do the right thing,” he said. “The exceptions are extremely rare, and they are detected and punished.”

I thought he was magnificent.

As the former law clerk of the Senate, Mark Audcent, put the H back in the honourable Red Chamber when he testified at the criminal trial of Mike Duffy (who was acquitted), so did Michael Wernick give the adult’s explanation of this whole mess.

And in the process, he provided a heartening reminder that in this country, among the many things for which we ought to be grateful is our public service.

Draft legislation by the Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) has triggered the suspension of 18,000 applications made under existing laws from immigrants seeking to live in the predominantly French-speaking province. The CAQ, which won power in October, has said that the reforms would improve newcomers’ integration into the workforce.

Lawyer group Association québécoise des avocats et avocates en droit de l’immigration asked Quebec Superior Court Justice Frederic Bachand to order the government to process existing newcomers’ applications as the bill is being debated.

“This situation is a catastrophe for us,” said Seeun Park, a nurse and plaintiff in the case who came to Quebec with her two children from South Korea in 2017.

“We already invested a lot of money and efforts end energy to work in Quebec,” she told reporters on Friday outside the courtroom in Montreal.

A spokesman for the province’s immigration minister declined to comment on Friday, saying the matter was before the court.

The CAQ campaigned on a pledge to cut immigration from 50,000 to 40,000 people a year and expel new residents who fail to pass tests on French and Quebec values within three years.

The policy could put Quebec on a collision course with the Liberals of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who are hoping to make gains in the province to offset expected losses elsewhere in a federal election this October.

“One of the fundamental responsibilities of any government is to look for good jobs, to defend jobs and to make sure that our economy is growing in ways that give a real and fair chance to everyone,” Trudeau told reporters in St John’s, Newfoundland when asked about his conversations with then Justice Minister July Wilson-Raybould.

Trudeau’s remarks were among the most detailed yet to explain an affair that is harming his Liberal government ahead of an October election.

Trudeau denies a Feb. 7 report in the Globe and Mail that officials exerted undue pressure last year on Wilson-Raybould to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials and to pay a fine instead.

SNC-Lavalin is a big employer in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up seats to have any chance of winning a majority in the election.

After Canada’s director of public prosecutions ruled on Sept. 4 that the trial should proceed, Trudeau and senior officials raised the matter three times with Wilson-Raybould, who had the power to overturn the decision.

But he told the West Block’s Mercedes Stephenson he’s taking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at his word and hopes Canadians’ “reasonableness” will prevail.

“Canadians will have to make up their own minds,” said Carr, who the Prime Minister’s Office put up to answer questions on the matter.

“I take the testimony of the Clerk of the Privy Council, who is the chief non-partisan public servant. I take the prime minister’s word that there was no direction, that it was her decision to make. He said so many times and I believe Canadians will — and you have to believe in the reasonableness of Canadians on this.”

WATCH BELOW: Wilson-Raybould’s reasons for stepping down ‘still unclear’ to me, says Trudeau

Wilson-Raybould was Carr’s cabinet colleague up until Feb. 12, when she abruptly resigned.

That came after Trudeau responded to questions about allegations of political interference by appearing to suggest Wilson-Raybould’s continued presence in his cabinet suggested nothing untoward had taken place.

The allegations published in the Globe and Mail on Feb. 7 asserted Wilson-Raybould was pressured by unknown officials in the Prime Minister’s Office to intervene in the decision of the director of public prosecutions not to offer an untested legal option called a “remediation agreement” to SNC-Lavalin.

A remediation agreement, created by the Liberals just last year, would have allowed a company to admit wrongdoing, face a fine, and avoid a criminal trial and a potential guilty verdict and a decade-long ban on bidding for lucrative government contracts.

Such a ban could have also had a heavy hit on the Montreal company’s bottom line and the thousands of jobs in an election year.

Trudeau initially said the report of pressure being applied was “false” and that he never “directed” her to take any specific decision.

The government line has evolved from that over the past three weeks, with officials later saying there had also been no pressure writ large and that Trudeau had spoken with Wilson-Raybould about the case and told her the decision was “hers alone.”

On Friday, he also offered more details on the considerations involved in conversations on the matter.

“One of the fundamental responsibilities of any government is to look for good jobs, to defend jobs and to make sure that our economy is growing in ways that give a real and fair chance to everyone,” Trudeau told reporters when asked about his conversations with Wilson-Raybould.

Michael Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council, told the House of Commons justice committee last week that he also met with Wilson-Raybould after the decision was made not to offer a remediation agreement, and did so in order to “convey consequences.”

He said those “consequences” included the potential loss of Canadian jobs — not threats against her.

When asked whether he believed any inappropriate pressure had been applied, Carr would not say but noted it was Wilson-Raybould who made the ultimate decision not to intervene and order a remediation deal be offered — something the company had lobbied heavily for.

“I believe that she made a decision that was hers to make and it was a decision that everybody is respecting,” Carr said, adding that he does not himself know the specifics of why Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet, which came almost exactly one month after Trudeau moved her from attorney general to the lower-profile position of Minister of Veterans Affairs.

“It wasn’t clear in the letter but she has reasons and she will give those reasons as she sees fit to do,” Carr said.

“She’ll be appearing in front of the justice committee on Tuesday and we will learn in more detail what was in her mind and what motivated her. I think that’s reasonable — the system is working.”

Wilson-Raybould is expected to appear before the House of Commons justice committee conducting a limited probe of the SNC-Lavalin affair on Wednesday.

She has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations, saying instead that she believes solicitor-client privilege prevents her from speaking on the matter.

Wernick said he disagrees and that solicitor-client privilege would not apply.

Wilson-Raybould has retained former Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell to help her decide what she can and cannot discuss publicly.

Sony Pictures Television and producers/co-creators Gloria Calderón Kellett and Mike Royce are shopping the series to other networks and streaming services (which upset fans hope happens!). Below, read our impassioned plea — published when rumors started circulating that the show was in danger of being canceled — for why the show deserves to stay on the air.

EARLIER: Fresh off a presidential election that plunged our nation into terrifying uncertainty and despair for so many Americans, a reimagined family sitcom from the ’70s and ’80s premiered on Netflix. But instead of a series focusing on a single white mother and her two daughters (still forward material for the time), this iteration of One Day at a Time centered on a newly single Latina mother living with her two children and her immigrant mother. The timing couldn’t have been more difficult for a country that was already being ripped apart at its red, white, and blue seams as our president-elect was figuring out how to start making good on his anti-immigration campaign promises.

Mike Yarish/Netflix

From the pilot we could tell this sitcom was different, despite having all the hallmarks of our beloved TV family comedies: the live studio audience; the extra bright studio sitcom lighting; the three-wall living room set. But this family unabashedly spoke Spanish without translation and the first episode dealt with everything from racism and feminism to veterans and depression. We may not have been in the audience, cheering when living legend Rita Moreno made her grand entrance by opening her own damn curtains, but by god it was immediately evident to anyone who watched that One Day at a Time was going to be the light we so desperately needed, the comfort food — ropa vieja, if you will — that would nourish us even after our binge was over. As Lydia (Moreno) tells her adult daughter Penelope (Justina Machado) after she breaks down over her failed marriage: “I got you.”

Ali Goldstein/Netflix

And, girl, have they ever. In just three seasons, the Alvarez family has seen us through coming out of the closet and first love, homophobia, addiction, depression, PTSD, racism, gentrification, 9/11, graduation, the near loss of a parent (an episode that, even a year later I still cannot watch without crying), remarriage, citizenship, and even Canada. You don’t have to be Cuban, an immigrant, gay, or a recovering addict to understand and/or to feel understood, and such is the beauty of this show.

Old family sitcoms would have tackled many of these issues with “very special episodes,” and they certainly wouldn’t have let us see the matriarch, the heart of the show, have a breakdown, let alone a depressive episode, but One Day at a Time has never tried to hide who it really is, which is what familia is all about.

While there is no denying the brilliance of Moreno in every line she gifts us, using Lydia’s now signature flare — my favorite still being when she exited a hotel closet with flourish, informing her gay granddaughter, Elena (artfully played by Isabella Gomez), that “THAT is how you come out of the closet” — it’s Machado who carries the show. Arguably the most underrated actress of our time, Machado takes the show’s diamond out of the rough. If Moreno is the shine, then it’s Machado who’s the rock. Her pitch-perfect delivery is able to both find the laughter in the heartache and pull at the heartstrings in comedic moments. Yes, the writers tell her all the right things to say in the times when so many of us have wished we, too, had a script to read, but without Machado’s ability to make us feel each measured word, One Day at a Time would be just another family sitcom that preaches a life lesson every half hour. Machado’s gift is that she can deftly unravel and put us back together again without us even realizing it, and isn’t that what a real mom does?

Machado’s Penelope also serves as the bridge between yesterday (Lydia) and the future (her children, Elena and Alex), between the privileged (building owner/super, Schneider and Penelope’s boss, Dr. Berkowitz, portrayed by Todd Grinnell and Stephen Tobolowsky, respectively) and the underserved. So many of the show’s most poignant moments are born from Penelope’s finding the common thread that all sides can understand and laugh at. Like in the first season when Schneider, who’s Canadian, laments his undocumented status and Penelope sarcastically responds, “Wow, you must’ve been very brave coming here with everything, knowing only the entire language, and struggling to unlearn the metric system.” Or, in one of the series’ most memorable episodes, where, after calling herself a “narrow-minded homofallopian,” Lydia cites her religious beliefs as reason for her issues with Elena being gay to an empathetic Penelope who’s torn between understanding where her mother is coming from and her love for her daughter who just wants to be who she truly is.

On the surface, it looks like a sitcom for snowflake liberals who decry Trump and gentrification and speak up for the marginalized while celebrating cultural differences, but at its core, it’s just a great show about an American family who argues, struggles, supports, and loves just like any other. Every episode, every season has shown us that family is both the one we’re born into and the one we create, the one we are given and the one we choose.

Which is why it’s entirely unsurprising that One Day at a Time fans have rallied upon hearing that the series’ future is uncertain. After all, if one of your family members is in trouble, you show up (and hopefully you bring pastelitos). After co-showrunner Gloria Calderón Kellett tweeted that Netflix still hasn’t decided on the show’s fourth season, stars including Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s Melissa Fumero (who played Penelope’s cousin Estrellita in the season 3 opener), Joe Manganiello (who guested as Nick, Schneider’s sponsor), and icon Gloria Estefan (who not only sings the show’s rebooted theme song but also appeared this season as Lydia’s sister and nemesis), immediately tweeted their support, helping make #RenewODAAT trend worldwide. Even producer Norman Lear, the man behind the original series (along with All in the Family, The Jeffersons, Maude, and more), couldn’t contain his excitement seeing fans rally behind the show and express their desire for more. “I’m not sure what it means to be trending,” he wrote on Twitter, “but HOLY S— does it feel good.”

This show deserves another season!! Go binge all 3 seasons! Maybe Estrellita will come back and fight with Penelope in season 4?! We’ll never know if you don’t watch! #RenewODAAT https://t.co/YDiZYx4lgK — Melissa Fumero (@melissafumero) February 21, 2019

I’m not sure what it means to be trending, but HOLY SHIT does it feel good. #RenewODAAThttps://t.co/moQ1F2zeY0 — Norman Lear (@TheNormanLear) February 21, 2019

So this is my appeal, my plea to everyone who’s not only already fallen in love with the Alvarez family (Schneider and Dr. Berkowitz included), but also to anyone who’s ever known what it’s like to love your over-the-top grandparents who don’t always say the right thing but who always come through, or to anyone who’s known what it’s like to be fiercely protective of your children as you try to give them a better life than you’ve had: please gather your familia to watch and re-watch this much-needed series.

One Day at a Time, I got you. We all got you. ¡Dale, networks, Dale!

The OGarden system lets you grow herbs, tomatoes, leafy greens, and more year-round.","If you've always wanted to start your own herb or vegetable garden but don't have the yard space or the ""green thumb"" to pull it off, there's now another option. The OGarden Smart is an indoor gardening system that grows up to 90 plants at one time—20 of which are edible.

Strawberries, celery, kale, bok choy, green beans, cayenne pepper, green onion, and cherry tomatoes are just a few of the fruits and veggies the OGarden can grow. Up to 30 growing cups can be placed in a lower cabinet, where the seeds are allowed to germinate. Once they sprout, the plants can then be transferred to the rotating wheel up above, which holds up to 60 plants at a time. It takes about 30 to 40 days to harvest the produce, depending on the type of plant grown.

The system is self-watering and uses automatic LED lights to provide the right amount of sunlight, no matter what season it is. The only work that's required is planting the seeds and refilling the water tank once a week.

The OGarden Smart is the second product launched by company co-founders Pierre Nibart and Pierre-Etienne Bourget, of Quebec, Canada. The original OGarden debuted in 2017, and the Smart upgrade incorporates a few new features, including automatic watering, automatic LED lighting, and a water warning system. Some reviewers of the original OGarden commented that the system is easy to use, and that the vegetables taste better than store-bought produce.

The OGarden Smart will set you back $859 Canadian dollars (about $650 USD) if you order it on Kickstarter at a discounted rate, but the company's founders are quick to point out that it will help you save money in the long-run. The system lets you grow organic produce at a fraction of the price you'd pay at your local grocery store.

The seven-time G…","Pop country music queen Carrie Underwood has listed her lavishly appointed mansion in a guard-gated golf course development in the affluent suburban community of Brentwood, Tenn., about 20 miles south of downtown Nashville, for $1.45 million. The seven-time Grammy winning fourth season “American Idol” winner isn’t seeking much profit on the property she bought for $1.353 million in 2007, not too long before she hooked up with her Canadian professional ice hockey player husband Mike Fisher, and hasn’t lived in since at least sometime last year. At the end of a manicured cul-de-sac that backs up to the rolling greens of the tony Governors Club, and somewhat curiously described in marketing materials as an “Italian Style Villa,” the 7,083-square-foot, stone accented beige brick mansion, which might more accurately be depicted as a luxurious if otherwise pretty ordinary transitional traditional with a decadently celebrified basement, has four bedrooms and four full and two half bathrooms over three opulently outfitted floors.

A grand, double-height foyer featuring a curved staircase and herringbone pattern stone tile flooring is open to the formal dining room and steps down to a cavernous living room with oak floorboards, a carved stone fireplace mantel and plush velvet drapes over a double-height stack of windows. With a plethora of up-to-date stainless steel appliances and dark brown granite countertops on elaborately carved custom cabinets, the kitchen opens over a boomerang-shaped island stack bar to a breakfast area and adjoining family room with a beige brick fireplace and golf course view. The residence also offers a library/office, a games room/guest apartment with kitchenette and a mirror-walled gym with black rubber floor mats.

Each of the three guest bedrooms has a private bathroom while the wall-to-wall carpeted main floor master suite offers a fireplace, a spacious bathroom and custom-fitted walk-in closet where a corkscrew staircase winds down to a basement done up as a girlishly glitzy “glam-room” fit for an international music superstar with radiant heated polished marble floors, a hair and makeup station, a shoe and handbag display area and a roomy lounge with wet bar.

Although the house sits on just over half of an acre, outdoor living spaces are limited to a not entirely private veranda outside the family room that overlooks the golf course and a planted courtyard outside the formal living room and master suite that is mostly shielded from view of passing golfers by verdant clumps of trees and foliage.

Sometime after a freaky fall outside the home in late 2017 that left her wrist broken and put dozens of stitches in her face, Underwood and Fisher reportedly decamped Brentwood for a semi-remote spread in nearby Franklin, Tenn., where they took up residence in a rustic-luxe barn-style home on close to 1,000 acres they acquired in a handful of transactions between 2011 and 2016 for a total of about $4 million. The couple have since moved to a rambling, multi-story Cape Cod-style mansion they custom built on the vast country estate where one of their nearest neighbors is veteran country music heavy hitter Wynona Judd.

Operator

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter in 2018 Hecla Mining Company's Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should need operating assistance at any time, please press * and then 0 on your touchtone telephone.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Westerlund, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.

Mike Westerlund -- Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you very much. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Hecla's Fourth Quarter and Yearend 2018 Financial and Operations Results Conference Call. Our Reserves and Resources news release issued last week and the Financial Results news release issued this morning before market open, along with today's presentation, are available on our website.

On today's call, we have Phil Baker, President and CEO; Lindsay Hall, Senior Vice President and CFO; Larry Radford, Senior Vice President, Operations; and Dean McDonald, Senior Vice President, Exploration.

Any forward-looking statements made today by the management team come under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and constitute forward-looking information under Canadian securities law, as shown on slide two. Such statements include projections and goals, which are likely to involve risks detailed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and in the forward-looking disclaimer included in the earnings and exploration releases and at the beginning of the presentation. These risks could cause results to differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

In addition, during this call, we may disclose non-GAAP financial measurements. You can find reconciliations of these measurements to the nearest GAAP measurements in the accompanying presentation, which is available on our website at www.hecla-mining.com.

Finally, in our filings with the SEC, we are only allowed to disclose mineral deposits that we can economically and legally extract or produce. Investors are cautioned about our use of terms such as measured, indicated, and inferred resources, which are not reserves, and we urge you to consider the disclosures that we make in our SEC filings.

I will now pass the call to Phil Baker.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Mike. Yeah, good morning, everyone. There's a couple of things I want to highlight for you this morning before turning the call over to the team for specifics. We're gonna start on slide three.

The first thing is that our best minds are getting even better. We set records for the highest level of silver, gold, and lead reserves in our history, and it was done with a drill bit, not through acquisitions. By the way, our zinc reserves would have also been a record, but fell 3,010 short. Realize these reserves were done with some of the lowest price assumptions for calculating reserves in the industry, and ours still went up significantly. And price assumptions matter. It means our least profitable ounces have more margin. So, when you consider reserves, remember that not all ounces are created equal. We have high margin ounces largely in Alaska and Quebec, great margins in great jurisdictions.

In addition, we also had the most measured and indicated resources in our history, as well as the most inferred. My expectation is for more reserve increases in the future. Particularly notable was Greens Creek, with about 15 to 20% increase in reserves of all metals, and an extension of the reserve mine life to around 2030. If you consider the reserves, the mine life could be five to 10 years longer. This mine produces about half our revenues, and over the last 10 years, a billion dollars of free cash flow. My expectation is that over the next couple of decades, it might produce maybe $2 billion of free cash flow. Greens Creek is a remarkable mine, but sometimes I think the market has just taken it for granted.

Also notable is Casa Berardi, which produces about 35% of our total revenues, adding about 400,000 gold ounces of gold reserves on surface with the new West Mine Crown Pillar Pit, a 28% increase in reserves. This pit is only slightly lower-grade than our highest-grade pit, and I suspect it will get bigger as we do the work to steepen the pit walls and do more definition drilling.

Greens Creek and Casa together generated about 85% of our revenue, all of our free cash flow, and are getting better and longer-lived. They're also the model at what we're trying to do at our three other operations -- San Sebastian, Lucky Friday, and Nevada. I just came back from Nevada and want to share with you a few of my observations. It reminds me in many respects of where we were when we acquired Casa -- more questions than answers, lots of work that we have to prioritize, people that we have to determine their capabilities -- and like Casa, we've made significant progress. Much of it will not be visible to you in many statistics yet. But Larry's gonna talk to you about the progress we've made in development. It's been significant, but we are still trying different ways of dealing with different conditions in the mine. So, while we're in a hurry to get to a steady state, we will take the time necessary to figure out the challenges of these mines so our Nevada operations will never value for the long term.

Before I move on to the 2019 outlook, I want to point out the photo that's on the right side of that PowerPoint slide. It's from Sandvik's magazine called Solid Ground, in which Alain Grenier, GM of Casa Berardi Mine, and the rest of the Casa Berardi team is featured. The article centers on the successful operation of the two Sandvik 40-ton autonomous haul trucks, and it's on our website if you'd like to read it. By the way, there are also two other cover stories from 2018 that are on our website -- one from SME and the other from CIM.

So, go to slide four, where we provide our estimates of production costs, capital, exploration, and R&D for 2019. Greens Creek and San Sebastian have similar production profiles in 2019, as in 2018. We expect silver cash costs to be only $1.10 an ounce, and all-in costs less than $11.00. Casa Berardi production estimates are a little lower than last year due to lower grades, causing cost to be slightly higher. Estimated Nevada gold production is higher with a full-year of production and considerably lower costs. The gold side of the business is expected to have cash costs per ounce of $8.75, and all-in costs of $12.50.

We estimate $150 million for capital, which is similar to last year; about $25 million expiration expenditures, a reduction of $10 million. When you add it all up at today's prices, we expect Hecla to generate free cash.

So, I'm gonna pass the call over to Lindsay.

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide six, we reported a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $27 million, or $0.06 per share, with almost all the loss occurring during the last quarter; and an adjusted net loss of $0.11 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $212 million versus $232 million in 2017. Gold cash costs and all-in sustaining cash costs, both after by-product credits, came in at $871.00 and $1,226.00 per ounce respectively; while silver cash costs and all-in sustaining cash costs after by-product credits were $1.08 and $11.44 per ounce. We're happy with our costs at our operating units, other than Nevada operations, which we reported higher costs, while we worked through what we believe are transitional issues.

Slide seven shows our revenue streams that are nicely diversified, with gold at 53%, silver at 24%, zinc at 17%, and lead at 6%. Greens Creek again continues to be the dominant source of revenues, contributing 47% of our total revenues. We realize that it has a more silver/gold ratio, the revenue of the two metals would almost be equal.

Moving to slide eight, revenues for the year totaled $567 million, versus $578 million last year. We had record gold sales of 248,000 ounces at a slightly higher realized goal price this year, with our acquisitions of our Nevada operations effective July 23rd contributing toward that record, offsetting the reduced silver production and sales, primarily at San Sebastian, and lower silver prices realized this year.

Earnings from mine operations amounted to $79 million, which is $73 million lower than last year. This reduction is not surprising, as it is primarily due to completing open pit mining at our San Sebastian operation in 2017, and moving to an underground operation in 2018, where the grades are lower and the mining costs are higher. Lower other expenses, including taxes, offset lower operating profit, resulting in a net loss of $27 million, which was similar to that of 2017.

On a consolidated basis, we generated $94 million in cash from operating activities, and invested $137 million at our mine sites. Of that $137 million, $36 million was invested at our Nevada operations, and included approximately $14 million to complete a new Tailings dam and to upgrade the CIL circuit in the mill to improve recoveries. We have a goal of financial discipline in which each of our mines should produce free cash flow. And clearly, that didn't happen with our Nevada operations that we acquired effective July of last year. We expect in 2019, the Nevada mining operations will be cash flow positive, but we'll invest those cash flows and more in exploration around the various Nevada mine sites and the development of the Hatter Graben decline. As to the other mine sites, we have no major capital initiatives planned for 2019.

Moving to the balance sheet, at yearend, we had approximately $275 million in liquidity, which includes a $250 million line of credit which was undrawn at yearend, and $27 million in cash on hand. Our debt consists of $500 million in bonds, which are repayable in 2021, and $31 million owed to Ressources Quebec, also due in 2021. The bonds are callable at par on May 1st of this year. We continually monitor the capital markets, and while we're able to refinance the bonds today, it would be at rates higher than the current bond's existing rate of 6.875%.

We will continue to focus on turning our Nevada operations into a cash flow generator, building up expected cash balances and being patient about refinancing of our bonds. We have other methods available to us to reduce our total interest expense, such as using term bank debt, so if the high-yield market continues to be pricey for single-B debt issuers, then we may use these other methods in accommodation with new bonds being issued to reduce future interest expense payments. Also, I'd point out, in the back of our release, our calculated net debt to last 12 months' EBITDA was 2.4, which would typically be representative of a higher credit rating than we currently are assigned.

So, in summary, we had a good 2018 and are very excited about the potential for 2019 and beyond. But now I'll pass it on to Larry to talk about the operations.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Thanks, Lindsay, and good morning. To start with, I want to highlight that our all injury frequency rate for 2018 declined 28% companywide, as you can see on slide 10. This is a statistic that we are very proud of, and frankly, we'll work to reduce it again this year.

Also of note, Casa Berardi recently reached one million man hours without a lost time accident. This is an incredible improvement from 2013, the year that we acquired the mine. Our Lucky Friday supervisory staff is also to be commended, having operated the mine since the strike began without an injury.

I also want to highlight the good work done at Greens Creek on slide 11, which, as Phil notes, is our most important mine, that generates about half of our cash flow. With the big jump in reserves that we have recorded and the resulting three years or so of mine life addition, the team is working hard on a new technical report. With the revised mine plan reducing the development in the next few years, moving the highest margin material from the end of the mine life to the next few years, we should see a significant increase in the value of the mine.

Greens Creek, as can be seen on slide 12, had another strong year, producing over eight million ounce of silver at a cash cost after by-product credit $0.66 per silver ounce. Contributing to this performance was record throughput of 2,301 tons per day.

Moving on to Casa Berardi on slide 13, this mine just keeps performing better and better. The 157 ounces of gold produced was the highest since we acquired the operation. Fourth quarter production level was a bit lower than the previous quarter, in part due to the removal of the primary crusher and replacement with a higher-capacity crusher, which took about a week.

The record production is primarily due to throughput, as shown on slide 14. The mill operated at an average of 3,515 tons per day in the fourth quarter 2018, and 3,769 tons per day for the year. Casa milled 825 tons per day more than 2016, and almost 2,000 tons a day greater than when the mine was acquired. In 2018, open pit feed accounted for 46% of the mill feed. We have run the mill at over 4,000 tons per day on a spot basis. We continue to study increasing throughput even further.

Casa Berardi was our second-highest cash flow generator in 2018, and a technical report is also being put together for it, reflecting the significant increase in surface reserves in what could be the fifth surface pit, called the West Mine Crown Pillar Pit.

Let's move on to Nevada on slide 15, where most of our focus is this year. We have a plan to turn around the assets, and we are working that plan. In 2018, the focus was on getting the operation back on track in terms of understanding ground conditions at Fire Creek and getting the team organized. We have come a long way in this regard. Our strategy is simple: develop and drill. We believe that the grades can be improved through new discoveries and resource conversion, and/or production can be ramped up by opening up more working zones.

Fire Creek, we have done a review of equipment and are adding equipment from Midas and from buying some new equipment. We've added two trucks, two large loaders, one jumbo, two bulkers to the Nevada fleet for costing a total of about $6 million, with the expectation that the upgrade will increase productivity. The implementation of Shot Creek at the end of the development process is resulting in better ground conditions, as expected, which should minimize the need to go back in and rehab development repeatedly, as was the case under prior management.

The CIL plant upgrade is complete, and the mill is now able to process Hollister ore. We have exceeded our annual development target of 35 feet per day in January, as shown on slide 16, and the goal will be to maintain this level and increase it where possible, because this should open up additional headings and increase production.

We have wrapped up Fire Creek manpower for -- underground manpower for 76 to about 110 through transfer of Midas and Hollister miners. Our contractor has brought in a road header at Fire Creek, and it is easily cutting the soft cup material, which is helping to speed up development, and we are considering a wider application of this type of machine. We're planning to increase Fire Creek throughput midyear to about 520 tons per day from 340 tons per day, which was the fourth quarter average, which means that the goal production will be weighted toward the second half of the year. The increased development is an important step for Dean's group, as we have worked to do on definition drilling to upgrade resources, and exploration to discover additional resources.

At San Sebastian, on slide 17, we are now collecting the bulk sample of sulfide material, and we should have it run through a third party mill for testing by the end of the second quarter. We currently have oxide material to take us well into 2020, and Dean's group has a priority of finding more oxide ore.

I'll hand it over now to Dan.

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Thanks, Larry. Last week, we announced the highest levels of silver, gold, and lead reserves in 128-year history. Total gold reserves reached 2.85 million ounces, an increase of 26% from last year, mostly due to increases in open pits at Casa Berardi as a result of successful surface drilling. Silver reserves grew up 8% to 191 million ounces, primarily from Greens Creek, due to a combination of good drilling results, advanced resource modeling techniques, and improved smelter terms. The increase in resources is also important, because this suggests the potential for increasing reserves in the future.

We continued with aggressive drill programs in the fourth quarter, following successes at Casa Berardi, Nevada, Greens Creek, and San Sebastian. A list of drill intersections is provided in the Appendix B of the Exploration release on February 14th, giving insights into the high-grade resources we are confirming and expanding.

As you can see from slide 19, Hecla reserve price assumptions of 1,450 per silver ounce and 1,200 per bold ounce are some of the lowest commodity prices used in the industry, and have been for many years. On slide 20, you can see that over the past 11 years, we have consistently replaced or grown silver reserves from 130 to 191 million ounces, in addition to the 142 million ounces of cumulative production over that time. This means we have actually added a total of 200 million silver ounces in the past 11 years, with no contributions from acquisitions.

At Casa Berardi, we had considerable drilling success again along the main trends, particularly near surface. And this has resulted in the new West Mine Crown Pillar Pit, as shown on the left-hand of slide 21; and expanded East Mine Crown Pillar and principal pits with a total of 442,000 ounces of new gold reserves added during the year. There are now a series of pits along the Casa Berardi definition zone. Underground exploration was also successful. The red arrows show the projections of high-grade shoots that will be evaluated in the coming year, particularly in the East Mine, where access was reestablished last year. A closer look at the West Mine Crown Pillar Pit in the cross-section on slide 22 shows the convergence of several broad mineralized lenses near surface, providing the critical mass for a potentially very economic open pit, and the possible exploitation of zones with underground mining in the future.

At Greens Creek, there was significant growth in reserves. As shown on slide 23, definition and exploration drilling continued to add reserves higher in the mine at the East Ore and Upper Plate Zones. Lower in the mine, we were adding to reserves and resources along some existing trends in the Gallagher Deep 200 South and Lower Southwest Zones. Three drills will be operating underground all year in these areas, with the goal of defining additional reserves.

In 2018, very little exploration occurred on the Nevada projects until the Klondex acquisition was completed. It is evident that we urgently need to upgrade resources to move into the mine plans and identify new resources. Slide 24 shows how significantly we are accelerating our efforts for both underground and surface drilling, with more crews, more drills, more technology, and increased budgets in 2019. The upper diagram on the right shows the location of underground definition and exploration drilling at Fire Creek. Intense underground drilling is planned for Spirals 2, 3, 4, and 9, and the Titan Zone to upgrade resources that can lead to near-term reserves. Exploration of the Spiral 9 and North Zone provides the opportunity to extend some of the known mineralization trends. This drilling is planned to be in combination with surface drilling that will be initiated in April, and we'll evaluate the Zeus Guard Shack and South Notice targets.

Lower in the diagram on the right shows the drills at Hollister are working to define the mineralization trends in West Gloria, Central Hollister, and Guinevere for near-term mining. The development advancing to the east toward the Hatter Graben provides underground drill platforms for the drilling of targets in the East Clementine area and into the Hatter Graben late in the year. Surface drilling is planned to begin in April, with the goal of extending the Hatter Graben resource to the east.

At San Sebastian, as shown on slide 25, mining studies are being completed on the Professor East Francine veins and the polymetallic mineralization of the Francine vein. While at the same time, surface drilling is focused on defining new near surface oxide mineralization along the West Francine and Esperanza veins. Recently, we have successfully identified new oxide veins at the El Toro target, and are pushing hard to define a new oxide source with further drilling. The emphasis of exploration in 2019 is to rapidly advance our opportunities in Nevada, define new oxide mineralization at San Sebastian, and continue the drilling successes at Casa Berardi and Greens Creek.

And with that, I'll pass the call back to Phil.

And our first question comes from Cosmos Chiu from CIBC. Your line is now open.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Hi. Thanks, Phil, Lindsay, Larry, and Dean. Thanks for the call. If I may, my questions are mostly on Fire Creek here. I understand that Fire Creek and the entire sort of Nevada complex is still a work in progress. Certainly in 2018, a transitional year, there were some disappointments with the decrease of reserves beyond what was produced. I'm just trying to get a better understanding in terms of what has been the biggest surprise to you at these Nevada assets in terms of reserves, in terms of production, as you know, ownership has handed -- since ownership has been handed over to Hecla.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I'll start, and then I'll let Larry and Dean jump in. But I think the biggest surprise and disappointment was the Klondex didn't follow the budget that they had presented to us. And so, as a result, the amount of development that was done was significantly less than was supposed to be done. And so, as a result, it really has caused us to have to really focus and reestablish the mine. That's probably the biggest thing from my perspective. Larry?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Certainly operationally, the biggest challenge is getting the development caught up. Despite ground conditions, which are challenging, we are on an acceleration track. And Cosmos, for just a comment on the reserves -- and we hit them pretty hard. Clearly, there was mine depletion. There was no drilling in the first half of the year. And so, there really wasn't time to refine and identify new reserves. But the other thing, we knew that there was a challenge in reconciling the production grades with the mill. And so, we really relooked at the modeling. We narrowed the vein or the size of the vein within the models. And so, we actually -- and changed the capping or top cut. And consequently, that represented about half the reserve losses. We've been very conservative in our modeling in those -- of the existing resources and reserves.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, we want to make sure that we have a base to build from in terms of reserves, in terms of resources. The development we want to -- it's still a work in progress to figure out the development, hence why we're looking at a roadheader to go in and do the development in advance. So, we think there's a lot of different levers to pull before we will optimize this mine, and similar to what we saw at Casa Berardi.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. Of course. And Phil and Dean, it's great that you brought up the reserves and resources. Looking at it here, and you talked about Spirals 2, 3, 4, and 9, and a number of different zones -- Vonnie, Joyce, Karen, Honey, and others. I'm just trying to understand what of these new -- what of these zones that you've identified are considered -- categorized as, say, new zones, versus an extension of current mineralization? I think Dean sort of touched on that Spiral 9 looks like it could be an extension in terms of a drilling platform for current utilization. I'm just trying to get a better understanding and trying to gauge the difficulty in terms of adding to reserves and resources based on, are they new zones, or are they extensions, and whatnot.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I'll let Dean answer the question.

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Yeah. Well, Cosmos, it's really all of the above. They're clearly extensions to the existing -- you mentioned Vonnie and Joyce, the veins that have been key producers in the past. There are extensions to the north and south. In fact, there may be opportunities up dip. But as you go to the north in what's referred to as -- well, let me step back. So, for those zones, we know they're there. There's been some preliminary drilling to define them. And now, we're getting the development in place to drill them off. From an expiration point of view, particularly to the north, you have Spiral 9, you have the North Zone, that -- the North Zone's really a northern extension of the known veins. We're seeing in the Titan Zone a series of new veins there, and then in Spiral 9. Surface drilling to the northwest with Zeus, I think, are defining some new veins that certainly look encouraging. We're gonna need to drill them out. But I do see kind of near-term upgrading, expansion along trends, and then with Spiral 9, Zeus, and others, things that are gonna come in in the next few years.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. Great. And then maybe that leads into my next question here. In terms of timing, when would you be ready to potentially put out a reserve resource update? Again, there are -- and do you have some market concerns in terms of the low ounces on current reserves at this point in time? I guess understanding that, Nevada's still a work in progress, and all the other issues that we had talked about in the past, or just now. But I'm just wondering, when would you be ready to potentially put out a new reserve resource?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

We have not actually made a determination. Our typical schedule is yearend, and I'm not envisioning that we're planning to change that. Or any . . .

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Yeah. At this point, Cosmos, I'd say we'd stay with our traditional schedule. But depending on what transpires, that may change.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. And maybe one last question on Fire Creek here. We've been given the production guidance for 2019 for Nevada as a whole, as a complex. But I'm just wondering how much of the 69,000 ounces in reserves for Fire Creek have you sort of incorporated into that 2019 guidance? Have you incorporated any of the beyond reserves into that guidance?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, the answer's yes. Some of this would be beyond reserves. As far as what that percentage is, I couldn't tell you. But it's -- does anybody know?

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

I don't know the exact number on that one.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Okay. But there's some. But a lot of it, the bulk of it, I guess, would be based on reserves.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Well, it is a combination. I mean, we -- and this was part of the calculus we did in acquiring this, is that you have to convert inferred into reserves. And frankly, what happens is gonna be similar to what we've seen at other mines, where we are producing mineralization that maybe doesn't even make a category. And we certainly see that Greens Creek a lot. We don't see any -- that this would be any different than that.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Yeah. Great. And sorry, I lied. Maybe one last question on Fire Creek here. You talk about increasing the under mine, underground throughput from, I think, 350 tons per day to 520 by mid-2019. Is that as simple as, as Larry said, getting ahead on development, getting your 1,200 feet per month in place. Is that really the bottleneck?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

It's a key -- the key to expanding throughput is in expanding development, without a doubt. Obviously, we need to also drill ahead of ourselves, get our definition drilling in place, confirm the scopes before we dive into them. All of that's driven by development.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. And you're happy with the 1,200 feet per month level, Dean, or Larry?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah. I mean, we've seeded it in January. We're a little bit behind in February, only because we're driving raises right now, so we're doing less capital lateral footage. But we see the sustain on plan. It was a matter of injecting more miners and more machines, and that's on track. And now, we actually have some opportunity to improve our actual cycle at the face. That's the next challenge that we will take on.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And I just wanted to just make sure that people understand, you're still trying new things, and you don't have a standard development plan yet for the cycle yet. You're still working through that.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah. We're still working through that. We're still doing conventional drill and blast, which are typically very short rounds, at Fire Creek, in the ground, since . . . So, we have to have a lot of headings, shootings, and short blasts. And so, there's opportunity there. The roadheader, the first trial, was very successful. It kept the material very well. It left behind a very solid back and rib. And so, we're just -- we're learning as we go. We're injecting -- we have our VP Tech Services onsite pretty much all the time now. We've taken Lucky Friday expertise down, and we're making the improvements that we should be.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. Great. Thank you. That's all I have. Thanks a lot.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Cosmos.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Fields from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Hey, guys. So, back since you've issued the bonds in 2013, in your EBITDA reconciliation, you've added back or taken away, as is the case, the gains or losses unrealized on derivative contracts. So, for the first nine months to today, that was basically a $40 million hit in your EBITDA, because you've gained that in your income statement, but all of a sudden, for the fourth quarter, most of that's gone away. So, it looks like you only take away about $8 million instead of $40. So, it looks like you're inflating your EBITDA by about $32 million. Can you help me understand why that's not the case?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, the first thing I'd say is that the derivatives contracts that we had, we closed out in the third quarter and generated $35 million, $32 million of cash from those contracts. So, we have not -- when the price of zinc and lead fell, and we were able to generate that cash. And so, we were monetizing that hedge. So, we've done that. Now, prices have come back up for zinc and lead, and so, we're putting new positions in place. So, to the extent that prices continue to rise, we'll have that -- that number will grow as we put in more contracts, and to the extent those go underwater. But Lindsay, anything to add to that?

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, Matthew, maybe you're saying we're detected $40 million and arriving at adjusted net income. We take that gain out. Then we include it in our EBITDA calculation. That's still alluded to, the cash we received on the closing of the hedges. It's much the same -- we were kind of following covenants, which allowed it, so.

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Right, but the first nine months of 2018, basically you add back -- you take away $40 million, and then all of a sudden, that disappears in the full year. I'm just . . .

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

You're talking about income statement, or balance sheet, or cash flow? Pardon me?

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Income statement is, for the first nine months, you've gained $40 million on derivatives. That shows up in the full year income statement as well.

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Not much happened in the fourth quarter, Matthew.

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Right, agreed. And the EBITDA reconciliation, when you look at you know your third quarter release, that entire $40 million from the income statement was taken away, but now all of a sudden, on the fourth quarter report, only $8 million is taken away.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I think what you're saying, maybe in the third quarter, we didn't add back the cash gains on the cashed out hedges, right? Is that what you're alluding to? We'll look back in and check that, but.

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Yeah, but if I look at your cash flow statement, it looks like you've only gained modified $15 million. So, there's a lot of -- there's some screwy numbers going on, and just, maybe we can take this offline, because you reported $156 million of EBITDA for the first nine months, $28 million in the fourth quarter, and somehow, that's supposed add up to $211 million. Happy to take this offline.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, let's take it offline. I might argue, they're not screwy numbers. They're just accounting and cash flows being mixed, so. We'll deal with it.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Okay. Any other question, Matthew?

Operator

Thank you. Your next question comes from Heiko Ihle from H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure thing, Heiko.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

Great. I promised myself I wouldn't ask a Casa Berardi question this time for once. So, going over to Nevada, you mentioned the asset should be cash flow positive this year. Are you willing to quantify this just a little bit more, especially given that your all-in sustaining cost estimate there is $1,325.00 an ounce?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

No, what we've said is that the operations will be cash flow positive with the exception of the exploration and the development for the Hatter Graben. So, when you look at -- so, basically we're saying that we're right at positive cash flow from Nevada, and if you look at the all-in sustaining cost, you see that.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then, the decline is about 15% complete, so there's still bunch of work to do, obviously. Speaking of --

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, we'll do 5,000 feet of development at Hatter Graben.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

And speaking of Nevada and following up from the question that Cosmos had asked, I mean, you mentioned the increase in the throughput at Fire Creek from 350 tons per day to 520 tons per day by 2019. You also mentioned that your focus on -- and this is from your lease -- maintaining the development grade and all ground conditions. Am I reading something into here that's not there? Is there something I'm missing? I thought the ground conditions have been in that mine, as the ground conditions at Fire Creek are actually pretty solid. Is there -- are there pockets that need extra ground support? Or again, am I missing something there?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Well, you'll remember, when we first bought it, we talked about fact that we had this tuft that created road conditions that we had to come in with the synthetic liner and build a road base. Well, that's -- so, we dealt with the road conditions, but you have that same condition on the back and on the ribs. And so, that's what Larry is alluding to with the shot creating that we've had to do, and that's why we're contemplating the roadheader going through this soft material. Larry?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, it's variable. You can see very good ground conditions for -- we'll get 24 feet a day on a given head-in. And then, at times, we run into altered tufts and very clay-like material that takes short rounds and requires a fair amount of support. And the additional shot treatment. So, it's variable.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And then you also have the introduction of water into this tuft, which again -- and if you think about it, if you look at those pictures of the road, you get a sense of how soupy it becomes and difficult to operate in. And so, we're trying to figure out the best way to deal with the changing ground conditions. And so, that's why I have continued to make a point that we're experimenting, we're trying new things. I'm more interested in Larry coming to a series of standards, depending on the ground conditions, rather than just being so worried about getting the development. But, Larry.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah. You mentioned water, there's water in certain pockets, and we're looking at a bit more of a mobile dewatering plan so that we're not managing the water underground. So, yeah, we've shown -- as Phil alluded, we've shown photos of some of the poor conditions and what we're doing to manage them. We've got the right team there. I mentioned the roadheader -- it's actually a very small roadheader that we're trialing right now. And if it continues to perform as well as it seems to be, we may go all in for a large roadheader, I mean, a really large roadheader, and really jack up the advancement.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

Very helpful. Thank you, guys.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Okay, thanks, Heiko.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony Sorrentino from Sorrentino Metals. Your line is now open.

Anthony Sorrentino -- Sorrentino Metals -- Analyst

Good morning, everyone.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Nice to talk to you.

Anthony Sorrentino -- Sorrentino Metals -- Analyst

Yeah, same here. You're estimating 2019 capital expenditures at $150 million and 2019 exploration expenditures at $25 million. Would you break those down by property?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Does someone have it handy, or . . .

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Well, I'll talk about the exploration. So, you know that $25 million, Anthony, the -- half of it will be in Nevada, and the remainder will be split between Casa Berardi, San Sebastian, and Greens Creek. There'll be very little exploration outside of those four areas.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And Casa Berardi in Mexico were roughly $3 million apiece.

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, Casa's $3.6 million. San Sebastian's . . .

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And then as far as the capital goes, it's that $12 million for the Lucky Friday, about $50 million each for Greens Creek and Nevada, and then about $40 million for Casa Berardi.

Anthony Sorrentino -- Sorrentino Metals -- Analyst

Okay. Very good. Thank you for answering my questions.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure thing.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ajay Lele from Southpaw. Your line is now open.

Ajay Lele -- Southpaw -- Analyst

Hello? Can you hear me?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

We can.

Ajay Lele -- Southpaw -- Analyst

Great. I just wanted to ask about the Casa Berardi medium-term cost outlook as you move from underground what looks like into more of an open pit mine plan for your recent reserve announcement? Thank you.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, there's really no change in the percentage of surface and underground planned any time soon. We'll have a number of years of the underground based on the current reserve, and we're adding to reserves periodically. So, those will not change. It's still roughly 50-50, and the grade of the underground's about twice the grade of the open pit -- maybe a little more, not much. The new stuff that we've added from the West Mine is a bit higher-grade than the surface average. So, all in all, our expectation is to sort of maintain the cost structure that you see as we develop both the underground and the surface.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Can I add to that?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure, please.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

So, all of that's premised on a permit limit of 1.4 million tons, metric tons per year, and we are going to apply for an addition to that. Should we successfully raise the permitted limit and make some adjustments in the mill, then we could increase the amount of open pit feed going into the mill.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, that's right. And that would be increased to how much?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Well, we're applying for $1.6 million.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So, $0.2 million more?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah.

Ajay Lele -- Southpaw -- Analyst

Thanks.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Trevor Turnbull from Scotiabank. Your line is now open.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Yeah, hi. I just had one quick question, a very simple question with respect to Nevada. Is there any chance you're gonna have a site visit this year? It might make it simpler to understand some of the stuff that's been discussed on the call so far.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I'm sure we'll have one this year. We haven't made any specific plans at the moment. I want Larry and his team to have the opportunity to get their SOPs for the development in the different conditions resolved before we start bringing people onto the site. So, while we're still in this learning phase, it's probably better to wait.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Okay. My other questions were really more for Larry with respect to Greens Creek -- Larry and Dean. I guess the first thing, you've got some exploration and potential reserve additions coming at Greens. Can you give us a sense, Dean, what that's going to look like in terms of the reserve grade you've got there at Greens Creek? I think you're on the order of, what, 400 grams silver now? Are these areas likely to be consistent with that and kind of maintain a similar level of silver?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, Trevor, so, last year, and I think I announced this per ton, but last year, our reserves were 11.8, and we're at 11.5 this year. My expectation is that you're gonna see that 11.5 to 12 with potential resources converting to reserves. We are exploring upper plate. It's narrower, but very high grade. The same is true for East ore. And both of those areas are higher up in the mine. And Deep 200 South is, overall, more precious metal rich, so that you will see, with a couple of these areas, higher-grade precious metals than the reserve grade and slightly lower base metals, but that's gonna fluctuate. Overall, I don't see huge changes in the grade, the reserve grade overall.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

So, maybe a better way to think about it, really, given all the base metals, is that NSR is unlikely to change a whole lot in terms of the value per ton of the stuff you're looking at versus what you've already got.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, I think that's a good comment.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

So, I guess what I'm also wondering is, you talked about, certainly on the slide and in the presentation, looking to move some high-grade material forward in the mine plan, and it feels like you've been just kind of a little ahead of reserve grade recently. Are you looking to kind of still kind of maintain that, or are you looking for a pretty significant bump in the grade you're moving forward? And I guess my question really is trying to get at are you gonna kind of be above the reserve grade in aggregate there for a few years, and then kind of to what degree, such that I kind of understand to what degree it might -- sorry, it might dip below reserve grade going forward?

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Over the next sort of four years, 2020 through 2023, the reserve grades will be -- or production grades will be higher than what it has been. I don't off the top of my head have -- I can't remember what that will be. But as a result, we'll have higher ounce production. Larry, generally speaking -- and we'll have the -- in the 43101, you'll be able to see that. But generally speaking, Dean?

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Yeah, and next year. This will not match the technical report exactly because this is more of an internal . . .

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

This includes inferred and everything.

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Yeah, this is not gonna match the technical report, but it'll give you kind of an idea of where we'll be. We should be, next year, in the 12.5 ounce per ton silver.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So, call it an ounce better in the next few years.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Yeah, a healthy 10% or so better than where it's been. And then, Larry, I guess also just referring to that slide 11 in the deck. You show the old design with a ramp. It looks like you've been able to get away without having to put in that ramp, which is obviously a huge savings, and you've gone to this -- what looks to be a much more simplified design. I'm just curious, it looks almost too good to be true that you could get rid of all that development and do what you need to do using existing workings. Can you just explain a little bit about how that came to pass, that you could eliminate all that development and still achieve what you needed to?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

The graphic that we included is just one example. This is the East Ore in the very high end of the mine, where we anticipate when we published our report, that there'll be 15,000 fewer development feed. And a part of it is coming from this section we're showing in the graph, but not all of it. Some of it's just a good rethink of how we're accessing what are complicated ore bodies; these things are geometrically complex. And the more we can come off of the existing access, as we have in this example, the less development we're gonna do. So, 15,000 feet capitalize-wise is no small amount of money. It's actually its quite significant.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

But to the point, I think some of this has come as a result of being able to take more data and build a clear picture of where these ore bodies are. I think that -- I don't mean to give an advertisement for Leap Frog, but I think it's been very, very helpful. Dean, you . . .

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

As you know, the geometry of the ore bodies at Greens Creek are challenging, particularly when you're trying to model. Using Leap Frog primarily, we've been able to create wireframe models of the ore bodies that incorporate not only the drilling, but all the underground sampling, and really been able to develop, I think, a lot more realistic 3D model. And I think that's contributing as well to mine planning and optimizations, is that historically, Greens Creek's had a lot of mining ore zones outside of the modeling, which of course causes adjustments and time delays. I think we're doing a much better job of recreating that geometry in our models now.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And so, as a result of that, you know where to put the development, and we can be much more efficient with what we're -- how we're designing it. That Larry has.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, just the last thought is that the prior mine plan, we had 15 foot high cuts and they were horizontal cuts. And so, as we designed them, we -- as soon as you got toward the fringes, and it no longer paid. You just cut off the scope. We've now adjusted our centerlines more to the actual geometry of the ore bodies. And it's made for, well, more ore and more efficient development.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Yeah. No, it sounds like it's been a positive result all the way around. That's great. Thanks, guys.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Trevor.

Operator

Ji won her fifth U.S. LPGA Tour title in her previous event last month, the season-opening Tournament of Champions in Florida.

She picked up right where she left off, in Chonburi.

After an opening birdie and a bogey on the third hole, Ji birdied nine out of the following 14 holes on the Siam Country Club Pattaya’s Old Course.

In her wake were Minjee Lee of Australia, Danielle Kang of the United States, and Jenny Shin of South Korea, each with a 65.

“I felt really great. I didn’t miss any fairways and missed just two greens,” Ji said. “I have a lot of confidence.

Lee was bogey free as she eagled the 15th and birdied five holes on a humid day.

“I was little bit slow starting out. I finished with three birdies on the last three holes at the front nine, and got a little bit better momentum,” Lee said.

A group of four, three strokes off the lead, included Americans Jennifer Song and Lizette Salas, Canadian Brooke Henderson, and Australian Katherine Kirk.

World No. 1 Ariya Jutanugarn, the 2013 runner-up, carded a 4 under 68, mixing an eagle and six birdies with two bogeys and a double bogey.

YEAR-END HIGHLIGHTS

Silver production of 10.4 million ounces and record gold production of 262,103 ounces.

Silver equivalent production of 43.6 million ounces or gold equivalent of 540,174 ounces. 7

Cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization (""cost of sales"") of $488.0 million.

Total cash cost, after by-product credits and all-in sustaining cost (""AISC""), after by-product credits, per silver ounce of $1.08 and $11.44, respectively. 1,2

Record reserves for gold, silver and lead; increases over 2017 of 26%, 8% and 5%, respectively.

Completed the acquisition of Klondex in July 2018.

Improved safety with All Injury Frequency Rate 28% lower.

""Greens Creek and Casa Berardi are the economic engines of Hecla, and the continued increase in reserves and resources, extended mine life and positive changes to the mine plans are surfacing additional value at these operations,” said Phillips S. Baker, Jr., President and CEO. “This allows investment in our three other mines, which all have the potential to be long-lived with strong economics like Greens Creek and Casa Berardi. The turnaround of the Nevada operations continues with an increasing development rate at Fire Creek that should allow the mine to have operating consistency as we increase production. This is the same approach we took when we first acquired Greens Creek and Casa Berardi. Substantial exploration is planned for both Fire Creek and Hollister this year as we work to convert resources to reserves and discover additional resources. With the Hatter Graben decline about 15% complete, we expect to start drilling between the current Hollister mine area and the Hatter Graben soon.""

""At San Sebastian we continue to discover and mine oxide mineralization while we take a bulk sample to determine the potential economics of the sulfide ore,"" Mr. Baker continued.

SILVER AND GOLD RESERVE SUMMARY

Proven and probable silver reserves are 191 million ounces, an increase of 8% over December 31, 2017 levels. Proven and probable gold reserves are 2.9 million ounces, an increase of 26% over December 31, 2017 levels. Proven and probable zinc and lead reserves of 932,000 tons and 774,000 tons are increases of 11% and 5%, respectively, over December 31, 2017 levels. The reserves for gold, silver and lead are the highest in Company history. The price assumptions used for 2018 reserves of $14.50 for silver, $1,200 for gold, $1.15 for zinc and $0.90 for lead are unchanged from last year, with the exception of zinc, which was $1.05 in 2017. The silver price assumption is among the lowest in the industry.

Please refer to the reserves and resources tables at the end of this press release, or to the press release entitled ""Hecla Reports Record Gold, Silver and Lead Reserves"" issued on February 14, 2019, for the breakdown between proven and probable reserve and resource levels, as well as a detailed summary of the Company's exploration programs.

Revised NI 43-101 Technical Reports for Greens Creek and Casa Berardi are expected by April. At Greens Creek, the optimized mine plan accelerates access to higher-grade ore, enabling the expected highest margin reserves to be extracted in the earlier years of the mine plan. In addition, the increase in reserves is expected to extend the mine life, excluding resources, by about three years to 2030.

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW

Fourth Quarter Ended Twelve Months Ended HIGHLIGHTS December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 FINANCIAL DATA Sales (000) $ 136,520 $ 160,113 $ 567,137 $ 577,775 Gross profit (loss) (000) $ (1,265 ) $ 46,310 $ 79,099 $ 152,449 Loss applicable to common stockholders (000) $ (23,831 ) $ (29,105 ) $ (27,115 ) $ (29,072 ) Basic and diluted loss per common share $ (0.05 ) $ (0.07 ) $ (0.06 ) $ (0.07 ) Cash provided by operating activities (000) $ 19,011 $ 41,763 $ 94,221 $ 115,878

Net loss applicable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 was $23.8 million and $27.1 million, or $0.05 and $0.06 per basic share, respectively, compared to net losses applicable to common stockholders of $29.1 million, or $0.07 per basic share, for both periods of the prior year. Among items impacting the results for the 2018 periods compared to 2017 were the following:

Sales for the fourth quarter and full year were 15% and 2% lower, respectively, than the same periods in 2017. The decreases are mainly due to lower silver production due to lower grades and production at San Sebastian as well as lower average silver prices, partially offset by higher gold production due to higher throughout at Casa Berardi and the addition of the Nevada operations.

A slight loss was recorded on base metal derivative contracts for the fourth quarter 2018, while gains on base metal derivative contracts of $40.3 million were recorded for the full year 2018, compared to losses of $4.7 million and $21.3 million, respectively, in the prior year periods, mainly the result of lower lead prices. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company settled in-the-money contracts prior to their maturity date, for cash proceeds of approximately $32.8 million.

Foreign exchange gains of $7.5 million and $10.3 million were recognized in the fourth quarter and full year of 2018, respectively, compared to a $0.6 million gain and a loss of $9.7 million, respectively, in the prior year periods. The variances were primarily due to weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.

Interest expense, net of amount capitalized, was $10.9 million in the fourth quarter and $40.9 million for the full year of 2018 compared to $9.6 million and $38.0 million, respectively, in the prior year periods.

Exploration and pre-development expense was $9.4 million for the fourth quarter and $40.6 million for the full year of 2018, compared to $7.3 million and $29.0 million, respectively, in the prior year periods, primarily due to increased exploration activity in Nevada and Quebec.

Research and development expense was $0.4 million for the fourth quarter and $5.4 million for the full year of 2018, compared to $1.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively, for the prior year periods, and is related to the evaluation and development of new technologies, such as the Remote Vein Miner (RVM) project at the Lucky Friday.

Suspension costs for the fourth quarter of $2.4 million and $20.7 million for the full year of 2018, including $1.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in non-cash depreciation expense. This is compared to suspension costs of $6.9 million and $21.3 million, respectively, for the prior year periods.

Income tax benefit for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 of $5.2 million and $6.7 million, respectively, compared to provisions of $38.5 million and $21.0 million, respectively, in the prior year periods. The tax provisions in 2017 resulted primarily from the changes in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the resulting revaluation of the deferred tax asset, as well as current income and mining taxes in Mexico.

Cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 of $19.0 million and $94.2 million, respectively, was $22.8 million and $21.7 million lower, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in 2018 was mainly the result of lower production and higher exploration spending, as well as acquisition costs, partly offset by cash proceeds from settlement of base metals derivative contracts prior to their maturity date.

Adjusted EBITDA was $28.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $71.1 million for the same period of 2017, and $211.9 million for the full year of 2018, compared to $231.9 million in 2017.3 The decreases were due to lower production and higher exploration spending.

Capital expenditures at the operations totaled $53.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, including $17.6 million at Nevada operations, $13.6 million at Casa Berardi, $12.2 million at Greens Creek, $7.3 million at Lucky Friday, and $2.5 million at San Sebastian. Capital expenditures for the year 2018 totaled $140.6 million at the operations, compared to $103.4 million in 2017.

Metals Prices

Average realized silver prices in the fourth quarter and full year 2018 were $14.58 and $15.63 per ounce, respectively, compared to $16.87 and $17.23, respectively, for the prior year periods. Realized prices for gold for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 were $1,237 and $1,265 per ounce, respectively, 3% lower compared to the fourth quarter 2017, while the price for the year ended slightly higher. Average realized prices for lead and zinc for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 23% and 21% lower, respectively, compared to the prior year period. The average realized prices for lead and zinc for the full year of 2018 were 2% and 4% lower, respectively, compared to 2017.

Greens Creek Mine - Alaska

For the fourth quarter, silver production was 2,163,563 ounces and gold production was 13,097 ounces, increases of 1% and 13%, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. Full year 2018 silver production was 7,953,003 ounces, a decrease of 5% compared to the prior year period, and 2018 gold production was 51,493 ounces, an increase of 1%. The decrease in silver production resulted from lower grades, and gold production was modestly higher due to higher throughput. The mill operated at an average of 2,310 tons per day (tpd) in the fourth quarter and 2,316 tpd for the full year. The annual throughput was a record.

The cost of sales for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 was $48.3 million and $190.1 million, respectively, a decrease of 22% and 6%, respectively, over the prior year periods. The cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver ounce, for the quarter and full year was $1.79 and $(1.13), respectively, an increase from $0.66 for the fourth quarter 2017, and a decrease from $0.71 for the full year 2017.1 The AISC, after by-product credits, was $7.92 per silver ounce for the fourth quarter and $5.58 for the full year of 2018, up for the quarter from $6.23 and lower for the year from $5.76.2 The higher per silver ounce cash cost, after by-product credits, for the quarter was primarily due to higher production costs and lower by-product credits. The increase in AISC, after by-product credits, for the quarter resulted from higher capital spending. The decrease in cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver ounce for the full year of 2018 was due to higher by-product credits. The impact of higher by-product credits on AISC, after by-product credits, was partially offset by higher capital spending for the full year of 2018.

For the full year of 2018, Greens Creek generated cash provided by operating activities of approximately $125.1 million and spent $40.8 million on additions to properties, plants and equipment, resulting in free cash flow of $84.3 million.5

Casa Berardi - Quebec

Gold production of 35,864 ounces during the fourth quarter 2018, including 4,849 ounces from the East Mine Crown Pillar (EMCP) pit, was 17% lower than the same period of 2017 due to lower grades. Full year 2018 gold production of 162,744 ounces, including 32,097 ounces from the EMCP pit, was higher than the prior year period by 4% and the highest since acquisition of the operation. The mill operated at an average of 3,515 tpd in the fourth quarter 2018 and 3,769 tpd for the year, which is a record and 218 tpd more than 2017, as well as approximately 1,800 tpd more than at acquisition.

Cost of sales was $47.3 million and $199.4 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively, increases of 2% and 8%, respectively, over the prior year periods. The cash cost, after by-product credits, per gold ounce of $940 for the fourth quarter 2018 increased 31% over the prior year period, due to lower gold production.7 For the full year 2018, the cash cost, after by-product credits, per gold ounce, decreased to $800, from $820 for the prior year period, due to higher gold production and expensing of EMCP pit stripping costs during the first half of 2017.1,4 The AISC, after by-product credits, was $1,348 per gold ounce for the fourth quarter and $1,080 for the full year 2018 compared to $1,039 and $1,174 in the same periods of 2017. The increase for the quarter was due to higher capital spending, with the decrease for the full year due to higher gold production and lower capital spending.2

For the full year of 2018, Casa Berardi generated cash provided by operating activities of approximately $82.9 million and spent $39.7 million on additions to properties, plants and equipment, resulting in free cash flow of $43.2 million.5

San Sebastian - Mexico

Silver production was 443,302 ounces for the fourth quarter and 2,037,072 ounces for the full year of 2018 compared to 759,100 and 3,257,738 for the same periods of 2017. Gold production was 2,928 ounces for the fourth quarter and 14,979 ounces for the full year of 2018, compared to 5,955 and 25,177 for the same periods of 2017. The lower metal production was expected due to lower grades as a result of the transition from shallow, high-grade open pits to underground production. The mill operated at an average of 487 tpd in the fourth quarter 2018 and 429 tpd for the year.

The cost of sales was $10.6 million and $41.8 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively, compared to $5.3 million and $23.7 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2017. Cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver ounce was $14.78 in the fourth quarter and $9.69 for the full year of 2018, compared to ($3.80) and ($3.36) for the same periods of 2017.1 The AISC, after by-product credits, was $19.51 for the fourth quarter and $14.68 for the full year of 2018 compared to ($0.64) and ($0.26) for the same periods of 2017.2 The increases in cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver ounce and AISC, after by-product credits, per silver ounce, were due to lower silver and gold production and higher mining costs as a result of the transition to underground mining.

A review of sulfide ore is underway, including a bulk sample to test the capabilities of the third-party plant.

Nevada Operations

For the fourth quarter of 2018, 19,098 gold ounces and 88,156 silver ounces were produced. For the period July 20, 2018 to December 31, 2018, 32,887 gold ounces and 172,301 silver ounces were produced. During 2018, the Nevada operations focused on development at Fire Creek and Hollister, limiting production as little development had been undertaken earlier in the year by Klondex. While the development rate at Fire Creek has exceeded the planned advance, the focus remains on finding ways to maintain the development rate in all ground conditions. In addition, the increasing development is providing additional drill platforms to enhance the exploration program, and five drills are operating for stope design, in-fill drilling and exploration. The Company's plan is to increase Fire Creek's throughput from 350 tons per day to 520 tons per day by mid-2019. At Hollister, the development of a decline to the Hatter Graben exploration target is underway with completion of the initial phase expected to be late in 2019.

During the period July 20, 2018 to December 31, 2018, approximately $32.6 million in capital and $9.3 million in exploration expense was invested in Nevada. Of the $32.6 million in capital, $12.4 million related to the completion of the tailings facility at Midas which is expected to provide the waste capacity for four years of full production, while $13.2 million was for development needed to increase Fire Creek throughput, and $1.5 million was for completing the carbon in leach ""CIL"" circuit at the Midas Mill to increase the recoveries from Hollister ore.

Lucky Friday Mine - Idaho

Silver production was 13,026 ounces in the fourth quarter and 169,041 ounces for the full year 2018, a decrease from 69,578 ounces and 838,658 ounces in the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, respectively, due to the ongoing strike by unionized employees, which began in March 2017. The Company continues to invest in the mine, with limited production and capital improvements being performed by salaried staff.

Construction of the RVM machine continues in Sweden, and is expected to be completed, along with testing of the unit, and sent to the Company in 2020.

EXPLORATION AND PRE-DEVELOPMENT

Exploration

Exploration (including corporate development) expenses were $8.1 million, and $35.7 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively. This represents an increase of 37% and 52% over the fourth quarter and full year 2017. These increases were primarily the result of the addition of the Nevada operations and increased exploration at San Sebastian, the Kinskuch project in British Columbia and the Little Baldy project in northern Idaho.

A complete summary of exploration activities can be found in the news release entitled ""Hecla Reports Record Reserves For Silver, Gold, and Lead"" released on February 14, 2019.

Pre-development

Pre-development spending was $1.3 million in the fourth quarter and $4.9 million for the full year 2018, principally to advance the permitting at Rock Creek and Montanore.

1,2,4,5 Non-GAAP measure. See pages 10-11 for more information.

Rock Creek

In August 2018, the Kootenai National Forest issued the Final Record of Decision (ROD) for Phase I (evaluation phase) of the Rock Creek Project, a proposed underground copper and silver mine in northwestern Montana near Noxon in Sanders County. The Company is updating its plan of operation to reflect the ROD, and agency approval is anticipated in early 2019. The project remains the subject of ongoing litigation.

Montanore

In May 2017, the Federal District court judge in Missoula, Montana remanded back to the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service their approvals for the Montanore project. The court advised that the agencies could proceed with the approval of the evaluation phase of the project. The U.S. Forest Service determined a focused supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (""EIS"") would be prepared on the evaluation phase and published its notice of intent to do so in the Federal Register in December 2017. It is anticipated that the agency will complete its assessment and issue a new ROD in 2019. As a part of this permitting process, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing updated terrestrial and aquatic biological opinions for the project. The project remains the subject of ongoing litigation.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The Research and Development activities of the Company consisted primarily of work being conducted on the RVM, the focus of which is shifting towards fabrication of the unit, with delivery expected in 2020.

DIVIDENDS

The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.0025 per share of common stock, payable on or about March 13, 2019, to shareholders of record on March 5, 2019. The Company's realized silver price was $14.58 in the fourth quarter and therefore did not satisfy the criteria for a larger dividend under the Company's dividend policy.

The Board of Directors also declared the regular quarterly dividend of $0.875 per share on the 157,816 outstanding shares of Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock. This represents a total amount to be paid of approximately $138,000. The cash dividend is payable April 1, 2019, to shareholders of record on March 15, 2019.

NOTES

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures cited in this release and listed below are reconciled to their most comparable GAAP measure at the end of this release.

(1) Cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver and gold ounce is a non-GAAP measurement, a reconciliation of which to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization (sometimes referred to as ""cost of sales"" in this release), can be found at the end of the release. It is an important operating statistic that management utilizes to measure each mine's operating performance. It also allows the benchmarking of performance of each mine versus those of our competitors. As a primary silver mining company, management also uses the statistic on an aggregate basis - aggregating the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian mines - to compare performance with that of other primary silver mining companies. With regard to Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations, management uses cash cost, after by-product credits, per gold ounce to compare its performance with other gold mines. Similarly, the statistic is useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as it provides a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and operating characteristics. In addition, the Company may use it when formulating performance goals and targets under its incentive program.

(2) All in sustaining cost (AISC), after by-product credits, is a non-GAAP measurement, a reconciliation of which to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization, the closest GAAP measurement, can be found in the end of the release. AISC, after by-product credits, includes cost of sales and other direct production costs, expenses for reclamation and exploration at the mines sites, corporate exploration related to sustaining operations, and all site sustaining capital costs. AISC, after by-product credits, is calculated net of depreciation, depletion, and amortization and by-product credits.

Current GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain silver and gold production. Management believes that all in sustaining costs is a non-GAAP measure that provides additional information to management, investors and analysts to help (i) in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and (ii) in the transparency by better defining the total costs associated with production. Similarly, the statistic is useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as it provides a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and operating characteristics. In addition, the Company may use it when formulating performance goals and targets under its incentive program.

(3) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement, a reconciliation of which to net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, can be found at the end of the release. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to evaluate the Company's operating performance but should not be considered an alternative to net income, or cash provided by operating activities as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. In addition, the Company may use it when formulating performance goals and targets under its incentive program.

(4) Cash cost, after by-product credits, per gold ounce, is a Non-GAAP measurement only applicable to Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations production. Gold produced from Greens Creek and San Sebastian is treated as a by-product credit against the silver cash cost.

(5) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure calculated as cash provided by operating activities less additions to properties, plants and equipment.

Other

(6) Expectations for 2019 include silver, gold, lead and zinc production from Greens Creek, San Sebastian, Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations converted using Au $1,250/oz, Ag $16.00/oz, Zn $1.25/lb, and Pb $1.00/lb. Lucky Friday expectations are currently suspended as there is currently a strike. Numbers may be rounded.

(7) Silver and gold equivalent calculation based on average actual prices for each metal in the year as follows: $15.71 for Ag, $1,269 for Au, $1.02 for Pb, and $1.33 for Zn.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements, Including 2019 Outlook

This news release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws, including Canadian securities laws. Such forward-looking statements may include, without limitation: (i) estimates of future costs including cost of sales, cash cost, after by-product credits per ounce of silver/gold and AISC, after by-product credits, per ounce of silver/gold; (ii) estimates for 2019 for silver and gold production and silver equivalent production, cash cost, after by-product credits, AISC, after by-product credits, capital expenditures and exploration and pre-development expenditures (which assumes metal prices of gold at $1,250/oz, Ag $16.00/oz, Zn $1.25/lb, Pb $1.00/lb; USD/CAD assumed to be $0.79, USD/MXN assumed to be $0.06; and (iii) the Company’s mineral reserves and resources. Estimates or expectations of future events or results are based upon certain assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect. Such assumptions, include, but are not limited to: (a) there being no significant change to current geotechnical, metallurgical, hydrological and other physical conditions; (b) permitting, development, operations and expansion of the Company’s projects being consistent with current expectations and mine plans; (c) political/regulatory developments in any jurisdiction in which the Company operates being consistent with its current expectations; (d) the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar, being approximately consistent with current levels; (e) certain price assumptions for gold, silver, lead and zinc; (f) prices for key supplies being approximately consistent with current levels; (g) the accuracy of our current mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates; and (h) the Company’s plans for development and production will proceed as expected and will not require revision as a result of risks or uncertainties, whether known, unknown or unanticipated. Where the Company expresses or implies an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed, projected or implied by the “forward-looking statements.” Such risks include, but are not limited to gold, silver and other metals price volatility, operating risks, currency fluctuations, increased production costs and variances in ore grade or recovery rates from those assumed in mining plans, community relations, conflict resolution and outcome of projects or oppositions, litigation, political, regulatory, labor and environmental risks, and exploration risks and results, including that mineral resources are not mineral reserves, they do not have demonstrated economic viability and there is no certainty that they can be upgraded to mineral reserves through continued exploration. For a more detailed discussion of such risks and other factors, see the Company’s 2018 Form 10-K, filed on February 22, 2019, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as well as the Company’s other SEC filings. The Company does not undertake any obligation to release publicly revisions to any “forward-looking statement,” including, without limitation, outlook, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this news release, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. Investors should not assume that any lack of update to a previously issued “forward-looking statement” constitutes a reaffirmation of that statement. Continued reliance on “forward-looking statements” is at investors’ own risk.

Cautionary Statements to Investors on Reserves and Resources

Reporting requirements in the United States for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by the SEC and included in the SEC's Securities Act Industry Guide 7, entitled “Description of Property by Issuers Engaged or to be Engaged in Significant Mining Operations” (Guide 7). Although the SEC has recently issued new rules rescinding Guide 7, the new rules are not binding until January 1, 2022, and at this time the Company still reports in accordance with Guide 7. However, the Company is also a “reporting issuer” under Canadian securities laws, which require estimates of mineral resources and reserves to be prepared in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101). NI 43-101 requires all disclosure of estimates of potential mineral resources and reserves to be disclosed in accordance with its requirements. Such Canadian information is included herein to satisfy the Company's “public disclosure” obligations under Regulation FD of the SEC and to provide U.S. holders with ready access to information publicly available in Canada.

Reporting requirements in the United States for disclosure of mineral properties under Guide 7 and the requirements in Canada under NI 43-101 standards are substantially different. This document contains a summary of certain estimates of the Company, not only of proven and probable reserves within the meaning of Guide 7, but also of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates estimated in accordance with the definitional standards of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum referred to in NI 43-101. Under Guide 7, the term ""reserve"" means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term ""economically"", as used in the definition of reserve, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The term ""legally"", as used in the definition of reserve, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Hecla must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Hecla's current mine plans. The terms “measured resources”, “indicated resources,” and “inferred resources” are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101. These terms are not defined under Guide 7 and are not normally permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC in the United States, except where required to be disclosed by foreign law. The term “resource” does not equate to the term “reserve”. Under Guide 7, the material described herein as “indicated resources” and “measured resources” would be characterized as “mineralized material” and is permitted to be disclosed in tonnage and grade only, not ounces. The category of “inferred resources” is not recognized by Guide 7. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in such categories will ever be converted into proven or probable reserves. “Resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of such a “resource” will ever be upgraded to a higher category or will ever be economically extracted. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of a “resource” exists or is economically or legally mineable. Investors are also especially cautioned that the mere fact that such resources may be referred to in ounces of silver and/or gold, rather than in tons of mineralization and grades of silver and/or gold estimated per ton, is not an indication that such material will ever result in mined ore which is processed into commercial silver or gold.

Qualified Person (QP) Pursuant to Canadian National Instrument 43-101

Dean McDonald, PhD. P.Geo., Senior Vice President - Exploration of Hecla Mining Company, who serves as a Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101, supervised the preparation of the scientific and technical information concerning Hecla’s mineral projects in this news release. Information regarding data verification, surveys and investigations, quality assurance program and quality control measures and a summary of sample, analytical or testing procedures for the Greens Creek Mine are contained in a technical report prepared for Hecla titled “Technical Report for the Greens Creek Mine, Juneau, Alaska, USA” effective date March 28, 2013, and for the Lucky Friday Mine are contained in a technical report prepared for Hecla titled “Technical Report on the Lucky Friday Mine Shoshone County, Idaho, USA” effective date April 2, 2014, for the Casa Berardi Mine are contained in a technical report prepared for Hecla titled ""Technical Report on the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimate for the Casa Berardi Mine, Northwestern Quebec, Canada"" effective date March 31, 2014 (the ""Casa Berardi Technical Report""), and for the San Sebastian Mine are contained in a technical report prepared for Hecla titled ""Technical Report for the San Sebastian Ag-Au Property, Durango, Mexico"" effective date September 8, 2015. Also included in these four technical reports is a description of the key assumptions, parameters and methods used to estimate mineral reserves and resources and a general discussion of the extent to which the estimates may be affected by any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant factors. Information regarding data verification, surveys and investigations, quality assurance program and quality control measures and a summary of sample, analytical or testing procedures for the Fire Creek Mine are contained in a technical report prepared for Klondex Mines, dated March 31, 2018; the Hollister Mine dated May 31, 2017, amended August 9, 2017; and the Midas Mine dated August 31, 2014, amended April 2, 2015. Copies of these technical reports are available under Hecla's and Klondex's profiles on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

The current Casa Berardi drill program was performed on core sawed in half and included the insertion of blanks and standards of variable grade in every 24 core samples. Standards were generally provided by Analytical Solutions Ltd and prepared in 30-gram bags. Samples were sent to the Swastika Laboratories in Swastika, Ontario, a registered accredited laboratory, where they were dried, crushed, and split for gold analysis. Analysis for gold was completed by fire assay with AA finish. Gold over-limits were analyzed by fire assay with gravimetric finish. Data received from the lab were subject to validation using in-built program triggers to identify outside limit blank or standard assays that require re-analysis. Over 5% of the original pulps and rejects are sent for re-assay to ALS Chemex in Val d’Or for quality control.

Dr. McDonald reviewed and verified information regarding drill sampling, data verification of all digitally-collected data, drill surveys and specific gravity determinations relating to the Casa Berardi mine. The review encompassed quality assurance programs and quality control measures including analytical or testing practice, chain-of-custody procedures, sample storage procedures and included independent sample collection and analysis. This review found the information and procedures meet industry standards and are adequate for Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation and mine planning purposes.

(1) Cash cost, after by-product credits, per ounce and AISC, after by-product credits. per ounce represent non-U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measurements. A reconciliation of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization (GAAP) to cash cost, after by-product credits can be found in the cash cost per ounce reconciliation section of this news release. Gold, lead and zinc produced have been treated as by-product credits in calculating silver costs per ounce. The primary metal produced at Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations is gold, with a by-product credit for the value of silver production.

Non-GAAP Measures

(Unaudited)

Reconciliation of Cost of Sales and Other Direct Production Costs and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (GAAP) to Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP) and All-In Sustaining Cost, Before By-product Credits and All-In Sustaining Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP)

The tables below present reconciliations between the most comparable GAAP measure of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization to the non-GAAP measures of (i) Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits, (ii) Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, (iii) AISC, Before By-product Credits and (iv) AISC, After By-product Credits for our operations at the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, San Sebastian, Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations units and for the Company for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and for estimated amounts for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.

Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce is a measure developed by precious metals companies (including the Silver Institute) in an effort to provide a uniform standard for comparison purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that these non-GAAP measures as we report them are the same as those reported by other mining companies.

Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce is an important operating statistic that we utilize to measure each mine's operating performance. We have recently started reporting AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce which we use as a measure of our mines' net cash flow after costs for exploration, pre-development, reclamation, and sustaining capital. This is similar to the Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce non-GAAP measure we report, but also includes on-site exploration, reclamation, and sustaining capital costs. Current GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain silver and gold production. Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce also allow us to benchmark the performance of each of our mines versus those of our competitors. As a primary silver and gold mining company, we also use these statistics on an aggregate basis. We aggregate the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian mines to compare our performance with that of other primary silver mining companies and aggregate the Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations units to compare our performance with that of other primary gold mining companies. Similarly, these statistics are useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as they provide a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and operating characteristics.

Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and AISC, Before By-product Credits include all direct and indirect operating cash costs related directly to the physical activities of producing metals, including mining, processing and other plant costs, third-party refining expense, on-site general and administrative costs, royalties and mining production taxes. AISC, Before By-product Credits for each mine also includes on-site exploration, reclamation, and sustaining capital costs. AISC, Before By-product Credits for our consolidated silver properties also includes corporate costs for general and administrative expense, exploration and sustaining capital projects. By-product credits include revenues earned from all metals other than the primary metal produced at each unit. As depicted in the tables below, by-product credits comprise an essential element of our silver unit cost structure, distinguishing our silver operations due to the polymetallic nature of their orebodies.

In addition to the uses described above, Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce provide management and investors an indication of operating cash flow, after consideration of the average price, received from production. We also use these measurements for the comparative monitoring of performance of our mining operations period-to-period from a cash flow perspective.

The Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations sections below report Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce for the production of gold, their primary product, and by-product revenues earned from silver, which is a by-product at Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations. Only costs and ounces produced relating to units with the same primary product are combined to represent Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce. Thus, the gold produced at our Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations units is not included as a by-product credit when calculating Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce for the total of Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian, our combined silver properties. Similarly, the silver produced at our other three units is not included as a by-product credit when calculating the similar gold metrics for Casa Berardi.

Reconciliation of Net (Loss) Income Applicable to Common Shareholders (GAAP) to Adjusted Net (Loss) Income Applicable to Common Shareholders (non-GAAP)

This release refers to a non-GAAP measure of adjusted net (loss) income applicable to common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share, which are indicators of our performance. They exclude certain impacts which are of a nature which we believe are not reflective of our underlying performance. Management believes that adjusted net (loss) income per common share provides investors with the ability to better evaluate our underlying operating performance.

Reconciliation of Net Loss (GAAP) and Debt (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) and Net Debt (non-GAAP)

This release refers to the non-GAAP measures of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (""Adjusted EBITDA""), which is a measure of our operating performance, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months (or ""LTM adjusted EBITDA""), which is a measure of our ability to service our debt. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income (loss) before the following items: interest expense, income tax provision, depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense, exploration expense, pre-development expense, acquisition costs, interest and other income (expense), foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses on derivative contracts, unrealized gains on investments, provisions for environmental matters, stock-based compensation, and provisional price gains and losses. Net debt is calculated as total debt, which consists of the liability balances for our Senior Notes, capital leases, and other notes payable, less the total of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Reconciliation of Cash Provided by Operating Activities (GAAP) to Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP)

This release refers to a non-GAAP measure of free cash flow, calculated as cash provided by operating activities, less additions to properties, plants, equipment and mineral interests and a one-time item for settlement of an insurance policy for reclamation of the Troy Mine. Management believes that, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, free cash flow is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:

(1) The term “reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term “economically,” as used in the definition of reserve, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The term “legally,” as used in the definition of reserve, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Hecla must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a time frame consistent with Hecla’s current mine plans.

Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call

Feb. 21, 2018, 10:00 a.m. ET

Operator

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter in 2018 Hecla Mining Company's Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should need operating assistance at any time, please press * and then 0 on your touchtone telephone.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Westerlund, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.

Mike Westerlund -- Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you very much. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Hecla's Fourth Quarter and Yearend 2018 Financial and Operations Results Conference Call. Our Reserves and Resources news release issued last week and the Financial Results news release issued this morning before market open, along with today's presentation, are available on our website.

On today's call, we have Phil Baker, President and CEO; Lindsay Hall, Senior Vice President and CFO; Larry Radford, Senior Vice President, Operations; and Dean McDonald, Senior Vice President, Exploration.

More From The Motley Fool

Any forward-looking statements made today by the management team come under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and constitute forward-looking information under Canadian securities law, as shown on slide two. Such statements include projections and goals, which are likely to involve risks detailed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and in the forward-looking disclaimer included in the earnings and exploration releases and at the beginning of the presentation. These risks could cause results to differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

In addition, during this call, we may disclose non-GAAP financial measurements. You can find reconciliations of these measurements to the nearest GAAP measurements in the accompanying presentation, which is available on our website at www.hecla-mining.com.

Finally, in our filings with the SEC, we are only allowed to disclose mineral deposits that we can economically and legally extract or produce. Investors are cautioned about our use of terms such as measured, indicated, and inferred resources, which are not reserves, and we urge you to consider the disclosures that we make in our SEC filings.

I will now pass the call to Phil Baker.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Mike. Yeah, good morning, everyone. There's a couple of things I want to highlight for you this morning before turning the call over to the team for specifics. We're gonna start on slide three.

The first thing is that our best minds are getting even better. We set records for the highest level of silver, gold, and lead reserves in our history, and it was done with a drill bit, not through acquisitions. By the way, our zinc reserves would have also been a record, but fell 3,010 short. Realize these reserves were done with some of the lowest price assumptions for calculating reserves in the industry, and ours still went up significantly. And price assumptions matter. It means our least profitable ounces have more margin. So, when you consider reserves, remember that not all ounces are created equal. We have high margin ounces largely in Alaska and Quebec, great margins in great jurisdictions.

In addition, we also had the most measured and indicated resources in our history, as well as the most inferred. My expectation is for more reserve increases in the future. Particularly notable was Greens Creek, with about 15 to 20% increase in reserves of all metals, and an extension of the reserve mine life to around 2030. If you consider the reserves, the mine life could be five to 10 years longer. This mine produces about half our revenues, and over the last 10 years, a billion dollars of free cash flow. My expectation is that over the next couple of decades, it might produce maybe $2 billion of free cash flow. Greens Creek is a remarkable mine, but sometimes I think the market has just taken it for granted.

Also notable is Casa Berardi, which produces about 35% of our total revenues, adding about 400,000 gold ounces of gold reserves on surface with the new West Mine Crown Pillar Pit, a 28% increase in reserves. This pit is only slightly lower-grade than our highest-grade pit, and I suspect it will get bigger as we do the work to steepen the pit walls and do more definition drilling.

Story continues

Greens Creek and Casa together generated about 85% of our revenue, all of our free cash flow, and are getting better and longer-lived. They're also the model at what we're trying to do at our three other operations -- San Sebastian, Lucky Friday, and Nevada. I just came back from Nevada and want to share with you a few of my observations. It reminds me in many respects of where we were when we acquired Casa -- more questions than answers, lots of work that we have to prioritize, people that we have to determine their capabilities -- and like Casa, we've made significant progress. Much of it will not be visible to you in many statistics yet. But Larry's gonna talk to you about the progress we've made in development. It's been significant, but we are still trying different ways of dealing with different conditions in the mine. So, while we're in a hurry to get to a steady state, we will take the time necessary to figure out the challenges of these mines so our Nevada operations will never value for the long term.

Before I move on to the 2019 outlook, I want to point out the photo that's on the right side of that PowerPoint slide. It's from Sandvik's magazine called Solid Ground, in which Alain Grenier, GM of Casa Berardi Mine, and the rest of the Casa Berardi team is featured. The article centers on the successful operation of the two Sandvik 40-ton autonomous haul trucks, and it's on our website if you'd like to read it. By the way, there are also two other cover stories from 2018 that are on our website -- one from SME and the other from CIM.

So, go to slide four, where we provide our estimates of production costs, capital, exploration, and R&D for 2019. Greens Creek and San Sebastian have similar production profiles in 2019, as in 2018. We expect silver cash costs to be only $1.10 an ounce, and all-in costs less than $11.00. Casa Berardi production estimates are a little lower than last year due to lower grades, causing cost to be slightly higher. Estimated Nevada gold production is higher with a full-year of production and considerably lower costs. The gold side of the business is expected to have cash costs per ounce of $8.75, and all-in costs of $12.50.

We estimate $150 million for capital, which is similar to last year; about $25 million expiration expenditures, a reduction of $10 million. When you add it all up at today's prices, we expect Hecla to generate free cash.

So, I'm gonna pass the call over to Lindsay.

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide six, we reported a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $27 million, or $0.06 per share, with almost all the loss occurring during the last quarter; and an adjusted net loss of $0.11 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $212 million versus $232 million in 2017. Gold cash costs and all-in sustaining cash costs, both after by-product credits, came in at $871.00 and $1,226.00 per ounce respectively; while silver cash costs and all-in sustaining cash costs after by-product credits were $1.08 and $11.44 per ounce. We're happy with our costs at our operating units, other than Nevada operations, which we reported higher costs, while we worked through what we believe are transitional issues.

Slide seven shows our revenue streams that are nicely diversified, with gold at 53%, silver at 24%, zinc at 17%, and lead at 6%. Greens Creek again continues to be the dominant source of revenues, contributing 47% of our total revenues. We realize that it has a more silver/gold ratio, the revenue of the two metals would almost be equal.

Moving to slide eight, revenues for the year totaled $567 million, versus $578 million last year. We had record gold sales of 248,000 ounces at a slightly higher realized goal price this year, with our acquisitions of our Nevada operations effective July 23rd contributing toward that record, offsetting the reduced silver production and sales, primarily at San Sebastian, and lower silver prices realized this year.

Earnings from mine operations amounted to $79 million, which is $73 million lower than last year. This reduction is not surprising, as it is primarily due to completing open pit mining at our San Sebastian operation in 2017, and moving to an underground operation in 2018, where the grades are lower and the mining costs are higher. Lower other expenses, including taxes, offset lower operating profit, resulting in a net loss of $27 million, which was similar to that of 2017.

On a consolidated basis, we generated $94 million in cash from operating activities, and invested $137 million at our mine sites. Of that $137 million, $36 million was invested at our Nevada operations, and included approximately $14 million to complete a new Tailings dam and to upgrade the CIL circuit in the mill to improve recoveries. We have a goal of financial discipline in which each of our mines should produce free cash flow. And clearly, that didn't happen with our Nevada operations that we acquired effective July of last year. We expect in 2019, the Nevada mining operations will be cash flow positive, but we'll invest those cash flows and more in exploration around the various Nevada mine sites and the development of the Hatter Graben decline. As to the other mine sites, we have no major capital initiatives planned for 2019.

Moving to the balance sheet, at yearend, we had approximately $275 million in liquidity, which includes a $250 million line of credit which was undrawn at yearend, and $27 million in cash on hand. Our debt consists of $500 million in bonds, which are repayable in 2021, and $31 million owed to Ressources Quebec, also due in 2021. The bonds are callable at par on May 1st of this year. We continually monitor the capital markets, and while we're able to refinance the bonds today, it would be at rates higher than the current bond's existing rate of 6.875%.

We will continue to focus on turning our Nevada operations into a cash flow generator, building up expected cash balances and being patient about refinancing of our bonds. We have other methods available to us to reduce our total interest expense, such as using term bank debt, so if the high-yield market continues to be pricey for single-B debt issuers, then we may use these other methods in accommodation with new bonds being issued to reduce future interest expense payments. Also, I'd point out, in the back of our release, our calculated net debt to last 12 months' EBITDA was 2.4, which would typically be representative of a higher credit rating than we currently are assigned.

So, in summary, we had a good 2018 and are very excited about the potential for 2019 and beyond. But now I'll pass it on to Larry to talk about the operations.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Thanks, Lindsay, and good morning. To start with, I want to highlight that our all injury frequency rate for 2018 declined 28% companywide, as you can see on slide 10. This is a statistic that we are very proud of, and frankly, we'll work to reduce it again this year.

Also of note, Casa Berardi recently reached one million man hours without a lost time accident. This is an incredible improvement from 2013, the year that we acquired the mine. Our Lucky Friday supervisory staff is also to be commended, having operated the mine since the strike began without an injury.

I also want to highlight the good work done at Greens Creek on slide 11, which, as Phil notes, is our most important mine, that generates about half of our cash flow. With the big jump in reserves that we have recorded and the resulting three years or so of mine life addition, the team is working hard on a new technical report. With the revised mine plan reducing the development in the next few years, moving the highest margin material from the end of the mine life to the next few years, we should see a significant increase in the value of the mine.

Greens Creek, as can be seen on slide 12, had another strong year, producing over eight million ounce of silver at a cash cost after by-product credit $0.66 per silver ounce. Contributing to this performance was record throughput of 2,301 tons per day.

Moving on to Casa Berardi on slide 13, this mine just keeps performing better and better. The 157 ounces of gold produced was the highest since we acquired the operation. Fourth quarter production level was a bit lower than the previous quarter, in part due to the removal of the primary crusher and replacement with a higher-capacity crusher, which took about a week.

The record production is primarily due to throughput, as shown on slide 14. The mill operated at an average of 3,515 tons per day in the fourth quarter 2018, and 3,769 tons per day for the year. Casa milled 825 tons per day more than 2016, and almost 2,000 tons a day greater than when the mine was acquired. In 2018, open pit feed accounted for 46% of the mill feed. We have run the mill at over 4,000 tons per day on a spot basis. We continue to study increasing throughput even further.

Casa Berardi was our second-highest cash flow generator in 2018, and a technical report is also being put together for it, reflecting the significant increase in surface reserves in what could be the fifth surface pit, called the West Mine Crown Pillar Pit.

Let's move on to Nevada on slide 15, where most of our focus is this year. We have a plan to turn around the assets, and we are working that plan. In 2018, the focus was on getting the operation back on track in terms of understanding ground conditions at Fire Creek and getting the team organized. We have come a long way in this regard. Our strategy is simple: develop and drill. We believe that the grades can be improved through new discoveries and resource conversion, and/or production can be ramped up by opening up more working zones.

Fire Creek, we have done a review of equipment and are adding equipment from Midas and from buying some new equipment. We've added two trucks, two large loaders, one jumbo, two bulkers to the Nevada fleet for costing a total of about $6 million, with the expectation that the upgrade will increase productivity. The implementation of Shot Creek at the end of the development process is resulting in better ground conditions, as expected, which should minimize the need to go back in and rehab development repeatedly, as was the case under prior management.

The CIL plant upgrade is complete, and the mill is now able to process Hollister ore. We have exceeded our annual development target of 35 feet per day in January, as shown on slide 16, and the goal will be to maintain this level and increase it where possible, because this should open up additional headings and increase production.

We have wrapped up Fire Creek manpower for -- underground manpower for 76 to about 110 through transfer of Midas and Hollister miners. Our contractor has brought in a road header at Fire Creek, and it is easily cutting the soft cup material, which is helping to speed up development, and we are considering a wider application of this type of machine. We're planning to increase Fire Creek throughput midyear to about 520 tons per day from 340 tons per day, which was the fourth quarter average, which means that the goal production will be weighted toward the second half of the year. The increased development is an important step for Dean's group, as we have worked to do on definition drilling to upgrade resources, and exploration to discover additional resources.

At San Sebastian, on slide 17, we are now collecting the bulk sample of sulfide material, and we should have it run through a third party mill for testing by the end of the second quarter. We currently have oxide material to take us well into 2020, and Dean's group has a priority of finding more oxide ore.

I'll hand it over now to Dan.

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Thanks, Larry. Last week, we announced the highest levels of silver, gold, and lead reserves in 128-year history. Total gold reserves reached 2.85 million ounces, an increase of 26% from last year, mostly due to increases in open pits at Casa Berardi as a result of successful surface drilling. Silver reserves grew up 8% to 191 million ounces, primarily from Greens Creek, due to a combination of good drilling results, advanced resource modeling techniques, and improved smelter terms. The increase in resources is also important, because this suggests the potential for increasing reserves in the future.

We continued with aggressive drill programs in the fourth quarter, following successes at Casa Berardi, Nevada, Greens Creek, and San Sebastian. A list of drill intersections is provided in the Appendix B of the Exploration release on February 14th, giving insights into the high-grade resources we are confirming and expanding.

As you can see from slide 19, Hecla reserve price assumptions of 1,450 per silver ounce and 1,200 per bold ounce are some of the lowest commodity prices used in the industry, and have been for many years. On slide 20, you can see that over the past 11 years, we have consistently replaced or grown silver reserves from 130 to 191 million ounces, in addition to the 142 million ounces of cumulative production over that time. This means we have actually added a total of 200 million silver ounces in the past 11 years, with no contributions from acquisitions.

At Casa Berardi, we had considerable drilling success again along the main trends, particularly near surface. And this has resulted in the new West Mine Crown Pillar Pit, as shown on the left-hand of slide 21; and expanded East Mine Crown Pillar and principal pits with a total of 442,000 ounces of new gold reserves added during the year. There are now a series of pits along the Casa Berardi definition zone. Underground exploration was also successful. The red arrows show the projections of high-grade shoots that will be evaluated in the coming year, particularly in the East Mine, where access was reestablished last year. A closer look at the West Mine Crown Pillar Pit in the cross-section on slide 22 shows the convergence of several broad mineralized lenses near surface, providing the critical mass for a potentially very economic open pit, and the possible exploitation of zones with underground mining in the future.

At Greens Creek, there was significant growth in reserves. As shown on slide 23, definition and exploration drilling continued to add reserves higher in the mine at the East Ore and Upper Plate Zones. Lower in the mine, we were adding to reserves and resources along some existing trends in the Gallagher Deep 200 South and Lower Southwest Zones. Three drills will be operating underground all year in these areas, with the goal of defining additional reserves.

In 2018, very little exploration occurred on the Nevada projects until the Klondex acquisition was completed. It is evident that we urgently need to upgrade resources to move into the mine plans and identify new resources. Slide 24 shows how significantly we are accelerating our efforts for both underground and surface drilling, with more crews, more drills, more technology, and increased budgets in 2019. The upper diagram on the right shows the location of underground definition and exploration drilling at Fire Creek. Intense underground drilling is planned for Spirals 2, 3, 4, and 9, and the Titan Zone to upgrade resources that can lead to near-term reserves. Exploration of the Spiral 9 and North Zone provides the opportunity to extend some of the known mineralization trends. This drilling is planned to be in combination with surface drilling that will be initiated in April, and we'll evaluate the Zeus Guard Shack and South Notice targets.

Lower in the diagram on the right shows the drills at Hollister are working to define the mineralization trends in West Gloria, Central Hollister, and Guinevere for near-term mining. The development advancing to the east toward the Hatter Graben provides underground drill platforms for the drilling of targets in the East Clementine area and into the Hatter Graben late in the year. Surface drilling is planned to begin in April, with the goal of extending the Hatter Graben resource to the east.

At San Sebastian, as shown on slide 25, mining studies are being completed on the Professor East Francine veins and the polymetallic mineralization of the Francine vein. While at the same time, surface drilling is focused on defining new near surface oxide mineralization along the West Francine and Esperanza veins. Recently, we have successfully identified new oxide veins at the El Toro target, and are pushing hard to define a new oxide source with further drilling. The emphasis of exploration in 2019 is to rapidly advance our opportunities in Nevada, define new oxide mineralization at San Sebastian, and continue the drilling successes at Casa Berardi and Greens Creek.

And with that, I'll pass the call back to Phil.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Dean. We're gonna go ahead and just go straight to questions, Operator.

If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the # key. To limit background noise, we ask you to mute your line once your question has been stated.

And our first question comes from Cosmos Chiu from CIBC. Your line is now open.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Hi. Thanks, Phil, Lindsay, Larry, and Dean. Thanks for the call. If I may, my questions are mostly on Fire Creek here. I understand that Fire Creek and the entire sort of Nevada complex is still a work in progress. Certainly in 2018, a transitional year, there were some disappointments with the decrease of reserves beyond what was produced. I'm just trying to get a better understanding in terms of what has been the biggest surprise to you at these Nevada assets in terms of reserves, in terms of production, as you know, ownership has handed -- since ownership has been handed over to Hecla.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I'll start, and then I'll let Larry and Dean jump in. But I think the biggest surprise and disappointment was the Klondex didn't follow the budget that they had presented to us. And so, as a result, the amount of development that was done was significantly less than was supposed to be done. And so, as a result, it really has caused us to have to really focus and reestablish the mine. That's probably the biggest thing from my perspective. Larry?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Certainly operationally, the biggest challenge is getting the development caught up. Despite ground conditions, which are challenging, we are on an acceleration track. And Cosmos, for just a comment on the reserves -- and we hit them pretty hard. Clearly, there was mine depletion. There was no drilling in the first half of the year. And so, there really wasn't time to refine and identify new reserves. But the other thing, we knew that there was a challenge in reconciling the production grades with the mill. And so, we really relooked at the modeling. We narrowed the vein or the size of the vein within the models. And so, we actually -- and changed the capping or top cut. And consequently, that represented about half the reserve losses. We've been very conservative in our modeling in those -- of the existing resources and reserves.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, we want to make sure that we have a base to build from in terms of reserves, in terms of resources. The development we want to -- it's still a work in progress to figure out the development, hence why we're looking at a roadheader to go in and do the development in advance. So, we think there's a lot of different levers to pull before we will optimize this mine, and similar to what we saw at Casa Berardi.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. Of course. And Phil and Dean, it's great that you brought up the reserves and resources. Looking at it here, and you talked about Spirals 2, 3, 4, and 9, and a number of different zones -- Vonnie, Joyce, Karen, Honey, and others. I'm just trying to understand what of these new -- what of these zones that you've identified are considered -- categorized as, say, new zones, versus an extension of current mineralization? I think Dean sort of touched on that Spiral 9 looks like it could be an extension in terms of a drilling platform for current utilization. I'm just trying to get a better understanding and trying to gauge the difficulty in terms of adding to reserves and resources based on, are they new zones, or are they extensions, and whatnot.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I'll let Dean answer the question.

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Yeah. Well, Cosmos, it's really all of the above. They're clearly extensions to the existing -- you mentioned Vonnie and Joyce, the veins that have been key producers in the past. There are extensions to the north and south. In fact, there may be opportunities up dip. But as you go to the north in what's referred to as -- well, let me step back. So, for those zones, we know they're there. There's been some preliminary drilling to define them. And now, we're getting the development in place to drill them off. From an expiration point of view, particularly to the north, you have Spiral 9, you have the North Zone, that -- the North Zone's really a northern extension of the known veins. We're seeing in the Titan Zone a series of new veins there, and then in Spiral 9. Surface drilling to the northwest with Zeus, I think, are defining some new veins that certainly look encouraging. We're gonna need to drill them out. But I do see kind of near-term upgrading, expansion along trends, and then with Spiral 9, Zeus, and others, things that are gonna come in in the next few years.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. Great. And then maybe that leads into my next question here. In terms of timing, when would you be ready to potentially put out a reserve resource update? Again, there are -- and do you have some market concerns in terms of the low ounces on current reserves at this point in time? I guess understanding that, Nevada's still a work in progress, and all the other issues that we had talked about in the past, or just now. But I'm just wondering, when would you be ready to potentially put out a new reserve resource?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

We have not actually made a determination. Our typical schedule is yearend, and I'm not envisioning that we're planning to change that. Or any . . .

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Yeah. At this point, Cosmos, I'd say we'd stay with our traditional schedule. But depending on what transpires, that may change.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. And maybe one last question on Fire Creek here. We've been given the production guidance for 2019 for Nevada as a whole, as a complex. But I'm just wondering how much of the 69,000 ounces in reserves for Fire Creek have you sort of incorporated into that 2019 guidance? Have you incorporated any of the beyond reserves into that guidance?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, the answer's yes. Some of this would be beyond reserves. As far as what that percentage is, I couldn't tell you. But it's -- does anybody know?

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

I don't know the exact number on that one.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Okay. But there's some. But a lot of it, the bulk of it, I guess, would be based on reserves.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Well, it is a combination. I mean, we -- and this was part of the calculus we did in acquiring this, is that you have to convert inferred into reserves. And frankly, what happens is gonna be similar to what we've seen at other mines, where we are producing mineralization that maybe doesn't even make a category. And we certainly see that Greens Creek a lot. We don't see any -- that this would be any different than that.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Yeah. Great. And sorry, I lied. Maybe one last question on Fire Creek here. You talk about increasing the under mine, underground throughput from, I think, 350 tons per day to 520 by mid-2019. Is that as simple as, as Larry said, getting ahead on development, getting your 1,200 feet per month in place. Is that really the bottleneck?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

It's a key -- the key to expanding throughput is in expanding development, without a doubt. Obviously, we need to also drill ahead of ourselves, get our definition drilling in place, confirm the scopes before we dive into them. All of that's driven by development.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. And you're happy with the 1,200 feet per month level, Dean, or Larry?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah. I mean, we've seeded it in January. We're a little bit behind in February, only because we're driving raises right now, so we're doing less capital lateral footage. But we see the sustain on plan. It was a matter of injecting more miners and more machines, and that's on track. And now, we actually have some opportunity to improve our actual cycle at the face. That's the next challenge that we will take on.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And I just wanted to just make sure that people understand, you're still trying new things, and you don't have a standard development plan yet for the cycle yet. You're still working through that.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah. We're still working through that. We're still doing conventional drill and blast, which are typically very short rounds, at Fire Creek, in the ground, since . . . So, we have to have a lot of headings, shootings, and short blasts. And so, there's opportunity there. The roadheader, the first trial, was very successful. It kept the material very well. It left behind a very solid back and rib. And so, we're just -- we're learning as we go. We're injecting -- we have our VP Tech Services onsite pretty much all the time now. We've taken Lucky Friday expertise down, and we're making the improvements that we should be.

Cosmos Chiu -- CIBC -- Analyst

Mm-hmm. Great. Thank you. That's all I have. Thanks a lot.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Cosmos.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Fields from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Hey, guys. So, back since you've issued the bonds in 2013, in your EBITDA reconciliation, you've added back or taken away, as is the case, the gains or losses unrealized on derivative contracts. So, for the first nine months to today, that was basically a $40 million hit in your EBITDA, because you've gained that in your income statement, but all of a sudden, for the fourth quarter, most of that's gone away. So, it looks like you only take away about $8 million instead of $40. So, it looks like you're inflating your EBITDA by about $32 million. Can you help me understand why that's not the case?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, the first thing I'd say is that the derivatives contracts that we had, we closed out in the third quarter and generated $35 million, $32 million of cash from those contracts. So, we have not -- when the price of zinc and lead fell, and we were able to generate that cash. And so, we were monetizing that hedge. So, we've done that. Now, prices have come back up for zinc and lead, and so, we're putting new positions in place. So, to the extent that prices continue to rise, we'll have that -- that number will grow as we put in more contracts, and to the extent those go underwater. But Lindsay, anything to add to that?

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, Matthew, maybe you're saying we're detected $40 million and arriving at adjusted net income. We take that gain out. Then we include it in our EBITDA calculation. That's still alluded to, the cash we received on the closing of the hedges. It's much the same -- we were kind of following covenants, which allowed it, so.

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Right, but the first nine months of 2018, basically you add back -- you take away $40 million, and then all of a sudden, that disappears in the full year. I'm just . . .

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

You're talking about income statement, or balance sheet, or cash flow? Pardon me?

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Income statement is, for the first nine months, you've gained $40 million on derivatives. That shows up in the full year income statement as well.

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Not much happened in the fourth quarter, Matthew.

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Right, agreed. And the EBITDA reconciliation, when you look at you know your third quarter release, that entire $40 million from the income statement was taken away, but now all of a sudden, on the fourth quarter report, only $8 million is taken away.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I think what you're saying, maybe in the third quarter, we didn't add back the cash gains on the cashed out hedges, right? Is that what you're alluding to? We'll look back in and check that, but.

Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Yeah, but if I look at your cash flow statement, it looks like you've only gained modified $15 million. So, there's a lot of -- there's some screwy numbers going on, and just, maybe we can take this offline, because you reported $156 million of EBITDA for the first nine months, $28 million in the fourth quarter, and somehow, that's supposed add up to $211 million. Happy to take this offline.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, let's take it offline. I might argue, they're not screwy numbers. They're just accounting and cash flows being mixed, so. We'll deal with it.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Okay. Any other question, Matthew?

Operator

Thank you. Your next question comes from Heiko Ihle from H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure thing, Heiko.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

Great. I promised myself I wouldn't ask a Casa Berardi question this time for once. So, going over to Nevada, you mentioned the asset should be cash flow positive this year. Are you willing to quantify this just a little bit more, especially given that your all-in sustaining cost estimate there is $1,325.00 an ounce?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

No, what we've said is that the operations will be cash flow positive with the exception of the exploration and the development for the Hatter Graben. So, when you look at -- so, basically we're saying that we're right at positive cash flow from Nevada, and if you look at the all-in sustaining cost, you see that.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then, the decline is about 15% complete, so there's still bunch of work to do, obviously. Speaking of --

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, we'll do 5,000 feet of development at Hatter Graben.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

And speaking of Nevada and following up from the question that Cosmos had asked, I mean, you mentioned the increase in the throughput at Fire Creek from 350 tons per day to 520 tons per day by 2019. You also mentioned that your focus on -- and this is from your lease -- maintaining the development grade and all ground conditions. Am I reading something into here that's not there? Is there something I'm missing? I thought the ground conditions have been in that mine, as the ground conditions at Fire Creek are actually pretty solid. Is there -- are there pockets that need extra ground support? Or again, am I missing something there?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Well, you'll remember, when we first bought it, we talked about fact that we had this tuft that created road conditions that we had to come in with the synthetic liner and build a road base. Well, that's -- so, we dealt with the road conditions, but you have that same condition on the back and on the ribs. And so, that's what Larry is alluding to with the shot creating that we've had to do, and that's why we're contemplating the roadheader going through this soft material. Larry?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, it's variable. You can see very good ground conditions for -- we'll get 24 feet a day on a given head-in. And then, at times, we run into altered tufts and very clay-like material that takes short rounds and requires a fair amount of support. And the additional shot treatment. So, it's variable.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And then you also have the introduction of water into this tuft, which again -- and if you think about it, if you look at those pictures of the road, you get a sense of how soupy it becomes and difficult to operate in. And so, we're trying to figure out the best way to deal with the changing ground conditions. And so, that's why I have continued to make a point that we're experimenting, we're trying new things. I'm more interested in Larry coming to a series of standards, depending on the ground conditions, rather than just being so worried about getting the development. But, Larry.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah. You mentioned water, there's water in certain pockets, and we're looking at a bit more of a mobile dewatering plan so that we're not managing the water underground. So, yeah, we've shown -- as Phil alluded, we've shown photos of some of the poor conditions and what we're doing to manage them. We've got the right team there. I mentioned the roadheader -- it's actually a very small roadheader that we're trialing right now. And if it continues to perform as well as it seems to be, we may go all in for a large roadheader, I mean, a really large roadheader, and really jack up the advancement.

Heiko Ihle -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst

Very helpful. Thank you, guys.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Okay, thanks, Heiko.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony Sorrentino from Sorrentino Metals. Your line is now open.

Anthony Sorrentino -- Sorrentino Metals -- Analyst

Good morning, everyone.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Nice to talk to you.

Anthony Sorrentino -- Sorrentino Metals -- Analyst

Yeah, same here. You're estimating 2019 capital expenditures at $150 million and 2019 exploration expenditures at $25 million. Would you break those down by property?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Does someone have it handy, or . . .

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Well, I'll talk about the exploration. So, you know that $25 million, Anthony, the -- half of it will be in Nevada, and the remainder will be split between Casa Berardi, San Sebastian, and Greens Creek. There'll be very little exploration outside of those four areas.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And Casa Berardi in Mexico were roughly $3 million apiece.

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, Casa's $3.6 million. San Sebastian's . . .

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And then as far as the capital goes, it's that $12 million for the Lucky Friday, about $50 million each for Greens Creek and Nevada, and then about $40 million for Casa Berardi.

Anthony Sorrentino -- Sorrentino Metals -- Analyst

Okay. Very good. Thank you for answering my questions.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure thing.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ajay Lele from Southpaw. Your line is now open.

Ajay Lele -- Southpaw -- Analyst

Hello? Can you hear me?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

We can.

Ajay Lele -- Southpaw -- Analyst

Great. I just wanted to ask about the Casa Berardi medium-term cost outlook as you move from underground what looks like into more of an open pit mine plan for your recent reserve announcement? Thank you.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, there's really no change in the percentage of surface and underground planned any time soon. We'll have a number of years of the underground based on the current reserve, and we're adding to reserves periodically. So, those will not change. It's still roughly 50-50, and the grade of the underground's about twice the grade of the open pit -- maybe a little more, not much. The new stuff that we've added from the West Mine is a bit higher-grade than the surface average. So, all in all, our expectation is to sort of maintain the cost structure that you see as we develop both the underground and the surface.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Can I add to that?

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure, please.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

So, all of that's premised on a permit limit of 1.4 million tons, metric tons per year, and we are going to apply for an addition to that. Should we successfully raise the permitted limit and make some adjustments in the mill, then we could increase the amount of open pit feed going into the mill.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, that's right. And that would be increased to how much?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Well, we're applying for $1.6 million.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So, $0.2 million more?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah.

Ajay Lele -- Southpaw -- Analyst

Thanks.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. And our next question comes from Trevor Turnbull from Scotiabank. Your line is now open.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Yeah, hi. I just had one quick question, a very simple question with respect to Nevada. Is there any chance you're gonna have a site visit this year? It might make it simpler to understand some of the stuff that's been discussed on the call so far.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I'm sure we'll have one this year. We haven't made any specific plans at the moment. I want Larry and his team to have the opportunity to get their SOPs for the development in the different conditions resolved before we start bringing people onto the site. So, while we're still in this learning phase, it's probably better to wait.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Okay. My other questions were really more for Larry with respect to Greens Creek -- Larry and Dean. I guess the first thing, you've got some exploration and potential reserve additions coming at Greens. Can you give us a sense, Dean, what that's going to look like in terms of the reserve grade you've got there at Greens Creek? I think you're on the order of, what, 400 grams silver now? Are these areas likely to be consistent with that and kind of maintain a similar level of silver?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, Trevor, so, last year, and I think I announced this per ton, but last year, our reserves were 11.8, and we're at 11.5 this year. My expectation is that you're gonna see that 11.5 to 12 with potential resources converting to reserves. We are exploring upper plate. It's narrower, but very high grade. The same is true for East ore. And both of those areas are higher up in the mine. And Deep 200 South is, overall, more precious metal rich, so that you will see, with a couple of these areas, higher-grade precious metals than the reserve grade and slightly lower base metals, but that's gonna fluctuate. Overall, I don't see huge changes in the grade, the reserve grade overall.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

So, maybe a better way to think about it, really, given all the base metals, is that NSR is unlikely to change a whole lot in terms of the value per ton of the stuff you're looking at versus what you've already got.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, I think that's a good comment.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

So, I guess what I'm also wondering is, you talked about, certainly on the slide and in the presentation, looking to move some high-grade material forward in the mine plan, and it feels like you've been just kind of a little ahead of reserve grade recently. Are you looking to kind of still kind of maintain that, or are you looking for a pretty significant bump in the grade you're moving forward? And I guess my question really is trying to get at are you gonna kind of be above the reserve grade in aggregate there for a few years, and then kind of to what degree, such that I kind of understand to what degree it might -- sorry, it might dip below reserve grade going forward?

Lindsay Hall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Over the next sort of four years, 2020 through 2023, the reserve grades will be -- or production grades will be higher than what it has been. I don't off the top of my head have -- I can't remember what that will be. But as a result, we'll have higher ounce production. Larry, generally speaking -- and we'll have the -- in the 43101, you'll be able to see that. But generally speaking, Dean?

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Yeah, and next year. This will not match the technical report exactly because this is more of an internal . . .

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

This includes inferred and everything.

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

Yeah, this is not gonna match the technical report, but it'll give you kind of an idea of where we'll be. We should be, next year, in the 12.5 ounce per ton silver.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So, call it an ounce better in the next few years.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Yeah, a healthy 10% or so better than where it's been. And then, Larry, I guess also just referring to that slide 11 in the deck. You show the old design with a ramp. It looks like you've been able to get away without having to put in that ramp, which is obviously a huge savings, and you've gone to this -- what looks to be a much more simplified design. I'm just curious, it looks almost too good to be true that you could get rid of all that development and do what you need to do using existing workings. Can you just explain a little bit about how that came to pass, that you could eliminate all that development and still achieve what you needed to?

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

The graphic that we included is just one example. This is the East Ore in the very high end of the mine, where we anticipate when we published our report, that there'll be 15,000 fewer development feed. And a part of it is coming from this section we're showing in the graph, but not all of it. Some of it's just a good rethink of how we're accessing what are complicated ore bodies; these things are geometrically complex. And the more we can come off of the existing access, as we have in this example, the less development we're gonna do. So, 15,000 feet capitalize-wise is no small amount of money. It's actually its quite significant.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

But to the point, I think some of this has come as a result of being able to take more data and build a clear picture of where these ore bodies are. I think that -- I don't mean to give an advertisement for Leap Frog, but I think it's been very, very helpful. Dean, you . . .

Dean McDonald -- Senior Vice President, Exploration

As you know, the geometry of the ore bodies at Greens Creek are challenging, particularly when you're trying to model. Using Leap Frog primarily, we've been able to create wireframe models of the ore bodies that incorporate not only the drilling, but all the underground sampling, and really been able to develop, I think, a lot more realistic 3D model. And I think that's contributing as well to mine planning and optimizations, is that historically, Greens Creek's had a lot of mining ore zones outside of the modeling, which of course causes adjustments and time delays. I think we're doing a much better job of recreating that geometry in our models now.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

And so, as a result of that, you know where to put the development, and we can be much more efficient with what we're -- how we're designing it. That Larry has.

Larry Radford -- Senior Vice President, Operations

Yeah, just the last thought is that the prior mine plan, we had 15 foot high cuts and they were horizontal cuts. And so, as we designed them, we -- as soon as you got toward the fringes, and it no longer paid. You just cut off the scope. We've now adjusted our centerlines more to the actual geometry of the ore bodies. And it's made for, well, more ore and more efficient development.

Trevor Turnbull -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Yeah. No, it sounds like it's been a positive result all the way around. That's great. Thanks, guys.

Phil Baker -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Trevor.

Operator

Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I will now like to turn the call back to Mr. Phil Baker for any further remarks.

sum-up of the wedding vibe: A cozy backyard dance party wedding at our favorite neighborhood restaurant.

Planned Budget: $10,000 (CAD)

Actual Budget: $9,500 (CAD)

Number of Guests: 45

Location: Windsor, Ontario, Canada

Where we allocated the most funds:

Our priorities for the wedding were good food, good music, good dancing, and good company, so our budget followed that model. The most funds went to the cost of our dinner, which we knew would be excellent because our venue is our favorite local restaurant. We were able to sit down with Josh, the chef and owner, and chat with him about our dietary restrictions and the atmosphere we wanted for the wedding, and he came up with an amazing meal for us. We also invested in our photography, and we are so glad we did because Sarah was great to work with and we love our photos. A large portion also went on rentals. We used the restaurant itself for the dinner, but our ceremony, cocktail hour, and dance party were all outdoors in the backyard. Given that the wedding was in October, we had no idea what the weather would do, so we made sure to rent a big tent, a dance floor, and a heater just in case. (It poured with rain, so we were grateful for the tent. It was also strangely very warm for October, so we didn’t need the heater. Nevertheless, we were glad to be prepared).

Related Post Is There A Better Way To Do A First Look?

Where we allocated the least funds:

We didn’t put a lot of money into flowers. We didn’t have a wedding party, so we only needed one bouquet and a handful of boutonnières for family. We also didn’t buy arrangements for the tables because Oliver’s mother and one of her friends bought cut flowers and greens from our florist and did a lovely job arranging them for us. We also decorated with seasonal items like pumpkins, which added to the (Canadian) Thanksgiving weekend coziness but without adding a lot of cost. We were lucky enough to be gifted our wine, which Kate’s parents made (and Kate designed the labels), as well as our beer, which was a custom brew by Oliver’s brother Jeremy (who is a German-certified brewmaster) in conjunction with local brewery Chapter II. Our friend Ivy, who is an incredible artist, designer, and illustrator, also generously designed and made our invitations, our friend Keenan, a talented chef, made us a beautiful and delicious cake as a gift, and our friend Dana gifted us her artistic skills on our chalk signs. We were able to do the graphic design for the seating chart, table numbers, and other printed signage ourselves.

What was totally worth it:

The day went by so quickly, and we couldn’t be everywhere at once, so receiving our photos and being able to go through them and experience the day all over again at a more relaxed pace was absolutely wonderful. Sarah, our photographer, has an amazing way of putting people at ease, even those people who don’t usually like being in photos. We were so completely overwhelmed not only at how well the photos turned out, but also by her kindness and the amount of care she puts into her work. We loved working with her so much on our wedding and our engagement photos, and she has become a friend. Our day-of coordinator, Grace, was also incredible. Any time there was a potential problem, she solved it immediately without letting the stress of it even reach us. She is incredibly organized, patient, and great at getting things done right, so she was perfect. She had no problem running around in the rain and getting muddy setting up our venue, which is worth noting! And, of course, she’s a friend too (there’s a pattern here I think!).

What was totally not worth it:

Honestly, not much. The only thing we didn’t end up needing was the heater for the tent because it was unseasonably warm. It was really cold the day before, however, so we were glad to be prepared for whatever weather came our way. We knew we had a small budget throughout the whole process, so we eliminated pretty much all of the expenses that wouldn’t be worth it. For example, we knew we wanted to do a donation to a charity instead of wedding favors. Because our black cat Winn is such a big part of our lives (yes, we took wedding photos with him, and the portrait our friend Ivy drew of him was hanging at the reception), we decided to donate to the Windsor Essex Humane Society (where we adopted him) instead of doing traditional favors.

A few things that helped us along the way:

Taking eighteen months to plan the wedding from engagement to wedding day was a great decision because it allowed us to take our time, book things well in advance, and keep our budget and priorities straight without too much stress (plus, we got the October wedding Kate wanted). Also, working on it together and not letting one person take on too much work made the process a lot easier and more balanced. We were also lucky to have family who we could ask favors and bounce ideas off, including Kate’s brother and sister-in-law who live nearby. It meant we could sit on their porch when we got stressed or stuck on a decision and get some advice without even leaving the neighborhood.

My best practical advice for my planning self:

Remember that you can’t control everything. Kate is a very organized but anxious person, so when the wedding started approaching, it was hard for her to let go of little details. Giving in to the fact that there were inevitably things out of our control was important but difficult. Don’t be afraid to go against tradition if it does not align with your priorities. Also, don’t check the weather. Ever. The forecast changed about thirty-six times before our wedding day, and there was nothing we could do about it, so it was pointless to check and stress about. Yes, it was freezing the day before while we set up the tent. Yes, we were sweating in the heat the day of the wedding. Yes, there was a massive rain storm in the afternoon. We couldn’t control any of it, we were well-prepared (and Rino’s owner Josh saved the day with some hay for the backyard mud), and luckily the sky cleared up just when we needed it to for our photos, ceremony, and dance party.

Favorite thing about the wedding:

How it became, through design or serendipity, this amazing little neighborhood-focused event. We started counting how many of our vendors were based within a short walking distance of our venue (which is also in the neighborhood where we live), and it was most of them: photographer, DJ, both florists, hairdresser, baker… This really added to the cozy feeling of the wedding along with the fact that we are friends with a lot of our vendors. It made the atmosphere very relaxed and familiar. Some of our vendors even commented on how they felt included and how much they enjoyed knowing some of the guests and other vendors at the wedding. We also loved doing a first look and getting to share that moment together before our family photos. The build up of anticipation throughout the morning and afternoon was exciting, and we really enjoyed the experience of surprising one another. Oh, and our dance party was phenomenal.

Something else We’d Like to Share:

We loved that every part of our wedding felt like us. During our planning, it was suggested that we might be focusing on the little details too much, but it was the details that really made the day our own. We chose music that was meaningful to us for our ceremony musicians, we wrote our own secular ceremony to reflect our life together (with a focus on being equal partners and including some serious sappy stuff, but also a couple jokes), we made a dinner playlist with songs that had meaning to us and our guests (including some that we listened to with our families as children), we drew (Oliver) and designed (Kate) table number signs that told the story of different bicycles throughout our relationship (and a pair of roller skates because Kate is a roller-derby skater), and we prioritized the things that meant the most to us without worrying too much about tradition.

We kept it small to share it with our closest family and friends (we both have small families, so that made this easier). We were able to spend time with each and every guest, which was incredibly important to us. And, this was a huge priority for us, we had the most fun dance party I have ever experienced. Our dance floor was packed all night, Jamie, our DJ, was fabulous, and everyone had a really fun time. That’s about all we could ask, so we wouldn’t change a thing. Finally, our wedding hashtag #ourOKwedding got a few laughs. The running joke was that we were turning an OK (Oliver/Kate) romance into a more-than-OK wedding.",Our Cozy $9K Wedding In The Backyard Of Our Favorite Restaurant,Apracticalwedding.com,https://apracticalwedding.com/rinos-kitchen-wedding/
483,Empty,2019-02-21T15:02:14Z,"From its earliest honorees to the present, the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Subject doubles as a kind of history of the ever-changing medium.","Photo: Walt Disney Pictures

This story has been updated to include the recent Oscar winner “Bao.”

Though animation has been around since before the first Academy Awards, it wasn’t until the fifth Oscars ceremony, for films released between 1931–32, that the Academy created the Best Short Subject categories, including one for animation. At that point, every major studio had an animation wing producing cartoons for theaters, and these cartoons dominated the Oscars for almost the first 30 years. When the studios shuttered their animation departments in the early 1960s, independent and international filmmakers began to dominate category, a trend that reached its peak in the ’70s and ’80s. By the beginning of the 1990s, studios like Pixar, Aardman, and Blue Sky helped mainstream animation in the English-speaking world and brought a newfound legitimacy to the art form that had not been seen since the golden age of the ’40s and ’50s.

Hailing from more than 20 countries and encompassing almost every style, the 87 winners of the Best Animated Short Subject Oscar double as a microcosm of the history of world animation. Watching them also reveals that the definition of what constitutes animation has expanded from the colored cells of “Three Little Pigs” to the cutouts-on-acetate collage of “Frank Film.” What follows is an attempt to rank all 87 winners, from a recent dud to some timeless classics that help define the medium.

87. “Dear Basketball” (2017)

Every Oscar category has its Crash — the winner that makes you go, “What the hell were they thinking?” “Dear Basketball” is essentially a sappy, four-minute Nike commercial that had no business being nominated. Making matters worse, it gave accused sexual assaulter Kobe Bryant an Oscar at the first post-#MeToo ceremony. Although most nominees and winners are invited to join the Academy each year, Bryant was denied an invite due to his lack of a footprint in the industry, although the assault may have had something to do with it too.

86: “Logorama” (2009)

“Logorama” makes every building, person, and prop out of corporate logos. It’s cool to look at, but it makes its point after the first two minutes. The rest of it is an overblown action sequence with horrible dialogue and voice-over work.

85. “Sundae in New York” (1983)

In his 1983 essay “1,112 and Counting,” gay activist Larry Kramer accused then-New York mayor Ed Koch of allowing gay men to die of a disease that had recently been dubbed Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, writing that he had “not allow[ed] himself to be perceived by the non-gay world as visibly helping us.” (That Koch was less-than-forthcoming about his own sexuality adds another layer to the story.) That same year, Jimmy Picker made this astoundingly tone-deaf Claymation short wherein Koch (voiced by an impressionist) improvises his own version of Kander & Ebb’s hit song “New York, New York.” By the time he won his Oscar, at least 200 more gay men had died from AIDS-related illnesses.

84. “Knighty Knight Bugs” (1958)

The only Bugs Bunny cartoon to get an Oscar, “Knighty Knight Bugs” is the animated equivalent of Al Pacino winning for Scent of a Woman instead of Dog Day Afternoon. Its mediocrity is especially egregious given that most of Bugs’s greatest films — including “What’s Opera Doc?,” regarded by some as the greatest cartoon of all time — weren’t even nominated.

83. “The Little Orphan” (1948)

In this Tom and Jerry short, Jerry adopts a starving orphan named Nibbles and treats him to a Thanksgiving feast, while he and Tom enact Pilgrim-Indian fights. The only thing worse than this cartoon’s racial and historical insensitivity is that it’s not funny.

82. “Frank Film” (1973)

This autobiographical film presents an unfolding collage of magazine cutouts glued onto acetate cells, while animator Frank Mouris tells his life story over dueling audio channels. Although considered an animation landmark, it’s a headache-inducing experience that’s too overwhelming to watch more than once.

81. “A Greek Tragedy” (1986)

This cartoon about three maidens holding up a building is a situation stretched out to six minutes. That same year, Pixar got its first nomination for “Luxo Jr.,” which, at only three minutes, tells a satisfying story about two lamps with distinct personalities.

80. “The Two Mouseketeers” (1951)

Tom, Jerry, and Nibbles engage in swordplay in 18th-century France. This short features some good music, but it’s one of the weaker cartoons in the series.

79. “Milky Way” (1940)

Disney’s eight-year winning streak broke this year when none of their cartoons received a nomination. The winner, “Milky Way,” is an MGM cartoon about three kittens produced by Rudolf Ising and Hugh Harman, animators who bounced around from studio to studio during the golden age of animation. Many of their cartoons, like this one, are as vapid and cutesy as “The Happy Little Elves” cartoons from The Simpsons. But they deserve a place in history for creating the MGM and Warners animation studios, which released the other two shorts nominated in 1940: “Puss Gets the Boot,” the debut film of Tom and Jerry, and “A Wild Hare,” which introduced the world to a rabbit who casually asked a hunter, “What’s up, doc?”

78. “The Fly” (1980)

This short offers an insubstantial jaunt from a fly’s point of view as it flies around a house.

77. “Surogat” (a.k.a. “Ersatz,” a.k.a. “The Substitute”) (1961)

The first completely foreign-made cartoon to win, this is a Yugoslavian short in which every prop, background, and person is inflatable. There are some cool moments when the protagonist manipulates the animation and changes the scenery, but on the whole, it’s just weird for weirdness’s sake.

76. “Three Orphan Kittens” (1935)

This Silly Symphony features cute Disney kittens getting in trouble. Nothing makes it stand out from similar Disney cartoons, nor does anything act as testing ground for new camera techniques or styles, which the later Silly Symphonies became during the ’30s. And it gets docked points for the racial stereotypes.

75. “The Pink Phink” (1964)

This marked the cartoon debut of the Pink Panther, the animated character who first appeared in the main titles of Blake Edwards’s 1963 film of the same name. Like the Panther’s other cartoons, this one suffers from repeating one joke over and over — the Panther paints everything pink while his foil wants to paint everything blue. That said, it’s always worth it to hear Henry Mancini’s theme music.

74. “Lend a Paw” (1941)

Mickey Mouse’s only appearance on this list, “Lend a Paw” mostly focuses on Pluto, who debates between his inner angel and devil whether to save a small kitten. The film, with its message to help friends in need, heavily foreshadows a conflict to come: Two months after its release, the United States entered the Second World War and Disney converted his studio into a propaganda factory.

73. “Is It Always Right to Be Right?” (1970)

Orson Welles narrates a parable about a world divided because everybody feels the need to be right. The animation and the music are bad, but the story is a good reminder of how we can better ourselves with a little humility.

72. “Magoo’s Puddle Jumper” (1956)

UPA’s Stephen Bosustow produced all three of 1956’s nominees, guaranteeing him an Oscar that night. Here, Mr. Magoo gets a car that defies the laws of gravity and can drive underwater. It’s typical Magoo fare, combining jokes about nearsightedness with the beauty of UPA’s animation.

71. “Leisure” (1976)

A recounting of man’s pursuit of leisure from caveman days to the present, “Leisure” features a cool mixed-media approach but it’s not very engaging.

70. “Great” (1975)

If you were confused when Kenneth Branagh came out at the 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony looking like Abraham Lincoln, “Great” offers a musical biography about who he was actually playing: Isambard K. Brunel, the English equivalent of Thomas Edison. The songs are catchy, but it’s basically a Schoolhouse Rock video stretched to half an hour.

69. “The Tortoise and the Hare” (1934)

Max Hare, the star of this fairly standard retelling of the Aesop’s fable, has been cited by many as an inspiration for Bugs Bunny, who would turn this story on its head in “Tortoise Beats Hare.”

68. “The Country Cousin” (1936)

Another retelling of a fable, this time with the creatures who made the studio famous. It’s always weird watching Disney mice who look nothing like Mickey, so the animation takes some getting used to. The best part is the music, which alternates between country banjo and a Gershwin-like motif, to reflect the two characters.

67. “When Magoo Flew” (1954)

In 1949, UPA released a cartoon called “Ragtime Bear” which worried their distributor, Columbia Pictures, because bears were not popular characters. The film was a hit, not because of the bear, but because it was the debut of Mr. Magoo, a nearsighted old man who became UPA’s first breakout character. Magoo was one of the first human characters to have his own cartoon series, and it became a signature role for actor Jim Backus (who would later play millionaire Thurston Howell III on Gilligan’s Island). In this entry, Magoo mistakes an airplane for a movie theater and walks on top of it mid-flight. The jokes grow a little stale, but any UPA cartoon is worth watching for the animation, and the shots of Magoo’s silhouette walking on the plane are gorgeous.

66. “Winnie-the-Pooh and the Blustery Day” (1968)

The last of Walt Disney’s astonishing 26 Academy Awards came posthumously for the second of the studio’s three Winnie-the-Pooh cartoons. One of the final projects he green-lit, Disney chose to release these shorts one at a time to introduce the characters to American audiences — hard to believe, given how famous they have become. That said, the short reveals how the animation division was starting to go adrift without Walt’s presence, including recycling some old ideas. The Heffalumps and Woozles sequence is the best example of this, since it tries to copy the demented fantasia of Dumbo’s “Pink Elephants on Parade” number but fails to equal it. The best element of the cartoon is the voice acting, a reminder that several of the actors voiced these characters for more than 30 years.

65. “Yankee Doodle Mouse” (1943)

Tom and Jerry go at it, WWII style. Sticks of dynamite are tossed back and forth, Jerry uses a brassiere as a parachute, and the score offers an enjoyable mix of patriotic anthems.

64. “Father and Daughter” (2000)

Of the three nominees for 2000, “Father and Daughter” got all the accolades, and it’s easy to see why: It tugs at the heartstrings with a simple story of a little girl who spends her life waiting for her father to return after he abandons her. The second nominee was similarly bleak, an adaptation of Daniel Defoe’s Journal of the Plague Year called “The Periwig Maker.” The third nominee, however, was Don Hertzfeldt’s “Rejected,” which went on to spawn countless internet memes and ridiculous catchphrases like “I am the queen of France!” As film fans know, the Oscars don’t necessarily predict which films will last.

63. “Manipulation” (1991)

The gags are funny and the special effects impressive in this short in which a cartoon man struggles to escape the sketchpad his animator has confined him to. Unfortunately, it can’t help but pale in comparison to the classic Looney Tunes cartoon “Duck Amuck,” which is The Godfather of fourth-wall-breaking, drawing-versus-animator cartoons.

62. “Flowers and Trees” (1931–32)

The first cartoon ever to win depicts a love triangle between two slender trees and an evil stump who starts a forest fire out of revenge. It features the usual dancing reeds, birds, and trees that appear in Disney’s early Silly Symphonies, and the animation is coarse compared to later Disney efforts. What makes “Flowers and Trees” a landmark, however, is that it is the first cartoon — and technically, the first film — ever produced in three-color Technicolor, the process that would later be used for Gone With the Wind, The Wizard of Oz, and many other films. As always, Disney knew what the audiences wanted before they did.

61. “Piper” (2016)

Pixar has just about owned the Best Animated Feature category since it was first introduced in 2001, but for the next 15 years they went home empty-handed for their shorts. “Piper,” about a cute young sandpiper overcoming her fear of the water, broke that losing streak, but it’s not one of their best. Still, it’s worth watching for the beautiful animation of the birds.

60. “A Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature” (1966)

John Hubley’s Storyboard Studios won its third and final Oscar for this charming animated music video of two Herb Alpert songs: “Spanish Flea” and “Tijuana Taxi.” (More on Hubley and Storyboard below.)

59. “Ferdinand the Bull” (1938)

Nearly 70 years before Blue Sky’s feature about this good-natured bull, Disney made its own version. Although popular at the time of its release, it’s faded from the canon, probably because it never had follow-ups. The voice acting comes from Milt Kahl (one of Disney’s Nine Old Men) as Young Ferdinand, Jack Benny announcer Don Wilson serves the narrator, and Walt Disney himself plays Ferdinand’s Mother.

58. “Tin Toy” (1988)

When Steve Jobs acquired Pixar for their computers in 1986, he didn’t expect to make any money off its small animation division, and engineers wondered why the animators were even on the payroll at all given the company’s lack of revenue. In 1988, knowing they were on thin ice, John Lasseter and his team asked Jobs for $300,000 to make “Tin Toy,” a cartoon about a toy one-man-band named Tinny escaping the clutches of a toddler. Jobs agreed, and the film wowed audiences when it premiered, even though the animation hadn’t been completed. The next year, “Tin Toy” became the first computer-animated short to win the Oscar. The only reason this cartoon is not higher on the list is the animation — that baby is ugly, and in one shot where it falls over, it barely even touches the floor — but these problems are mostly due to the limitations of the technology. “Tin Toy” served its purpose, legitimizing computer animation as an art form, and convincing Jobs to keep funding the animation unit. In 1991, Lasseter wrote a treatment for a feature film about Tinny and a cowboy doll finding their way home. The title was Toy Story.

57. “The Crunch Bird” (1971)

56. “For the Birds” (2001)

At two minutes, “The Crunch Bird” is the shortest cartoon to win the Oscar, and “For the Birds” isn’t much longer. They’re both one-joke cartoons about birds, but they’re very funny jokes and they don’t overstay their welcome.

55. “Speedy Gonzales” (1955)

The official debut of everyone’s favorite Latino mouse, Speedy Gonzales brings cheese to the poor Mexican mice while getting the better of cheese factory guard Sylvester every time. In one absurd gag, he runs through Sylvester’s open mouth and exits through the back of his tail, the kind of gag that Warners directors like Tex Avery and Bob Clampett pioneered. While Speedy may strike some as a stereotype today, he has always been popular among Latinos, and a feature film where he will be voiced by comedian Eugenio Derbez is in development.

54. “It’s Tough to Be a Bird” (1969)

Ward Kimball became the only one of Disney’s Nine Old Men (his nickname for his nine favorite animators) to win an Oscar with this 20-minute history of birds, narrated by a bird drawn to resemble the great animator himself. Kimball, who drew most of the characters in Alice in Wonderland, was a master of zaniness, and he pulls out all the stops here. The film’s combination of animation and live action makes it the first mixed-media short to win, and it climaxes with a chaotic montage reminiscent of Terry Gilliam’s work on Monty Python — which, by sheer coincidence, premiered two months before “It’s Tough to Be a Bird” was released.

53. “The Box” (1967)

In a sweet cartoon about an old man with a mysterious box, the sparse setting, heavily percussive score, and final reveal add to the impact.

52. “Feast” (2014)

In a heartwarming story that becomes too sentimental in the final 30 seconds, a cute dog who loves eating unhealthy food reunites his owner with his girlfriend after she dumps him over his bad diet. But the dog is really cute.

51. “Mouse Trouble” (1944)

Tom gets a book of ways to trap mice and fails at all of them in a short that’s pretty much just a series of mishaps. But it also includes one of the best jokes in any Tom and Jerry cartoon, when a beaten-up Tom turns to the camera and says in a basso profundo voice, “Don’t you believe it!”

50. “Quiet, Please!” (1945)

“Quiet, Please!” does a great job at stacking the deck against Tom, who has to prevent Jerry from waking up Spike the dog. The best joke involves him catching lightbulbs Jerry tosses down before they can shatter on the floor, a joke that pays homage to W.C. Fields’s It’s a Gift, although the punch line is much more violent: Jerry plugs Tom’s tail into a socket and he lights up like a Christmas tree.

49. “La Maison en Petits Cubes” (“The House of Small Cubes”) (2008)

Japanese animation had never been recognized in this category until “La Maison en Petits Cubes,” the story of a fisherman in a flooded home who looks back on his life. The film takes on Proustian dimensions by using a smoking pipe as the catalyst for the old man’s memories, which come to life in beautiful drawings by animator Kunio Katō. When he got his Oscar, he brought down the house by ending his speech with “Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto!”

48. “Tango” (1982)

Except for the producers of La La Land, no one ever had a worse Oscar night than Zbigniew Rybczyński, the Polish director of “Tango” who spoke limited English. After silencing the orchestra who tried to play him and his translator off, he went outside to smoke a cigarette, Oscar still in hand, and left his ticket in the theater. When the security guard refused to let him back inside, he screamed, “American pig, I have Oscar!” and supposedly hit him, landing him in jail for the night. The film itself is a cool experiment where live-action characters repeat actions and movements in an impossibly large room, and more are added until it becomes like the stateroom in the Marx Brothers’ A Night at the Opera. You’ll want to watch it more than once to see how the characters overlap with each other.

47. “Mr. Hublot” (2013)

French steampunk artist Stephane Halleux provided the inspiration for “Mr. Hublot,” which brings his futuristic universe to life. The story is little more than your standard “man and dog friendship” tale, but the dog being a robot gives it a clever spin and the animation of the Blade Runner–like city looks spectacular.

46. “The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore” (2011)

Animator and children’s book author Bill Joyce co-directed this short about a man transported via tornado to a magical library with flying books. The animation reflects Joyce’s whimsical style, and there are some funny gags with the books, particularly when Lessmore has to perform surgery on one of them.

45. “The Lost Thing” (2010)

Narrated by songwriter Tim Minchin, “The Lost Thing” depicts a friendship between an awkward boy and a mysterious tentacled thing that looks like it wandered out of “Mr. Hublot.” It’s a touching story with a solid punch at the end, and the scene in the Department of Odds and Ends doubles as a nice homage to Terry Gilliam’s Brazil.

44. “A Close Shave” (1995)

Is there a single more expressive character in all of animation than Gromit, Wallace’s dog companion? With no mouth, he has to convey everything through his brow and his eyes, combining Chaplin’s warmth with Keaton’s deadpan. Here, he and Wallace uncover a plot to kidnap sheep and make them into pet food. As always, Gromit plays detective and action hero while the bumbling Wallace is just lucky to be along for the ride. The film also introduced audiences to Shaun the Sheep, who later got his own TV show and film series. The only trouble is that the half-hour running time works against the film, due largely to the overstuffed final action sequence where director Nick Park tries to top his efforts from the preceding Wallace and Gromit film. (More about that one later.)

43. “Johann Mouse” (1952)

In 1940, MGM animators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera teamed up a cat named Jasper and a mouse called Jinx in “Puss Gets the Boot,” but it didn’t leave much of a mark. A year later, they produced a follow-up film that redesigned the characters and renamed them Tom and Jerry. They became MGM’s breakout stars, and Hanna and Barbera would go on to make more than 100 cartoons with them, netting MGM 13 Oscar nominations and seven wins. The last was for “Johann Mouse,” wherein Tom and Jerry become a musical sensation in 1890s Vienna. There are some funny jokes involving Tom’s piano playing, and the music, performed by the MGM orchestra, is a reminder of how the old studios spared no expense on their cartoons. After MGM shuttered its animation unit in 1957, Hanna and Barbera set up their own company and went on to create The Flintstones, The Jetsons, Scooby-Doo, and dozens of other memorable TV cartoons. As with Disney, it all started with a mouse (and a cat).

42. “The Danish Poet” (2006)

Liv Ullmann narrates a touching story about how coincidence and chance shape one’s destiny, with a nice twist ending. She also plays all the characters, and her lilting tones help make this cartoon a lovely experience.

41. “Special Delivery” (1978)

A man’s refusal to clean the snow off his front porch leads to to the death of his mailman — and hilarity ensues. “Special Delivery” has just one purpose: to entertain, and it does so admirably.

40. “Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom” (1953)

Co-directed by “It’s Tough to Be a Bird” director Ward Kimball, “Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom” tells the history of music from cavemen to the present day. This entertaining cartoon was the first produced in Cinemascope, and its flat, stylized animation — which recalls UPA — is a radical departure from previous Disney films. Although the studio produced some inventive and entertaining short cartoons during the 1950s, by the end of that decade it had more or less given up on them, as the company moved into the black by diversifying into TV, live-action films, and theme parks.

39. “Quest” (1996)

This German student film depicts puppets traveling through various lands of sand, stone, and machinery to find the source of a mysterious dripping noise. The animation is extremely cool, especially in the backgrounds. The only trouble is the ending, which seems profound at first but feels a little too “student film” on second viewing.

38. “Closed Mondays” (1974)

Director Bob Gardner, the inventor of Claymation, spent 14 months with his filmmaking partner Will Vinton making this stop-motion film about a drunk who wanders into a museum after hours and finds the artwork coming to life: an abstract painting turns into a series of swirling musical notes; a slot machine with lips speaks abstract poetry; and a traditional painting of a scullery maid talks back to him. Unlike “The Critic” (to be discussed below), which scoffs at art, “Closed Mondays” speaks to its power to involve us through the emotions it conjures.

37. “Bao” (2018)

Domee Shi, a Chinese-Canadian immigrant, became the first woman to direct a Pixar short with “Bao.” She shared her Oscar with producer Becky Neiman-Cobb, making this the first animated short for which a female directing and producing team shared a prize. Shi based this heartwarming story of a mother who raises a dumpling from birth to adulthood on her own relationship with her overprotective mother. The use of food as a metaphor for parenting is specific to Chinese culture: Shi has said in interviews that Chinese parents substitute “Have you eaten yet?” for “I love you.” This specificity allows “Bao” to express universal truths about parents and children. Shortly before it premiered last summer, Pixar founder John Lasseter announced he would leave the company after he was outed for sexually harassing women and fostering a “boys club” mentality that kept female employees from rising through the ranks. Hopefully, “Bao” is a sign of things changing for the better, not just at Pixar, but throughout Hollywood itself.

36. “Paperman” (2012)

After dominating this category in its early years, Disney won its first Animated Short Oscar since “It’s Tough to Be a Bird” for “Paperman,” which is also the first (and so far only) black-and-white cartoon ever to win. The main character is an anonymous office clerk inspired by one spot of color — a woman’s red lipstick kiss on a piece of paper — to go after her, with papers piling up around him. The style and the lack of dialogue serve the story beautifully.

35. “Charade” (1984)

Have you ever played charades with your friends and gone nuts when they can’t guess what you’re miming? Charade takes this premise to a hilarious extreme, as the main character makes it obvious he’s miming titles like Jaws and Superman, but his friends’ guesses completely miss the mark. At the same time, one player becomes the first person in history to successfully mime The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Rotations, which the others get right away.

34. “Balance” (1989)

Like the best stop-motion films, “Balance” leaves viewers breathless, wondering how the animators did it. Set atop a floating platform in space, it depicts five identical men fishing for a rare device and causing the platform to tilt back and forth whenever they walk. It also inspired the finale of National Treasure: Book of Secrets.

33. “The Dot and the Line” (1965)

Chuck Jones won his only competitive Oscar for this adaptation of a book by Norton Juster about a male Line who seeks the love of a female Dot. The animation is unlike any of Jones’s Warners cartoons, echoing the work of abstract pioneer Oskar Fischinger, and the scenes where the Line morphs from two to three dimensions are beautifully done — all while Robert Morley provides humorous math puns in his dry voice.

32. “Crac!” (1981)

One of the greatest things about animation is the way it can imbue inanimate objects with emotions. In “Crac!” the protagonist is a rocking chair who begins his life when a French-Canadian farmer builds it from the wood of a tree. Over its life, it observes the farmer, his wife, and their family for generations. Like the opening montage of Up, the film collapses a century into a little less than 15 minutes, coming together harmoniously in the final moments, when the chair reflects on all it has seen in its final home, an art museum.

31. “The ChubbChubbs!” (2002)

Sony Animation won its first and (so far) only Oscar for this computer-animated sci-fi film about an alien janitor with dreams of being a karaoke singer who must face off with the menacing ChubbChubbs. The film is filled with inside jokes for sci-fi nerds, including cameos from Yoda, E.T., and Jar-Jar Binks — who dies in the opening two minutes. The twist at the end is great too.

30. “Moonbird” (1959)

UPA’s John Hubley was forced to go into TV commercials after he was blacklisted and thrown out of the company, but he found success producing the ad campaign for Maypo Oatmeal, which starred an animated child played by Hubley’s son Mark. Using the money from these ads, he and his wife Faith Hubley made “Moonbird,” a film based on a tape recording of Mark and his brother Ray playing together. Watching all these Oscar winners chronologically, “Moonbird” is a radical departure in style from any of the ones before it, going beyond the flatness of UPA to create characters based entirely on crudely drawn outlines. Its limitation is the fact that the two boys’ improvisation can’t help but lag at times, but it was a huge step forward for Hubley. A 1968 follow-up called “Windy Day” uses an improvisation by his two daughters, and is even better.

29: “A Christmas Carol” (1972)

This made-for-TV film of Charles Dickens’s most famous story was such a hit when it aired in 1971 that it received theatrical distribution the following year, allowing it to qualify for the Oscar (the rules were then changed to prevent this from happening again). It’s a quite effective adaptation, aided by Alistair Sim and Michael Hordern reprising their roles as Scrooge and Marley from the famous 1951 movie. Marley in particular is a standout — whenever he speaks, he just opens his mouth wide and unleashes the words with no lip movements. Bonus points for including the shriveled children representing Ignorance and Want, a powerful scene from the book cut from most adaptations. It’s only weakness is that at 25 minutes, it feels rushed, particularly when Scrooge changes his ways at the end.

28. “The Old Mill” (1937)

As production moved ahead on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Disney used his shorts to experiment with the technology he knew would make his first feature-length film stand out. The most famous of these is “The Old Mill,” the first animated cartoon to use the multiplane camera. This device placed a camera atop multiple planes of glass to provide a depth of field never before seen in animation. Just as he had embraced Technicolor before live-action filmmakers, Disney embraced deep-focus cinematography four years before Citizen Kane, making this short about animals weathering a bad storm look like it was shot by Kane cinematographer Gregg Toland, and the storm itself is one of the most suspenseful scenes in any cartoon.

27. “Tweetie Pie” (1947)

Director Friz Freleng threatened to quit Warner Bros. when producer Edward Selzer opposed his pairing of a bird named Tweety and a cat named Thomas (later renamed Sylvester), but “Tweetie Pie” would net Selzer and the Looney Tunes their first Oscar. The film showcases Freleng at his absolute best, with his virtuosic matching of action to music and absurdist gags. What made him a genius, however, was how he imbued his characters with moments of humanity amid the chaos, as when Sylvester throws his hammer on the ground after finishing a contraption. When asked why he included it, he just said, “Because it’s human.” Upon Selzer’s death, his Oscar was given to Freleng.

26. “Bob’s Birthday” (1994)

“Bob’s Birthday” introduced audiences to Bob and Margaret, the middle-aged British couple who got their own TV series in the late 1990s, and it’s the raunchiest cartoon to ever win. Bob, terrified of turning 40, comes home and rants about his fears to Margaret without realizing she’s planned a surprise party for him — and worse, that all the guests are listening from their hiding spots as he insults them and walks around with no pants on. The awkwardness of the situation and Bob’s callousness make this cartoon hard to watch, but there’s genuine tenderness between him and Margaret, and the conclusion, when she realizes it’s better just to be there for him, is touching.

25. “Bear Story” (2015)

Chilean director Gabriel Osorio made a haunting allegory of the Pinochet regime with this cartoon about a bear whose toy music box tells how he was kidnapped from his family and sold into the circus. The designs on the mechanical music box, and how they contrast with the bear’s world, are gorgeously rendered, and the story is a moving tale about the relationship between storytelling and trauma.

24. “Der Fuehrer’s Face” (1942)

Originally titled “Donald Duck in Nazi Land,” the most famous of Disney’s World War II cartoons depicts Donald Duck living under Hitler’s tyranny. His home, and most of the props, are shaped like swastikas, and he’s forced to work in a munitions factory where every time a photograph of the Fuehrer comes down the conveyor belt, he has to scream “Heil Hitler!” in his distinctive squawk. One of the rare Disney films that includes laugh-out-loud gags, it’s as entertaining today as it was 77 years ago, and features one of the most absurdist moments in Disney animation, when the shells come to life. The title song became a hit for Spike Jones and his band. (It loses points for insensitive drawings of the Japanese, however.)

23. “Birds Anonymous” (1957)

If there is a patron saint of cartoon voice-over it’s Mel Blanc, who, until his death in 1989, voiced almost all of the Looney Tunes characters. Here he plays Tweety, Sylvester, and a cat named Clarence who takes Sylvester to Birds Anonymous, AA for cats. His voices for Sylvester and Tweety are iconic, but it’s as Clarence that he really excels here, using a flat voice to give him the appearance of control even though he reverts to his old ways at the end. Blanc said this was his favorite cartoon, and, as with Freleng, after producer Edward Selzer’s death, Selzer’s Oscar was passed on to Blanc.

22. “Peter and the Wolf” (2007)

Literalizing Prokofiev’s famous piece, which is meant to live in the imagination of its listeners, is a tricky undertaking, but director Suzie Templeton’s approach in this half-hour film produces excellent results. Her adaptation makes several smart changes to the story by setting it in contemporary times, making the hunters into bullies who torment Peter, and establishing a dynamic between the title characters that leads to a satisfying and touching conclusion. The stop-motion animation seems to have influenced Wes Anderson’s Fantastic Mr. Fox and Isle of Dogs.

21. “For Scent-imental Reasons” (1949)

Edward Selzer, who once unironically barked to his animators, “I don’t see what laughter has to do with the making of animated cartoons!” told Chuck Jones that nobody would laugh at his amorous French skunk, Pepé Le Pew, but once again he was wrong. As in all his films, Pepé longs for Penelope Pussycat, whom he thinks is a skunk, but she wants nothing to do with him. This time, however, Penelope goes after him at the end, freaking him out. Bonus points for writer Michael Maltese’s hilarious faux-French dialogue.

20. “Munro” (1960)

“Munro” originated with a short story by Jules Feiffer, who turned 90 last month and has spent his career drawing cartoons, illustrating children’s books, and writing for stage and screen. The title character is a bratty 4-year-old boy who gets drafted into the army as punishment, but none of his superiors believe it because they’re convinced anyone who enlists must be motivated by the army’s “cause.” The savagery of the satire and the humor of the animation, modeled after Feiffer’s drawings, make this cartoon as funny as a Mark Twain story. Interestingly, this very American short was the first Oscar winner made outside the United States — the animation came from Gene Deitch’s studio in Prague, where he moved to receive financing and has lived for the past 60 years.

19. “Geri’s Game” (1997)

Most people were introduced to “Geri’s Game” when it played before A Bug’s Life in 1998, inaugurating Pixar’s tradition of showing one of their shorts before their features. It’s one of the studio’s funniest films, taking a simple concept — an old man playing chess with himself — and executing it perfectly. The best part is that the old man develops two distinct personae throughout the game — one needy and conniving, one cold and calculating — and their interactions make you think you’re watching two people instead of one. Geri cameos in Toy Story 2 as the repairman who sews Woody’s arm back on.

18. “Anna and Bella” (1985)

17. “Bunny” (1998)

“Anna and Bella” is a hand-drawn Danish short where two sisters look back on their lives and make peace over the heartbreaking way their friendship ended; “Bunny” is a battle between an elderly rabbit and a moth who won’t leave him alone. They’re tied here because they’re structurally quite similar: They begin as one thing and go someplace you don’t expect, leading to two of the most moving endings on this list. Tom Waits provides the soundtrack for “Bunny” and sings over the end credits.

16. “Every Child” (1979)

Producer Derek Lamb made “Every Child” in conjunction with UNICEF’s International Year of the Child campaign. The story of a baby passed from home to home could have been maudlin in the wrong hands, but Lamb brings humor to it to by having every voice, sound effect, and musical note performed by a male duo called Les Mimes Electriques. The short begins and ends with them in the recording studio, an image that acquires additional resonance when the child is finally adopted at the end by two old men.

15. “Harvie Krumpet” (2003)

Adam Elliot’s sympathy for the differently abled has always come through in his short films and his cult feature film Mary and Max. Like those, “Harvie Krumpet” combines a wry sense of humor with heartfelt drama to tell of a Polish émigré to Australia who never loses his optimism, despite the many setbacks that come his way. Funny without being ironic, and moving without being sentimental, Elliot never condescends to his characters or their situations. It’s the work of a true humanist.

14. “The Sand Castle” (1977)

Thin in story but rich in atmosphere, Co Hoedeman’s “The Sand Castle” depicts humanoid, serpentine creatures who rise from the sand, build a fortress, and watch it crumble as the winds sweep it away. The film is a haunting tribute to the impermanence of art, best summarized by Calvin and Hobbes creator Bill Watterson, who once drew a Michelangelo-inspired painting on the ceiling of his dorm knowing it would be erased by whoever lived there next year. “My fondest memories,” he said, “are [of] times like these, where things were done out of some inexplicable inner imperative, rather than because the work was demanded.”

13. “The Moon and the Son: An Imagined Conversation” (2005)

John Canemaker, an NYU professor and historian who has written authoritative books on animation, is the son of an Italian who spent five years in jail for (allegedly) burning down his hotel to collect the insurance money when John was a child. Ten years after his father’s death, he produced this “imagined conversation” between them with John Turturro as himself and Eli Wallach as the old man. Told through a collage of animation, live-action clips, and photographs, it tells a universal story about the necessary distance children must keep from their parents, and a father who, to paraphrase Philip Larkin, was “fucked up in [his] turn / By fools in old-style hats and coats.” It could have easily been a feature, especially with the stellar performances of Turturro and Wallach, but it’s a remarkable achievement at half an hour.

12. “Three Little Pigs” (1932–33)

Where to begin with the impact of the most popular cartoon short ever made? The fact that it was held over in theaters for months by popular demand? The legions of merchandise it spawned? The catchy hit song that inspired the title of one of the most famous American plays? Leave it to Chuck Jones, who said it was “the first time that anybody ever brought characters to life … who looked alike and acted differently.” This makes the short stand out from the standard Silly Symphonies because Fifer and Fiddler Pig are a fun-loving unit offset by their smart brother, Practical Pig. Separately, they get into trouble, but when they team up to outsmart the Big Bad Wolf, who dons a variety of unconvincing disguises to trap them (including a stereotypical Jewish peddler), they’re unstoppable. Bonus points for the morbid family photos in Practical Pig’s home of Uncle Earl (a football) and Father (sausage links.)

11. “Creature Comforts” (1990)

The short that launched a multiyear U.K. advertising campaign, Nick Park’s “Creature Comforts” takes street interviews with real English homeowners describing their living conditions, and puts them in the mouths of stop-motion animals. The juxtaposition of the human voices with the animals is hysterical, like the lion who speaks with a Brazilian accent about wanting more heat. Park’s ability to use eyes to convey emotions is unparalleled in stop-motion animation (see also, Gromit) and the deadpan, sullen looks he gives the animals only adds to the comedy.

10. “The Critic” (1963)

In 1962, Mel Brooks attended a screening of an abstract cartoon by animator Norman McLaren, where he heard an audience member mumbling sarcastic comments to himself. He then hired animator Ernest Pintoff to draw three minutes of abstract imagery, to which he recorded an improvised commentary as a 71-year-old audience member. As the images fly by, Brooks (then only 36) yells out things like, “It must be some kind of symbolism — I think it’s symbolic of junk!” and “Two dollars out the window, Murray!” At three minutes, it doesn’t overstay its welcome, but it’s also hard not to want more. Fortunately, we have more, in the landmark sketches, comedy routines, movies and musicals that Brooks has created throughout his 60-plus-year career in show business.

9. “Mona Lisa Descending a Staircase” (1992)

Joan Gratz’s film depicts the history of 20th-century art in seven minutes as famous paintings break apart and transform into each other, as when a Picasso of a nude girl in bed becomes Munch’s The Scream. By placing these and other works next to each other, Gratz reminds us how all artists influence one another, even when their work seems to have nothing in common. Even more astonishing is that the animation was achieved entirely through oil-based clay, which she spread on a vertical easel. The effects of her thumbprints molding the clay from frame to frame gives the paintings a living quality, similar to how King Kong’s fur appears to move in the 1933 film. It took Gratz eight years of planning and two and a half of filming, and you can see the effort.

8. “The Ugly Duckling” (1939)

In Danny Boyle’s Steve Jobs, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak asks Jobs, who can’t design or code, what it is he actually does. Jobs replies, “Musicians play the instruments — I play the orchestra.” The same could be said of Walt Disney. He wasn’t a great animator; he didn’t “invent” sound or color cartoons; and he wasn’t the first person to make an animated feature film. But he understood how to use technology to its full extent; he was an expert judge of talent; and he had an impeccable knowledge of dramatic storytelling. “The Ugly Duckling,” the final Silly Symphony cartoon, is a remake of a 1931 cartoon that sticks closer to the Hans Christian Andersen story. Unlike that one, which was played mostly for laughs, this adaptation features one of the saddest scenes in the Disney canon, when the rejected duckling takes solace by playing with the one creature who will not judge him — a duck decoy. Disney once said, “The primary purpose of any of the fine arts is to arouse a purely emotional reaction in the viewer.” That may not be true of all art, but it’s certainly true for much of his.

7. “The Hole” (1962)

John Hubley was never shy about his liberal politics, and fused them with animation in this powerful 1962 film where two construction workers, voiced by character actor George Matthews and jazz artist Dizzy Gillespie, debate whether accidents are caused by human failings or karmic coincidence. Released the same year as the Cuban Missile Crisis, the short foreshadows films like Fail-Safe and Dr. Strangelove, and given the context of the civil-rights movement, also resonates as a conversation between a complacent white man and a person of color who can hear dog whistles. Considering that all of it was improvised, it’s remarkable that Matthews and Gillespie’s dialogue becomes as profound as that of the two tramps in Waiting for Godot. It’s an eternally relevant parable about the dangers of not listening closely to the warning signs around us.

6. “The Old Man and the Sea” (1999)

Despite Russia’s history of animation, no Russian animator ever won an Oscar until Aleksandr Petrov made this 20-minute adaptation of Ernest Hemingway’s novel, producing what is possibly the finest screen adaptation of any of his books. He and his son spent two and a half years hand-painting 29,000 oil pastel frames on glass, shooting each of them with a special IMAX camera, and moving the paints with their hands in between shots. This style, reminiscent of the early-20th-century paintings of George Bellows, captures Hemingway’s masculine prose, particularly in the scene depicting the old man’s 24-hour arm-wrestling standoff where it looks like you can see the muscles tensing. It also captures his romanticism: The old man’s dreams of Africa are beautifully drawn, and Petrov departs from the novel by adding dream sequences where the protagonist swims and flies alongside his beloved fish. Denis L. Chartrand and Normand Roger provide the beautiful score.

5. “Ryan” (2004)

“We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are,” said Anaïs Nin. This quote cuts to the heart of “Ryan,” Chris Landreth’s documentary about Canadian animator Ryan Larkin, whose two short films, “Walking” and “Street Musique,” made him a rising star in ’70s animation. By the time they met in the early 2000s, Larkin had been living on the streets of Ottawa for more than 20 years, a victim of alcohol and drug addiction. Landreth worked for two and a half years on the film, recording interviews with Larkin and then working with a team of animators to depict the characters as oblong beings with holes in their bodies and faces that represent their psychological torment. When those wounds are touched on, spikes and colored lines emerge from their faces. What’s more, none of the people were drawn through motion-capture, an astonishing achievement given how realistic their movements are. Landreth’s film rescued Larkin from obscurity: Upon his death in 2007, he was working on his first animated film in more than 30 years, “Spare Change,” which was completed the following year by his collaborator Laurie Gordon.

4. “Gerald McBoing-Boing” (1950)

After leaving the Disney studios during the infamous 1941 strike, John Hubley, Steve Bosustow, and a group of young animators created United Productions of America, known as UPA. Although the studio produced work throughout much of the 1940s, they didn’t achieve mainstream recognition until they adapted the Dr. Seuss record “Gerald McBoing-Boing,” the story of a little boy who can only speak in sounds. Its success sent shock waves through the industry: Here was a radical departure from your typical animated cartoon, with no cute animals, no cartoon violence, and an intentionally unrealistic animation style. The film’s backgrounds flow seamlessly into each other (there are no walls), with locations changing only through props. Their color changes with the ups and downs of Gerald’s trajectory: When he’s happy, both he and the screen are bright yellow, but at his lowest point, dark blues and blacks dominate. The flat, limited animation allows for expressionistic camera angles, like the famous shot of Gerald walking up the stairs, inspired by Carol Reed’s The Fallen Idol. The short made UPA a force in the industry, and 70 years after its release, “Gerald McBoing-Boing” remains one of the most remarkable and influential cartoons ever produced.

3. “The Man Who Planted Trees” (1987)

Frédéric Back (who also directed “Crac!”) was a lifelong environmentalist who planted thousands of trees on his own property, which made him the perfect person to adapt Jean Giono’s short story, “The Man Who Planted Trees.” This powerful film tells of the friendship between a young man and a peasant farmer who has devoted his life to planting trees throughout his desolate homeland. Over 30 years and two World Wars, he remains undaunted in his mission to cultivate and nurture the French-Canadian countryside, astonishing government officials who never realize that all of this beauty comes from one man’s efforts. To achieve the film’s look, Back and his assistant, Lina Gagnon, sketched on matte acetate with colored pencils, adding in layers of shading as scenes blend from one to the other, using multiple exposures and no cuts. As in “Gerald McBoing-Boing,” the colors evolve with the trajectory of the landscape, from black, craggy lines to lush blues and greens. As an environmental parable, “The Man Who Planted Trees” never becomes preachy or bathetic; it’s a plaintive character study of a saint. Tolstoy would have loved it.

2. “The Cat Concerto” (1946)

Tom and Jerry’s finest outing has the duo at a piano recital where Tom, playing Liszt’s “Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2,” disturbs Jerry, who has made the piano his home. From there, they torment each other using every part of the instrument. Unlike many of their cartoons, this one is an even-handed battle: Tom gives just as good as he gets, and it’s funny to watch Jerry get smacked around over the keys. The jokes involving Tom’s fingers, especially when he attempts to play a tremolo while avoiding a mousetrap, will make any pianist sweat. Warner Bros. cartoons used the “Hungarian Rhapsody” numerous times — including in an uncannily similar cartoon called “Rhapsody Rabbit” with Bugs in the Tom role, that came out the same year. But with “The Cat Concerto,” MGM bested its rival, making this music inseparable from animation’s favorite cat and mouse team.

1. “The Wrong Trousers” (1993)

Nick Park’s follow-up to the first Wallace and Gromit film, 1989’s “A Grand Day Out,” is the best of the duo’s cartoons. “The Wrong Trousers” pits them against a villainous penguin, Feathers McGraw, who attempts to manipulate Wallace’s mechanical trousers to steal a rare jewel. Feathers’s dead-eyed, emotionless stare, combined with Gromit’s expressions, make for hysterical viewing as the penguin replaces him as Wallace’s companion. The gags come fast and furious, some of them subtle (Gromit reading “Pluto’s” Republic), some of them broad, as when Wallace goes on his first “walk” in the trousers and gets yanked all over the countryside.

If only for the hilarious gags and story, “The Wrong Trousers” would still be high on this list, but what puts it at the top is the two-minute climactic chase sequence where Wallace and Gromit go after Feathers on a mechanical train set that runs through their impossibly large home. David O. Russell studied it for the final action sequence in Three Kings, and Danny Boyle has called it “the best action sequence I’ve ever seen in a film.” It is truly one of the most remarkable scenes in all of animation: a triumph of editing, scoring, and sound design that proves animation can hold its own with live action.","Every Oscar Winner for Animated Short Subject, Ranked",Vulture.com,http://www.vulture.com/2019/02/every-oscar-winner-for-animated-short-subject-ranked.html

by Egon von Greyerz

Is a total collapse of the financial system next or will we see the globalists taking control of the world? Either way, the world is now at one of the most critical crossroads ever in history. Shakespeare expressed it eloquently in Julius Caesar:

There is a tide in the affairs of men.

Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;

Omitted, all the voyage of their life

Is bound in shallows and in miseries.

On such a full sea are we now afloat,

And we must take the current when it serves,

Or lose our ventures.

THE NOT SO BRIGHT FUTURE FOR THE WORLD

One of the brightest minds in finance, R.E. McMaster, has summarised the global situation as follows:

“The globalist New World Order could fall apart. First of all, all of the world’s governments today are socialist, a guarantee of failure.

Moreover, debt globally has reached a tipping point (by 2022 at the latest). (A root meaning of the word “debt” is “death”.)

Social Credit Red China could implode from all its excessive reckless debt and imperialistic over-extension.

The un-elected elitist EU is already coming part with Italy, France, the UK, Poland and Hungary in revolt.

The US Empire is self-destructing from military overstretch, bloated debt at all levels, and spoiled, childlike, take-offense-at-everything selfishness by identity groups and welfare recipients squabbling over the loot taken from productive citizens by the government, while billionaire oligarchic-run corporations pick them apart.

Plus, nearly all governments are equally destructive cultural Marxist.

Then there is the instability of the earth’s magnetic poles, its fast weakening magnetic field, the increasing numbers and intensity of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, plus solar instability, not to mention expensive and increasingly scarce energy.

The risk of an internet shutdown.

The risk of a population-exterminating epidemic (likely a virus, man-made), and the risk of a destructive global nuclear war.

Mankind today, at least the mad narcissistic sociopathic and psychopathic Luciferian rulers, seem to have a comprehensive death wish. …”

It is hard to argue against many of these projections. R.E. McMaster is a moderate person with an immaculate 50 year track record.

It is possible that the elite is working hard on their globalist agenda to assume control of the world. If they achieve what they have set out, life on earth will be extremely unpleasant to say the least. Also, there will be nowhere to escape.

A DISORDERLY RESET NEXT

But even the best plans can go badly wrong. The most likely spanner in the works for the elite will be a total collapse of the financial system. This would involve first a final round of money printing creating hyperinflation in most Western countries as well as in emerging markets. But this will have no effect as the world discovers that worthless pieces of paper or computer entries cannot create eternal prosperity.

After a brief hyperinflationary phase, we will see an implosion of the financial system when global debt and liabilities of at least $2 quadrillion currently, disappears into a black hole. As the debt implodes, so will all the bubble assets financed by the debt, including stocks, property and bonds.

So the world is not in the position to take the flood that leads to fortune. Sadly whatever current the world takes will lead to miseries. We are now in a LOSE – LOSE situation and it will be a question of the least painful outcome.

Since the world cannot choose which way to go, we must look at the most likely option. Personally I believe that a collapse of the financial system and the world economy is more likely than globalist control of the world. You could argue that the globalists will orchestrate the collapse and take advantage of the anarchy which will arise to take control. But I think that the coming disorderly reset of the world economy will be impossible to control by any individuals, state or military power.

A GLOBAL FIRE IS REQUIRED

So the coming years and decades will be horrific which ever path the world takes. A reset is totally necessary for the world to start the next growth phase. We need a global fire that burns the current system down to the ground. Only from that position can we get strong green shoots that will form the foundation for a healthy growth of the new world economy.

Michael Snyder recently wrote an article about life in Major Wester Cities called:

“Rats, Public Defecation And Open Drug Use:

Our Major Western Cities Are Becoming Uninhabitable Hellholes”

The advantage with the fire is that it will also destroy the decadence as well as the false values and false morals which have become rampant in the last few decades.

The suffering that we, our children and grandchildren will go through during this period of transition will be horrendous but sadly it will be necessary in order to give the world a chance to eventually take the right current.

DEUS EX MACHINA – THE ONLY SOLUTION?

It is with no pleasure I discuss the above alternatives for the world. I obviously wish that the outcome of the mess we are in now could treat the world more gently. But I cannot see another realistic solution. Possibly that would be Deus ex Machina which I discussed many years ago in an article. This is from the old Greek plays when god was lowered down on the stage in a little machine or basket and solved all the problems. But unfortunately I think that this is a very unlikely solution to the problem we are in.

GOLD ON THE WAY TO NEW HIGHS IN ALL CURRENCIES

So let’s finish with some more uplifting news for the ones who understand the importance of wealth preservation or insurance against the current risks in the world economy and financial system. In my article last week I talked about the Gold Maginot Line. Gold in US dollars has not yet broken the important $1,350 line but is now on its way, finishing at $1,320 last Friday.

Important moves often start in the periphery. As the chart below shows, Gold in Swiss franc for example broke out of the same line last week and is now on its way to new highs.

Gold is now breaking out to new all time highs in a number of currencies including the Swedish and Norwegian Krona, Canadian and Australian dollars and many more. In Venezuela gold was 200 Bolivars in 2000 and now it is 327 million. In Argentina gold was 270 pesos in 2000 and now it is 50,000. We are likely to see these hyperinflationary levels in the West in coming years.

Subscribe

As I discussed in my article last week, the time when gold can be bought at current levels is quickly coming to an end. And we might get to the point when gold, due to shortages, cannot be bought at any level.

Finally, remember that gold is the only currency that has survived in history. A 5,000 year old tradition will not change whatever governments or globalists try to achieve.

Gold is not just a store of value, it is also beautiful. Below are 3 pictures of gold, dating back 4,500 to 6,250 years, from Timothy Green’s book “The Ages of Gold”

The bull below is 6,250 years old. It is a symbol of gold being both timeless and eternal as the only money which has survived throughout history.

Whooping Cough Symptoms What Does Whooping Cough Sound Like? Whooping Cough Diagnosis Whooping Cough Treatments Whooping Cough…,"Coughing fits can be irritating and embarrassing, especially when you're in a public place. There may be instances when you could not control it, but know that coughing is the body's way to get rid of foreign particles or mucus from your lungs.

Commonly caused by viruses, a cough may ease on its own without having to be medicated.1 But when a cough persists or you get a ""whoop"" as you inhale, it may not be a mild cough anymore — it could be that you have whooping cough.

What Is Whooping Cough?

Whooping cough, also known as pertussis or the 100-day cough, is a highly contagious respiratory disease brought on by the Bordetella pertussis bacterium. Its name was derived from the prolonged and intense coughing fits that produce a whooping sound when inhaling.

A person with pertussis can infect up to 15 people2 when the whooping cough bacteria3 spread from their coughing or sneezing. It generally starts off with cold-like symptoms such as mild fever and occasional cough, but the coughing spells can last for more than two weeks.4

Whooping Cough Causes: How Does It Spread?

As mentioned, the Bordetella pertussis bacterium causes whooping cough. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, the droplets of fluid with the bacteria coming from their mouth or nose spread into the air and get inhaled by people close by. When inhaled, the bacteria will reproduce in the cells of the nose and throat. This process generates toxins that inhibit the clearing of airways in the lungs and windpipe.5

A milder illness that's similar to whooping cough is caused by Bordetella parapertussis. Though parapertussis has a shorter duration and is less common,6 both can be fatal when acquired.7,8

Is Whooping Cough Contagious?

Whooping cough is highly contagious and is a common infectious disease in the United States. A recent peak in the number of cases occurred in 2012, with 48,277 reported cases of pertussis,9 although there was a 37 percent decrease in the number from 2014 to 2015.10 The latest report shows 18,975 cases in 2017.11

Outbreaks in day care centers and schools that happen annually12 may have contributed to the significant increase in the number of pertussis cases in 13- to 16-year-olds. But among age groups, the majority of deaths occurred in babies younger than 3 years old.13

How Long Is Whooping Cough Contagious?

Infected people may likely spread the disease during the first stage of the illness, known as the catarrhal stage, and two weeks after the coughing fits start. This is when coughing fits begin to get worse and the ""whooping"" sound is produced.14

Whooping Cough Symptoms You Should Look Out For

Symptoms of whooping cough in adults may be determined through the three stages that an infected person undergoes.15,16

Catarrhal stage — Lasting for one to two weeks, symptoms may include sneezing, occasional cough, runny nose and nasal congestion. In some cases, mild fever may occur.

Lasting for one to two weeks, symptoms may include sneezing, occasional cough, runny nose and nasal congestion. In some cases, mild fever may occur. Paroxysmal stage — The common symptoms are vomiting, exhaustion, bluish discoloration of the skin or mucous membrane, choking and acute coughing. The whooping sound may also be evident in this phase.

The common symptoms are vomiting, exhaustion, bluish discoloration of the skin or mucous membrane, choking and acute coughing. The whooping sound may also be evident in this phase. Convalescent stage — At this point, the prolonged coughing fits become less intense.

Other symptoms of pertussis may include:17

Dehydration

Loss of appetite

Inflammation of the middle ear

In many cases, babies do not cough but they experience apnea, a condition that turns their skin blue and causes their breathing to temporarily stop.18

What Does Whooping Cough Sound Like?

The whooping cough sound may be characterized by a high-pitched ""whoop"" when you breathe in. This sound may be heard after coughing fits during the paroxysmal stage of the disease.19 Not everyone infected with pertussis may produce this sound, though, and some may not even cough, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).20

Whooping Cough Diagnosis

If you have been coughing for 14 days or more, it is important to consult with your health care provider to verify if you have pertussis.21 A number of laboratory tests will determine pertussis including culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology.22 Other tests that you may undergo are blood tests and chest X-rays.23

Whooping Cough Treatments You May Follow

Babies who have been infected by whooping cough may need hospitalization or attentive care from their physician, as this can become a very serious condition for a baby.24 For children and adults, who may not need to be admitted to a hospital, here are lifestyle and home remedies for whooping cough that you may follow:25,26,27,28

• To decrease vomiting, eat small, frequent meals. • Avoid foods that trigger mucus production such as peanuts and wheat. Even healthy foods like raw milk and eggs should be temporarily avoided or minimized while you're suffering from the symptoms. • Consume vitamin C-rich foods such as lime, tangerine, berries, bell pepper and broccoli to boost your immune system. A study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal29 found that vitamin C, when taken in substantial doses, may help ease coughing fits in the paroxysmal stage of pertussis. • To avoid dehydration, drink at least 70 ounces of pure water per day if you're a 75-kilogram (165 pounds) individual. Refrain from consuming commercial fruit juices and sports drinks, as they not only may contain inflammation-causing sugars, but are lacking in a variety of organic nutrients. • Get rid of irritants in your home that may cause coughing fits, such as aerosol sprays and smoke from tobacco and stoves. • Rest and relax in a cool and quiet bedroom. • Help ease coughing fits by using a cool-mist vaporizer.

A 2014 study found that antihistamines, pertussis immunoglobin and salbutamol may not help ease coughing fits caused by pertussis.30 If you plan to take these medications to help relieve whooping cough, seek your health care provider's advice before doing so.

Also, unless advised by your doctor, cough medicines are not recommended to be taken by people with pertussis, especially children under 6 years old. Coughing is the body's way of clearing airways, which is why it must not be suppressed.31

Whooping Cough Prevention: Is There a Way to Restrain This Disease?

Whooping cough is an airborne respiratory disease that targets the immune system. Simply inhaling the tiny droplets released from an infected person's mouth might put you at risk. Here are some ways to help prevent acquiring this disease:32

If you have pertussis, cover your mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing — doing this may help restrain the spread of bacteria in the air.

Promote proper hygiene everywhere you go. Pertussis is as contagious as the common cold. As much as possible, wash your hands using mild soap and water. While many hospitals and health care factions also endorse using hand sanitizers, actually many of these sanitizers contain isopropyl alcohol, which can dry your hands and increase your risk of absorbing toxins, so if you do use sanitizers, do it minimally.

A 2007 study showed that whooping cough in infants is largely transmitted from household members — including asymptomatic persons who were fully vaccinated 33 — who come in close contact with the babies. 34 To avoid this, keep infants away from known infected persons, especially those in the early stages of the disease. 35

— who come in close contact with the babies. To avoid this, keep infants away from known infected persons, especially those in the early stages of the disease. Boost your immune system by getting enough sleep and including foods rich in B vitamins, protein, vitamins A, C and D, fiber and probiotics to your diet.

Diet for Whooping Cough: Which Kinds of Food Should You Eat?

Since pertussis is an airborne disease, it is essential to boost your immune system to prevent it. One way to do this is by keeping an eye on what you eat. To help reduce the risk of having pertussis, here are the kinds of nutrients that you may need to consume:

• Protein — Commonly found in lean meat, bone broth, fish, eggs, nuts and seeds, protein may help fight infections. However, be mindful of your protein consumption, as too much protein can also be detrimental to your health, putting you at risk of insulin sensitivity and even cancer. • Vitamin C — Good sources of vitamin C include broccoli, berries, leafy greens, citrus fruits and bell peppers. • Vitamin A — Add carrots, squash, sweet potatoes, cantaloupe, organic, pastured eggs, grass fed beef and dark, leafy vegetables to your diet to lower your risk of infection. • Fiber — Help balance your gut microbiome by adding fibrous foods like blueberries, cucumbers, nuts, celery, carrots, banana, papaya and mango to your diet. • Vitamin D — Best acquired through sun exposure, vitamin D may help support your immune response. Raw grass fed milk, wild-caught Alaskan salmon and organic, pastured eggs also contain vitamin D. • Probiotics — Fermented foods are rich in probiotics that help balance the intestinal bacteria. These include fermented vegetables, natto, kimchi, pickles, miso, kefir, tempeh and raw grass fed yogurt. • B vitamins — Boost your immunity by consuming foods with vitamin B1 (thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B7 (biotin), B9 (folic acid) and B12 (cobalamin) such as dark, leafy greens, mackerel, sardines, anchovies, pastured organic chicken, yogurt, cheese and raw, organic grass fed milk.

Croup Versus Whooping Cough: What's the Difference?

Whooping cough, as mentioned, is a respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. Its notable symptoms are runny nose, mild fever and coughing bouts that produce a ""whoop"" sound when inhaling.36

On the other hand, croup is another name for laryngotracheobronchitis and laryngotracheitis. Croup is commonly caused by the parainfluenza virus, but respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, enterovirus, influenza and adenovirus may also lead to croup. It is an infection that interferes with breathing and is common in children because they have small airways.

Croup symptoms include nasal congestion, rhinorrhea and fever. An infected person may develop a hoarse voice, a high-pitched wheezing sound or stridor and a seal-like cough. Similar to pertussis, croup may be fatal to infants, but it is rare.37

Unlike whooping cough, croup may not be as serious. Home treatments may help ease it, and only about 5 percent of infected children will require hospitalization.38

486,Empty,2019-02-22T13:00:00Z,Julia* was 16 years old when a man more than three times her age tried to undo her bra.,"Loading She was told it was her own fault that she was repeatedly harassed by her male co-workers, she says. Julia believes that the fact her abusers also had intellectual disabilities meant their alleged offences were seen as lesser crimes. Now 31-years-old, the trauma is still with her. “I felt I had no control over what happened to me,” Julia says. “That feeling is never completely gone."" Julia is just one of many women with intellectual disabilities who have been harassed, abused, assaulted - and ignored. Momentum is building behind the push from Labor and the Greens' for a royal commission into abuse in the disability services sector. The government waved through the parties' motion on Monday, agreeing in principle to a royal commission. However, Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not commit to a timeline for the inquiry, saying it would first need the agreement of all states and territories.

But the first hurdle to any meaningful inquiry is Australia's lack of robust data that traces the true extent of what experts call an endemic and hidden crisis. “We know women with disability are silenced by the perpetrators of the abuse,” says Associate Professor Patsie Frawley at Deakin University. ""We know violence against women with disabilities is often unreported and when it is reported it is dismissed, ignored or covered up."" Through her community outreach work Frawley has collected countless testimonials from women with an intellectual disability who have been sexually abused. But the reports of abuse are not being tracked at a state or national level.

The 2016 Australian Bureau of Statistics Personal Safety Survey shows that more than 43 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds with a disability or long-term health condition report experiencing sexual harassment. That is almost double the proportion of people without a disability or long-term health condition. But because the figure is based on a household survey, it does not capture the population of women with a disability living in facilities or who would not readily disclose abuse, Frawley says. And many facilities, such as boarding houses, prisons and women's shelters, don't identify women with disabilities in their records, ""so there's not a clear and full picture"", she says. And an erroneous, often-quoted statistic: ""90 per cent of women with disability have experienced violence and abuse"", is a two-decade-old conflation of several Canadian studies. “A royal commission would give us the opportunity to get some really good Australian data,” Frawley says. 'I was very terrified'

Soon after Julia started working at the sheltered workshop, several older male employees found her in the phone directory and left countless voicemail messages asking her to be their girlfriend. Loading Through tears, Julia recalls working alone in a storeroom when she felt hands fumbling with her bra clasp. It was a male co-worker aged in his 50s. “I turned around and said ‘why did you do that?’ and he said ‘because I can’.” On another occasion, a male co-worker in his 20s touched her bottom, rubbed himself against her and laughed. She reported the incidents to her boss, who said he would talk to the men.

But Julia was later told that their behaviour was expected, given her youth and appearance, she says. She was advised not to engage with or smile at her co-workers. As she rode the bus home from work one afternoon she saw one of her abusers on the same bus. She panicked, got off the bus, crossed the road and was hit by a car. She sustained a skull fracture and a mild brain injury. She was again traumatised when one of her abusers visited her in hospital. The day she returned to work, she learned the man who had touched her bottom had been making loud sexual noises, moaning her name and making lewd gestures with the workshop machinery as he invited other men to join in. “A female co-worker told me she was scared for me … she was worried [the man] would take the next step of rape,” Julia says. “I was very terrified and became angry.""

She confronted the man in the lunchroom, yelling at him and threatening to call the police. But the most demoralising act, she says, was the reaction from her managers. Julia was ordered to the head manager’s office where several other section bosses were waiting. She says the door was slammed shut behind her and locked, she was reprimanded and her job was threatened. “They told me I had no right to have an outburst at a male with an intellectual disability,” she says. “They said it was very inappropriate of me and it was not tolerated in the workplace.” The intimidating experience was the final straw. Julia had a nervous breakdown and was hospitalised. 'It's okay to speak up'

When the perpetrators of harassment and assault are people with an intellectual disability it can be seen as “less of a crime”, Frawley says. The daily, pervasive sexual abuse of women with a disability were usually reported as ""incidents"" and dealt with internally, she says. “We need to take them out in the open and call them what they are. These are crimes.” Julia was an exception. The teenager and her mother launched a long and costly court battle against her employer; it was later settled. But she had lost her job, her self-esteem and her friends. “I couldn’t leave the house for three years. I was very paranoid that someone was going to touch me,” she says. International evidence shows women with disabilities are subjected to higher rates of physical and sexual abuse, both from people close to them and total strangers. The perpetrators might be intimate partners, co-workers, managers, carers and, in isolated cases, transport providers such as taxi drivers. A 2008 survey in the United States found women with severe disabilities were four times more likely to be sexually assaulted than women without disabilities. And a 2005 New Zealand study found women aged between 11 and 17 disclosed experiences of sexual abuse at the hands of step-fathers, mothers' boyfriends and older brothers.

For Julia, it has taken several years of intensive work with a counsellor to claw back her life. “He told me a person who doesn’t have a disability struggles [to overcome the trauma of sexual harassment] but a person with intellectual disabilities struggles 10 times worse,” she says. Julia believes women with intellectual disabilities may be perceived as vulnerable and less likely to defend themselves from sexual harassment and assault. “I want them to know it’s not their fault and it's okay to speak up,” she says. Lawyer and senior advocate at the NSW Council for Intellectual Disability Jim Simpson says a royal commission would “put a spotlight on the terrible injustices that happen so often to people with intellectual disability”. “It's extremely important to have the spotlight of a royal commission because people with disability - by the nature of their disability - find it really hard to identify when their rights are being abused, know what to do about it and have the confidence to seek redress,” Simpson says. “Reporting sexual abuse is so often difficult for any woman. It can be much more difficult for women with intellectual disability.”

It is vital that a royal commission examine all settings, including residential facilities, schools, hospitals, jails, workplaces and within homes, Simpson says. Frawley says there is a role for the National Disability Insurance Scheme Quality and Safeguards Commission to address these issues. The commission - which covers NSW and South Australia - received 29 reports of sexual assault against NDIS participants, and 184 reports overall of abuse or neglect in three months. The Human Rights Commission’s National Inquiry into sexual harassment in Australian workplaces was also taking notice, holding a targeted consultation with people with disability in Sydney on Monday. “There is good work being done, but there is a hell of a lot more we need to understand and a lot more that needs to be done,” says Frawley. *Name has been changed","Push for a royal commission into disability sector: the endemic, hidden crisis facing women",Smh.com.au,https://www.smh.com.au/national/push-for-a-royal-commission-into-disability-sector-the-endemic-hidden-crisis-facing-women-20190218-p50ymy.html

It’s Not Real; It’s Puccini: People often suspend realism. In the movie “Spiderman” the hero swings through the canyons of Manhattan using threads of “spider silk” he attaches from building to building as he travels down the street. In Puccini’s La Boheme, the leading lady sings a beautiful aria on her death bed, in the last stages of consumption, tuberculous filling her lungs will bodily fluids. The realist may say that is not possible. The opera buff may respond it’s not real; it’s Puccini.

Human imagination is boundless.

Unfortunately, many scientists, commentators and politicians expect other physicists and commentators to suspend realism when examining climate science produced by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and other reports from similar organizations. Critical thinking is not welcome.

For example, 40 years of calculations from comprehensive satellite data show that the atmosphere is warming modestly, but not over the Antarctic. The calculations are verified using temperature measurements by different instruments in weather balloons, taken over a part of the atmosphere. The greenhouse effect occurs in the atmosphere. The temperature trends in the atmosphere include effects of all greenhouse gases, such as changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor occurring from natural El Niño events.

The IPCC, etc. use surface temperatures, which are not comprehensive and include many other influences such as urbanization and change in land use. Surface temperature trends show a far greater warming rate than atmospheric trends. The IPCC, etc. claim that the primary cause of surface warming is carbon dioxide and that it is dangerous for humans. The advocates of dangerous warming have not produced a substantiated foundation, a tested hypothesis that demonstrates how a minor warming of the atmosphere causes a far greater warming of the surface. Further, the models they use predict a pronounced warming of the upper troposphere above the tropics, a “tropical hot spot.” Observations by balloons, and satellites show that it’s simply not there. It is as if the Climate Establishment is saying about their work: it’s not physics, it’s climate science!

********************

Will Happer – Realist: President Trump did the unthinkable for many. He appointed a distinguished physicist, William Happer, to a committee being formed to review the security risks to the nation from climate change. Readers may recall that TWTW has suggested that the threat assessments are dubious at best. They lack critical thinking. Fort Eustis, VA, on the James River, is listed as one of the military facilities most at risk from sea level rise caused by global warming. The tidal gages in the area show that sea levels are not rising by an unusual extent.

But, the entire area of Norfolk / Newport News, which is on the low coastal plane, is sinking. Land subsidence is occurring, primarily from ground water extraction from two major wells which are forming clear funnels that show subsiding land centered on these wells. One well is at West Point on the York River about 30 miles northeast of Fort Eustis. The other well is in Franklin, Virginia, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Eustis. A cost-effective alternative for water may be to replace these wells with one or two desalination plants similar to that employed in Carlsbad, CA, using prefiltration technology developed in Israel.

When the appointment of Happer was announced, the global warming chorus roared – how dare the president appoint a physicist who may question the threat assessments by experts. The noise may be reminiscent of the uproar the occurred when President Reagan dared question the assessments of the experts who considered that the Soviet economy was comparable to that of the US, including the first US Nobel laureate in economics. After the Soviet economy collapsed, the critics of Reagan forgot their previous economic assessments.

A sample of the response to Happer can be found in an editorial in Science Magazine written by a journalist for an environmental news service, E & E News.

“William Happer, a prominent opponent of climate science in the Trump administration, is heading a new White House effort to downplay the national security risks posed by climate change.”

“Happer, who is not a climate scientist, has rejected mainstream climate science for years. He routinely says that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and that the world could burn more fossil fuels without harm. Happer heads a group called the CO2 Coalition, which advocates for a rejection of climate science, and he has said the world is in a ‘CO2 drought.’”

“’Frankly, it’s insulting to those in the intelligence community and those who are in our science agencies,’ [Francesco] Femia [co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security] said. ‘Within the Pentagon and within the intelligence community, there are a lot of people who are evidence-driven, fact-driven, science-driven patriots, and they see a risk and they begin to put that into their analysis because they know if you don’t do so, you’re going to have a blind spot on security. And that’s never a good thing.’”

Such comments prompt a response such as, “Why do these evidence-driven, fact-driven, science-driven patriots ignore atmospheric temperature trends, where the greenhouse gas effect occurs?” And “What is fact-based about claims of exponential sea level rise, increasing sea levels by an ever-increasing rate?”

But, perhaps the most pointed response came from physicist Luboš Motl in his blog, The Reference Frame, when addressing political comments by former mayor Michael Bloomberg and Senator Chuck Schumer:

“Can’t they see that Happer clearly knows more about these matters – especially the absorption of electromagnetic radiation (the greenhouse effect is an example) and the relative CO2 famine in the present – than they and their Senate clubs and aides combined? Bullying of a scientist by a politician is the right word here.”

This goes to the core. The enormous benefits of carbon dioxide fertilization are well-documented, substantiated by experiments and real-world observations, but ignored by the IPCC and the climate chorus. Worse, the IPCC, etc. have produced a distorted version of the absorption and reemission of electromagnetic radiation (the greenhouse effect). See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy, Defending the Orthodoxy, Changing Seas, and Other Scientific News.

********************

The Greenhouse Effect: this is the first in a series on the greenhouse effect as it is being measured in the atmosphere.

Greenhouse gases are nearly transparent to sunlight but partially opaque to thermal radiation from Earth’s surface and atmosphere. The greenhouse effect is a predicted warming of the surface and lower atmosphere and a cooling of the stratosphere and upper atmosphere as the concentration of greenhouse gases increases. The most important greenhouse gas is water vapor, H2O. Carbon dioxide, CO2, is of lesser importance. Nitrous oxide, N2O, and methane, CH4, make only minor contributions to greenhouse warming. The most abundant gases in the atmosphere, nitrogen, N2, and oxygen, O2, are not greenhouse gases since they are nearly transparent to both sunlight and thermal radiation. There is no doubt that the greenhouse effect exists, but there is considerable uncertainty about how large it is.

Many economic models show that small warming of any kind will benefit the Earth, for example, by lengthening growing seasons and by lessening human mortality due to extreme cold. Separately, increasing concentrations of CO2 have enormously positive effects on the growth of crops and forests. Greening of the Earth from more CO2 is already being observed from satellites. It is important to resolve whether the greenhouse effect from credible increases in CO2 concentrations will be modest and beneficial or large and harmful. Theoretical uncertainties in science have traditionally been resolved by comparing theoretical predictions with observations. Comparing predicted and observed temperature changes of the surface and lower atmosphere is an incisive way to resolve theoretical uncertainties about the magnitude of the greenhouse effect.

Surface and lower-atmospheric temperatures are expected to warm in response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. But surface temperatures, and their global averages, are influenced by other factors, like land-use changes, suburban and urban development. Surface temperatures are measured by thermometers here and there—sometimes in very bad locations—, and effort is made to interpolate between sites, often poorly. In contrast, satellites can measure atmospheric temperatures with nearly full sampling of the globe and with few of the systematic errors that plague surface measurements.

Instruments on satellites measure the intensity of microwave radiation emitted by the atmosphere. Temperatures are deduced from these intensities by methods analogous to those used in scanning temporal thermometers, available in most pharmacies. Atmospheric temperatures determined from satellite observations have been confirmed by direct measurements of temperature from weather balloons, many hundreds of which are launched every day.

Another reason to use atmospheric rather than surface temperatures as the touchstone for testing climate models is that climate models predict maximum warming at altitudes of 5 to 10 km in the tropical atmosphere. Lesser warmings are predicted for the surface, where it is harder to make reliable measurements.

Using atmospheric temperature data, John Christy et al. have repeatedly shown that the global climate models, in general, greatly overestimate the warming of the bulk atmosphere. Using 60 years of weather balloon data, Ross McKitrick and Christy have shown that an assumed pronounced warming centered over the tropics at about 30,000 to 35,000 feet (9 to 11 km, 300 to 200 millibars) is not found. The McKitrick and Christy study reinforces a 2007 study by Douglas, Christy, Pearson and Singer. This “hot spot” may be logically derived from a warming of the surface, whatever the cause. Its failure to appear after 60 years of observations is significant. There is something wrong with the theory. methodology, and/or procedure used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its followers such as the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the models on which they rely.

TWTW addressed this lack of a pronounced warming in the context of the widely accepted Global Annual Energy Budget by Kiehl and Trenberth on January 26 and February 2. The vicinity of center of the graphic depicts the concepts at issue “Thermals and Evapotranspiration” at the surface absorbing heat then rising in the atmosphere then releasing latent heat in the atmosphere. Based on the evidence presented by McKitrick and Christy, these processes are not intensifying. Thus, assumptions that storms, floods, droughts, etc. are intensifying are not justified by observational evidence.

Using observed evidence, Christy et al. have shown that the divergence between climate models and actual nature is increasing. The divergence is likely to continue unless the theory and methodology used by the IPCC, et al., are changed substantially. This is the first of several TWTWs that will address our understanding of the actual greenhouse gas effect and why the efforts of the IPCC, et al. are faulty.

Although not comprehensive and not embodied in a coherent theory, significant observational data of the atmosphere are being collected. These data suggest the IPCC has significantly overestimated the total greenhouse gas effect, especially that of carbon dioxide. These data bring into question the right side of what is depicted in the Kiehl and Trenberth diagram, the outgoing surface radiation resulting in far less outgoing longwave radiation. Unfortunately, outgoing longwave radiation, which is in the infrared range, cannot be observed from the surface.

The 1979 Charney report assumed that the greenhouse gas effect of carbon dioxide, which had been measured by laboratory experiments, would be greatly amplified by increased water vapor. Since there were no comprehensive measurements of outgoing longwave radiation, there was no hard evidence supporting or refuting this concept. Thus, the 1979 Charney report embodied speculation concerning the impact of greenhouse gases that may have been appropriate at that time; but, as with atmospheric temperature trends, this speculation has been superseded by observational data.

To better express the effects of greenhouse gases on outgoing infrared radiation, it is useful to think of placing thin layers of slightly smoky glass over a bright light shining through a window with each layer of glass being less smoky, clearer. As more layers are placed on, the total effect increases, but effect of the last layer is less noticeable than the previous one. In terminology that will follow in future TWTWs, if there is no interference with the light (electromagnetic energy) passing through the atmosphere (the window), it is said to be transparent. If there is considerable interference with the light (electromagnetic energy) passing through the atmosphere, it is said to be opaque. Different greenhouse gases interfere with different wavelengths of outbound infrared energy. At a particular wavelength, carbon dioxide may be transparent to infrared energy, yet at a different wavelength, opaque to infrared energy. The ability of greenhouse gases to absorb, then re-emit energy varies with the wavelength of the energy.

Since the advent of the satellite era, several countries have been compiling data on the atmosphere. For example, with what is called the A-Train of multiple satellites, and a similar, lower orbiting, C-Train, satellites from the US, France, and Japan collect a wide variety of data, including visible, infrared and microwave energy, phases of water, studies of vegetation, atmospheric pollutants, greenhouse gases, aerosols, clouds, water levels on land areas, snow depths, etc. The information is shared among international partners.

Future installments in TWTW will discussed how these data, and other data, are compiled and developed into databases that are available to the public and can be downloaded onto personal computers. Further discussions will include how these calculations based on observations contradict the findings of the IPCC, etc., and their models. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy and Measurement Issues – Atmosphere.

********************

Hurricanes and Climate Change: On her web site, Climate Etc., Judith Curry has posted two installments on a series about Hurricanes & Climate Change. The first is on detection, going back about 5,000 years. The second is on attribution which she states must be based on observations, not models. See links under Models v. Observations.

********************

Additions and Corrections: A reader on WUWT wrote that TWTW linked to the headline of comments on a paper changing ocean pH with changing wind patterns. The link created the impression that the paper contradicted recent lowering of pH claimed by many. Actually, the paper showed 159-year reconstruction of pH based on a set of coral collected in the northern South China Sea. TWTW should have made such a comment under the link.

********************

Number of the Week: Not €1.57 billion, but closer to €7 billion. An EU energy study claimed that annual levies on UK consumers in 2016 for subsidies to renewable electricity were €1.57 billion, whereas the correct figure is closer to €7 billion. It seems that subsidies for green energy are experiencing more exponential growth than increases in sea level. See link under Problems in the Orthodoxy.

Climate change science pioneer Wallace Smith Broecker dies

US professor raised early alarms about climate change and popularised term ‘global warming’

By Jonathan Watts, The Guardian, Feb 19, 2019

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/19/climate-change-science-pioneer-wallace-smith-broecker-dies

“Broecker said his studies suggested that the conveyor belt was the ‘Achilles heel of the climate system’ and a fragile phenomenon that could change rapidly for reasons not fully understood. It would take only a slight rise in temperature to keep water from sinking in the North Atlantic, he said, and that would bring the conveyor to a halt.

“In the 1970s, he worked as a consultant for Exxon and wrote several papers on the effects of carbon dioxide for the oil company.

“His 1975 paper “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?”, which predicted rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to pronounced heating of the planet. This built on earlier studies and helped to push the subject to a wider audience.”

Hurricanes & Climate Change: Detection

By Judith Curry, Climate Etc. Feb 17, 2019

https://judithcurry.com/2019/02/17/hurricanes-climate-change-detection/#more-24723

“I am preparing a new Special Report on Hurricanes and Climate Change.

“There has not been a timeline or synthesis of these results for the past five thousand years, either regionally or for the entire coastal region. However, it is clear from these analyses that significant variability of landfall probabilities occurs on century to millennial time scales. There appears to have been a broad ‘hyperactive period’ from 3400 to 1000 years B.P. High activity persisted in the Gulf of Mexico until 1400 AD, with a shift to more frequent severe hurricane strikes from the Bahamas to New England occurring between 1400 and 1675 AD. Since 1760, there was a gradual decline in activity until the 1990’s.”

Hurricanes and Climate Change: Attribution

“Models and theory suggest that hurricane intensity and rainfall should increase in a warming climate. There is no theory that predicts a change in the number of hurricanes or a change in hurricane tracks with warmer temperatures.

“Convincing attribution of any changes requires that a change in hurricane characteristics be identified from observations, with the change exceeding natural variability.”

1. The Green New Deal’s Impossible Electric Grid

Renewable energy can’t consistently balance power supply with demand.

By Robert Blohm, WSJ, Feb 20, 2019

https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-green-new-deals-impossible-electric-grid-11550705997

“Mr. Blohm is an elected member of the Operating Committee and the Standards Committee of the North American Electric Reliability Corp., the continental bulk electric system’s reliability regulator designated by the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 and by all the Canadian provinces’ energy regulators.”

In expressing a critical concern Mr Blohm writes:

“The Democrats’ Green New Deal calls for a fully renewable electric power grid. Regardless of the economic or political challenges of bringing this about, it is likely technologically impossible.

“An electric power grid involves second-by-second balancing between generated supply and consumer demand. In the case of a sudden imbalance—such as from the loss of a generator’s output—all the remaining generators on the grid instantaneously pool together. Each one pitches in a small part of the required power to make up for the lost generator fast enough to keep supply and demand balanced.

“This doesn’t work for wind and solar because you can’t spontaneously increase wind or sunshine. Hydro power is limited and unevenly distributed around the country. And for safety reasons, nuclear power—even if the Green New Dealers accepted it—can’t be cranked up to neutralize imbalances. Nor can consumer demand be suddenly reduced enough.

“Fossil-fuel turbines, by contrast, very naturally compensate for sudden supply outages. The inertia of the spinning mass of rotors provides the extra energy needed to compensate for the loss for the first few seconds. (Wind-rotor inertia is too short-lived.) Meanwhile the generators’ on-line reserve capacity kicks in, giving a rapid boost in power output to prevent the turbines from slowing down. That substitute power, called “governor response,” lasts as long as 15 minutes. During that time a single replacement generator ramps up to compensate entirely for the loss. All the turbines on the grid are thereby restored to their original speed, and the governor response is rearmed for the next disturbance.

An all-renewables grid would require prohibitively expensive battery storage to compensate for sudden power losses. Even with batteries, the lost power would have to be fed through “inverters”—a technology that converts variable-wind-speed alternating current, solar-power direct current, and battery-power direct-current into alternating current—to allow for synthetic inertia and governor response in the case of a disruption.

“But according to a 2017 report from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, if a large enough share of the power grid flows through inverters, the grid itself may collapse. Existing inverter technologies have faced serious software problems and prompted outages where they have been deployed. The IEEE is trying to create a global standard for inverter design—though heavy input by Chinese suppliers bent on commandeering the technology may pose a national-security risk if the U.S. were to incorporate the standard.

“How could the market price in the cost of providing rapid replacement energy that renewable sources can’t provide reliably? The entity that caused the outage should need to pay. Yet the power industry—to say nothing of the Green New Dealers—hasn’t given this much thought. An all-renewables power grid is destined to collapse.”

Ji won her fifth U.S. LPGA Tour title in her previous event last month, the season-opening Tournament of Champions in Florida.

She picked up right where she left off, in Chonburi.

After an opening birdie and a bogey on the third hole, Ji birdied nine out of the following 14 holes on the Siam Country Club Pattaya’s Old Course.

In her wake were Minjee Lee of Australia, Danielle Kang of the United States, and Jenny Shin of South Korea, each with a 65.

“I felt really great. I didn’t miss any fairways and missed just two greens,” Ji said. “I have a lot of confidence.

Lee was bogey free as she eagled the 15th and birdied five holes on a humid day.

“I was little bit slow starting out. I finished with three birdies on the last three holes at the front nine, and got a little bit better momentum,” Lee said.

A group of four, three strokes off the lead, included Americans Jennifer Song and Lizette Salas, Canadian Brooke Henderson, and Australian Katherine Kirk.

World No. 1 Ariya Jutanugarn, the 2013 runner-up, carded a 4 under 68, mixing an eagle and six birdies with two bogeys and a double bogey.

489,Empty,2019-02-25T08:01:47Z,"Southern Utah wasn't always a riding paradise, but as they say, if you build it, they will come. The post 2019 Bible Feature Story: Slow Roll appeared first on BIKE Magazine.","As I climbed out of a truck in Utah's Gooseberry Mesa parking lot, toothy, redrock peaks filled the view to the north and east, highlighted by the world-famous skyline of Zion National Park. I'd been told to expect a two- to three-hour ride that was rugged and technical. But perusing our flat surroundings made me skeptical.

Perhaps sensing my apprehension, Jake Weber, a retired Army combat engineer-turned guide with Utah Mountain Biking Adventures, offered a measure of reassurance. ""We get a lot of people who show up and say they want to ride 30 miles every day of their trip,"" he told me. ""But after about 15 miles on their first day, they're like, 'Yeah, we're good,' and they're ready for a beer at the trailhead.""

Welcome to the land of ""mesa miles."" Maybe you've heard of them. In short—no pun intended—they're harder than standard miles which makes them feel longer. The more you ride them, the more comfortable you get disclosing that you ""only"" rode 10 miles today and it still took two hours.

I had never ridden a mesa mile when I got to Washington County, Utah, which is well known to desert aficionados as a singletrack oasis and has hosted the world's premier freeride competition, Red Bull Rampage, off and on since 2001. Still, it remains something of a hidden gem to the rest of the riding world, in part because it's remote: four hours from Salt Lake City, six hours from Phoenix, nine hours from Denver.

St. George, the county seat and a city of roughly 90,000 people, spent decades as a retirement community for golfers and still attracts celebrities like Michael Jordan to its greens come winter. But starting around the mid 2000s, adventure took a bite out of golf's place as the area's top attraction. The number of local outfitters swelled from a dozen to more than 50. Mountain biking overtook road biking as the most popular two-wheeled pursuit. With an almost 90-percent population jump since 2000, Washington County ranks as the fastest-growing metropolitan area in America. It also has a warmer climate than its sometimes-rival, Moab, five hours to the northeast, and offers legitimate riding and 60-degree temps in the belly of winter.

On this beaming morning in early October, photographer Margus Riga and I had joined a local crew for a spin along the South Rim and through Hidden Canyon. Gooseberry, the original mesa ride and still a lot of locals' favorite mesa of the five with trails, carries an almost-mythical reputation among those who know about it. Mostly that is due to Goose's sandstone features and their surprising, albeit intimidating, ridability.

""They're like giant rock biscuits that you can just roll up onto,"" said 54-year-old Kenny Jones, who owns Gooseberry Yurts and once finished 14 straight Leadville 100s back-to-back. ""A lot of the bottom sections of the rocks have a nice, roll-y out. So they look really steep but then the tranny grabs your front wheel and gets you out of the vertical position.""

We followed Quentin Morisette, owner of Over the Edge Sports in nearby Hurricane, as he weaved between puddles in the rock—and the brine shrimp they hold, making it a no-no to ride through them—and abided by the local code not to leave tracks in the dirt. He led us to a playground that he called the Skatepark: two deep, connected bowls that mimic the flow of a purpose-built concrete bowl. From there we swooped between stands of juniper, piñon and cedar trees, as well as the mesa's namesake gooseberry bushes. After 15 minutes of wrestling our bikes up, down and over the sandstone landscape—a full-body workout that longtime local Bill Bergeron compares to ""being stuck in a cage with a gorilla""—we came upon a 20-foot-tall biscuit that looked like a soft-serve ice-cream tower. It was steep and layered, with a small drop at the entry over significant exposure. Morisette hiked to the top for the second time in his life and prepared to drop in.

The line, my riding partners explained, was not to be confused with the Wall of Considerable Consequences, which we'd pass later, or the Wall of Death, which we'd skip. Morisette rolled in, landed the initial drop and rocketed out the bottom as the rest of us filmed it with our phones. ""You've got to be kidding me!"" shouted Weber, who served two tours in Iraq and left the military after a pair of traumatic brain injuries saddled him with PTSD. Now he coaches a local high school team and rarely sees someone test the sharp end, hence his incredulous response.

Morisette let out a sly grin. ""I've been riding here for 23 years, and it just gets better,"" he said. ""When you're on the rock, the sky's the limit.""

As we continued toward Gooseberry's high point, I realized why locals pay attention to their tires' side knobs here: You need a lof of support to grip the off-camber sandstone. It helps that the trail is marked by white dots on the rock, too; otherwise it's easy to wander off track.

We pedaled over a 4-foot-wide plank to the Point, an airy perch overlooking the valley and Zion. The trail only gains 300 vertical feet from the White Trailhead (elevation: 5,100 feet above sea level) to here, but the entire ride includes about 900 feet of gain. ""It's all 10 feet at a time,"" Morisette quipped.

We ogled the old Rampage venue to the north, which includes the notorious King Kong descent, as well as Flying Monkey, a mesa across the valley where the government, legend has it, used to send furry primates down a rail propelled by a rocket at supersonic speeds to test military ejector seats.

Then we returned the way we came, back to the trailhead. Slightly under the weather, I collapsed in the gravelly shade, feeling like I'd ridden 20 miles if not more. Someone informed me it was actually less than 10. I sighed, chalked it up to the mesa effect and closed my eyes for a nap, while the others tipped back beers in the sun.

According to Washington County's GIS department, the local mountain biking scene encompasses 296 miles of mapped trails to go with a gnarliness spectrum ranging from sublime cross-country favorites like Hurricane Rim, J.E.M. and Dead Ringer, to the five local mesas and their sandstone playgrounds, to big-boy gravity lines that attract the world's best freeriders every October.

The area's rise to prominence happened neither quickly nor due to a mass movement. On the contrary, it started in late 1993 when a pair of native sons took up the sport at age 49. Twin brothers Morgan and Mike Harris had grown up in Rockville, a tiny town on the Virgin River at the mouth of Zion Canyon, but because their father forbade them from riding dirt bikes, they didn't start until they were 26. As Morgan tells it, they rode motos for 20 years, then performance ATVs for three, at which point they grew wary of the danger and turned to mountain bikes.

In the early days, Morgan rode a primitive bike with a shoddy fork. ""Boy, I went home bloody a lot,"" he chuckles. A few other locals were riding at the time, but they mainly stuck to the mellow Green Valley Loop. ""There wasn't any real anchor trail to draw people to the area,"" Harris recalls.

He and Mike used to hunt deer, coyotes and rabbits on Gooseberry Mesa, and they often heard visitors talk about slickrock riding in Moab. They knew Gooseberry contained similar features and started poking around, starting with the slab that parallels the White Road. They built a short trail through one of the mesa's mini-canyons, then found out they needed a permit. So they met with the BLM in 1994 to talk about expanding their work to the north and south rims and Hidden Canyon. ""Originally they wanted 15 cents a foot, per year, for the use of the land,"" Harris says. Then the agency softened its stance. ""They said if you can have everything completed by Trail Days of 1996, we'll do a trail dedication. We had it done, but it took them until '98 to dedicate it.""

With Gooseberry complete, the Harris brothers turned their attention to Little Creek Mountain, which they'd been staring at for years from Gooseberry. They started exploring its slabs, ancient petroglyphs and fossils (there's actually a dinosaur bone embedded in the sandstone in one spot) and potential trail corridors that didn't require slaughtering flora. After a year-and-a-half of building there—with unofficial permission from a BLM official, Harris says—the agency changed its mind and asked them to stop. So they did, again shifting to where they thought the next destination could be. In this case it was a long redrock spine that would come to be known as Church Rocks.

Mike Harris quit riding after Little Creek, leaving Morgan to continue alone. Luckily others picked up the slack, and soon enough a growing community of riders had built Guacamole, which fostered its own mini-network on the mesa including The Whole Guacamole, Holy Guacamole and Salt on the Rim.

Harris left to build trails in Nevada after constructing Holy Guacamole, and now, at age 73, he just maintains existing routes. But the foundation he and Mike laid continues to anchor the network. If you ask 20 locals to name their favorite trail, like I did, you could get 15 different answers. The scene now includes a 100-mile race—True Grit, held every March in St. George—and a respected advocacy organization, the Dixie Mountain Bike Trails Association (DMBTA), which was launched in 2010 by True Grit founder Cimarron Chacon. ('Dixie' is a common moniker in Washington County because the early settlers grew cotton, which led to the area being known as 'Utah's Dixie.')

DMBTA only counts about 75 official members, but more than 2,000 people follow the organization on social media, ""and a lot of them come out to our volunteer days,"" says club president Kevin Christopherson. Others hand him money on the trails, even if they're not from the area. In addition, the Rampage organizers have donated about $14,000 to DMBTA each of the past two years.

The roots and robust support keep the area on the broader map, attracting riders from around the world—with a healthy dose of freeriders each spring, an influx that Morisette affectionately calls the Canadian Invasion. The key to providing such a reliable product when so many other destinations in the region cannot, he says, is the geography. Just north of Hurricane, Interstate 15 goes from 3,500 feet in elevation to above 5,000 and stays there, which places Zion on the northern edge of viable winter and early spring riding.

Although a lot of local rides, particularly the mesas, require driving a fair distance to park at a trailhead, not everywhere does. One of the guys we rode Gooseberry with, a diehard XC fanatic named Josh Wolfe, lives in St. George and doesn't own a car. We bumped into him the next morning in the nondescript parking lot for Zen and Barrel Ride, just over a dirt mound from St. George's subdivisions and commercial sprawl. We had just finished up an ambitious combo ride in a group of eight.

Wolfe was on his way out for a midday loop, and after our morning figure-eight on Zen and Barrel, I understood why he lives so close to these trails. Zen features the kind of ledgy, technical terrain that makes your forearms cramp. Kenny Jones called it a ""rim-basher trail,"" and halfway through our descent it delivered. Jake Miller, a Red Rock ambassador and standout local rider, buckled an $1,800 carbon wheel in two places without crashing. Despite its ride-from-home proximity to a city of 90,000, you still feel like you're away from the hectic rush of civilization when you reach the top. Then the real fun begins. Both Riga, who lives in Vancouver and calls the North Shore home, and I deemed it our favorite trail of the week.

We continued on to the freeride-friendly Barrel from there, led by longtime St. George rider Bryce Pratt, who built it 15 years ago, and Mitchell Curwen, who recently refurbished it and added some features. ""If you want to see what a bike can do, this is a great place to take it,"" Curwen said as we pedaled up a wash toward the top. Pratt designed the trail to snake through a series of barrel cactuses, which look like stunted pony kegs with 3-inch-long thorns.

I followed a mother of three named Angie Anderson down the Waterfall, an aptly named chunky section that serves as Barrel's crux, if you don't count the jumps below. Some of those jumps dropped blindly off of giant boulders into perfectly sculpted transitions. Others were gaps, including one over a creek. Everything seemed to flow just as it should until we were back at the parking lot.

""Doing Zen and Barrel in the same day is a big day. They're probably our two most technical trails in St. George City,"" Curwen said. ""If you can get out of here without a broken bike part or broken body part, that's a win.""

Victorious, Riga and I returned to St. George later that afternoon to check out the Snake Hollow St. George Bike Park—the newest addition to the area's stable of radness. Built on 80 acres of city-owned land through a collaboration between DMBTA, the Southern Utah Bicycle Alliance and the Washington County Tourism Office, the facility was funded by $1.6 million in tax dollars and was slated to open the month after our visit. But there were already dozens of kids testing it out after school. This winter, city workers and volunteers are planning to add a 5.5-mile NICA racecourse through the lava field on the lot's southern end. According to county tourism director Kevin Lewis, it will be the only year-round bike park in Utah.

The most recent addition to Washington County's singletrack menu arrived two years ago when DMBTA finished a 7-mile intermediate loop on Wire Mesa. In its first year of existence, trail counters recorded 16,000 visitors—or an average of 44 a day. It's close to Gooseberry and Grafton mesas, so you'd expect it to see traffic, but the number still quantified the area's growing renown. (In total, 178,000 people rode BLM trails around Washington County last year, including 30,000 on Gooseberry.)

The numbers are a far cry from when Morgan Harris broached the idea of a Gooseberry trail to the BLM 25 years ago. ""At that first meeting, they said, 'Being that remote, 7-and-a-half miles off the highway, you're probably only going to see 36 riders a month, at most,'"" Harris recalled. Within three years of Gooseberry's trails being open, the local bike shop owners told Harris they'd seen a 60-percent increase in sales. Five years later, when Harris' fork fell apart, Zion Cycles founder Fred Pagles gave him a new Trek Remedy and free service and parts for life. When Harris protested, Pagles said: ""If you hadn't done what you did, I wouldn't have a business.""

There is still a touch of uncertainty about what will happen to unofficial trails on BLM land that have become wildly popular and mapped, like Little Creek and Dig It on Grafton Mesa. A long-in-the-works travel management plan is nearing completion, and locals are optimistic the BLM will bring them into the fold and declare them legal, since closing them would be more complicated and potentially hurt the area's economic growth.

But whatever happens, the local scene is plenty healthy, as evidenced by a recent show of support for Harris after he was diagnosed with gum cancer. In mid-May, Harris underwent surgery to remove a tumor, and doctors removed his fibula from his lower right leg and used it to rebuild his jaw. Locals held a fundraiser to help cover his medical bills, bringing in nearly $25,000. Over the Edge built a new Ibis Mojo HD for Harris to ride into his 80s. At a post-ride barbecue in October, Harris said he still didn't have the leg power to ride technical terrain, as much as he wanted to.

Instead, he had been maintaining trails he built a generation ago. ""I get out there at daylight and get done before it gets too hot,"" he said. ""Me and the dog, Hazel."" His tools were hidden in the bushes as he spoke.

I asked Harris what he thinks of the community that he and his brother helped to create. ""It amazes me what's happened here,"" he said. ""When I was building trail, I never expected any payback. Payback was people having a smile on their face, loving what you built. I can't believe this came out of us wanting to ride a trail on Gooseberry.""

RIDE: Although most trails are on MTB Project, for a more localized resource check out swutahtrails.com, a brand-new, one-stop tool for trail descriptions, photos and videos with downloadable maps and GPS navigation. Trails are sorted into geographical zones to showcase the various regions throughout the county.

STAY: You'll find ample lodging options throughout the county via Google. We stayed at a rental house in Sand Hollow Resort, which suited our large group well and was convenient to both Hurricane and St. George. You can also check out Gooseberry Yurts for a more primitive, adventurous option—with four days' worth of riding from your front door. The 20-foot-diameter yurts sleep five to seven adults and cost $150 a night.

EAT: Again, options abound, but you can't go wrong with Lonny Boy's BBQ in Hurricane, George's Corner Restaurant in St. George and the Bit and Spur Restaurant and Saloon in Springdale. Affogato is a worthy coffee shop in St. George, while River Rock Roasting Co., in La Verkin, serves tasty food and everything from coffee to beer on the edge of a canyon carved by the Virgin River.

SHOP: Over the Edge Sports in Hurricane treated our team well, whether that meant providing TLC to the day's testing steeds each evening, sharing local beta on where to ride or leading the way on hard-to-follow loops (OTE also runs a free shop ride every Saturday, which is a great way to see the area's nooks and crannies).

Your stories of your own battles with bureaucracy motivate me to keep writing. Suggestions for topics are always welcome, although I have quite a backlog already.

After I touched on untreated timber a couple of weeks ago, several people asked for me to expand on leaky buildings. It is a woe-begotten tale of mismanagement on a grand scale.

In 1996, the Commission of Inquiry into leaky buildings of the previous decade bemoaned ""a loss of collective memory, and lack of conventional wisdom, among inspectors, architects, engineers, developers, and contractors regarding the requirements for effective building"".

""Hang on"" the astute reader may ask, ""wasn't the problem in the period from 1998 to 2003?""

The National Party had been under pressure from the Greens because timber treatment uses some particularly nasty chemicals (such as arsenic) that could be bad for the environment. Untreated timber was allowed to be used for house framing on 28 February 1998, until the Building Industry Authority issued a directive on 9 March 2003, re-introducing treatment for all consents.

The Commission of Inquiry mentioned above was the Canadian inquiry. They had a massive and highly publicised problem. Sure, this was the era before Google, so research took more than a mouse click, but the most basic due diligence a government should carry out prior to changing regulations would be to check what other countries' experiences have been. New Zealand blindly copied a known disaster.

The blame doesn't lie solely with untreated timber. Town planners with no construction experience started using roof area instead of floor area, measuring boundary dimensions to roof lines instead of walls, and setting arbitrary height limits – all because it meant more resource consents would be needed.

Developers responded with the infamous ""Mediterranean style"", totally unsuited to our climate conditions, with flat roofs and no overhangs allowing them to squeeze the most building space into the rules.

Post-disaster, planners actually returned to rules that reflected the needs of the building industry to some extent. But after a decade, I started to see an influx of the same rules and interpretations that created so many problems. It seems we don't learn from history.

Most architects, including myself, had trained at Auckland University, where the Architecture School was split into petty factions, many staff had no practical experience, and it was greater ""status"" to teach theory than technical skills. In short, the education was negligent and the qualification just about worthless for anything outside of academia. It took ten years to teach myself to be competent for the sort of complicated buildings we were designing.

The standard of drawings given to builders was not good enough for the high-risk details that were required.

The dismantling of apprenticeships meant young chippies and tradies were unleashed on buildings without the experience to work through difficult projects. In earlier times, skilled main contractors would be on site to check and coordinate work, but a new breed of project managers were saving clients money by tendering out each trade separately, with no supervision of specialist skills on the actual project. I set up my own practice primarily so I could refuse projects that involved working with them.

Product suppliers, such as a certain Australian firm, happily sold materials that were simply not suitable for what, where, and how they were being used. Some claddings

relied on nothing more than a coat of paint at every joint to keep water out. It was never going to last.

Helen Clark's Labour Party responded to the disaster by disbanding the Building Industry Authority – the government agency that was the ultimate regulator of the construction system. This was a cynical ploy to remove the government from liability as the BIA could no longer get sued.

Instead, the liability was dumped on councils. Building inspectors had probably the smallest part to play in the debacle. They had no say over the design, did not carry out the faulty workmanship, and were not present during most of the construction.

By tradition, they checked some basic structural, fire, and plumbing issues, as accepted by the BIA and courts up until then. Their processes failed to change with the times, and the courts retrospectively decided that building inspectors should have done more. Their employers - the councils, and therefore the ratepayers, had to shoulder a small proportion of the responsibility.

There is a grossly unfair legal principle that is applied to construction projects called ""joint and several liability"". It exists mainly to ensure lawyers make money by always having someone to sue. That small proportion of responsibility meant councils were jointly liable for the whole thing. When problems arose, building firms went bust, and councils were the ""last man standing"".

The courts reached deep into ratepayers' pockets. You, the public, ended up paying for the damage, while most perpetrators never paid a cent.

Along with many others in the architecture profession, I have lobbied hard to change the law to ""proportional liability"" for leaky buildings and any other problems. We should each take our fair share of responsibility, and limit councils' exposure to their small share. Government legal advisers have resisted.

I would like to see all councils join together with building professionals and ratepayers' associations to promote this at the national level on behalf of ratepayers.

View full cov…,"OTTAWA — Canada’s top public servant says he is worried someone will be assassinated during the coming federal election campaign given the disturbing tenor of recent public discussion.

Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick told the House of Commons justice committee Thursday he is deeply concerned about Canada’s politics and where things are headed.

Wernick appeared at the committee to address the SNC-Lavalin controversy dogging the Liberal government, but he prefaced his testimony by voicing grave reservations about the overall state of public political dialogue leading up to the October election.

“I worry about the rising tide of incitements to violence when people use terms like ‘treason’ and ‘traitor’ in open discourse. Those are the words that lead to assassination,” Wernick told the MPs.

“I’m worried that somebody’s going to be shot in this country this year during the political campaign.”

The hashtag #traitortrudeau has appeared on Twitter posts critical of the prime minister in recent weeks.

At a Saskatchewan town-hall meeting in January, a woman accused Justin Trudeau of selling out the country to his globalist partners, adding that traitors were once hanged for treason in Canada.

At a pro-pipeline protest on Parliament Hill this week featuring a convoy of truckers, Conservative Sen. David Tkachuk encouraged participants to roll over every Liberal left in the country.

Wernick did not mention Tkachuk by name Thursday, but he said it was “totally unacceptable” that a parliamentarian would incite people to drive trucks over others after 10 pedestrians were killed in a van attack in Toronto last year.

“I hope that you as parliamentarians are going to condemn that,” he said.

Wernick lamented that the reputations of honourable people who have served their country were “being besmirched and dragged through the market square.”

He also expressed dismay about what he called the “trolling from the vomitorium of social media” entering the open media arena.

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had earlier found himself in the dock in connection with the case, but a designated CBI court in Thiruvananthapuram discharged him and six other accused on November 5, 2013. The CBI then approached the Kerala High Court, which upheld the discharge of Vijayan and two others. However, it set aside the discharge of three of the accused and directed that the case against them will stand revived in the trial court.

Besides the CBI’s appeal challenging the August 23, 2017 decision of the Kerala HC, the apex court will also consider petitions filed by some of the accused. Congress leader V M Sudheeran too has filed a plea seeking impleadment. The case relates to the award for renovation and modernisation of three hydro-electric projects in the period 1995-1997. The MoU between the Kerala State Electricity Board and Canadian firm SNC-Lavalin was signed on August 10, 1995.

The scandal came to light following an audit by the Principal Accountant General of Audit (Kerala), who pegged the loss to the exchequer at over Rs 300 crores. The report of the PAG triggered a storm, which led to an inquiry by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB). On inquiry, the VACB found some substance in the report of the PAG as regards the suspicious circumstances, and elements of misconduct in the making of the contracts.

Subsequently, the CBI took over the probe following a HC order. In its case, the CBI had alleged that Vijayan, the then electricity minister, had shown undue haste and interest in the execution of the supply contracts in February, 1997, and the KSEB happened to execute such a contract at the instance of the minister in haste when SNC-Lavalin offered some grant for the construction of a cancer hospital – the Malabar Cancer Centre in Kannur.",SNC-Lavalin graft case: Supreme Court to hear final arguments in April,Indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/snc-lavalin-graft-case-supreme-court-to-hear-final-arguments-in-april-5597347/

As early as Tuesday, Canadians could hear directly from Jody Wilson-Raybould on whether she was inappropriately pressured as attorney general to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution.

But beyond the political scandal, consider the failures of the RCMP and federal prosecutors in the case. Since 2012, the RCMP have charged eight people tied to allegations SNC engaged in bribery of foreign officials. Seven of those accused have had their cases tossed out of court due to delays or problems with evidence. RCMP and the Public Prosecution Service of Canada have yet to convict anyone from the company.

Many are asking whether they are really up to the job.

""Canada has a very poor record of enforcement,"" says James Cohen, head of the watchdog group Transparency International Canada. ""Canadian companies who engage in corruption have sadly been playing the odds that they will not get caught.""

The RCMP and PPSC's umbrella case against the company itself, SNC-Lavalin Group Inc and its subsidiaries, could be prosecutors' last hope.

To put it bluntly — they desperately need a win.

Bribing a dictator

SNC-Lavalin's troubles began in 2011, and unravelled like a spy novel.

The company, whose top construction executive for years paid bribes in Libya to win billions in contracts, moved out of the country temporarily when its patron, dictator Moammar Gadhafi, was ousted and killed.

One month later, as Libya burned, authorities in Mexico arrested a group of alleged plotters accused of trying to smuggle one of Gadhafi's sons to a life in hiding. Among those detained — but released — was an SNC money man, Stéphane Roy.

A month after that, a senior SNC-Lavalin employee invited a CBC reporter to a remote ski hill in Quebec. He whispered news of an internal revolt at SNC-Lavalin over allegations the top construction exec for years paid bribes and laundered money for the Gadhafi regime through Swiss banks, all to keep contracts flowing to SNC-Lavalin.

Those stories made headlines, sparked firings, police investigations, and eventually criminal charges.

In April 2012, that executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, was arrested in Switzerland where he was held for two and a half years. He pleaded guilty in Switzerland to bribery and laundering millions to win SNC-Lavalin contracts in Libya.

'We've done nothing wrong'

The company has long maintained that any bribes or kickbacks were the work of rogue employees.

The company's latest CEO Neil Bruce told investors on Friday the company will vigorously defend itself against the charge its international construction arm paid bribes.

""We've done nothing wrong as a company and none of our current employees have done anything wrong,"" Bruce said.

To date, the only conviction of anyone at SNC-Lavalin related to foreign bribery was the guilty plea from Ben Aïssa secured by Switzerland.

In Canada, so far every single charge the RCMP has laid has either not stuck — or not yet been to trial.

This month, a charge of obstruction of justice was thrown out against Sami Bebawi due to court delays.

Bebawi was SNC-Lavalin's top construction executive in the years before Riadh Ben Aïssa. RCMP charged Bebawi in 2014, accusing him of sending a lawyer to visit Ben Aïssa in a Swiss prison to offer $10 million if he covered up Bebawi's involvement in Libya. What Bebawi didn't know is that he'd walked into a sting operation. Ben Aïssa has become a vital co-operating witness for the RCMP.

Bebawi still awaits trial in Montreal on fraud and bribery charges tied to SNC-Lavalin's Libya operations..

Roy, the SNC-Lavalin money man detained briefly in Mexico in 2011, also walked out of court free this month. As vice-president of finance under Ben Aïssa, Roy was charged with fraud and bribery tied to Libya. But last week a judge tossed all charges due to ""unreasonable"" delays by the prosecution.

Bangladesh boondoggle

The RCMP and PPSC suffered similar defeats in its case against employees of SNC-Lavalin International in Bangladesh over the company's failed bid to win a $1.3-billion contract to build the Padma Bridge.

The World Bank eventually debarred SNC-Lavalin from bidding on projects for 10 years.

However, Canada's prosecution of five people over the Bangladesh bridge project, including a low level engineer and two executives, eventually failed.

Watch: SNC and a bridge for Bangladesh

A joint CBC News investigation shows the bribery scandal surrounding Canada’s SNC-Lavalin is even more extensive than first reported, with its own special code involving several foreign countries. 14:55

Charges were dropped against engineer Mohammad Ismail who became a witness, turning over evidence of a widespread system of secret payments used by the SNC-Lavalin division.

The four others were acquitted, after a judge ruled that RCMP wiretap evidence collected by bugging an executive's office was inadmissible.

Complex investigations, changing priorities

Canada has a sparse record of convicting anyone in foreign bribery cases.

To date, the RCMP and PPSC have only ever secured six convictions under the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act since its adoption two decades ago.

The RCMP superintendent who led these international investigations says those convictions nonetheless sent a message to corporate Canada.

""The early cases in Canada which resulted in fines to corporations led to compliance regimes being established country-wide by Canadian firms operating globally,"" says Biagio Carrese, a 29-year veteran anti-money laundering investigator with the RCMP.

Notably, he says, the three-year prison term handed down to Nazir Karagar of CryptoMetrics Canada for attempting to bribe government officials in India put Canadian executives on notice.

""The impact was immediate. It set a precedent,"" said Carrese, who has left the RCMP and now works in the private sector.

He declined to comment on the SNC-Lavalin case, but acknowledges foreign bribery cases can fail — or struggle — due to their international scope, legal and technical complexity, and the need for an intense amount of time, resources and special expertise.

RCMP's National Division had 115 dedicated investigators by 2013. A year later, after the Parliament Hill shootings, and the rise of homegrown ISIS sympathizers, many investigators were reassigned to anti-terrorism, depleting resources in the fight against foreign bribery.

""In a world of ever-changing priorities, this can be difficult. I believe this to be true of police and prosecutors,"" Carrese said.

Watch: SNC-Lavalin affair unfolds in front of the Justice Committee

Canada's top civil servant shared some strong words with the Justice Committee regarding the ever-growing SNC-Lavalin scandal. So what should we make of his testimony? And are we any closer to understanding what actually happened? The At Issue panel is back looking for the answers. 12:57

Transparency International, in its 2018 report Exporting Corruption, noted a recent deterioration in enforcement in Canada, noting no new major cases launched in recent years.

Convictions in Canada

While no SNC-Lavalin employee has been convicted of foreign bribery, the company has faced humiliating headlines over corruption here at home.

Sûreté du Québec and provincial prosecutors won convictions against former CEO Pierre Duhaime and his executive vice-president of construction Ben Aïssa over bribes paid to win the $1.3-billion contract to build the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) superhospital.

RCMP is also still investigating SNC-Lavalin over $2.3 million in kickbacks paid to the head of the Federal Bridge Corp. Appointee Michel Fournier (former chief of staff to Jean Chrétien) is serving a five-and-a-half year prison term for accepting payments to Swiss bank accounts coded named ""Zorro"" while doling out bridge contracts.

Today, as politicians and the public debate the fate of SNC-Lavalin, and whether it ought to be offered an out of court deal to resolve the foreign bribery case, the police and prosecutors who toiled for years no doubt have a thirst to see their work put before the courts.

Beyond the law, the politics, the potential impact on this giant company — our public guardians have spent untold millions building a case and to date have little to show for it.","What's at stake for RCMP, prosecutors in the SNC-Lavalin case",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-bribery-snc-lavalin-case-1.5031712

MONTREAL -- Amid an ongoing scandal that has rocked the Liberal government in Ottawa, the head of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. said he's tired of seeing his employees ""used as a puck in a political hockey game.""

""Frankly, they don't deserve it. And we've had enough,"" chief executive Neil Bruce said Friday after slashing the company's dividend and reporting its biggest quarterly losses in at least two decades.

The beleaguered engineering and construction giant has been in the eye of a firestorm that erupted earlier this month when the Globe and Mail reported the Prime Minister's Office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to steer prosecutors toward negotiations with the company.

The company was looking to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement in connection with fraud and bribery charges linked to business dealings with Moammar Gadhafi's now-toppled regime in Libya.

In a YouTube video released by SNC on Friday, president and CEO Neil Bruce said the company is seeking a remediation agreement to avoid a criminal trial, but has not asked for the fraud and corruption charges to be dropped.

“It’s not easy for myself, for the management team, or for all of our dedicated, hard-working employees to see SNC-Lavalin’s name effectively in the media repeatedly as it has been over the last couple of weeks,” Bruce said in the interview with SNC’s External Communications Director Daniela Pizzuto.

“This is more of a political inquiry ... I want to categorically say – that we have done nothing wrong as a company. And none of our employees have done anything wrong as a company.”

Bruce said he wasn't holding out much hope for a remediation agreement, which would allow SNC-Lavalin to avoid a criminal trial in exchange for fines and other penalties.

""That's certainly at their discretion,"" he said. ""But frankly, it doesn't look like that today.""

SNC-Lavalin chopped its dividend by 65 per cent Friday as it reported a fourth-quarter loss of $1.6 billion.

It will now pay a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share compared with its earlier payment of 28.7 cents per share.

Bruce said problems at a mining project in Chile were ""incredibly disappointing,"" noting the company's mining and metallurgy and oil and gas segments had underperformed, prompting a pair of profit warnings earlier this year.

Ongoing diplomatic tensions between Canada and Saudi Arabia have jeopardized future contracts in the Middle Eastern kingdom, Bruce said last month after announcing a $1.24-billion impairment charge related to SNC-Lavalin's oil and gas business.

The Jan. 28 announcement, combined with news about delays at the Chilean mining project and an arbitration loss in Australia, sent shares plummeting 27 per cent to close at $35.01, their lowest since September 2012.

Analyst Derek Spronck of RBC Dominion Securities advised investors to ""keep calm and carry on.""

""There remain lots of challenges ahead for SNC, but none of which we would view as insurmountable and more than reflected in the current share price,"" he said in a research note Friday.

A criminal case could result in a ban of up to 10 years on bidding on federal contracts.

Bruce noted that until a conviction comes down, the company faces no bidding restrictions in Canada.

""Basically, they don't penalize you until you're found guilty.""

""This overhang continues to be there,"" he added, ""and competitors in the U.S....use that against us.""

Analysts pointed to a potential sale of some of the company's 16.77 per cent stake in Ontario's 407 ETR highway in 2019. The company has been mulling a partial sale for at least six months, which would hand it a slice of the $2.2 billion some analysts say the stake is worth.

The Montreal-based company's loss for its fourth quarter amounted to $9.11 per diluted share. That compared with a profit of $52.4 million or 30 cents per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Revenue totalled $2.56 billion, down from $2.92 billion.

On an adjusted basis, SNC reported a loss of $1.31 per diluted share compared with an adjusted profit of 98 cents per diluted share a year ago.

Analysts on average had expected a loss of $1.19 per diluted share, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

SNC has declined BNN Bloomberg’s multiple interview requests this week.

The post How many times did Jody Wilson-Raybould need to say ‘No’? appeared first on Macleans.ca.","Update: On Feb. 27, 2019, Jody Wilson-Raybould testified during an extended opening statement to the House of Commons justice committee. Read the full transcript of her statement here.

Since its outset, l’affair SNC-Lavalin has been framed as a “he said, she said.” More accurately, the messy scandal arising from allegations that the PMO pressured then-justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to give a prosecutorial break to the powerful Quebec company has been a “he, he, he-said,” while “she” consults with her lawyer about how much she can say. We’ll learn the answer to that next week when Wilson-Raybould speaks before the House justice committee.

Even before her testimony, however, an eerily familiar tale has unfolded, the last chapter in the spell-binding spiel from Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, this week before the justice committee. And that’s the spectre of powerful men not used to hearing “No,” not willing to accept “No,” doggedly pushing for a “Yes” from the person who ostensibly determines consent, then gaslighting her when they don’t hear it.

Through it all a question emerges: How many times did Jody Wilson Raybould need to say “No” before she was heard?

The matter involving SNC-Lavalin’s bid for a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) was settled, theoretically, on Sept. 4, when Kathleen Rousell, the director of Public Prosecutions, informed the company in writing it would ineligible for a remediation agreement as part of a DPA, and thus would have to stand trial on charges it had engaged in bribery and fraud in Libya. As attorney general, Wilson-Raybould could have overruled the prosecution service, and thus preserve SNC-Lavalin’s unfettered access to billions in government contracts. She did not. That was a “No.” Assuming a “No” is final in this setting, however, is to naively underestimate the determination and the clout of the Montreal construction giant that lobbied so effectively to have deferred prosecution agreements passed into law last year.

Not even two weeks after the decision was made, on Sept. 17, Wilson-Raybould discussed the SNC-Lavalin file with the prime minister. As Trudeau reported it, the attorney general felt the need to ask him whether he planned to tell her what to do concerning the prosecution. Any decision “was hers alone to make,” Trudeau told her, a bit of moral suasion familiar to any parent.

The next day, Sept. 18, SNC-Lavalin, clearly not about to take the prosecutors office’s decision, nor Wilson-Raybould’s decision not to overrule it as a “No,” met with Wernick and Finance Minister Bill Morneau to discuss “justice and law enforcement.”

Another letter from Rousell to SNC-Lavalin, this one dated Oct. 9, confirmed again in writing that the company will not be invited to negotiate a remediation agreement. The next day, Oct. 10, SNC-Lavalin issued a news release to say it strongly disagreed with the director of prosecutions’ position and remained open and committed to negotiating a remediation agreement.

Exactly who it would negotiate with was unclear. What we do know is that between early October and Nov. 19 SNC-Lavalin met with two different senior PMO advisors— Elder Marques and Mathieu Bouchard— to discuss “justice and law enforcement.” Visits by SNC-Lavalin lobbyists to the PMO would total 14.

The trees turned colour, leaves fell, chill filled the air, and Jody Wilson-Raybould was still talking about SNC-Lavalin at a Dec. 5 lunch at the Chateau Laurier with Gerry Butts, who has said he told the then justice minister to talk to Wernick.

Wernick revealed this week that he raised the issue of SNC-Lavalin during a Dec. 19 conversation with Wilson-Raybould. He conveyed to her that the prime minister and others were “quite anxious” about the possible economic consequences if SNC-Lavalin were found guilty. That is understandable. Lavalin is a major employer in Quebec. But the law bars prosecutors from considering the national economic interest when they consider offering deferred prosecution to companies charged with bribing foreign officials. Wernick employed a too-big-to fail rhetoric, expressing concern that the board might decide to “close, sell” the company which “would have consequences for 9,000 Canadians, plus the suppliers, plus the pensioners, plus all the communities in which the company’s active.” And the company’s “share price had tanked,” he said.

In all of those conversations “there was no inappropriate pressure put on the minister at any time,” Wernick said. Even more risible was a comment he’d make later in a scrum with reporters when asked why he’d continue to contact the attorney general three months after a decision had been made: “Because the decision had not already been made,” he said.

We’re talking Grand-Master-Jedi-level gaslighting here. Clearly the “No” registered on the SNC-Lavalin DPA on Sept. 4, Sept. 17, Oct. 7, Dec. 19 did not register as an actual or final decision. As for pressure? She must be imagining things! After all, the decision was Wilson-Raybould’s alone to make. And the insurance kicker: If Wilson-Raybould did feel she was being pressured to override the decision to prosecute, it was up to her to protest to the very office applying pressure, or resign. If she didn’t, well, it’s nobody’s fault but hers. Her behaviour is the problem. As I said, it’s an age-old template.

As for “How many times did Jody Wilson Raybould need to say ‘No?’ before being heard?” It’s a trick question. The correct answer: Zero.

The startling news came Friday afternoon during a technical briefing where city officials revealed the bidders chosen to work on the massive infrastructure project.

The city is planning to borrow an additional $700 million over 30 years to cover the inflated cost. The expansion, which will add 44 kilometres of track and 24 new stations, is now scheduled to be finished by 2025 instead of 2023.

East West Connectors is the top choice to expand the east-west Confederation Line. The consortium is led by Omaha, Neb.-based construction conglomerate Kiewit, which worked on Toronto's Spadina Subway extension, as well as France-based Vinci.

Its bid came in at $2.57 billion, well above the $1.98 billion target the city had set.

The Confederation Line expansion project will see the line extended to Trim Road in the east and Moodie Drive in the west, as well as an extension to Algonquin College.

It was supposed to be completed by 2023, but that assumed the first 12.5-kilometre stage, from Blair to Tunney's stations, would be up and running by the first half of this year.

Allan Hubley, right. (Kate Porter/CBC)

Behind schedule

That's not going to happen, with fewer than half of the 34 vehicles completed, testing far behind schedule and recent concerns about the system's ability to deal with Ottawa winters.

As reported by CBC News, ​SNC-Lavalin beat out two international consortia to win the north-south Trillium Line extension, worth more than $600 million. It would see the line extended into Riverside South, as well as a spur to the airport.

SNC-Lavalin bid for the contract under the name TransitNext. This deal, if approved, would also include a 30-year maintenance contract, making SNC-Lavalin's contract worth $1.6 billion.

The Montreal-based multinational firm is embroiled in a political controversy over its attempts to avoid criminal prosecution over bribery charges. If SNC-Lavalin faces those charges in court and is found guilty, the company could be blocked from bidding on federal government contracts for a decade.

SNC-Lavalin recently slashed its earning projections twice, its shares have hit a 10-year low and its CEO said late last year that the scandal has cost the company $5 billion worth of business.

As well, councillors are sure to question the choice of SNC-Lavalin because of its role as lead partner in Stage 1, which now looks to be delayed a third time. It's unclear when the first phase will be complete.

Mayor Jim Watson has said he's not concerned about the controversy.

Province's share unconfirmed

The bill for Stage 2 is supposed to be split three ways between the city, provincial and federal governments.

The federal cash is confirmed, and the previous Ontario government committed $1.2 billion for Stage 2 in a letter to the mayor in May 2018.

But the Progressive Conservative government elected last spring has still not confirmed the cash, despite Premier Doug Ford having said he supported the light-rail expansion during the 2018 election.

Watson is supposed to be speaking with the premier about the matter at Queen's Park on Tuesday, just a day before council is set to debate the contracts, the largest infrastructure project the city has ever undertaken.

Feb 22 (Reuters) - SNC-Lavalin’s chief executive said on Friday the Canadian construction company has done “nothing wrong” in the broadening political crisis facing the country’s prime minister.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office is under fire for allegedly pressuring his former justice minister to try to ensure that SNC avoid a corruption trial over charges of bribing Libyan officials.

The federal government had refused SNC’s request for an agreement that would have allowed it to avoid a trial.

“I want to categorically say that we have done nothing wrong as a company,” SNC Chief Executive Neil Bruce told analysts on a conference call following the release of quarterly results. “We have never asked for charges to be dropped.”

Montreal-based SNC has been seeking to avoid a corruption trial because the executives accused of wrongdoing have left the company, and it has overhauled ethics and compliance systems.

Bruce on Friday also said he would not “give up” on pursuing business interests in Saudi Arabia, despite strained relations between Ottawa and Riyadh. Relations between the two countries have been tense as Saudi Arabia froze new trade with Ottawa in August after Canada demanded the immediate release of jailed rights activists.

“We’re not going to take that and give up, and that was the reason why I was there twice last week,” Bruce said.

He said an SNC board committee has hired advisers to look at options to improve shareholder value. Plans to sell a portion of SNC’s 17 percent stake in the 407 toll highway in Canada this year is “progressing well,” he said.

SNC said fourth-quarter revenue at its engineering and construction business fell to C$2.49 billion from C$2.87 billion a year earlier.

The company wrote down C$1.2 billion ($910 million) in oil and gas assets, which resulted in a C$1.6 billion fourth-quarter loss.

SNC lowered its quarterly dividend by 18.7 Canadian cents per share to 10 Canadian cents, as it seeks to save C$131 million in cash annually.

It also reported a C$346 million loss related to a South American mining project, which analysts believe is Chilean state-run miner Codelco’s Chuquicamata copper mine.

SNC projected lower annual revenue from its metals and mining business, as it stops bidding on lump-sum projects going forward.

Excluding one-time items, the company reported a loss of C$1.62 per share. Analysts on average had expected C$1.19 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Earlier on Friday, Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said he wants to see a business like SNC Lavalin “continue to be successful.” ($1 = 1.3209 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by John Benny in Bengaluru and Allison Lampert in Montreal; Additional reporting by Julie Gordon in Ottawa Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar)","UPDATE 1-SNC Lavalin posts C$1.6 bln loss, cuts dividend as Saudi prospects worsen",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/snc-lavalin-results-idUSL3N20H43Q

The three firms are moving through a rigorous stage gate process having been selected from 19 applicants and 80 expressions of interest

Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL), one of Canada’s premier science and technology organizations, announced on 2/15/19 that two firms, Starcore Nuclear and Terrestrial Energy have successfully completed the pre-qualification stage of CNL’s invitation, and have been invited to enter the Due Diligence stage.

In these stages, CNL will evaluate with increased rigor, the technical and business merits of the proposed designs, assess the financial viability of the projects, and review the necessary national security and integrity requirements.

StarCore Nuclear’s proposed SMR design is a 14 MWe high-temperature gas reactor. StarCore is proposing to build reactors at both the Whiteshell and Chalk River sites.

Terrestrial Energy’s proposed SMR design is a 195 MWe integral molten salt reactor. CNL did not indicate what site(s) the firm has chosen if selected to build. In the US the firm has been looking at different candidate sites including the Idaho National Laboratory.

The firm Global First Power (GFP), with its key partners Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC), has progressed through the second stage of the invitation process, and has been invited to participate in preliminary, non-exclusive discussions regarding land arrangements, project risk management, and contractual terms (Stage 3). These negotiations are not an indication of project approval, and the proposal and proponent must satisfy further stringent evaluation.

GFP/OPG/USNC Team’s proposed SMR design is a 5 MWe high-temperature gas reactor.

The fourth and final stage, Project Execution, would include construction, testing and commissioning, operation and ultimately decommissioning of the SMR unit.

All of these projects are subject to regulatory processes and requirements. The licensing process with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) is independent of CNL’s invitation and evaluation stages. Should a project advance to a license application, proponents will be required to undertake meaningful project engagement with the public and Indigenous communities. CNSC is currently conducting pre-licensing vendor reviews with a number of SMR developers.

Background on CNL SMR Program

In June 2017 CNL set the ambitious goal of siting an SMR on a CNL-managed site by 2026. To achieve this, CNL launched a Request for Expressions of Interest to gather input and feedback from stakeholders across Canada and internationally. CNL received 80 responses from academia, energy utilities, potential end users, host communities, and the nuclear supply chain.

Included in those responses were 19 formal responses from technology developers interested in building a prototype or demonstration reactor at a CNL site. Based in part on that strong response, CNL moved forward with announcing a staged invitation process for those vendors interested in siting their demonstration unit. Even as this work is ongoing, the deployment of small modular reactors in Canada is still several years away. .

The proposed flexibility of operations for these new designs enables a wide range of end uses, including pairing SMRs with intermittent renewable sources such as solar or wind energy to ensure grid reliability. In addition to electricity production, the energy from an SMR could be used for the production of hydrogen, for local area heating, or in industrial processes which require heat or steam.

Holtec’s SMR-160 Attracts Support in Ukraine and US

(WNN) Holtec International has made progress with its work on an SMR-160 system through agreements with Energoatom and Exelon Generation announced during the winter meeting of the Holtec Advisory Council for SMR-160, held on 2/8/10 in Jupiter, Florida.

The SMR-160 application is under review by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and is in Phase 1 of the three-phase evaluation cycle. State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine, the nuclear regulatory authority in Ukraine, is expected to coordinate its regulatory assessment of SMR-160 under a collaborative arrangement with its Canadian counterpart.

At the same meeting, Holtec signed a memorandum of understanding with Exelon Generation, adding Exelon to the SMR-160 team, which currently includes SNC-Lavalin and Mitsubishi Electric.

Chris Mudrick, Exelon Generation senior vice president, Northeast Operations, said in the Holtec statement:

“As the largest nuclear operator in the United States, Exelon Generation is pleased to partner with Holtec to develop an operating model for the SMR-160. This project is a great example of how innovation and new technologies are bringing our industry together and driving the future of nuclear power.”

Under the terms of the MoU, Exelon Generation plans to support SMR-160’s market acceptance, develop a generic deployment schedule and staffing plan, and assist to improve its operability and maintainability features, Holtec said. As SMR-160s are built around the globe, Exelon Generation could provide reactor operating services to customers that lack an established nuclear industrial infrastructure, it added.

Exelon’s move to sign on to support the molten salt project is the second by a US nuclear utility. Southern Nuclear is working with a consortium of developers, including TerraPower, to develop a molten salt reactor.

Holtec describes the SMR-160 as a “passive, intrinsically safe, secure and economical” small modular reactor that has the flexibility to be used in remote locations, in areas with limited water supplies or land, and in unique industrial applications where traditional larger reactors are not practical.

The Holtec meeting was led by the incoming chairman, Michael Rencheck, CEO of Bruce Power, Canada, and attended by invited industry experts from several leading organisations, including Bruce Power, Energoatom, Entergy, Exelon Generation, Southern, Talen Energy, NEI, SNC-Lavalin, Mitsubishi Electric, and several major suppliers. The international contingent consisted of business and technology leaders from Canada, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates.

Holtec Technology Development Partners

On February 14, 2018, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH), Global Nuclear Fuel (GNF), Holtec International and SMR LLC announced a collaboration to advance the SMR-160 small modular reactor primarily in the area of fuel development.

The firm also has a joint development agreement with SNC Lavalin and Mitsubishi. Under the agreement, SNC-Lavalin will provide Holtec with a range of nuclear engineering services, including supporting the licensing of the SMR-160 reactor. While the SMR-160 is based on light water reactor technology, it should be noted that SNC-Lavalin is the parent company of Candu Energy.

In August 2015, Mitsubishi signed a long-term partnership agreement with Holtec to develop the instrumentation and control systems for the SMR-160. Holtec has previously secured engineering, design and qualification support for its work on the SMR-160 from the Shaw Group and URS Corporation.

UK-Japan Venture Seeks to Build an HTGR in UK

The firm Penultimate Power has agreed to form a joint venture with the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) to build a novel small modular reactor in the UK to provide power and process heat for heavy industry according to a trade press report.

The partners want to build a 10 MWe high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor (HTGR) in the North East of England, based an R&D design that has been running in Japan since 1998.

Ian Fells, technical director at Penultimate Power and former consultant to the UK Atomic Energy Authority, said the venture is seeking approvals from authorities and he expects the £500m (US$651m) plant will be constructed within the coming 48 months.

The firm has ambitious goals for its HTGR.

“We talk about distributed electricity generation with wind, solar and biomass generation,” says Fells. “Now we’re talking about distributed nuclear generation.”

At this power rating the unit will likely be built as an R&D project to demonstrate the feasibility of the technology. Also, developers haven’t addressed how they plan to license the unit nor take it through the UK GDR process for safety review and environmental assessment.

Long term plans include scaling up the technology to 100 MWe, and building a factory, preferably in Teesside, to construct the modular plants for use across the UK. Though Fells said a timeline for this has not yet been agreed.

The UK Government’s support for SMRs has been a disappointment for developers. It launched a £250m competition in 2015 aimed at commercializing the technology but in 2017 scaled back its ambitions, announcing it would offer just £44m to prove the feasibility of a wider set of designs and then for development activities.

In other SMR news NuScale has said it aims to deploy its SMR design in the UK with the first 60 MWe units aimed for operation in the mid-2020s. Rolls-Royce has submitted design plans to the government for a 220 MWe unit.

Note to readers: AAAS Science Magazine has this week published a terrific article on NuScale with first rate writing and stunning graphics.

China has been developing a 230 MW HTGR with two units attached to a single turbine. However, according to some reports, plans to build 20 of them for domestic use have been postponed in order to revamp the design to be more efficient.

RAB Financing Model Could Attract

Private Investment To Nuclear Energy Projects

(NucNet): The regulated asset base financing model (RAB) for nuclear power plants could attract private investment in the sector because investors are able to see a fixed rate of return as the project is being built, Harminder Singh, a power analyst at London-based data and analytics company GlobalData told NucNet in an email.

Mr Singh said the key problem that RAB addresses is that of the high cost of capital for nuclear power projects. He said the RAB model has been used in other infrastructure sectors in the UK, such as the £4.2bn Thames super sewer project, to provide “comfort to investors in private utilities, especially in water”.

But he warned that the RAB model could shift the risk from the developers to consumers, leading to higher electricity bills.

“The model has so far not been used for projects as expensive as nuclear power plants, which is seen as a key cause for concern.”

The UK government is said to be considering RAB financing for new nuclear following recent decisions by Hitachi to suspend the Wylfa nuclear project in Wales and by

RAB financing is essentially a type of contract drawn up with the backing of government, which calculates the costs and profits of a project before it is started, and allocates an investor’s profits from day one.

514,Empty,2019-02-21T09:00:10Z,"Former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould was not formally a lawyer in the eyes of the legal profession at the time the decision was made to continue with the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on charges of fraud and corruption, CBC News has learned.","This story has been rewritten from a previous version based on new information. Please see correction note at the end.

Former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould can practice law, after all, by virtue of an honorary membership in the Law Society of Ontario.

While her name does not appear in the society's public database initially consulted by CBC News, law society spokeswoman Susan Tonkin confirmed late Thursday afternoon that Wilson-Raybould was called to the Ontario bar in June 2016 under a special clause reserved for those who have served as justice minister, attorney general or solicitor general of Canada.

However, Tonkin refused to say whether the honorary membership means Wilson-Raybould benefits from the solicitor-client privilege accorded regular members of the bar.

""As the regulator of Ontario's legal professions, the Law Society doesn't interpret the law.""

The honorary membership came six months after Wilson-Raybould let her membership in British Columbia's law society lapse, and seven months after she was sworn in as federal justice minister. That means there was a period of six months in 2016 when she wouldn't have formally been allowed to practice law.

Her successor, David Lametti, is listed as a member of the Quebec and Ontario bars.

Wilson-Raybould's office has not responded to questions from CBC News about her law society status.

Wilson-Raybould has been at the centre of a political maelstrom in recent days — citing solicitor-client privilege in her refusal to comment on reports that she was pressured by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office to tell prosecutors to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with Quebec-based construction giant SNC-Lavalin.

Under a DPA or remediation agreement, a company can settle criminal charges by agreeing to take certain actions, such as paying a fine or changing its practices.

If convicted, SNC-Lavalin could be barred from competing for federal government contracts for up to a decade.

Wilson-Raybould has hired retired Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell to advise her on what she can disclose. Opposition critics have called for the government to waive solicitor-client privilege in her case.

The controversy has shone a spotlight on the concept of solicitor-client privilege and exposed a wide range of expert opinions on the circumstances in which it would apply — particularly in the case of an attorney general.

One expert says even a non-lawyer can be bound by solicitor-client privilege if they're serving as an attorney-general — with the government itself as a client.

Andrew Flavelle Martin, assistant professor at the Peter Allard School of Law at the University of British Columbia, said a non-lawyer attorney general is the one person who can provide legal advice without being a member of a law society.

While most people named attorney general at the federal or provincial level have been practicing lawyers, it's not a requirement and there have been non-lawyer AGs in the past.

""So she's right to say that solicitor-client privilege prevents her from talking because she was providing legal advice,"" Martin said.

The question of whether conversations between Wilson-Raybould and the government are covered by solicitor-client privilege may not boil down to whether she is a member of a law society.

Gavin MacKenzie, author of Lawyers and Ethics: Professional Responsibility and Discipline, said the question of solicitor-client privilege in Wilson-Raybould's case hinges on what role she was playing at the time.

Advising the government on a legal question — such as whether a proposed measure is constitutional — would be covered by solicitor-client privilege, said MacKenzie. That wouldn't be the case, he said, with decisions that have to be made by attorneys general themselves, such as whether to continue a prosecution.

""Generally speaking, conversations with others in government about those decisions aren't subject to solicitor-client privilege, whether she is a member of the law society or not. Those are functions of the attorney general that are separate.""

Kent Roach, a law professor at the University of Toronto, said the advice an attorney general offers the government is usually the result of the work of many lawyers.

""Even if you assume that the attorney general was not herself acting as a lawyer, I think in most cases there's going to be senior officials in the room whose advice the attorney general is relying upon,"" he said. ""And so it would seem to me that in those situations you probably would still have attorney-client privilege.

""It has not, to my knowledge, been authoritatively resolved.""

With that said, some observations.

At the very heart of the matter, of course, are the charges faced by SNC-Lavalin, a Montreal-based global engineering and construction firm with about 50,000 employees worldwide, and two of its wholly owned subsidiaries.

The charges the companies face — as opposed to those some of its former senior executives face or have faced — are bribing a foreign public official (under the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act) and fraud (under the Criminal Code of Canada).

The offences are alleged to have occurred between 2001 and 2011 in relation to SNC construction contracts in Libya; the charges were laid on Feb. 19, 2015.

The RCMP alleges the companies paid almost $48 millon to Libyan public officials to influence government decisions and allegedly defrauded Libyan organizations of about another $130 million.

Publicly available documents at the Federal Court of Canada and elsewhere make it obvious that SNC-Lavalin from virtually the moment the charges were laid was putting if not all, then most, of its eggs in one basket — the hope of what’s often called a “deferred prosecution agreement” (DPA). Former SNC-Lavalin CEO Robert Card mentioned such agreements favourably publicly as early as May of 2015, even though DPAs weren’t even available in Canada at the time.

How about just doing business in countries where companies aren’t expected to bribe and grease their way to lucrative contracts?

The company ramped up its lobbying of government officials — the Globe and Mail has reported that in 2017, company representatives met government officials and MPs more than 50 times, including 14 visits with staff in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office.

And happily enough, in the fall of that year, the government launched brief consultations on DPAs, in Canada called “remediation agreements.”

The great advantage of DPAs to corporations is that it allows them to negotiate a resolution to a criminal prosecution without the unpleasantness of an admission of guilt — or the potential “disbarment” from doing business with the federal government for as long as 10 years.

By February of last year, the agreements were in the budget, the Criminal Code amendments were enacted in June and came into effect on Sept. 21.

SNC was all but slavering with eagerness. According to Federal Court documents, the company contacted lawyers at the Public Prosecution Service in April, months before the legislation even passed.

For the next three months, lawyers for SNC said in the documents, the company handed over all sorts of information, significantly that since 2012, when the events in Libya first came to light, SNC-Lavalin had implemented “a world-class ethics and compliance program,” completely replaced its senior management and board of directors, and dismissed “senior officers who could be considered as having been even remotely associated” with the unfortunate Libya activities.

Generally speaking, one doesn’t badger someone else for an invitation, whether to dinner or anything else. One is either invited, or not.

It wanted a damn invitation to negotiate a damn remediation agreement.

You can imagine the corporate horror when on Oct. 9 last year, Richard Roy, counsel for the director of prosecutions Kathleen Roussel, wrote SNC lawyers that Roussel had determined “a remediation agreement is not appropriate in this case” and that she was declining to “issue an invitation.”

That seems fair enough: Generally speaking, one doesn’t badger someone else for an invitation, whether to dinner or anything else. One is either invited, or not.

In the email, Roy reminded them Roussel had made her decision on Sept. 4, as they had been told.

What then was the prime minister doing, as he has acknowledged doing, meeting Wilson-Raybould about two weeks later, on Sept. 17? Remember, this was the meeting where the PM has said he told the former attorney-general the decision — whether she would in effect overrule prosecutors and instruct Roussel to make the deal — was hers to make.

Regardless, within 10 days of the Oct. 9 email, even as SNC’s preliminary hearing on the charges was underway (it appears to be over, but the judge hasn’t issued a decision yet on whether it will proceed to trial), company lawyers were in Federal Court, seeking judicial review of Roussel’s decision and an order compelling her to invite the company to begin negotiating a remediation agreement.

Lawyers for Roussel have since asked the court to strike the application.

(The argument here is really about whether Roussel has the discretion to make the decision she did, and whether her determination is reviewable.)

There are a couple of telling paragraphs in the SNC factum for the judicial review, wherein the lawyers point out that DPAs — not exactly the same as the Canadian regime, but close — have been around in the United States for almost three decades and in the United Kingdom for five.

“According to various public sources,” the lawyers say, “numerous large, multi-national businesses, including various competitors (of SNC-Lavalin), have availed themselves of deferred prosecution agreements … in other jurisdictions…”

It’s analogous to the arguments for doping in sport: The other guys are doing it, so we have to in order to be competitive.

How about just doing business in countries where companies aren’t expected to bribe and grease their way to lucrative contracts? How about being a little less global? There’s no conscription, after all, for companies to work in places like Libya.

“The markets have probably overreacted recently,” said Caisse chief executive Michael Sabia of SNC-Lavalin. “This represents an investment opportunity.” In addition to its run-in with the courts, SNC-Lavalin, set to release its fourth quarter results on Friday, has offered up unwelcome surprises for investors since late January by slashing its earnings forecasts twice. The Montreal-based company is facing challenges at a mining project in Chile as well as instability in Saudi Arabia due to diplomatic tensions between Ottawa and Riyadh.

The uncertainty comes amidst the company’s ongoing fraud and corruption case in Canada tied to alleged crimes committed in Libya between 2001 and 2011. A conviction could prevent SNC-Lavalin from bidding on federal contracts for up to 10 years. The gauntlet of woes has tanked the company’s share price, which now hovers at around $35 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

It’s about big changes in culture.” SNC-Lavalin is embroiled in a controversy in Ottawa over allegations that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office pressured the former justice minister to steer federal prosecutors toward negotiations for a settlement agreement with the firm in order to avoid criminal prosecution.

Sabia said the Caisse would “be a rock” for SNC-Lavalin and ready to boost its stake in the company, barring any technical barriers.

SNC-Lavalin may also face criminal charges in connection to a contract from the early 2000s to refurbish Montreal’s Jacques Cartier Bridge, court documents show.
