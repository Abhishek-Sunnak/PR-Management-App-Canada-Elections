Elections Alberta reports that 403,000 voters had cast ballots by end of day Thursday, with Friday and Saturday still to go. That's more than the populations of Airdrie, Okotoks, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, Lethbridge and Leduc put together.

During the first three days of advance voting in the last provincial election in 2015, roughly 162,000 ballots were cast.

Mount Royal University political scientist Lori Williams says it's a mistake to read too much into the high turnout numbers because advance voting doesn't necessarily predict what happens on election day.

""It's really difficult to know what's motivating the people who are voting, whether it's awareness, whether it's anger, whether it's fear,"" she said.

Williams says there's a good chance voter turnout will be high because it's been a highly competitive, hard-fought race with stark choices on the ballot.

Unlike previous years, Albertans can cast their ballots at any advance poll location in the province, instead of just their assigned polling station. But those ""vote anywhere"" ballots will not be counted until 1 p.m. the following day.

On election day, voters must cast ballots in the ridings where they live.

Duane Bratt, a political scientist at Mount Royal University in Calgary, says that might be driving up the turnout.

""You now can go to all sorts of places, whether it's Mount Royal University, the Calgary airport, and vote no matter where you live"" in the advance polls, he said.

Bratt says research suggests people who vote early were already going to vote anyway, and prefer the convenience to standing in line on election day.

Voting hours vary from location to location, with most advance polling locations open from 9 a.m. until 8 p.m. through Saturday.

1,Canada,2019-04-13T03:44:00.0000000Z,“So the question of what happens to carbon taxes in Alberta and Canada won’t be solved by Alberta’s election one way or the other; it’s going to be determined by the federal election later ...,"The Alberta carbon levy was a contentious issue even before the election was called. It then became a hot topic and buzz word on the campaign trail.

But how well is it understood? What does it mean for Albertans? And, are misconceptions being politicized to infuriate or rally voters?

Is the carbon tax ‘a cash grab’?

“We need to recognize that the NDP’s carbon tax is just a cash grab,” UCP leader Jason Kenney said during the April 4 leaders debate. “All economic pain and no environmental gain.”

Alberta’s consumer carbon tax came into effect Jan. 1, 2017. The levy is charged on all fuels that emit greenhouse gases when combusted at a rate of $20 per tonne in 2017 and $30 per tonne in 2018. The federal carbon tax took effect April 1, 2019, applying to provinces that refused to impose their own emissions pricing.

READ MORE: How will Alberta’s carbon tax impact consumers?

Economist Trevor Tombe says one of the biggest misconceptions of the carbon tax is that it doesn’t really do anything.

“You often hear a statement that, ‘It’s all economic pain and no environmental gain,’ for example. But there’s a lot of evidence, from B.C. in particular — who’s had a carbon tax for the past 10 years or so — that people do respond to price increases.

“When things get more expensive, you try to shift into other things, not everyone of course, but overall,” said Tombe, who works out of the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy.

“Based on the B.C. experience, emissions in Alberta may fall between five and 15 per cent lower than they would be without the carbon tax.”

Watch below (Nov. 23, 2017): Alberta’s carbon tax is set to go up in the New Year. There are some big claims making the rounds on social media about exactly how hard it will hit Albertans in the wallet. Tom Vernon sets the record straight.

Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission, a non-partisan group of academics and business leaders focused on economic and environmental solutions, just published a report on carbon tax misconceptions.

The worst, the head of the commission says, is that a carbon tax doesn’t work.

“If you look at B.C., if you look at California, if you look at the U.K., if you look at Quebec, these policies do work. What they don’t do is work overnight,” Chris Ragan says.

At least five different published studies have found British Columbia’s carbon tax, introduced in 2008, has cut overall emissions, reduced per capita gasoline use by seven per cent, improved average vehicle efficiency by four per cent, cut residential natural gas use by seven per cent and diesel use by more than three per cent.

Meanwhile, the province enjoyed about three per cent annual economic growth between 2012 and 2017.

Energy economists such as Mark Jaccard at B.C.’s Simon Fraser University argue that regulations get faster, bigger results and are politically easier to enact (as opposed to a tax). The big cuts to Canada’s carbon emissions, he said, have come from closing coal-fired power plants and clean fuel rules.

“Some people will tell you you have to have carbon pricing,” he said on a recent podcast. “That’s not true. You could do it all through regulations.”

Is it a ‘massive’ expense for Albertans?

Tombe thinks this is the other broadly misunderstood aspect of Alberta’s consumer carbon tax.

“That it will add thousands of dollars per year in household costs of living. We see claims along those lines very often.”

READ MORE: Alberta Election Fact Check: UCP says NDP hid carbon tax from Albertans in 2015

In Alberta, the $30/tonne levy is applied on fuel purchases like gasoline (for filling vehicles) and natural gas consumption (for heating buildings).

“For the average household, it increases annual costs by about $450 per year or so,” Tombe said. “That’s counterbalanced by a refundable tax credit — $300 for an individual, it’s higher for a family, it grows with the number of children, it can be as high as $550 per year.

“So the net effect of both of those policy changes for the majority of Alberta households is fairly modest.”

Albertans earning less than $47,500 a year and families earning less than $95,00 a year get a full rebate. The NDP estimates 60 per cent of Alberta households qualify for a full or partial rebate.

Rebates are automatically applied to Alberta residents who file tax returns and meet the income criteria.

In the #abdebate, Jason Kenney claims the savings from a CTax would be $1,150. This is wrong. Here's research on CTax costs in Alberta (the UCP platform cites this research too). https://t.co/mIbbyJTK1R — Trevor Tombe (@trevortombe) April 5, 2019

How much does the carbon tax cost businesses and commercial facilities?

“It really depends on the age of your building, the size of your building and so on,” Tombe said. “But roughly speaking, on average, the amount of natural gas that’s used for heating commercial building spaces is about 1 gigajoule of natural gas per square metre, for example. The carbon tax is $1.51 per gigajoule.

“Based on how large your space is, you’re looking at about $1.50 per square metre in heating cost from the carbon tax.”

Watch below (April 18, 2017): the province provided details on energy efficiency rebates available to Albertans. They’re part of a climate strategy that includes a carbon levy. Tom Vernon looks at where revenues are going.

Can Alberta just not have a carbon tax?

Kenney has said one of the first things a UCP government would do, if elected April 16, would be eliminate Alberta’s consumer carbon tax.

“That would be extremely easy to eliminate,” Tombe said.

“It could be done as quickly as legislation could pass through the house. The most time-consuming process of eliminating the carbon tax in Alberta would be to actually have the legislation written and passed. But once that’s done, it could be done overnight.”

But Albertans themselves would still be faced with a carbon tax — a federal one. On April 1, 2019 the federal government applied a levy to every province that hadn’t already implemented their own form of carbon tax.

No province would have two carbon taxes, but if Alberta got rid of its own levy, the federal one would kick in.

“If a province were to withdraw its own price on carbon — as we’ve seen Manitoba do, for example, or more recently, Ontario — if Alberta were to eliminate its charge on fuel, then we would see very shortly after that the federal government come in and impose its carbon tax,” Tombe explained.

“So the question of what happens to carbon taxes in Alberta and Canada won’t be solved by Alberta’s election one way or the other; it’s going to be determined by the federal election later on in the year.”

Alberta’s carbon tax translates to six cents a litre of gasoline. The federal tax is four cents a litre.

Watch below: On Day 14 of the Alberta election campaign, the United Conservative Party took aim at the federal carbon tax.

Martin Olszynski, a University of Calgary law professor, said all Ottawa would have to do is pass an order in council to bring Alberta under the same federal tax that recently came into effect in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick. None of those provinces had its own tax.

“It’s a matter of getting cabinet together and writing the order,” Olszynski said.

Looking to the courts to block Ottawa’s tax is an iffy bet, he suggested.

In court hearings on Saskatchewan’s anti-tax constitutional challenge, Olszynski said, judges asked if allowing Ottawa to regulate greenhouse gases as a matter of “national concern” would impede provincial efforts to do the same.

Fact check: Does the federal carbon tax leave 8 out of 10 families better off?

“If you recognize this matter as a matter of national concern, you would strip away the provincial ability to regulate these things,” he summarized.

But Olszynski notes that courts have recognized that many issues – especially environmental ones – are best managed jointly between national and provincial governments.

Other federal arguments in favour of a national carbon tax are backed by decades of case law, Olszynski added.

Why has the carbon tax become politically volatile?

On the provincial level, the UCP are campaigning on a promise to scrap it. Kenney has said he would sue Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government if he tries to impose the federal carbon tax in Alberta.

NDP leader Rachel Notley says the carbon tax is a way to protect the future. She says the NDP’s rebate plan is working and the air is getting cleaner — that the party’s approach has already reduced greenhouse gases by seven megatons. The tax, she says, is paying for projects like public transit and flood protection.

The carbon tax has undoubtedly become a divisive political issue and one parties are capitalizing on in the hopes of motivating voters.

“The carbon tax is unpopular and it’s unpopular because it is visible,” Tombe said.

“GST is also not popular. Think back to the federal election after Brian Mulroney introduced the GST. The then-Liberal government campaigned strongly against the GST, a very unpopular tax because we see it on a regular basis… you’re exposed to it, you’re reminded of it all the time,” Tombe added.

READ MORE: Alberta to implement carbon tax in climate change policy

Political scientist Duane Bratt believes there are a few reasons it’s coming up time and again on the election campaign trail.

“I would say the first is the way the NDP sold it,” Bratt said.

“There could have been lots of reasons to have a carbon tax, but they directly linked it to social license for pipelines and the pipelines haven’t been built yet. That’s the problem that the NDP is having.

“It’s very possible, I believe, that the pipeline eventually will be built in due part to the introduction of the carbon tax. But that doesn’t matter for this election because they’re getting the pain without the benefit,” Bratt said.

Another factor, he says, is timing: when the tax was implement in the context of the economic climate.

“I believe the NDP, after they were elected, didn’t think the recession would last as long as it did. Most experts were looking at two years, not four years,” Bratt said. “That’s another problem that they’ve had; just the economic downturn combined with a brand-new tax.”

Watch below (Oct. 5, 2018): Ontario Premier Doug Ford is in Alberta Friday to speak out against the federal carbon tax plan. Jason Kenney will be with him at a rally in Calgary. Tom Vernon reports.

He said his party will build and modernize hospitals, shorten wait times and provide predictable funding to ensure Albertans get the care they need.

“Nothing makes me more proud to be Albertan than our health-care system. When you need the system the most, it’s there for you,” he said.

“But we also need to watch our costs. Health care is a huge cost and important as we have an aging and increasingly complex society. We need to plan and be strategic now, so that every dollar we put into the system goes where it’s needed, helping Albertans get better, stay healthy and have quality of life.”

He said the party would build more non-acute care beds outside hospitals and improve home-care options.

The Alberta Party said it will save $200 million by halting the NDP’s plan to buy laundry machines for AHS. The party will also review the NDP’s plan for a medical superlab in Edmonton, with “the aim to cancel it,” Mandel said.

Now, she wants politicians to listen.

The 50-year-old Edmonton woman said she's excited to cast her ballot in Alberta's provincial election on April 16, because it's a way for her to advocate for her community.

More than 5,000 Albertans struggle with homelessness, and about 90 per cent of them are of eligible voting age, according to statistics from Homeward Trust.

The province's new Election Act, which governs this year's election, aims to make voting more accessible for all Albertans, including those experiencing homelessness.

Got a question about the election? Ask us. Text ""ELECTION"" to 587-857-5055 and we'll get back to you with the answer

Under the new act, regulations dictating voter eligibility have relaxed, and Elections Alberta plans to set up polling stations in homeless shelters across the province on election day including Edmonton's Boyle Street Community Services, the Mustard Seed in Calgary, the Neighbours Outreach Wetaskiwin and the Camrose Women's Shelter.

With voting booths inside shelters, homeless voters who struggle to move around will have an easier time grabbing hold of a ballot, said Drew Westwater, Elections Alberta's chief elections officer

""We tried to make [voting] as easy as possible for all Albertans this year,"" he said.

People who don't have a fixed address or an identification card are also able to vote this year.

A new form available at shelter polling stations allows staff to vouch for their clients. They can list the shelter they're affiliated with in lieu of a residential address or ID.

People struggling with homelessness feel 'unheard'

Despite Elections Alberta's efforts to make voting more accessible, there is still a lack of candidates visiting homeless shelters during the campaign.

As a result, homeless voters still feel unheard, MacKenzie said.

She said candidates haven't spent enough time getting to know homeless constituents, making it difficult for her community to get involved in politics.

""If [candidates] were really listening, so many people wouldn't be falling through the cracks of our system.""

Listen to The Ledge podcast, as CBC's legislative reporters bring you expert analysis and insiders' insight

Only one candidate, the Alberta Party's Bob Philp, has visited Boyle Street during the campaign.

Philp doubles as a member of the shelter's board of directors, but took a leave of absence for the election.

Bringing elections to the homeless

Philp's colleague, Alberta Party candidate Colette Smithers, was 50 when she found herself without a home.

Smithers acknowledged politicians need to engage with marginalized populations more and said she's thrilled to hear Elections Alberta will introduce polling stations to shelters.

""There's so much shame and doubt and feelings of not belonging that comes with this situation of being homeless that they won't take the step out for fear of being shamed and embarrassed,"" she said.

""To have something as important as an election come to you, come to your space where you're comfortable … it's just magic.""

Across Alberta, people experiencing homelessness make up less than one per cent of the population. But advocates and community leaders believe politicians need to reach out to voters struggling with homelessness regardless.

Elliott Tanti, Boyle Street's communications lead, knows nearly all of the centre's clients by name.

When asked why politicians should care about the centre, Tanti urged people to remember everyone could risk homelessness at some point.

""[Homelessness] is one of the most pertinent issues in our society … in this election, we're talking about jobs and the economy and those sorts of issues. Well, when things don't go well, this is the last place [Albertans] end up. This is where people have to go. This is it,"" Tanti said.

Tanti said homeless people who don't have access to phones or computers might have a harder time staying informed because many political parties post information on social media and online.

While shelters do what they can to help their clients access political resources, face-to-face interactions between homeless Albertans and candidates would help.

Joanna Neuman, who started helping others at Boyle Street after overcoming homelessness herself, still doesn't know if she's going to vote in this year's election.

""That's another reason I sometimes don't want to vote. No matter who you vote for, nine times out of 10 they don't follow everything,"" Neuman said. ""I really think [candidates] should come down here, give a little speech, or just come in for lunch. Volunteer for a day. Do something.""

'It's about time we are appreciated for who we are'

MacKenzie said keeping up with politics is important to her and she's not the only one at Boyle Street who plans to vote.

She had a message for candidates.

""You want to come and say you want to speak and be my voice, then you need to hear our voices as well,"" she said.

Any or all of those things are “very likely,” Canada’s electronic spy agency said in a report released this week.

Political parties, candidates and their staff have already been targeted, according to the Communications Security Establishment (CSE).

Meantime, Australia’s director of its security intelligence service reiterated his assessment this week that the threat of foreign interference in his country’s 2019 election as being “at an unprecedented level.” Already this year, the parliamentary systems and those of the three major political parties have been compromised.

And, that is despite — or perhaps because of — sweeping legislative changes made last year aimed at reducing foreign interference and a ban on foreign donations passed earlier this year.

Half of the established democracies that held elections last year experienced cyber-interference at triple the rate of three years ago. The report also mentions several instances when Canada was targeted in the past.

What’s “improbable,” CSE said, is that Canada will experience interference on the scale of Russian activity in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

No surprise there. Russia doesn’t care as much about Canada as the United States.

What is surprising is that there is no mention of China.

In late December, CSE issued a special bulletin a few weeks after Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was detained in Vancouver pending extradition to the United States on fraud charges.

“It is almost certain that actors likely associated with the People’s Republic of China ministry of state security are responsible for the compromise of several managed service providers beginning as early as 2016,” it said.

MSPs are companies like Bell, Rogers, Telus and IBM Canada — some of the same companies that already use Huawei equipment and have expressed interest in buying its 5G network gear.

Australian academic and ethicist Clive Hamilton questions the focus of the CSE report and says it is “disappointing” that it looks at election interference through a Russian lens.

“Russia is not a big problem for Canada. China is a much greater threat and it uses quite different methods of interference,” said Hamilton, who is currently in Canada doing research for a follow to his book, Silent Invasion: China’s Influence on Australia.

“Russia wants social disruption,” he said in an interview. “The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) wants to influence the stable U.S., Canadian and Australian systems. They don’t care who is in government as long as they can influence its decisions.”

Candyce Kelshall agrees. She is a fellow at Buckingham University’s Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies and an adjunct professor in Simon Fraser University’s Terrorism Risk and Security Studies program.

“China is very much a real and present danger,” she said in an interview. “However, the Chinese efforts are not designed with a clear intent that is malevolent in terms of influencing. … They’re more about controlling, maintaining, manipulating access with hardware, software and communications technology.”

Both suggest that the Chinese government has a long-term strategy to influence and control policies, if not governments, including those in Canada and Australia.

Hamilton calls it “Hongkongization” where slowly, slowly, institutions are eroded and ground is ceded to Chinese Communist Party control.

That’s what has happened since 1997 when control of Hong Kong reverted to China from Britain. And it’s what China is attempting in Australia where the people of Chinese descent account for about five per cent of the population, similar to Canada.

CCP-linked individuals, businesses and organizations in Australia have promoted candidates with some success. But mostly, they have bought or won over political elites, infiltrated political parties and campaigned in the Chinese community against candidates seen as “unfriendly” to the Chinese government (even if those candidates are of Chinese descent).

It has also been happening here for at least a couple of decades. In 2010, Richard Fadden, then head of CSIS, said at least two provincial cabinet ministers as well as other officials and employees in municipal and provincial governments were under foreign control. He singled out China.

Since then, Kelshall said Canada has been “sleep-walking” as CCP influence has grown.

While Hamilton, Fadden and others say it is not too late to mitigate the Chinese government’s influence, Kelshall pessimistically predicts that over the next 25 years the CCP will become Canada’s benevolent dictator — benevolent because there will be no war and its deep economic and financial ties will make it unwilling to disrupt any trade routes.

“The only way forward is strong, strategic involvement,” she said. “We need a much closer involvement because you know the saying, ‘Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.’”

For Kelshall and for the rest of us, the unanswered question is: “How could Canada have let this happen?”

B.C. — all of which went Liberal in the 2015 election, many flipping from the Conservatives.","It’s touted as the largest celebration of its kind outside India, drawing almost 500,000 people to mark the Sikh religion’s new year.

For politicians eager to tap into an electorally powerful ethnic group, the huge version of Khalsa Day in Surrey, B.C., is a veritable gold mine.

But barring a significant change of tune by the federal government over the next week, this year’s edition will impose an unprecedented policy. Unless certain demands are met, Liberal MPs will be barred from speaking from its stages on April 20, says organizer Moninder Singh.

“We’ve never had to take steps like this,” said the B.C. Gurdwara Council spokesman. “But we can’t be giving platforms where half a million people are out walking around, when we don’t see a genuine relationship being formed with the community.”

The threatened ban was over an issue causing growing consternation in the Sikh community: an annual Public Safety Canada report on terrorism that for the first time this December contained a small section on the alleged threat of Sikh extremism.

Community activists insist that violent support for the independence of Sikh-dominated Punjab state from India ended in the years after the 1985 Air India bombing, Canada’s worst-ever terror act — and call the report a smear job.

Critics see the hidden hand of India, allegedly manipulating Canada to malign a diaspora fixated on Punjab separation. The government says that’s hogwash, while others warn against politicians meddling in a report penned by independent security agencies. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale has apologized for language that he says inadvertently disparaged Sikhs.

Regardless, community activists say the issue could have major implications for Canadian politics, setting off a potentially seismic shift in a minority group with wildly disproportionate political muscle.

At stake are nine Sikh-dominated ridings – in the Toronto-area suburbs, Calgary and lower-mainland B.C. — all of which went Liberal in the 2015 election, many flipping from the Conservatives.

Another eight, mostly Liberal seats across the country could be decided by the Sikh vote if the races are “competitive,” says Jaskaran Singh Sandhu, executive director of the World Sikh Organization (WSO), while 18 more are susceptible to Sikh influence if particularly close.

“Nine seats make or break their (Liberal) majority,” said Sandhu. “Sikhs can decide that.”

There are already signs of trouble for the party: a slate of candidates tied to the fathers of two Liberal MPs was roundly defeated in a recent election for the board of North America’s largest Sikh temple. The winners contend Ottawa’s terror report was a factor; the losers say it was just about religion.

About 400 people crowded into a round-table meeting on the issue in Brampton, Ont., Sunday, grilling the lone Liberal MP — Ruby Sahota — who attended.

And more Khalsa Day parades and gurdwaras — Sikh temples — are considering bans of their own on Liberal politicians speaking if the report is not changed, said B.C.’s Singh.

Other Sikhs, though, question whether there is a movement afoot, or just some very vocal leaders concerned about a niche matter.

“My sense is that it is a dead issue,“ says Ujjal Dosanjh, a former Liberal cabinet minister who has long crossed swords with the Punjabi separatist — or Khalistani — movement.

Shinder Purewal, both a political scientist at B.C.’s Kwantlen Polytechnic University and now a Conservative federal candidate, believes the south Asian community generally is souring on the Liberals, and shares others’ misgivings about the terror report. But he doesn’t expect it to play a big role in the Oct. 21 election.

“I don’t think that is one of the burning issues,” Purewal said. “People have the impression that immigrant communities have a separate agenda from other Canadians. They don’t. They care about the same issues.”

No one can question, though, that the Sikh community has some considerable political weight to throw around.

Recent elections have produced 18 Sikh MPs, including four cabinet ministers and a party leader. All from a minority community of 500,000 — barely one per cent of Canada’s population.

Canadians of Hindu Indian descent actually outnumber them, but Hindus and other south-Asian subgroups have not had the same influence politically.

That out-sized activism and clout stems partly from Sikh Canadians’ concentration in a relatively few ridings. But there may be another, more philosophical explanation, too. The religion melds the spiritual and secular in a way that encourages political service as an extension of the community-giving expected of followers, argues Sandhu.

Purewal says such an intersection of godly and earthly is common in many religions, and suggests that Sikh history — including a need to repulse a succession of invaders who targeted the Punjab — may be a better explanation for high levels of political engagement.

Whatever their reasons for getting involved, Sikhs have traditionally voted Liberal, the party they see as generally more friendly to immigrants and immigration, said Singh, though he adds they are becoming more discriminating. Purewal says the wave of Sikh support for Liberals in 2015 was largely a reaction to the Conservatives’ legislation stripping citizenship from dual citizens convicted of terrorism.

Regardless, the terror report in December was, for some Sikh leaders at least, a rude awakening after a spate of political victories.

“We thought we’d finally arrived,” Balpreet Singh, legal counsel for the World Sikh Organization, told Sunday’s town hall. “(But) what we’ve seen in the last year has been a wound to the Sikh community we haven’t seen in decades.”

The complaints centre around the document’s reference to “Sikh (Khalistani) extremism” — seen as defaming an entire, peaceful community rather than singling out a specific entity — and the lack of any evidence to support the claim of present danger. The report mentions the Air India bombing 33 years ago and two terror groups critics say have long been inactive.

Singh believes the passage stems from a counter-terrorism co-operation agreement signed between Canadian and Indian national-security czars last year, as well as the government’s desire to improve fractured relations with New Delhi.

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh suggested the report is having a “massive” effect on Sikh politics, and warned it could spark hate crimes.

“This is the type of report by the government … that is going to result in people saying, ‘Well, if Sikhs are terrorists, then maybe we should take action,’ ” he told the town hall. “That is deeply offensive.”

Conservative Garnett Genuis, though an MP from Alberta, also attended the Brampton meeting and earned generous applause when he defended the right to peacefully advocate for Punjab independence.

Sahota voiced her own concerns about the report’s language, and the lack of clarity on why Khalistanis were suddenly included after years of silence. But in a spirited defence of her government, she stressed the document was the product of independent security services, not the party.

“We can’t take it to a point where we are politically interfering with our intelligence agencies,” the Brampton North MP said. “This didn’t wind up in there by accident … Obviously there is a reason.”

Goodale has said future iterations would not reference Sikh extremism but only “extremists who support violent means to establish an independent state within India.” He has not, though, disavowed the issue’s inclusion in the report.

Asked about the lack of backup evidence, a spokesman for the minister said: “Intelligence can precede criminal charges or other law enforcement action that would result in further public disclosure.”

Meanwhile, Dosanjh says he’s appalled by the Liberal MPs of Sikh background who publicly talk down the report’s Khalistani section.

“It’s horrifying to see,” he said. “Politicians have to rise above pandering and look to the national interest.”

Organizers of the Surrey Khalsa view things rather differently. They say the government must commit to re-issuing December’s report without the mention of Sikhs as a menace — or forget about politicking at the April 20 parade.

This being 2019, opponents of the report have made their demand clear, in a Twitter slogan: #ProveitorRemoveit .

Senior EU diplomats expect “Russia-based organizations” to ...","Canada could stand to benefit from the legwork done by Europe to crack down on social media companies, says the European Union's ambassador to Canada.

Peteris Ustubs described the EU's Code of Practice on Disinformation — which was recently mentioned by Canada's Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould — as the product of an extensive process that ultimately succeeded at getting big players like Facebook, Google and Twitter to sign on.

The EU code encourages social media companies to suppress disinformation on their platforms and boost transparency through regular reporting. The European Commission has said it has resulted in fake accounts being removed, and ""meaningful progress in a number of areas, in particular on political ads transparency tools"" that all platforms are now making available ahead of European Parliament elections beginning May 23.

Twitter, for example, expanded its political campaigning ads policy in February to cover all EU member states, it noted in a report to the commission, and restricted campaign ads to only certified advertisers after March 11.

It's up to Canada to decide how it wants to engage with the companies, Ustubs said Friday. But if the Trudeau government wants to adopt the EU's social media-endorsed rules, they're available and ready to be copied, he explained.

“We were very pleased to welcome Minister Gould in this room, with all the EU ambassadors, in order to discuss our practices and our co-operation, and what the European Union has done so far on electoral processes, making sure that there is no interference, and how we actually deal with the platforms,"" Ustubs said April 12, at the EU delegation's office in Ottawa.

""For the European Union, the engagement with platforms took quite a while, so it was quite a long process. We established several working groups, not only internal ones but specifically with the platforms, in order to come together and try to craft the (Code of Practice) for the elections. That process was completed last year, and we are very pleased to make sure that that (code) is also accessible to Canada. But it would be for Canada to decide.""

Brussels put the rules in place last fall following reports of election interference in EU member countries, and ahead of the next EU Parliament vote. Senior EU diplomats expect “Russia-based organizations” to attempt to influence the vote by “hacking into institutions and spreading fake news,"" the Financial Times reported.

Facebook, Google and Twitter have all taken steps to beef up defences when it comes to election integrity, and all say they want to ensure people can access accurate information and avoid misleading reports or manipulation.

But Gould has said she would like to see more done by the platforms. On Monday, following a report from the national electronic spy agency that said Canadians are “very likely” to be targeted by foreign meddling in connection with the 2019 federal election in October, she raised the prospect of the platforms applying the EU's code to Canada.

""I would have liked to have seen more transparency with Canadians, with the actions they are taking. Right now we only hear from social media companies when they decide to share information with us,"" she said. ""I think we would like to see more regular reporting, something similar to what they have in the EU with the Code of Practice leading up to the EU elections.""

Ustubs said each country ""is going to decide their own ways of co-operating with platforms,"" and whether the EU's code would result in complete compliance was hard to tell at this point. ""Whether this is a perfect picture, perfect outcome, we will see — but at least we have an extremely good starting point,"" he said.

Just getting the platforms ""around the table and talking"" and agreeing with the code was significant, he said. ""At the same time, starting to judge by this code of conduct, how it is working and what kind of results it brings, we need a little bit of time, seeing how exactly the provisions in the code are implemented.""

Platforms asked about EU code for Canada

Gould had also said she talked to the platforms about undertaking what she referred to as “Canada Too principles.” She portrayed a system where “programs and projects that they’ve rolled out in other jurisdictions with regards to their elections” are applied in Canada as well.

The Trudeau government passed Bill C-76 in December, requiring platforms to keep a registry of political and partisan ads.

National Observer asked Facebook Canada, Google Canada and Twitter Canada on Friday whether they would be willing to follow the EU Code of Practice.

“We have responsibilities to keep people safe on our services and are committed to tackling harmful content online,” a Facebook Canada spokesperson said in response. “New rules for the internet should protect society from harm while also supporting innovation, the digital economy and freedom of speech. These are complex issues and we are always open to discussing these important topics with the government.”

Facebook is making buyers to confirm identities to run election-related ads. The company has a suite of tools to capture political ad information and is expecting to roll out additional tools for advertisers before the end of June. Through its Canadian Election Integrity Effort, it believes it's improving authenticity and transparency.

A representative for Google Canada did not return a request for comment before publication. Google Canada head of government policy Colin McKay told National Observer Monday that the company was committed to combating misinformation, and that it had met “several times” with Gould and her staff, as well as Elections Canada, the commissioner of elections and the Privy Council Office to talk about transparency.

""We have every intention of continuing our close work with government to protect Canada’s democratic institutions and election activities,” he said.

Google is banning political advertising on its platform before Canada’s election. It has published a white paper on how the company says it is fighting misinformation across its products and is working with the Canadian Journalism Foundation and Canada’s Centre for Cyber Security to prepare for the election.

A representative for Twitter Canada declined comment. Twitter has been suspending thousands of accounts in connection with attempted influence campaigns and publishing the data in an attempt to be more transparent and tackle interference. A February CBC/Radio-Canada analysis of 9.6 million tweets, which the company has deleted, showed trolls ""stoked controversy over pipelines and immigration in Canada.”

“In light of the upcoming European Parliament elections and in line with our commitments to the European Commission Code of Practice on Disinformation, we are taking active steps to stop malicious accounts and tweets from spreading at scale,” the company wrote in a January EU code of practice report.

The platform says on its website that it is working alongside political parties and election commissions “around the world” and staying alert to suspicious activity reports.","Canada could benefit from Europe’s crackdown on social media companies, says ambassador",National Observer,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/04/12/news/canada-could-benefit-europes-crackdown-social-media-companies-says-ambassador

Alberta’s election platforms compared: Where the NDP and UCP stand on everything from child care to carbon taxes

Albertans head to the polls in a few days and campaign promises and homophobic remarks by candidates have done little to shake the narrative of pipelines and a sputtering economy. Both parties have laid out extensive fiscal plans that chart different paths for Alberta’s future – neither calls for a dramatic break with the present, through a sales tax or a pivot away from oil and gas. However, both parties offer differing views on how to stoke economic growth and whether Canada’s unity question should migrate from Quebec to Alberta.

After a two-year recession, Alberta led the provinces in economic growth in 2017, as it so often did before the 2014-2015 oil crash. Hiring picked up and unemployment started to drift down. Then in late 2018 oil prices collapsed, major pipeline projects are still in limbo and hiring has been almost nonexistent. Here’s a deep dive into how Alberta’s economy was on track until it hit a major snag. (for subscribers)

Opinion: Political science professor Duane Bratt writes that Alberta’s nasty election is only a sign of things to come.

McGill drops Redmen as sports teams’ name after criticism from Indigenous community

McGill University announced in a note to students, faculty, staff and alumni Friday that it has dropped the use of the Redmen name after consulting with Indigenous people who asked that the name be retired.

“I have learned about the true depths of the pain caused by the Redmen name,” wrote Principal Suzanne Fortier in the note. “I have heard from Indigenous students at McGill who feel alienated by the name. They feel disrespected and unconsidered.”

The move comes months after students voted 79 per cent in favour of dropping the name in November.

Story continues below advertisement

Schools and sports teams across North America have long wrestled with the legacy of Indigenous team names that many in those communities find offensive. McGill was late among universities to resolving the debate because the name adopted in the 1920s was originally a reference to team-uniform colours. Indigenous connotations and racist symbolism were added starting in the 1940s and the university began trying to erase them in the 1990s.

Opinion: Back in November, alumni Konrad Yakabuski wrote that the school shouldn’t need a vote to do the right thing: “I never thought the name of the school’s football team referred to anything other than Indigenous peoples who inhabited the land centuries before it became a campus dominated by privileged white folks like me.” (for subscribers)

In rebuke of ICC, Sudan’s new military rulers have no plans to extradite al-Bashir

Sudan’s new military rulers are vowing that the deposed president Omar al-Bashir won’t be extradited to The Hague on a long-standing arrest warrant for crimes against humanity. Mr. al-Bashir, who ruled Sudan for 30 years before his arrest on Thursday during a military takeover, has become a crucial test case for the International Criminal Court. He is the first sitting head of state to be indicted by the court, but has evaded arrest for a decade.

The military leaders denied their takeover was a coup and have promised a civilian government at some point, but didn’t specify a date.

Despite a curfew, protesters continued a mass street occupation at the army headquarters to denounce the military takeover. So far, the military has shown no signs of using violence to enforce the curfew.

The protests were originally sparked by soaring bread prices, cash shortages and a deepening economic crisis. But the demonstrations grew stronger last Saturday when thousands of protesters began a round-the-clock mass sit-in outside the arm headquarters and won protection from elements in the military.

Opinion: Doug Saunders writes that even as a second Arab Spring blooms in Sudan and Libya, the West’s myth of strongman stability refuses to die: “We need to get behind the people in the street, and the educated, hopeful next generation – even if it means a short-term risk of instability.”

As China and U.S. inch toward a trade deal, Canada gets a warning of potential harm

The prospect of a trade deal between Washington and Beijing has rallied markets and raised hopes that U.S. pressure can prise open greater foreign access to the world’s second-largest market for countries around the world.

But for Canada, which has already felt Chinese economic punishment in the midst of a dispute over the arrest of a Huawei executive, a U.S.-China trade deal also carries risk that Beijing will increase its orders for American goods and slash its demand for those sold by others. (for subscribers)

WHAT ELSE IS ON OUR RADAR

Trump considering sending migrants to sanctuary cities: U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday he may send “illegal immigrants” to Democratic strongholds – just hours after White House and Homeland Security officials said the idea had been discussed but quickly rejected.

“The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy – so this should make them very happy!” tweeted Trump. Critics branded the plan, supposedly rejected, as an effort to use migrants as pawns to go after political opponents.

Ottawa fire: Fire crews are attempting to contain a blaze at a restaurant in Ottawa’s historic Byward Market neighbourhood. The fire, which broke out Friday morning, forced the evacuation of an Italian eatery where the fire began.

School bus rollover: A school bus rolled over east of Toronto Friday morning sending two elementary school students and the driver to hospital with minor injuries. Police are still looking into the cause of the crash.

MARKET WATCH

Canada’s main stock index rose on Friday, after a jump in oil prices lifted energy shares. Oil prices rose as involuntary supply cuts from Venezuela, Libya and Iran supported perceptions of a tightening market, already underpinned by an OPEC deal to cut production. Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX Composite index rose 81.06 points, or 0.49 per cent, at 16,480.53.

U.S. stocks closed near record highs on Friday after the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co., soothed worries that the first-quarter earnings season would curb Wall Street’s big rally back from last year’s slump. An 11.5-per-cent jump in Walt Disney Co. shares also gave big boosts to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 223.46 points, or 0.85 per cent, to 26,366.51. The S&P 500 gained 15.24 points, or 0.53 per cent, to 2,903.56 and the Nasdaq Composite added 29.90 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 7,977.26.

War of a word: How ‘ideology’ has been weaponized into a political slur

“What was once a word for someone devoted to the detached study of ideas has been perverted, if not totally inverted. After all, the claim that someone – typically a political enemy – is “an ideologue” is now meant to discredit their intellectual positions, because it presumes some alternate, ideal position that is unclouded by ideology; some purely rational, scientifically grounded terra firma from which one can snipe, ‘Oh, that’s just ideology.’ ”- John Semley

How a Canadian art mystery was discovered in Louisiana – and solved by Westworld star Louis Herthum

Open this photo in gallery Vancouver art dealer Uno Langman (left) and actor Louis Herthum react to a photograph of them from 1994. March 14, 2019. Vancouver. Jackie Dives

In the 1990s, Louis Herthum, who lives in California and is best known for his role on the HBO series Westworld, had travelled to his hometown in Louisiana for his 20th high-school reunion. At this point in his career, he could finally afford to satisfy his passion for art, thanks to a regular role on Murder, She Wrote. So, he visited an antique shop and found something way up in the ceiling that intrigued him: a series of paintings depicting lumber work in the forest. Some were signed ‘LSH’.

Buying those paintings for a few hundred dollars set Mr. Herthum on a long journey that ends with the Lawren Harris works finding their way back to Canada. Marsha Lederman sat down with Mr. Herthum and the Vancouver art gallery owner who reunited to tell The Globe the repatriation story. Today, those paintings may be worth as much as $1-million.

Tropical luxe: Why Belize is set to be the next Costa Rica

The chic Gaia Riverlodge property is hidden in the lush nature of the Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve in Belize. Today’s Belize has been shaped by waves of migration – from descendants of slaves brought from Africa in the 17th-century to Indian, Chinese and Taiwanese immigrants who began settling in Belize in the 1960s. But, these days the newcomers making a mark on the landscape are Canadian and American developers, turning the country from a backpacker haven to a luxury destination that will rival Costa Rica.

The Gaia Riverlodge, where Maryam Siddiqi recently visited, is one such property that shows this change and is owned by a Montrealer. It is a boutique hotel, perched on a riverside hill overlooking a waterfall. The resort beckons one to unplug. (for subscribers)

""We have been sorry to see that there's a bunch of stuff out there that is either misunderstanding or poorly explained. There are a bunch of myths out there."" The commission has just published a report on carbon tax misconceptions. The worst, Ragan said, is that a carbon tax doesn't work.

Article Continued Below

At least five different published studies have found British Columbia's carbon tax, introduced in 2008, has cut overall emissions, reduced per capita gasoline use by seven per cent, improved average vehicle efficiency by four per cent, cut residential natural gas use by seven per cent and diesel use by more than three per cent. Meanwhile, the province enjoyed about three per cent annual economic growth between 2012 and 2017.

Article Continued Below

Other jurisdictions that have successfully used carbon taxes to reduce emissions include Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, several U.S. states, the U.K. and the European Union. Three separate studies found B.C.'s tax either didn't affect jobs or added them. A fourth found a small decrease in jobs for less-educated workers. Studies in the U.S. or the U.K. found little or no impact on job numbers. The commission's report finds that far from hurting families, 70 per cent of Canadian households will receive more in carbon tax rebates than they pay.

Energy economists such as Mark Jaccard at B.C.'s Simon Fraser University argue that regulations get faster, bigger results and are politically easier to enact. The big cuts to Canada's carbon emissions, he said, have come from closing coal-fired power plants and clean fuel rules. ""Some people will tell you have to have carbon pricing,"" he said on a recent podcast. ""That's not true. You could do it all through regulations."" You could, concedes Ragan. But that would cost the economy more. Besides, he said, bringing in carbon taxes gives governments an opportunity to cut other levies such as income tax. Albertans who believe the province could escape a carbon tax by rescinding provincial legislation may also be mistaken. Martin Olszynski, a University of Calgary law professor, said all Ottawa would have to do is pass an order in council to bring Alberta under the same federal tax that recently came into effect in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick. None of those provinces had its own tax. ""It's a matter of getting cabinet together and writing the order,"" Olszynski said. Looking to the courts to block Ottawa's tax is an iffy bet, he suggested. In court hearings on Saskatchewan's anti-tax constitutional challenge, Olszynski said, judges asked if allowing Ottawa to regulate greenhouse gases as a matter of ""national concern"" would impede provincial efforts to do the same. ""If you recognize this matter as a matter of national concern, you would strip away the provincial ability to regulate these things,"" he summarized.

But Olszynski notes that courts have recognized that many issues — especially environmental ones — are best managed jointly between national and provincial governments. Other federal arguments in favour of a national carbon tax are backed by decades of case law, Olszynski added. Ragan said the debate over carbon taxes is as important to Canada's future as debates over the GST or free trade with the United States. ""It's a big policy issue and it's appropriate that we're talking about it now."" Ragan just wishes the debate wasn't so mythical. ""We live in a democratic society where people play partisan politics. Those political debates don't always stick to the facts.""

Eligible voters: 31,820

No matter who wins, a fresh face will represent the riding of Edmonton-Whitemud in the legislature as four family-focused candidates vie for the open seat left by an NDP incumbent.

Bob Turner, who is not seeking re-election, won the southwest Edmonton seat for the NDP in 2015 after 17 consecutive years under Progressive Conservative lock. Dave Hancock served much of this period as a cabinet minister and also a stint as interim premier. It was then briefly held by now-Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel through an October 2014 byelection.

The NDP took hold of the seat just seven months later with Turner avenging the byelection loss, defeating Mandel and the PCs. More than 60 per cent of the river-bound riding’s eligible electors voted — one of the highest turnouts in Edmonton — with Turner receiving nearly 58 per cent of the vote.

Labour lawyer Rakhi Pancholi is running for the first time in hopes of keeping the seat with the NDP to build on work the party’s done over the last four years in government.

“I have been so impressed by Rachel Notley’s leadership. She’s proven herself to be so pragmatic,” Pancholi said of her decision to run for the party. “We’ve made so much progress in this province and I didn’t want to see it disappear.”

Diversifying the economy and funding for education and health care are main priorities for residents she has spoken to. Notley and the NDP government have a proven track record on these important issues, Pancholi said.

But her three opponents say their parties will be better-suited to turn the economy around — all with the priority to amend or eliminate the current carbon tax.

First-time candidate Elisabeth Hughes said killing the carbon tax would be her first priority if elected with the UCP after seeing the detrimental impact it has taken on local businesses.

“I feel it’s been a very unfair tax on the middle class and we don’t have an option on heating our homes,” said Hughes who owns a small commercial construction business with her husband. “I’ve seen so many of my friends and neighbours that were hurting and just felt like it was my time to step up.”

Freedom Conservative Party candidate Jason Norris also said eliminating the levy would be his first goal if elected because it is causing businesses to struggle.

The information technology systems administrator said he is running to offer another conservative choice and will consistently fight to ensure Albertans are getting a fair shake for their resources, including getting the Trans Mountain pipeline sold back to the private sector.

“I always affirm to people that I’m going to be one of the most available MLAs in the history of Alberta because I love people in my area and I want to be able to serve them,” he said.

Rounding out the group of contenders is the Alberta Party’s Jonathan Dai, the only candidate with previous election experience having run provincially in 2015 and federally in 2000.

The 64-year-old said he wants to make life better in Alberta for his grandchildren and future generations by ensuring a diversified economy and ample public services.

“All Albertans have a shared, common destiny. We must work together,” Dai said. “We need to become a smart province instead of just relying on resources, one resource, and that’s oil.”

The candidates

Jonathan Dai, Alberta Party

Age: 63

Occupation: Business owner/consultant

Reason for running: “I care deeply for our community and the future of Alberta. We have reached a critical juncture that requires leadership that is inclusive and not divisive.”

Priorities: A diversified, sustainable economy is key to Alberta’s future. We must attract investment and new businesses to create jobs for our families. Public services (education, child/senior care, infrastructure/environmental protection) must be efficient and delivered with compassion. All Albertans have a shared common destiny. We must work together and serve as bridge builders to access markets, near and far.

Website: jonathandai.ca

Elisabeth Hughes, UCP



Age: 39

Occupation: Entrepreneur/business owner

Reason for running:“My biggest motivator is this economic disaster the NDP government has slapped on my Alberta. In just three and a half years, 180,000 Albertans are unemployed. They can’t get our oil to tidewater and major investors are moving billions of dollars to other more competent jurisdictions every day. No one is standing up for Alberta! So with 12 years experience with Conservative Party of Canada MPs, a UCP government will bring back jobs and make Alberta strong again.”



Priorities: Kill the carbon tax. Provide responsible incentives for business to invest and grow in Alberta. Cut the red tape that chokes our small businesses, developers and investors from considering Alberta as a good place to do business.

Jason Norris, Freedom Conservative Party



Age: 30

Occupation: Information technology systems administrator

Reason for running: “I am running as a candidate because I feel that grassroots conservative policies are no longer being represented in this province. I am also a strong supporter of Alberta autonomy and eliminating the control from Ottawa. I also don’t believe that MLAs should have a party whip that forces them to follow the leader. MLAs should be free to represent their constituents.”

Priorities: Eliminate the carbon tax, small business tax and equalization payments. Hold a referendum on independence if Ottawa does not allow Alberta to control its resources and have equal representation in Canada. Demand Ottawa sell the Trans Mountain pipeline back to the private sector as well as demand repeal of Ottawa’s Bill C-69 and the B.C. tanker ban.

I am usually skeptical about the oft-made claims that any given election is the nastiest ever. What metrics are being used? Were other campaigns examined in detail? For instance, Alberta’s 1935 election, fought amid the Great Depression, and the 1944 battle between the Social Credit Party and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation were hardly walks in the park.

But this year’s provincial election lives up to that billing for Albertans.

Story continues below advertisement

Candidates have had to withdraw or apologize for racist, homophobic or misogynist comments from their past. There have been large-scale rallies on issues such as gay-straight alliances and the federal Bill C-69, which would rewrite many of Canada’s industrial regulations, including the way capital projects such as pipelines are assessed. Social media has turned into even more of a cesspool than usual. Campaign signs have been defaced with vile language. Candidates from multiple conservative parties are raising the spectre of Alberta separatism. The RCMP is investigating the 2017 leadership race of the United Conservative Party (UCP).

One reason for the nastiness is the length of the campaign period. Officially, the campaign is 28 days long, but the unofficial beginning was the night Jason Kenney became UCP leader in October, 2017. A year and a half of almost constant campaigning – much of it negative – has set people’s nerves on edge.

Another reason has been the degree of polarization between the parties. Previous competitive elections in Alberta have been between centre-right parties, such as the Progressive Conservatives (PC), and right-wing parties – for example, the 2012 contest between the PCs and Wildrose. Even the hard-fought campaign of 1993 matched the Liberals, promising “brutal cuts” and the PCs, who vowed “massive cuts.” But in 2019, you have an NDP that may have moderated itself from its days in opposition, but remains solidly left-wing, facing a UCP that is much further to the right than the old PCs. In fact, the UCP is the most socially conservative party since the days of Ernest Manning and the Social Credit party of the 1960s. Small centrist parties such as the Alberta Party and the Alberta Liberals have not been able to exploit the big ideological hole between the NDP and UCP.

The two major parties are also running on platforms that involve substantial negative campaigning. Much of the NDP re-election strategy has been to focus on demonizing Mr. Kenney for his past views on abortion and LGBTQ rights. Meanwhile, the UCP wants to “fight back” against perceived enemies of Alberta’s oil and gas sector – Ottawa, B.C., Quebec, environmental groups, First Nations that oppose pipelines, large oil and gas firms that support climate change efforts – and wants to create a “war room” to respond to anyone who criticizes the sector. On the very first night of his leadership of the UCP, Mr. Kenney set the tone: “If we work hard, stay humble and earn every vote, we will ensure that this deceptive, divisive, debt-quadrupling, tax-hiking, job-killing, accidental socialist government is one-and-done.” The next day, Rachel Notley responded: “We will stand up against the UCP’s job-killing, climate-denying, gay-outing, school-cutting, health-privatizing, backward-looking, hope-destroying divine agenda.”

The state of the economy has only deepened the campaign’s bitterness. Since late 2014, Alberta has been suffering through a lingering economic downturn the likes of which have not been seen since the 1980s. When you combine 130,000 job losses with the difficulty of getting products to market, you end up with an angry electorate.

A final factor in the increasing nastiness of this campaign is the spread of technology. Cellphones, Google, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram all leave trails to controversies, allowing candidates to be scrutinized more than ever before, and for the results, verified or not, to be disseminated as quickly as possible. It leads to a digital arms race in which one candidate is forced to resign or apologize, leading to attacks on the other side’s candidates.

But if the UCP wins, as it is expected to, its platform – one of repeal and confrontation – suggests the party’s governance style will probably be highly divisive. It will be opposed by an NDP that will not disappear – as has generally been the case with defeated governments in Alberta – and will instead be a formidable opposition, empowered by MLAs with government and cabinet experience.

Eligilble voters: 29,782

The riding of Edmonton-Highlands-Norwood has been about as reliable an NDP seat as any in the province.

The question this election: does that continue after Brian Mason?

Last year, the longtime NDP MLA and former party leader announced he would not run again. Former premier Ralph Klein famously said Mason was so popular in the riding that “you’re going to need an atomic bomb to get him out of there.” In 2015, Mason won again with nearly 80 per cent of the vote.

Mason’s departure is just one of the things that makes Highlands-Norwood interesting. It’s among Edmonton’s most diverse ridings. Twenty-six per cent of residents are immigrants, while 11 per cent are Indigenous — the highest rate in any Edmonton riding. It also has the lowest median income in the city and higher than average unemployment.

Janis Irwin is the NDP candidate seeking to take the baton from Mason, first elected in 2000. She’s confident Mason’s endorsement and the NDP’s policies will resonate with voters in the neighbourhood.

“To be able to say it was our government that was able to halve the rate of child poverty in two years, it’s incredible, and that’s because of explicit action that Rachel (Notley) took like introducing the Alberta child benefit.”

Two Indigenous women are also in the running. Leila Houle, the UCP candidate, comes from Whitefish Lake First Nation. She said many Indigenous families in the riding share her story: growing up on reserve and then moving to Edmonton for school or work and facing barriers.

She finds the overarching issue for residents is jobs and the economy. “That is the overwhelming response at the door.”

The Green Party’s Taz Bouchier is a former Edmonton civic candidate whose background is in social work.

“The complaint I’ve been getting is ‘Brian Mason did not listen to us. We want someone who will,’” she said.

“There’s many Indigenous people in that community, and there’s many people suffering from poverty, and they’re feeling like they’re not being listened to or heard.”

Tish Prouse, a property manager running for the Alberta Party, thinks the party can break through as a centrist alternative to the UCP and NDP.

“It’s not an ideologically driven party,” he said. “There’s considerable input and sway and … discourse (among members) to come up with varied alternatives to a particular problem.”

Two lesser known parties are hoping to convince voters.

Joe Hankins, who lives in Boyle Street, represents the Alberta Independence Party. He says people are dissatisfied with the UCP and the NCP, as well as Alberta’s place in Canada.

“It’s not hard to broach the subject” of separation at the doors, he said. “Maybe half the people are a little apprehensive about independence but they seem willing to listen.”

Representing the upstart Alberta Advantage Party is Chris Poplatek, who says he will represent residents in the riding and not the party.

“How my party decides to vote is based on each individual candidate, if we get elected,” he said, adding education, the carbon tax, seniors care and crime are the biggest issues he’s hearing.

There’s also a candidate from the Communist Party of Alberta.

“We’re the only party that says we want working people to take power and abolish capitalism,” said candidate Alex Boykowich.

In a report released Monday, the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) said interference will likely come in the form of misinformation spread online through social media and untrustworthy websites.

""If a (news) report sounds implausible, maybe check it against a well-known Canadian news source to see if they are also reporting it,"" said Veronica Kitchen, an associate professor of political science at the University of Waterloo and Balsillie School of International Affairs.

""We still have enough good journalists in this country that they'll be reporting it.""

Canada is unlikely to see a repeat of Russia's widespread meddling during the 2016 presidential election in the United States. Instead, foreign adversaries could attempt to sway the ideas and decisions of voters in more subtle ways by focusing on polarizing social or political issues, or by promoting the popularity of one party over another, the report said.

""We recognize that foreign adversaries may use cyber technology to interfere and influence Canadians like they have done in other countries,"" Karina Gould, minister of democratic institutions, said in a news release that accompanied the report. Cyberattacks against elections in advanced democracies have increased threefold since the last federal election in 2015.

Voters are now the single largest target of cyber threat activity during elections, the report found, meaning voters need digital literacy skills to spot false or misleading information, Kitchen said.

""We should be skeptical of information, but deciding which information to be skeptical of is the challenge,"" Kitchen said.

The CSE believes voters will be the primary target because it's easier to change the mind of voters than it is to change the outcome of the election itself, especially with Canada's paper ballot system.

We’re confident that we would win.”,"Jason Kenney, leading the polls ahead of this Tuesday's Alberta election, has threatened to ""turn off the taps"" on oil-and-gas shipments to B.C. Is he just bluffing? John Horgan seems to thinks so.

Jason Kenney and his United Conservative Party are looking a little bruised and battered as they near the end of a wild election campaign in Alberta. In the final week, Kenney was hit with allegations of voter fraud going back to his 2017 party leadership victory, sparking an RCMP probe.

And Kenney’s United Conservatives have been embarrassed by some UCP candidates spouting racist, homophobic and anti-immigrant opinions, resulting in two candidates dropping out.

But, despite the bozo eruptions and personal hits he’s absorbed, Kenney’s lead hasn’t slipped away. In fact, there hasn’t been an opinion poll conducted in Alberta in which Kenney’s United Conservatives have not held a healthy lead during the entire two years of the party’s existence.

The reason? Voters are mad as hell about a weak Alberta economy, and the widely held perception that hostile governments outside the province are to blame. Hurtin’ Albertans are angry at Justin Trudeau’s federal Liberals and their anti-oil energy policies. Many are furious at B.C. Premier John Horgan and his NDP government’s opposition to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.

The expanded pipeline would pump heavy crude from Alberta’s oilsands to the B.C. coast for shipment by tanker to Asia. The Horgan government is fighting the project in court, saying it poses too big of an environmental risk from a possible marine oil spill.

The Horgan government has been battling their NDP cousins in Alberta, where Premier Rachel Notley has championed the pipeline. But now Notley’s government is hanging by a thread. And if she’s defeated Tuesday, the Alberta-B.C. war will get even more brutal.

Last year, Notley’s government threatened to cut off oil-and-gas shipments to B.C., introducing Bill 12, the Preserving Canada’s Economic Prosperity Act. The act would allow the Alberta government to restrict oil-and-gas shipments to B.C. It was passed by the Alberta legislature, but never proclaimed into law.

Kenney has vowed to finish the job, insisting he’s not afraid to “turn off the taps” to punish British Columbians for Horgan’s anti-pipeline stance.

“We’ll turn it into a real law, indicating to the New Democrats in Victoria that if they block our energy, we are prepared to use that,” said Kenney, vowing to proclaim the legislation at his first cabinet meeting if he’s elected premier Tuesday.

Notley said she deliberately held back proclaiming the bill into law, saying it was too early to use it.

“Jason Kenney needs some tactical advice,” she said. “Enacting Bill 12 now would be like blowing the weapon up on the launch pad.”

But Kenney said that only proves Notley was involved in a “fake fight” with Horgan, a fellow NDP premier.

“Unless John Horgan ends his unconstitutional fight against Alberta energy exports, the people of B.C. will need to get used to paying well over $1.70 a litre for gas,” Kenney said.

Would Kenney really follow through on this threat? Would he really turn off the taps?

“I’m concerned when other jurisdictions threaten other Canadians,” Horgan said. “I’m hopeful cooler heads will prevail, whoever wins.”

Horgan’s key cabinet ministers think Kenney is bluffing.

“When you’re in an election campaign, that’s the kind of rhetoric that gets thrown around,” said Finance Minister Carole James.

But if Kenney does follow through on his threats, B.C. is prepared to fight back.

“He knows that there’s going to be consequences if he does that,” said Energy Minister Michelle Mungall. “B.C. is not going to take this lying down. We’ve been clear that we will take immediate actions through the courts.”

When the Notley government first introduced the turn-off-the-taps bill last year, the Horgan government tried to stop it in the Alberta courts, arguing B.C. would be unfairly punished.

“A significant disruption in the supply of gasoline, diesel and crude oil from Alberta to British Columbia would cause British Columbia irreparable harm,” the B.C. government argued in the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench.

The B.C. government said cutting off oil and gas from Alberta could even injure human health because remote communities that rely on Alberta diesel to generate electricity could be left without power.

The Alberta court, however, dismissed B.C.’s argument because the Notley government hadn’t proclaimed the turn-off-the-taps bill into law.

If Kenney takes that final step, though, it will be right back to the barricades in court.

“We’re confident that bill is unlawful and if action was taken, we would deal with it,” said B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman. “It is not lawful in Canada to restrict energy exports to one province over different provinces. We’re confident that we would win.”

B.C. Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson called on Horgan to settle the dispute once and for all.

“If Jason Kenney is successful, John Horgan should be booking the first available date for the two of them to sit down and solve this problem,” Wilkinson said, though B.C. Green party Leader Andrew Weaver predicted an upset.

“If Albertans want to elect their own Donald Trump, they’ve got Jason Kenney,” Weaver said. “But I’m betting Rachel Notley will win.”

Albertans get the final say Tuesday. Their decision will have a big impact in B.C.

As Alberta prepares to go to the polls next week, United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney would have us choose the latter. Cut taxes. Cut services. Cut overtime. Cut supports for the LGBTQ community. Cut enough, they say, and things will get better.

Rachel Notley and the NDP, on the other hand, offer a realistic vision for the future of their province in which their province's prosperity helps lift all Albertans — not just wealthy executives and their companies.

The NDP is offering a platform based on hope and a strong belief in the ability of Albertans to face the challenges ahead of them by working together.

Watch: Alberta leaders go toe-to-toe during election debate. Blog continues below.

A slump in oil has many in the province worrying about their economic future. From the very beginning of this election, Notley's message has been that the best way to face that future is to work together, support one another and build a strong province for all.

""The question is this: do Albertans stick together or do we turn on each other?"" Notley said as she launched the election last month.

""Jason Kenney wants two Albertas — one for the wealthy and one for the rest of us. He wants two Albertas divided over people's rights,"" she said. ""I want to continue to build one Alberta.""

Fear can be a powerful motivator, but so can hope.

When Kenney asked on Twitter recently of people were better off after four years of an NDP government, he sparked a Twitter storm with the hashtag #BetterOffWithRachel, of people citing her government's poverty reduction, affordable daycare, support for the LGBTQ community and more.

In other words, the kinds of things that create a more equitable society that puts the priorities of working people ahead of those of the rich and powerful.

Kenney, by contrast, is pushing a massive corporate tax cut that would drain the Alberta government of some $7 billion. He is also promising to balance the budget, this would require cuts to public services such as education and health care — something that would especially hurt lower-income families.

Beyond his destructive tax cuts, there are plenty of good reasons to keep Kenney out of the premier's office, from his head-in-the-sand approach to climate change, to his plans to gut overtime pay, to his commitment to make farm work more dangerous and onerous, to the questionable candidates attracted to his party, to the very question of the legitimacy of his own leadership of the UCP.

Not so long ago, Kenney was using his influence as a member of Parliament to push for stripping Albertans of their human rights.

Guilt by association can be a dangerous road to go down, but at some point you have to wonder why so many white nationalists and anti-gay activists thought they might find a home in the UCP, and why they thought a party led by Kenney would not only welcome them, but would want them on their team.

The obvious reason is that Kenney himself has a past that, if he weren't the leader, could easily get him kicked out of the party himself.

Kenney, after all, cut his teeth in politics advocating that basic rights be denied to members of the LGBTQ community. It was just 21 years ago, as well, that Kenney urged then Alberta Premier Ralph Klein to use the Notwithstanding Clause to override a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that gay Albertans are protected under the Human Rights Code.

Think about that. Not so long ago, Kenney was using his influence as a member of Parliament to push for stripping Albertans of their human rights. There are so many great things an MP can and should do for their country. Denying people of their human rights isn't one of them.

Kenney's past, the legitimacy of his current leadership of the UCP, the people who have chosen to be associated with him and the future he is promising Alberta with his destructive policies all add up to Kenney and his party being just too dangerous to be elected.

As work neared completion on the new Edmonton Remand Centre, the Progressive Conservative government faced a decision.

The centre, which opened in 2013, had been wired so that each cell would have a television. The jail’s management was in favour, and several judges have argued allowing inmates to watch TV in their cell would make for a more humane facility, especially for inmates in segregation.

But when it came down to it, both the Progressive Conservatives and their NDP successors balked at buying TVs for the facility. Perhaps both feared a “TVs for prisoners” attack ad in the next election campaign.

It’s easy to understand why politicians hardly ever bring up jails — on the campaign trail or otherwise. Most people don’t spend time thinking about prison conditions, and the average person never expects they or a loved one will have to interact with the justice system.

But for thousands of Albertans and their families, incarceration is a fact of life.

On an average day, there are around 3,800 adults and 100 youth in Alberta correctional facilities — which house pretrial inmates and people serving sentences of less than two years. The system costs $288 million annually to run.

At last count, nearly three out of every four people in the system were remand inmates — people who are being held prior to trial and haven’t yet been convicted. Alberta’s remand rate is the highest in Canada, and would be among the highest in the world if it were its own country.

Inside, the opioid crisis is being felt as acutely as anywhere: 224 people overdosed in Alberta correctional facilities between 2016 and last October alone. Prisoner complaints about being denied access to timely medical care or having medications changed are common.

And despite growing awareness of the problem, Alberta’s rates of Indigenous over-incarceration are higher than they were a decade ago. Indigenous people account for about 6.5 per cent of Alberta’s population but make up 39 per cent of male admissions and 55 per cent of female admissions to the corrections system.

Postmedia asked three Alberta inmates — all of whom are able to vote by special ballot in the provincial election — what they think the people hoping to lead Alberta should know about its correctional system.

Jeff Kent, who spent 15 months in the Edmonton Remand Centre awaiting trial on fraud charges before being transferred to Fort Saskatchewan, thinks the biggest issue is the system’s reliance on remand.

With space for 1,952 inmates, the Edmonton Remand Centre is the largest correctional centre in Canada. The average length of stay is just a few days, but many are held for much longer. Remand inmates usually get enhanced credit for time served because remand time is harder than time spent in longer stay facilities — which allow more creature comforts.

Typically, people are only denied bail if they’re a danger to the community or a flight risk. But Kent says he and many inmates awaiting trial are neither.

“I’m finding my situation is not unique … there are guys who are being remanded who are not a risk to the community.”

Kent thinks that the size of the centre has justified Alberta’s higher than average use of remand. “It doesn’t matter if they made it 1,800 beds or 3,000 beds, they would have found a way to fill it.”

An inmate’s quality of life depends in large part on where they’re placed. The remand centre is designed so that the majority of inmates have as much out of cell time as possible, but it doesn’t always work that way.

Jamie Harrison has been in remand since 2016 after being charged with driving while disqualified, possession of stolen property and breach of conditions. When Postmedia spoke to him, he was part of the remand’s popular bootcamp self-improvement unit. But he’s been on units on near round-the-clock lockdown due to a few misbehaving inmates.

“They just put you wherever there’s room,” he said.

Inmates who break the rules can be removed from the general population through a process called disciplinary segregation. But another process, known as administrative segregation, is more flexible. Amanda Hart-Dowhun, president of the Alberta Prison Justice Society, said an inmate can be placed on administrative segregation even if they’re not facing an internal charge.

Unlike disciplinary segregation, there is no cap on how long an inmate can be on administrative segregation, she said. “That can go on indefinitely.”

Wayne Wilcox, a client of Hart-Dowhun’s, is in the administrative segregation unit at the remand centre. He’s usually confined to his cell for 23 hours a day, and is currently being tried for his role in a high-speed flight from police.

Wilcox has been incarcerated on and off for most of his adult life, mostly for property crimes. He said he is “institutionalized” and ill-equipped to function outside. He’s developed detailed ideas for a program that he thinks would help rehabilitate ex-prisoners.

“There needs to be resources,” he said. “The reason people keep coming back to jail is because once you go to jail, things get worse for you. They don’t get better.”

For Kent, perhaps the most difficult things about being inside is staying in touch with family. There are no in-person visits at the remand centre. Anyone hoping to visit an inmate must do so at a video terminal in a west Edmonton office building. Local phone calls cost $1.25 for 20 minutes. Between travel, phone and canteen costs, Kent estimates it costs his family about $1,000 a month for him to be incarcerated.

“We’re not complainers, and we’re not grievers,” he said of people in jail. “But the reality is this system seems to be designed to separate offenders, or alleged offenders, from their supports.”

18,Business,2019-04-12T13:06:00.0000000Z,"Shell Canada, which sold off much of its oilsands ... Most company officials declined this week to wade into the issue during a heated election campaign. But that hasn’t a stopped a broader ...","When Rachel Notley unveiled her signature climate change strategy in 2015, four oilpatch heavy-hitters stood directly behind her — and Alberta’s plans for taxing carbon and capping oilsands emissions.

Leaders of Suncor Energy, Canadian Natural Resources, Shell Canada and Cenovus Energy endorsed the idea of limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the oilsands to 100 megatonnes and backed a new carbon-pricing regime.

“Today’s announcement is a significant step forward for Alberta and for the industry,” declared Murray Edwards, chairman of Canadian Natural Resources.

Fast-forward 40 months.

The tandem issues of a carbon tax and an emissions cap are taking centre stage in the election campaign, with the NDP on one side, the United Conservative Party on the other, and the oilpatch caught in the middle of a political firefight.

Anyone who thought the 2015 accord would bridge an energy-environment policy divide in Alberta was mistaken.

“You cannot associate the individuals that stood on the stage with the premier as representing the full interests of the industry,” said Mark Scholz, president of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, which opposes the carbon tax.

“We should definitely get rid of it, because it puts you into an uncompetitive (position) and you are not really moving the dial on carbon,” added Tamarack Valley Energy CEO Brian Schmidt.

The idea of an emissions cap and carbon tax divided industry players more than three years ago, and it continues to highlight a fault line within the sector itself.

In a report last week by Royal Dutch Shell, the supermajor reiterated its support for carbon pricing and the Paris climate agreement.

Shell Canada, which sold off much of its oilsands assets in 2017, also sees the emission cap “as an expression of confidence in our industry’s continued ability to innovate to reduce GHG levels,” said company spokesman Tara Lemay.

Large oilsands producers such as Suncor and Cenovus also back the tax.

Most company officials declined this week to wade into the issue during a heated election campaign.

But that hasn’t a stopped a broader debate from churning.

Energy economist Peter Tertzakian, executive director of the ARC Energy Research Institute, believes a carbon levy can be a “competitive differentiator” for Canada’s oil and gas industry.

A carbon tax encourages companies to lower emissions and energy use, driving down costs and making them more competitive over the long run, he said.

In a world focused on decarbonizing, a levy will also make it easier for producers to raise capital in the future.

“Whether there is a government-imposed carbon tax or not, the financial industry is levying a carbon tax on you, on your ability to raise money or on your stock price,” said Tertzakian.

Steve Laut, executive vice-chairman of Canadian Natural Resources, said this week that the company supports a levy on the oil and gas industry, although he stressed a carbon tax on the public “is not our realm.”

“When it comes to the oil and gas industry, we supported that, particularly for the oilsands,” he told reporters.

“It was important that we support it and, as you can see, support it (with) more than just words. Our (energy) intensity has gone down dramatically.”

A report last year by consultancy IHS Markit noted average emissions per barrel — or the energy intensity — from the oilsands has dropped by 21 per cent in the past decade, and could fall another 16 to 23 per cent by 2030.

But with overall production rising in Canada, total emissions from oil and gas production jumped by 16 per cent between 2005 and 2016, putting more pressure on governments.

Producers agree climate action is needed and government policies should encourage innovation and investment, while avoiding any damage to the sector’s competitiveness.

However, divisions still exist over a carbon tax and the oilsands emissions cap.

Schmidt, who was chairman of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers when Alberta’s climate plan was unveiled, noted it caused “a lot of sparks” within industry.

“There’s a real difference in how the carbon tax is viewed,” he said.

“Most members, I would say, in town here are not in favour of the cap or the tax that was put in place in Alberta, because they just didn’t think it would get you anywhere.”

Scholz points out all of Alberta’s climate measures haven’t won “social licence” that would see pipelines accepted and built in the rest of the country.

“The facts speak for themselves,” he said.

Yet, removing the existing policy won’t stop the industry from facing a cost for carbon.

The federal government has imposed carbon pricing on provinces that don’t have their own plans, although the issue is the subject of a constitutional court challenge.

The UCP has also promised it will retain a carbon levy on larger industrial emitters, such as oilsands plants, if it’s elected.

Under its program, larger emitters would have to reduce their emissions intensity by 10 per cent compared to their average performance between 2016 and ’18. The UCP will also cut industry’s compliance costs from $30 to $20 per tonne.

In an interview, UCP Leader Jason Kenney said he’s not surprised companies like Shell back a broad carbon tax, although it hasn’t altered his position.

“I am not going to take the advice of millionaire multinational executives when it comes to punishing people for living normal lives,” he said Thursday.

“Economic masochism is not a responsible policy. Imposing massive costs on ourselves, which competing jurisdictions are not imposing on themselves, is a recipe for carbon leakage, the flight of capital and the loss of jobs.”

Notley contends the UCP plan would encourage emissions to grow in Alberta. Removing the carbon tax would penalize companies that have made significant investments to lower their emissions, she added.

“Many leaders in the oil and gas industry are playing the long game,” Notley said this week.

“And the long game means taking responsible action to combat climate change, and being part of the kind of plan we have in place.”

Tuesday’s election will settle where Alberta’s climate policy is headed next.

But it won’t resolve a split within industry on what’s the best step for an energy-powered province to take in a world that’s struggling to decarbonize.

The picture is as bad or slightly worse in Canada as in the average OECD country, said the report, which calls for various government measures ...","With a federal election coming later this year, expect politicians to be talking non-stop about the middle class and its importance to the country.

The problem is, according to a new report, the middle class is shrinking — squeezed by high housing and education costs, displaced by automation and lacking the skills most valued in the digital economy.

And faring particularly badly are millennials, who are less likely to reach middle-income levels in their 20s than their baby-boomer parents, says the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development analysis.

The picture is as bad or slightly worse in Canada as in the average OECD country, said the report, which calls for various government measures to tackle the problems.

“Our analysis delivers a bleak picture and a call for action,” said Gabriela Ramos, the organization’s chief of staff, who oversaw the project. “The middle class is at the core of a cohesive, thriving society. We need to address their concerns regarding living costs, fairness and uncertainty.”

The report defines middle class as 75-to-200 per cent of the median income in each nation. For Canada, that means a person living alone would have an income of about $29,432 to $78,485, it says.

Across the organization’s 36 member countries, the portion of citizens considered middle class fell to 61 per cent from 64 per cent between the mid-1980s and the mid-2010s, says the report.

Middle-class shrinkage was sharper in Canada than the OECD average.

Coupled with the contracting centre was a surge in the number of upper-income earners — those making more than 200 per cent of the median — who also cornered a greater chunk of their nation’s wealth, says the report. The middle-class slice of the financial pie fell even faster than the number of people in that bracket.

And those people still classified as middle class saw their purchasing power stagnate or decrease.

Between 2008 and 2016, real median incomes grew by an average of just 0.3 per cent a year, compared to 1.6 per cent in the mid-90s to mid-2000s, the OECD review found.

At the same time, people in the top 10 per cent saw their real incomes grow at three times that rate, the report said.

To make matters worse, housing costs have risen at twice the rate of inflation, so the middle-income earners spent almost a third of their pay on accommodation in 2015 — 29 per cent in Canada — up from 25 per cent in 1995.

One result is that it appears to be getting tougher to realize the dream of middle-class status.

Just 59 per cent of Canadian millennials — born from 1983 to 2002 — made it into that sector by their 20s, compared to 67 per cent of baby boomers, defined as those born from 1942 to 1964.

“Today the middle class looks increasingly like a boat in rocky waters,” said OECD secretary-general Angel Gurria.

The report attributes some of the slippage to the rise of automation, estimating that in Canada, one in five middle-class workers is at risk of losing their job to a machine — slightly more than the OECD median.

And while having high-level skills is not as much of a guarantee of financial success as it once was, being in a high-skill job still greatly increases the chances of making more money, says the report.

The authors list a number of recommended actions, from middle-class tax relief, measures to increase incomes and help with education costs, to programs that encourage workers to improve their skills.

The task is crucial, said Ramos.

“A strong and prosperous middle class is crucial for any successful economy and cohesive society,” she wrote in a preface to the report. “Societies with a strong middle class have lower crime rates, they enjoy higher levels of trust and life satisfaction, as well as greater political stability and good performance.”

The province has no Crown corporation ...","CALGARY — As websites go, it doesn’t stand out. Unlike the polished, visually appealing sites the governing NDP and opposition UCP have launched to attack each other in recent weeks, this one has the black-and-white esthetic of a Windows 95 text document. However bland and antiquated its look, though, it inserts a set of damning allegations into the middle of this Alberta election campaign.

The site, not-so-artfully named after the person running it, was launched earlier this month by lawyer and former power executive Robert Hemstock, who is currently suing the Alberta government, Deputy Premier Sarah Hoffman and NDP Premier Rachel Notley’s top spokesperson Cheryl Oates for defamation. It breaks down in lawyerly detail what Hemstock considers to be a series of mistakes the NDP government made as it changed the rules governing the province’s deregulated electricity market — moves he claims cost Alberta power consumers $2 billion, a niggling scandal of the NDP’s first term.

Hemstock filed the defamation suit in July 2018, based on events dating as far back as 2015, when Notley’s New Democrats were elected. The website went live after he filed a new affidavit on March 29.

He launched the suit because he believes the government unfairly blamed him for a series of contract cancellations in the power market in 2015 and 2016, based on a clause he helped negotiate into those contracts in 2000.

He launched the website because he wants to “expose” the details of the controversial episode, and because he believes the public doesn’t understand how or why those cancelled contracts ended up saddling consumers “with an estimated $2 billion in unnecessary costs” — and how the province could have avoided those mistakes in order to save Albertans money.

Both the suit and the website also appear to be an attempt by Hemstock to clear his name.

“It’s also about how our elected representatives in the Alberta Government used their position of power and access to taxpayer funds to attempt to achieve their political objective of avoiding accountability,” the website charges.

Hemstock declined to comment on the site because his defamation suit is still before the court but the affidavit filed March 29 contains a new allegation that the government has not provided all the documents requested in the case.

“That a decision was made to defame me, by implicating me as the cause of the loss of approximately $2 billion to electricity consumers, with no records showing how that decision was arrived at discloses the defendants have not discharged their obligation to provide all relevant material records,” Hemstock states in the affidavit.

“I’m not aware of anything new being filed, but because the matter is before the courts we won’t be commenting,” said Oates, who was Notley’s communications director before the writ dropped and is working on the NDP campaign.

It is a scandal. It is absolutely a scandal

Alberta’s electricity sector is unique in Canada and is confusing even for Albertans. The province has no Crown corporation like BC Hydro, SaskPower or Hydro Quebec that produces and distributes power to its residents. Instead a jumble of private-sector companies and some city-owned utilities like Calgary’s Enmax Corp. own the power plants, transmission lines and distribution networks while multiple provincial government agencies regulate or oversee the market.

In the middle of 2015, the province’s then-new NDP government increased the price industrial companies had to pay for emitting carbon in the province, which triggered an opt-out clause for many of those power producers, letting them cancel their contracts to purchase power in the province.

On his website, Hemstock called the price increase “a mistake” that government ought to have known would trigger the opt-out clause. Further mistakes, Hemstock alleges, include trying to deflect blame for the cancelled contracts, and specifically, going “on the offensive” by blaming him.

The government called the opt-out clause the “Enron clause,” after Enron Canada had asked for it to be added before that now-defunct company agreed to bid on power contracts.

Hemstock was in-house counsel for Enron Canada in the late 1990s when Alberta was in the midst of deregulating its electricity market and when the contracts in question were signed. He later joined Enmax as an executive.

In his defamation suit, Hemstock said he was employed by Enron Canada and “was not employed by nor did he advise (parent company) Enron Corporation in relation to any financial reporting obligations in the United States of America, at any time.”

Enron Corp. — rather than Enron Canada — collapsed amid a corporate scandal that included misleading investors and falsifying financial information.

In December 2015, Enmax became the first company to make use of the opt-out clause and handed the money-losing contracts it was holding over to an arms-length government agency called the Balancing Pool.

In the following months, other money-losing power contracts were also handed to the Balancing Pool, shifting the potential losses from the contracts from companies directly onto Albertans.

One power executive, speaking on condition of anonymity because they didn’t want to run afoul of the government or comment on the defamation case, said the case should be “a cautionary tale when it comes to political interference in the electric market” because electricity “is a complicated but essential commodity.”

The issue stirred up controversy in Alberta — though many residents don’t fully understand what happened — as the government moved to support the Balancing Pool through a loan.

“What I can’t fully grasp, and perhaps this is a failing on my part in opposition, is how it is that $2.2 billion has gone into the Balancing Pool, backstopped by Alberta taxpayers, and it isn’t the single greatest scandal that Albertans have seen,” said Greg Clark, then leader of the Alberta Party, in the province’s legislature in May 2017. “It is a scandal. It is absolutely a scandal.”

A decision was made to defame me

Industry groups have also sharply criticized how the government handled the series of cancelled contracts.

“Albertans should be concerned about the government’s $2.25-billion loan to the Balancing Pool and the mounting interest cost (about $400 million), which will need to be repaid,” the Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta said in a release.

The controversy is not a key focus in the current Alberta election, partly because it’s so complicated, but it is a point that parties have included in their platforms.

The UCP has promised that, if it forms government, it will “Ask the Auditor General of Alberta to conduct a special duty audit of the NDP-incurred financial losses on the power purchase agreements held through the Balancing Pool.”

In an emailed statement, the UCP said the NDP has not been transparent about their electricity market changes.

Hemstock’s defamation case is expected to drag on long after the April 16 election. He believes the government blamed him for the power contracts being handed over to the Balancing Pool.

In their statement of defence, the provincial government, Hoffman and Oates state they never referenced Hemstock directly and “as such, the statements cannot be defamatory or cause harm to the plaintiff, as alleged or at all.”

The defence also states that comments were made “as senior government officers in the performance of their official duties and are protected by absolute privilege” and their comments were “based on true facts about matters of public interest and are fair comment on a matter of public interest.”

Ontario and Quebec are now at 26.5 per cent and are doing the best in Canada in terms of job growth as a result. By contrast, the corporate ...","It's not just what the NDP did wrong that has been destructive to Alberta, it's also what it failed to do right.

During Alberta’s last election night on May 5, 2015, I was so nauseous I had to have a bowl on my lap just in case. Earlier that morning, I had received my first chemotherapy session for the triple-negative breast cancer I’d been diagnosed with that February.

I was much too ill to stay up to wait for the results. When I woke up in the morning and grabbed my newspapers off the front stoop, my stomach lurched. Was it the news of an NDP majority government that turned my stomach? I don’t think so.

I had decided I would give Premier Rachel Notley and her government — filled as it was with accidental MLAs — the benefit of the doubt that they would not be the disaster that every other provincial NDP government I’ve ever lived under has been in both B.C. and Ontario — including one I regrettably voted for in my younger years.

Very quickly, however, the NDP government disabused me of my cautious optimism. One of its first acts was to change the Power Purchase Arrangements in an effort to incentivize more sustainable electricity to be built in the province. It was done in such a destructive, ideological, ill-advised and incompetent way that Greg Clark, the Alberta Party incumbent, calls it the “NDP government’s single biggest scandal,” that has cost Alberta taxpayers more than $2 billion while getting nothing in return.

Then the province announced it would hold a royalty review — something that former premier Ed Stelmach did that led to capital leaving Alberta for Saskatchewan and the U.S. Did Notley not learn from Stelmach’s costly mistake? Clearly not.

That decision predictably led to almost one year of uncertainty in the energy industry, resulting in mothballed projects, layoffs and investment leaving the province. Thankfully, ideology gave way to irrefutable evidence and sound recommendations and the ultimate decision was not to substantially change the rates.

Damage to the confidence of the oilpatch in the stability of the investment climate of Alberta was compounded again by Notley when she announced her carbon tax, even though she never campaigned on this “tax on everything.” More layoffs followed, not just in the oilpatch but across every sector of the economy.

When asked recently how much carbon emissions have decreased as a result of the carbon tax, Notley looked stunned by the question and said she didn’t know.

Recently, the Sailer brothers in Lethbridge revealed that their 40-year-old family business, Southland Trailers, spends $7,000 a month on the carbon tax. That’s money they said they could be spending reinvesting in their business, improving productivity and hiring more staff.

All of these blows to Alberta’s job creators weren’t apparently enough. Notley raised Alberta’s corporate tax rate by 20 per cent (from 10 per cent to 12 per cent) — which at least is something she campaigned on but which unsurprisingly led to capital fleeing this province. With the federal corporate tax at 15 per cent, Alberta now has a corporate tax rate of 27 per cent. Ontario and Quebec are now at 26.5 per cent and are doing the best in Canada in terms of job growth as a result.

By contrast, the corporate tax rate in Texas is now 21 per cent, thanks to U.S. federal corporate tax reductions to 21 per cent — whereas they were 35 per cent one year ago. As a result, business is booming in the U.S.

The 2018 Global Petroleum Survey, which evaluated 80 jurisdictions found that Canada’s competitiveness in the oil and gas sector has dropped from the lofty heights of third in 2014 to 43rd. The timing of the decline is not an accident. Policy matters and Notley’s policies (coupled with Justin Trudeau’s) have been one devastating blow after another to this province.

Meanwhile, United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney plans to decrease Alberta’s corporate tax rate by four percentage points over four years if elected premier in Tuesday’s election.

But, it’s not just what the NDP did wrong that has been destructive to Alberta, it’s also what it failed to do right that has caused untold damage. Since Feb. 8, 2018, when the feds introduced Bill C-69, Notley and her ministers said and did virtually nothing to oppose the “no-more-pipelines law.” They also said and did virtually nothing on Bill C-48, the law that will ban Alberta oil from being moved by tanker on B.C.’s north coast, (but will allow all other oil to move up and down that coast.)

To say that the NDP has been negligent on both of these files would be a gross understatement. Notley’s inaction on these key files, in my view, is reason enough for her to lose any right to run the province.

Perhaps the most damaging thing of all, however, was how Notley — who said Alberta was “the embarrassing cousin” of Confederation — never objected to Trudeau unilaterally killing the $7.9-billion Northern Gateway pipeline that had been approved by the NEB after a gruelling $500-million regulatory process and was passed by the Harper Conservative government in the House of Commons. Notley never supported that pipeline and Shannon Phillips, her environment minister, actively protested against it.

Notley and her comrades also never kicked up a fuss when the Energy East pipeline was killed because of Trudeau moving the goalposts on the no-brainer project that would have provided Eastern Canada with Alberta oil, lessening its reliance on OPEC oil.

Deficits in Alberta are way up and Notley has projected our debt to reach almost $100 billion by 2023. According to the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, Alberta’s debt is currently increasing at a rate of $483 per second, and a whopping $15.2 billion in 2018-19 — which is little more than the confiscation of services from future generations.

What’s more, Notley has repeatedly appointed arch opponents of Alberta’s energy industry to oversee it, regulate it and advise on it, including the appointment of Ed Whittingham to the Alberta Energy Regulator just weeks before she called the April 16 election — her way of ensuring another fox is in the henhouse in case she loses the election.

I could go on and on about the job-killing decisions of this government, but I’ve run out of space and have to take a break. I’m feeling a bit nauseous. Here’s hoping I won’t need to keep a bowl handy on election night.

22,Canada,2019-04-12T21:19:00.0000000Z,It now appears that we in Canada will almost certainly miss our commitment ... The province’s environmentalists will undoubtedly stay away from the UCP. But the question in this election is whether they can still accept Notley and her pursuit of ...,"On a Tuesday evening in early April, in a community centre in Premier Rachel Notley’s riding in Edmonton, eighteen activists got together to think about how to save the world. The assembled group, which included everyone from young professionals to retirees to one mother who brought along her two kids, belonged to the local chapter of Extinction Rebellion (XR). The recently viral environmental movement was founded in the United Kingdom last year and has since grabbed headlines by blockading landmarks, including London bridges, in its quest to get politicians to address climate change.

XR, which has chapters in at least thirty-five countries, is driven by a sense of urgency around the impending impacts of our changing planet. A new report from the International Panel on Climate Change stressed that climate change will render swathes of the earth uninhabitable within the century unless drastic changes are made. It now appears that we in Canada will almost certainly miss our commitment, made under the Paris agreement, to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to 30 percent below our 2005 level by 2030. Instead of being content to continue on with the status quo of incremental changes, members of XR in Canada, drawing inspiration from rising stars like Swedish student Greta Thunberg and US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are calling for a rapid move away from of oil-sands, and other fossil-fuel, extraction, with a corresponding government-sponsored economic transition to a zero-emissions economy by 2030.

Members of XR Edmonton got together on that night to brainstorm ways to participate in a worldwide week of civil disobedience slated to begin April 15. The goal of the local chapter is to pressure Alberta’s and Canada’s leaders into initiating a “World War Two–style mobilization” to kick-start a transition to a fossil-fuel-free economy within a decade. A few weeks earlier, XR Edmonton had participated in a march through the downtown core, which drew more than 100 demonstrators. The scenarios proposed for the week of April 15 ranged from the artistic to the disruptive but typically involved the high-visibility occupation of an Edmonton landmark.

Not on the docket for the evening was a discussion of Alberta’s upcoming provincial election, on April 16. Notley’s NDP may be the most progressive government that the province has had in decades, or ever. But, even so, committed environmentalists may have a hard time cheering for the party. Premier Notley is not an environmentalist, and her promotion of pipelines, such as the stalled Trans Mountain expansion, on the national stage has made her seem like the antithesis of one. Still, her NDP’s approach to the environment is a step removed from that of the conservative governments that preceded her and is at odds with those now itching to regain power. The NDP’s main challenger, the United Conservative Party (UCP)—currently ahead 8 to 19 percent, depending on the poll—has proposed cutting back the modest environmental policies that the NDP spent years putting in place.

One of the questions environmentalists must ask when evaluating Notley, and other progressive candidates across the country, is whether they need to make a decision between being pragmatic and principled. Does Notley represent how far a politician can go to push emissions reductions in Alberta without courting electoral suicide, or could a more ambitious program of drastic emission cuts, like those recommended by scientists, XR, and other environmentalist groups, actually be possible with the right kind of push?

Since its surprise victory in 2015, the Alberta NDP has enacted a series of incremental environmental measures, including the establishment an energy-efficiency agency, the financing of clean-energy and infrastructure projects, and the expansion of protected areas. However, it was its Climate Leadership Plan (CLP), which was announced with much fanfare six months after the party’s victory, that represented the largest cultural shift. The multipronged strategy included a plan to phase out coal electricity generation, to put a cap on oil-sands emissions, and to implement a carbon tax. It also stated the goal of achieving one-third of power generation from renewable sources by 2030.

Notley, however, has also seemed to value the CLP for its ability to grant Alberta the social legitimacy needed to sell oil from the oil sands, which use a steam-heating extraction process that has a large carbon footprint compared to conventional oil extraction. She was quoted in the Edmonton Journal invoking then US president Barack Obama’s rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline and his designation of the oil sands as “dirty oil” as a reason to adopt the CLP.

This strategy of pushing environmental protection as a way to continue destructive resource extraction is a gamble that could alienate all voters. Speaking in the provincial leadership debate on April 4, Notley contrasted her approach to building pipelines with that of her main opponent, Jason Kenney, a former Harper cabinet minister and leader of the UCP: “I didn’t just talk to echo chambers of people who already agreed with us,” she said. “I spoke to people who were opposed to pipelines, and I changed their opinions.” The result, she said, is that “we’ve gone from four in ten to seven in ten Canadians supporting pipelines.”

Whether her approach will actually satisfy voters remains to be seen. It’s unclear if any of the crude-oil pipelines currently on the drawing board will actually be built (two projects, Keystone XL and Enbridge’s Line 3, are held up in the US regulatory system). The province is now recovering from a recession that started in 2014—induced in part by low oil prices and stalled pipelines—and Notley is facing a sour electorate.

According to pollster Janet Brown of Janet Brown Opinion Research, most Albertans don’t blame Notley for failing to deliver Trans Mountain, which has been suspended by a federal court order pending new consultations. But, says Brown, “they are frustrated that her efforts didn’t result in ‘social licence’ to build pipelines, as she promised it would.” Brown argues that Albertans aren’t entirely convinced that Kenney’s approach would be more effective than Notley’s, but many residents would like to see their provincial government be more aggressive in pursuing pipelines. Kenney and the UCP’s approach includes a stated intention to scrap Notley’s signature environmental programs, including the coal phase-out and the provincial carbon tax, and he has announced his intention to challenge the federal carbon tax in court.

The province’s environmentalists will undoubtedly stay away from the UCP. But the question in this election is whether they can still accept Notley and her pursuit of pipelines as the lesser of two evils.

While the NDP faces its critics on the right, environmentalists on the left say that the much-hyped CLP didn’t go far enough. Some parts duplicate existing federal programs, and others have been described as greenwashing. The oil-sands cap, for example, is set at 100 megatonnes of carbon emissions annually. That number is actually about thirty megatonnes above current emissions for the sector.

Still, the program was proactive by Canadian standards. For example, the provincial carbon tax, introduced in 2017, pre-empted the federal tax that came into force this month. One tangible benefit to Albertans is that the province’s program sees the money goes into provincial revenue, instead of to the feds. The Notley government puts this money toward rebates to consumers and toward green investments, including transit expansions, incentives to help consumers switch to more energy-efficient housing, and programs to switch to clean electricity generation in First Nations and Métis communities.

NDP spokesperson Leah Holoiday says that the coal phase-out has already reduced Alberta’s emissions by seven megatonnes a year. (This is a drop in the bucket compared to the province’s total annual emissions of 263 megatonnes, measured in 2016, though Holoiday argues that its programs will equal up to seventy-five megatonnes of emissions savings by 2030.)

All these environmental savings are projected as comparisons to a business-as-usual scenario in which emissions continue to grow. But scientists and researchers are arguing that a slight decline or a levelling off of emissions is not enough—radical cuts are needed to prevent the worst-case scenarios of climate change. Even if Alberta meets the projections in the CLP, the province’s emissions in 2030 will equal about 260 megatonnes, which is roughly what they are today.

Duncan Kenyon is director of the Edmonton chapter of the Pembina Institute, a think tank that advocates for green energy. He says that both government and the environmental lobby have done a poor job of explaining how a carbon tax is an effective tool for reducing emissions and attenuating the destructive effects of climate change, like forest fires, that Albertans are already feeling. “We haven’t brought people along to buy into what we have on paper right now,” he says.

Kenyon argues that the Notley government is facing the consequences of its instrumentalist approach to the CLP. Its vision, says Kenyon was “let’s do this climate-change [mitigation] because it’ll make all the opponents [to our pipelines] go away.” In a world where all crude-oil pipeline options are currently delayed, that approach has left Notley looking like a weak negotiator. Kenyon argues that it would have been more strategic to promote the CLP on its own merits, emphasizing the impacts that climate change is already having on Alberta, like floods and forest fires, and branding the CLP as part of a strategy to fight those natural disasters. He says that Albertans are genuinely concerned about climate change and that neither the NDP government nor advocacy groups have made a forceful enough case for policy that could deal with it. “We never connected that emotional understanding that our economy needs to change,” he says. “We never said, ‘Here is how you do it.’”

In the course of my interactions with the Edmonton chapter of XR, it seemed like the environmentalists’ attitudes to Notley were divided. “[Notley has] done a lot of great things for the province,” said Linda Fontaine, a retired bus driver. “There’s a solar program, and she’s put money into a lot of renewable-energy projects. And, if she gets another term, we’re going to see those things get a lot more financial backing.” Others, like science teacher and Green Party candidate Tanya Herbert, are more critical. “If she gets into power again, it’s going to be a heck of a lot better than any UCP government, which I’m absolutely fearing,” she said. But she can’t avoid looking at the last four years as a partially missed opportunity. “I wish that she would have had the bravery over the last four years to let Albertans see that we’re stronger than oil and gas. We’re more than oil and gas.”",Rachel Notley's Support for Pipelines Could Cost the NDP the Election,The Walrus,https://thewalrus.ca/rachel-notleys-support-for-pipelines-could-cost-the-ndp-the-election/

Minister Vic Fedeli told a media briefing. Canada's most populous province and industrial powerhouse ...","By Fergal Smith

TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario's Conservative government, presenting its first budget on Thursday, forecast a smaller deficit for the Canadian province in the current fiscal year and a return to balance by 2023-24 as it disclosed plans to reverse the growth in spending.

The Progressive Conservative Party, led by populist Doug Ford, won a majority of seats in last June's provincial election, promising greater fiscal prudence than the Liberal Party, which had held power for 15 years.

The budget ""sends a message to the world that we are serious about fiscal sustainability,"" Finance Minister Vic Fedeli told a media briefing.

Canada's most populous province and industrial powerhouse is projected to run a deficit of C$10.3 billion ($7.7 billion) in fiscal 2019-20, which began on April 1, including a C$1 billion reserve. That compares with an estimated deficit of C$11.7 billion in 2018-19.

The 2018-19 deficit was much more than the C$6.7 billion deficit projected by the Liberals in last year's budget, due mostly to accounting adjustments and the cancellation of a cap- and-trade carbon tax by the Conservatives.

But it was smaller than the C$13.5 billion deficit projected in February in a third-quarter update, while the 2023-24 projected timeline to eliminate the deficit was one year ahead of the Liberals' target.

That could soothe bond investors, who had been looking for evidence the Conservatives would tackle the province's heavy debt load. At about C$368 billion, estimated in 2018-19, Ontario has one of the largest sub-sovereign debts in the world.

The province, which has run deficits every year since 2008-09, pays more to borrow than some other major Canadian provinces, such as Quebec and British Columbia, that are running balanced budgets.

""I think it is positive from a market perspective,"" said Derek Burleton, deputy chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. ""The deficit implementation plan is reasonable, provided it can meet its targets. They are clearly ambitious on spending.""

SLOWER SPENDING GROWTH

The budget, which looked to expand the sale of alcohol and allow tailgating for sporting events, limited overall spending growth to an average annual rate of 1 percent between 2018-19 and 2023-24, much less than inflation.

It included lower spending on children's and social services even as the Conservatives proposed a new dental program for low-income seniors and a new refundable tax credit for childcare costs that would provide up to C$6,000 per child under the age of 7, and a lesser amount for older children.

Like the federal government, Ontario has favored faster write-offs of capital investments rather than corporate tax cuts to bolster competitiveness with the United States.

But a slowdown in the once red-hot housing market and global economic headwinds could increase the fiscal challenges for the province, which accounts for about 40 percent of Canada's economy and is a major exporter of cars and other manufactured products.

The budget projected growth to slow to 1.4 percent in 2019 from 2.2 percent in 2018, while net debt-to-GDP, a key measure of fiscal health, was estimated at 40.2 percent in 2018-19, the second highest among Canada's 10 provinces. It is projected to rise to 40.7 percent in 2019-20, before dipping to 38.6 percent in 2023-24.

""The CEOS and executives at Alberta's biggest oil sands companies know the NDP got it right,"" said Kim Conway, Chair of Unifor's Energy Council.

Unifor represents thousands of workers at Suncor, Imperial, Husky and Shell. Conway says companies must share with voters what they've been saying to their employees and investors behind closed doors; that the province's oil sands industry will be far better off with Rachel Notley's energy policies.

""The big oil sands companies helped craft the Notley government's Climate Leadership Plan because they understand that the industry must decarbonize to survive in a changing world,"" said Conway.

Today energy workers are calling on executives to tell voters that Jason Kenney's backward-looking policies actually represent a serious threat the future viability of the industry and to the jobs of thousands of Albertans.""

The NDP's Climate Leadership Plan, unveiled in 2015, has helped Alberta oil sands companies reduce their emissions faster and more economically than the policies of the old PC government. Jason Kenney wants to revive those outdated policies, which would have the effect of rewarding environmental laggards and punishing the top performers.

""Given the fracking boom and oil glut in the United States, everyone understands that the future of our industry depends on getting into new markets in China and India. But both of those countries are introducing tough new carbon pricing systems,"" said Scott Doherty, Executive Assistant to Unifor's National President. ""The only way to get into those markets and become a player on the world stage is to reduce emissions. That's what people like out-going Suncor CEO Steve Williams mean when they say we need to become 'carbon competitive.' Jason Kenney's approach of ignoring what our potential customers really want puts both investment and jobs at risk.""

""Albertans are understandably anxious and angry, so Kenney's belligerence may seem appealing but it actually decreases the likelihood of TMX getting built. And, it's shocking that the UCP platform – at least in its original form – didn't make a single reference to diversification,"" said Doherty.

In contrast, the NDP has been rolling out the boldest oil and gas diversification strategy that Alberta has seen since the days of Peter Lougheed. The Notley government's 'Made in Alberta' strategy has already attracted $13 billion in private-sector investment and led to the creation of thousands of jobs.

""Premier Notley has a clear and comprehensive plan for dealing with the rapidly changing global oil and gas landscape,"" said Conway, who works at Suncor.

""If you're thinking about holding your nose and voting for Jason Kenney 'because of the economy,' think again,"" she said. ""In this case, it's Notley who has the right prescription.""

Unifor, Canada's largest union in the private sector represents 315,000 workers in every major area of the economy. The union advocates for all working people and their rights, fights for equality and social justice in Canada and abroad, and strives to create progressive change for a better future.

Shannon recently ran for the Conservative nomination in Waterloo, but lost the bid to Jerry Zhang on April 2. Shannon majored in Geography at the University of Guelph and completed a Master’s of Environmental Studies in Tourism Policy and Planning at the University of Waterloo. She then completed a PhD in Geography and Environmental Management, specializing in rural economic development and traveling to rural communities to research adaptation and diversification approaches to changing economic landscapes in Canada. Shannon also worked as the manager for a non-profit agency that serves at-risk youth.

“Having been born and raised in the small town of MacTier, I know full well the challenges and opportunities that exist in these beautiful northern communities,” Shannon said in a statement. “Recently completing a PhD in the field of rural economic development, it is a privilege to now have an opportunity to apply this knowledge to improve the lives of those living in the riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka.”

Shannon said she believes that the current Liberal Government is impeding economic development and job creation by imposing high taxes and increasing regulations on small businesses and major industries.

“As someone who is well educated in both the environment and economic development, I oppose the Liberal Government’s plan to implement a carbon tax that would have a disproportionately negative financial impact on lower-income Canadians and senior citizens,” Shannon said. “I also oppose Justin Trudeau’s Liberals’ policies that are deeply rooted in an ideology that inhibits freedom of thought and expression.”​

She forecast cannabis retail sales reaching C$3.6 billion ...","OTTAWA (Reuters) - Long lines formed on a sub-zero morning last week to buy marijuana over the counter from three different shops in Ottawa, the first capital in the industrialized world to open them.

Though the day highlighted the realization of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s promise to legalize cannabis during his 2015 campaign, neither he nor anyone else from the ruling Liberal party was out taking credit for it - a sign that the social stigma around marijuana is still strong.

“Canadians are accepting of legalization, but I don’t think they’re celebratory,” said Peter Donolo, a political strategist at Hill + Knowlton and communications director for former Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chretien.

Aside from difficulty keeping up with demand, legalization has gone smoothly. Online pot sales to adults began nationally on Oct. 17, but storefronts only opened in the province of Ontario, which includes the capital, on April 1.

Six months before a national election, polls show Liberals deadlocked or trailing the rival Conservative Party, and Trudeau is being cautious about weed.

Though Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has said he would not reverse legalization if elected, he has repeatedly expressed worries about safety - especially around people driving while high - and has said more young people might try marijuana now.

There are also some communities like the Vancouver suburb of Richmond, where 55 percent of the population list their ethnic origin as Chinese, which have prohibited cannabis storefronts.

“Legalization has gone well,” a government official said, but the issue is not a “primary focus”.

It is now safer to be a consumer because of regulation, the official said, adding that black market sales are falling and legal jobs and revenue are being created.

Interviews with customers and retailers at the Ottawa stores revealed that even if Trudeau is not talking about it, legalization has generated good will.

“I live close by and I’m excited to see how this store will change the neighborhood,” said Jessica, 23, who declined to give her last name. “I did not vote Liberal last time, but I might this time.”

Jessica was huddled close to an outdoor heater in front of the Fire & Flower store, which is just a 10-minute walk from both the prime minister’s office and parliament.

“We have a deep appreciation for the opportunity we’ve been granted,” said Michael Patterson, one of the shop’s two license holders.

Vivian Azer, a financial analysts who follows cannabis companies for Cowen and Company in New York, sees a bright future for Canada’s nascent marijuana industry.

She forecast cannabis retail sales reaching C$3.6 billion ($2.7 billion) in 2019, including taxes. Azer sees illicit sales declining to 11 percent of the total sales by 2025 from 90 percent last year.

By 2025, Canadian recreational weed revenue will total C$10 billion ($7.5 billion), with medical marijuana at C$2 billion ($1.5 billion), Azer estimates.

“The stigma is rolling away,” Azer said.

Cheralynn, 55, said the promise to legalize marijuana was one of the main reasons she voted for Trudeau in 2015.

“And I like Justin,” she said. “Most women do. He’s kinda cute.”","Canada's Trudeau isn't talking about it, but legal pot is going well",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKCN1RO1ZT-OCATP

The committee’s report is expected to be released before the October federal election, but it won’t be focused on the foreign cyber threats ...","When it comes to defending Canada from the menace posed by the People’s Republic of China, it is now a matter of public record, and should be a matter of some embarrassment to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, if not shame, that the course his government embarked upon almost four years ago was dangerously naïve, if not recklessly thoughtless.

It’s a tragedy that it took the Chinese Ministry of State Security’s kidnapping of former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and cultural entrepreneur Michael Spavor to prove that the Beijing regime was not the “win-win, golden-decade” friend and trade partner Trudeau had incessantly harped about. Robert Schellenberg, dubiously convicted on drug-smuggling charges in the first place, had his 15-year jail sentence upgraded to a cell on death row. Canada’s canola exporters are stuck with $2.7 billion in export contracts that Beijing has ripped up. Threats of further punishment hang in the air.

It’s all because Canada detained Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou last December on a U.S. Justice Department extradition warrant. Meng is sought by the U.S. to face charges of fraud and dodging sanctions on Iran. Beijing needed to throw somebody up against a wall and slap him around, so President Xi Jinping chose Justin Trudeau.

Beijing needed to throw somebody up against a wall and slap him around, so President Xi Jinping chose Justin Trudeau.

Beijing’s complex campaigns of subversion, threats, influence-buying, bullying and espionage in Canada stretch back much farther than last December, of course. So does the sleazy tendency of Canadian politicians to look the other way, or rush to Beijing’s defence whenever anyone in the intelligence community publicly notices the obvious, or throw the director of the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service under the bus for pointing it out.

When CSIS director Richard Fadden had the temerity to point out nearly a decade ago that there were provincial cabinet ministers and other elected officials in Canada who had fallen under Beijing’s general influence, several Liberal and NDP MPs demanded his resignation.

So it was refreshing to see that Tuesday’s first-ever annual report from the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) made no bones about it. China is a threat to Canada’s national security, the committee found. Terrorism, espionage and foreign influence, cyber threats, major organized crime and weapons of mass destruction were all listed in the NSICOP report among the top threats to Canada. China figures in the report’s findings under espionage and foreign influence, and under cyber threats as well.

Russia is right up there, too, and although the report is redacted in several places, other unnamed governments were reported to be busy with the same dirty work. But it was the novelty of China being singled out for once, in a high-level federal government intelligence report, that’s worth noticing. Usually, the federal government lets China get away with anything.

“China is known globally for its efforts to influence Chinese communities and the politics of other countries. The Chinese government has a number of official organizations that try to influence Chinese communities and politicians to adopt pro-China positions, most prominently the United Front Work Department,” the report states, referring directly to Fadden’s whistle-blowing in 2010.

The report also notes a 2017 warning from David Mulroney, a former ambassador to China, about Beijing’s influence-peddling efforts in Canada. To get what it wants, Beijing mobilizes student groups, diaspora groups, “and people who have an economic stake in China, to work behind the scenes.” The report also notes the unsavoury business of lavish political donations on offer from Chinese businessmen with close links to China’s Communist Party leadership.

Two years ago, the Financial Times obtained the United Front Work Department’s training manual, which boasts about the electoral successes of 10 pro-Beijing politicians in Ontario. “We should aim to work with those individuals and groups that are at a relatively high level, operate within the mainstream of society and have prospects for advancement,” the manual states.

The reason for the public’s relative inattention to influence-and-espionage threats posed by foreign powers like China and Russia is that the federal government tends to avoid addressing the issue publicly. “As it stands now, an interested Canadian would have to search a number of government websites to understand the most significant threats to Canada,” the committee found.

“For some threats, such as terrorism, information is readily available and regularly updated … For other threats, such as organized crime or interference in Canadian politics, information is often limited, scattered among different sources or incomplete. The Committee believes that Canadians would be equally well served if more information about threats were readily available.”

That information is available, of course. It just hasn’t been coming from the federal government. In his just-published book, Claws of the Panda: Beijing’s Campaign of Influence and Intimidation in Canada, veteran foreign affairs reporter Jonathan Manthorpe painstakingly enumerates the breadth and scope of the United Front Work Department’s organizations in Canada, and Beijing’s intimate links throughout Canada’s business class. Manthorpe relied solely on the public record, showing that Beijing’s strong-arming, its inducements and its subtle and not-so-subtle intimidation have been carried out in plain sight for years.

Last year, a coalition of diaspora groups led by Amnesty International provided CSIS, Canada’s spy agency, with an exhaustive account of Beijing’s intensive campaign of bullying, threats and harassment targeting Canadian diaspora organizations devoted to Chinese democracy, the Falun Gong spiritual movement, Tibetan sovereignty, and the Uighurs. A Muslim ethnic minority in Xinjiang, the Uighur people are currently being subjected to an overwhelming tyranny of concentration camps, religious persecution, “re-education,” family separation and ’round-the-clock, pervasive surveillance. “Canada has become a battleground on which the Chinese Communist Party seeks to terrorize, humiliate and neuter its opponents,” says Manthorpe.

That kind of subversion usually occurs behind the scenes. But for years, Confucius Institutes have operated openly in dozens of Canadian universities, colleges and high schools. “In most cases,” Manthorpe contends, “they are espionage outstations for Chinese embassies and consulates through which they control Chinese students, gather information on perceived enemies and intimidate dissidents.”

Because its mandate covers more than a dozen institutions and agencies, NSICOP – first proposed 15 years ago, but only now getting off the ground – had a lot of ground to cover. More than half of the report’s 121 pages are devoted to a review of the intelligence functions of the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces. But it’s subversion by foreign governments that seems to have caught the parliamentary committee’s attention: CSIS told NSICOP the foreign-influence threat is becoming more acute, and countering it will call for “a more significant response” in the coming years.

With that in mind, the committee is already working on a follow-up review of the mandate, priority and resources the federal government provides Canada’s intelligence community to monitor and counter the foreign-influence threat. The committee’s report is expected to be released before the October federal election, but it won’t be focused on the foreign cyber threats the government is already preparing to monitor and expose during the election campaign.

“We’re going to outline the primary-threat actors, we’re going to be examining the threat those actors pose to our institutions and, to a certain extent, our ethno-cultural communities,” NSICOP chair David McGuinty told reporters Tuesday. “We’re working feverishly to get it done.”

About time, too.

I’m not going to speculate on the Alberta election…We will deal with things as they come, but we’re going to continue to push. And that’s what we’ve found that, unfortunately ...","That is the fraught, politically-charged reality since April 1, when Ottawa imposed its carbon tax “backstop” in four provinces that refused to match the federal minimum of $20 per tonne of emissions.

But Canada’s price, even as it climbs to $50 per tonne in 2022, is smaller than similar taxes in some of the 24 other countries that have set national carbon prices . Sweden’s tax is roughly $189 per tonne. In France, it’s $83 per tonne. And in its landmark report from October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said global carbon prices may need to be as high as several thousand dollars per tonne in 2030 if the world is to keep warming below 1.5 degrees C by the end of the century.

Federal Conservatives and their ideological companions at Queen’s Park argue this hurts the economy and isn’t necessary to reduce emissions. New Democrats and the Green party contend Canada is lagging on climate action and should, among other things, eliminate federal subsidies to the oil and gas industry.

The purpose of this group… is to talk about carbon pricing, to see what’s going on, also to share lessons learned. And there was a lot of interest in what Canada is doing, how we’re returning the revenues directly back into not only the province, but also to people. And that’s by law: 90 per cent of the revenues go back to individuals through taxes. They’re very interested in that, because how you use your revenues can help or hurt politically… Ours is using carbon pricing because it’s the most efficient way to reduce emissions, but also to make life affordable for folks. They have choices to save more money if they want by taking measures in their homes or how they get to work, transportation, to reduce emissions. Or not. But they will get the money back.

The IPCC report from October (says) if we’re going to keep warming to 1.5 degrees, the carbon tax … should be anywhere between $135 (US) to $5,500 (US) per tonne (by 2030). Do you agree that the carbon price that we’re going to have in 2022 will need to go up?

We’ve always said that pricing is only one of the tools in our tool box. So, we’ve got the price on pollution, but we’re also making historic investments in public transportation, and phasing out coal, and investing in renewables and investing in energy efficiency and clean-tech companies and innovation. So, I mean, we’ve taken an across the board approach. And our focus is really, OK, what’s effective, what is practical, and how do we do this in a way that ensures that life is affordable and you’re also creating good jobs and innovation in Canada.

But beyond 2022, is the carbon tax going to go up? Assuming, as we hear all the time, it’s the best, most efficient way to incentivize people away from pollution, wouldn’t it have to go up if we’re going to close the gap and hit our targets?

We’re committed to meeting our Paris Agreement target (to cut emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030). We’ve been clear about that, and we’re taking an across-the-board approach. The commitment is only to 2022, and that’s when we meet with provinces and territories to do a review (of Canada’s climate change framework). But there’s no intention to go up now.

It seems there’s a disconnect between the action experts say is needed to prevent the worst consequences of climate change, and the action that is politically possible for governments to do. What do you think about that?

Look, we’ve done a lot and we know we need to do more. We came in (to government), there was 10 years of inaction. We helped negotiate the Paris Agreement, then we negotiated with provinces and territories. We’re two thirds of the way to our target and we’re 11 years out… One of the challenges, of course, is when you have provinces like Ontario that backtrack. They do less, so they increase the challenge. But we are committed to it.

Why do think there is so much resistance, with Jason Kenney maybe on the cusp of winning in Alberta, what Doug Ford is doing in Ontario, other provinces that are skeptical of the efficacy of carbon pricing, or carbon taxes — why do think there’s an audience for that?

I think they’re skeptical of climate action overall. They seem to be skeptical of the science that says the enormity of the challenge and how we need to act now. We have our climate change report that says Canada is warming at double the international average, and… they aren’t making decisions based on policy and evidence. We know that carbon pricing works. We know that we need to take action. We know you can do it in an affordable way by giving the money back. But this generation of Conservative politicians wants to do less and less on climate change when the risks and the costs are enormous.

Assuming the polls are right and Kenney becomes Premier of Alberta, cancels the carbon tax in Alberta and lifts the cap on oilsands emissions, what can the Liberal government in Ottawa do? Wouldn’t that tear up the chance of Canada hitting its targets?

I’m not going to speculate on the Alberta election…We will deal with things as they come, but we’re going to continue to push. And that’s what we’ve found that, unfortunately, provinces didn’t step up — some provinces, led by Conservative politicians, didn’t step up and they made it free to pollute. And we stepped in, put a price on pollution, but also did it in an affordable way.

OTTAWA – Britain’s prolonged divorce proceeding from the European Union will give it more time to forge a proper free-trade deal with Canada, says the country’s envoy to Ottawa.

The United Kingdom is not legally allowed to engage in free-trade negotiations until it has departed the EU, but High Commissioner Susan le Jeune d’Allegeershecque said her country’s top trade negotiator has been meeting regularly with Canadian representatives to sketch out the broad strokes of a bilateral deal.

Britain remains part of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the EU and Canada as long as it is a member of the 28-country bloc.

Canadian and British negotiators aim to replicate CETA as much as possible in a two-country pact, le Jeune d’Allegeershecque told The Canadian Press from London on Thursday.

She spoke hours after a frustrated EU, in an emergency meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May, granted Britain a Brexit reprieve until the end of October.

The Halloween extension avoids a messy no-deal departure from the EU that was to occur Friday, which could have triggered a British recession with immediate tariffs on trade with the continent.

“The plan is still to have a transitioned form of the CETA agreement, which would reflect all the benefits that that (deal) has,” le Jeune d’Allegeershecque said. “We obviously now have a little bit more time.”

That includes technical discussions about particular chapters and topics, she added.

“The legal position is we’re not allowed to negotiate,” said le Jeune d’Allegeershecque. “Technical talks about what an agreement might look like are possible and those have been going on. There’s been intense co-operation and contacts between our two trade-policy and trade-negotiating teams.”

That work follows May’s September 2017 visit to Ottawa during which she and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged a “seamless” transition out of CETA and into a new trading relationship after Brexit.

The May government’s attempts to follow through on its pledge to break from the EU have been fraught with frustration, delays and no end of drama.

The extension was reached in Thursday’s early morning hours in Brussels, between May and EU leaders. She was back in London later Thursday and told Parliament she wanted to strike a compromise to exit as soon as possible.

That won’t be easy because the House of Commons has rejected her Brexit plan three times. In multiple votes meant to gauge what the British Parliament might support, majorities have rejected every scenario they’ve been offered, from simply scrapping the plan to leave the EU to holding a new national vote on the idea to leaving in a “hard Brexit” with no agreed terms.

May said if her own divided Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party can’t find a way forward soon, Britain will have to take part in the European Parliament election late next month.

May told reporters before leaving Brussels that she was hopeful the departure could take place before June 30 and if possible, before the European election.

“It’s quite an ambitious objective on her part because she will have seen how difficult it has been to get anything through Parliament recently,” said le Jeune d’Allegeershecque.

Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said her department has been “very assiduous in working out a transition on all of our treaties, including CETA” for a post-Brexit Britain.

“However, I think it would be fair to say we are negotiating with a target which is both moving and quite understandably focused on serious challenges at home,” Freeland told the Senate foreign-affairs committee this week.

Canada views the situation as it’s watching two married people it cares about “going through some difficulties,” Freeland said.

“They seem not quite yet to have decided where they’re going to end up as they work through those difficulties, but what we say to both the EU and to Britain – and this is very warmly received – is we are going to remain the best of friends with both of them, no matter what the outcome.”

The prolonged British departure is weighing heavily on Britain’s European allies.

Kareen Rispal, the French ambassador to Canada, said that as a long-time EU booster she hopes that Britain’s inability to say goodbye might actually lead to its staying in the bloc.

“Brexit is not a win-win for anyone,” she said in an interview. “It’s not one for the U.K. It’s not one for Europe. It’s not one for France. France will suffer because we do lots of trade with the U.K.”

France will find a way to carry on with Britain, regardless of the outcome, she said, but added: “At one point we need to end this uncertainty because it’s not good for the economy, for companies.”

U.S. President Donald Trump used Twitter Thursday to complain that it was “too bad that the European Union is being so tough.” He said the EU is “likewise a brutal trading partner with the United States,” something he said he would change.

Le Jeune d’Allegeershecque had no comment on Trump’s tweet, but said the EU has not been tough on her country.

“I think they have legitimate concerns about such things as the European parliamentary elections. I think what came out was a very decent compromise, which gives us both what we wanted,” she said. “The fact that we and the EU are content to what’s been agreed is the most important thing.”","Brexit delay makes time for Canada, Britain to craft trade deal, envoy says",Canadian Manufacturing,https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/manufacturing/brexit-delay-makes-time-for-canada-britain-to-craft-trade-deal-envoy-says-230888/

Thompson wanted to learn why, and spearheaded a task ...","© Kurt Brownridge / Global News Speaking to Global News at his home outside Wiarton, Ontario, Conservative MP Larry Miller reflects on the difference between rural and urban voters.

Armed with a sign that reads “Have Your Say Café,” Liberal candidate Allan Thompson pops into coffee shops that dot the nearly 6,000 square kilometres of the Huron-Bruce riding to hear from voters.

“I think we do need to do a better job of being present, being out in the community, listening to people — battle this sort of a stereotype that somehow rural communities are more conservative, because I just don’t think that’s true,” the former political reporter told Global News.

But Thompson knows better than anyone that past election results have painted a different picture: this is his second shot to steal the seat from third-term Conservative MP Ben Lobb. And the southwestern Ontario Huron-Bruce riding, and all those that surround it, have been blue for at least a decade.

Thompson also knows a lot about the mindset of those rural voters, and not just because he grew up on a farm in the riding.



In 2015, the Liberals won a sweeping majority across the country in large part due to their success in urban centres. But they didn’t fare well in more traditional Conservative territory: small-town, rural Canada.

Thompson wanted to learn why, and spearheaded a task force that produced an internal party report on how the Liberals could do better in Southwestern Ontario and beyond.

“One of the things we suggested was we should be more present. People should see their prime minister and cabinet ministers in rural settings, and we’ve seen a lot of that,” he said. (Thompson said Justin Trudeau’s visit to the International Plowing Match in 2017 was the first by a prime minister since Louis St. Laurent.)

In January, Trudeau created a new ministry with rural voters in mind, naming Nova Scotia MP Bernadette Jordan Minister for Rural Economic Development. That was another recommendation from Thompson’s report.

“It’s my campaign slogan but it’s also my motto — I really do think our political leadership needs to be reminded over and over and over that a quarter of Canadians live in a rural setting.”

“And every time we’re making any decision, somebody has to be at the table to say, ‘OK that’s great, but what will that mean for people who live in a rural community?’” Thompson said.

The difference between rural and urban voters

Some of Thompson's potential electors say they do feel forgotten by the Liberal government, and most told Global News they’ve long voted Conservative.

“I find that the Liberals just seem to focus more on the big city,” said Sarah Fagan in Goderich, Ontario's downtown.

“A lot of the issues that they deal with are Toronto issues and it’s not helpful to us. Any of the high-speed transportation systems, none of the stations ever get up here,” Fagan said.

One riding away to the north, longtime and popular Conservative MP Larry Miller said there’s no magic to winning the rural vote, but there are differences between urban and rural voters.

And transit is a good example.

“I totally get why transit is important, especially in larger cities, but not only is it not expected up in rural parts like Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound. … It’s just not practical,” Miller told Global News at his home just outside Wiarton.

“There’s no way that transit is going to work for me out here, and I don’t want it anyway, you know. So there’s a lot of those issues that, you know, we just don’t expect them. Ambulance, police — we know it’s going to take longer for them to get to our place and we’re OK with that.”

Miller said country voters are drawn to his party in part because of the Conservative focus on fiscal responsibility.

“We know government has to provide some services for us and that’s normal but outside of that, get out of our face and let us live our lives,” Miller said.

Very popular among voters and in his Conservative caucus, this will be Miller’s last term — he’s decided to retire after nearly 30 years in politics.

But he’s not worried about his riding swinging red. (He stole it from a Liberal back in 2004.)

“Not a chance,” Miller said.

“I can thank Justin Trudeau for that, because if there was any kind of doubt or chance in some people’s minds to vote Liberal, everything that he did here in the past couple months has totally taken that away.”

(Several of the people Global News stopped to chat politics with across Southwestern Ontario raised the handling of the SNC-Lavalin scandal as a concern, without being asked about it specifically.)

Allan Thompson hopes to land a seat for the first time by telling voters Conservatives aren’t actually in step with rural voters.

“Their definition of rural is somehow different. It’s got a slight anti-immigrant tinge and not as much focus on socially progressive issues,” Thompson said.

Helping others in need is a ""core rural value,"" Thompson said. ""Somebody can show up at your door in a snowstorm and get a meal or a coffee or stay the night. That’s a core value that came from the pioneer and that corresponds pretty well with a lot of what the Liberal party advocates about looking out for people who are in need,” Thompson said.

In his campaign, he wants to counter stereotypes of the idyllic country lifestyle, and he thinks voters are ready to talk about that.

“There’s a lot of poverty in rural communities. It’s very striking when you knock on doors,” Thompson said. ""Seniors in need, people who are homeless or live in substandard housing conditions, people who are dealing with addiction with mental health issues — those things can all be even more difficult to deal with when you’re in a rural setting.”

A question of relevance



Since the Liberals were able to win a majority in 2015 without winning rural voters, is their vote really necessary in 2019?

“Rural areas aren’t going to be as important as say, the 905 [vote-rich, battleground suburban area surrounding Toronto] or Toronto, and I think that’s just a function of the population shifting from rural communities to urban ones, and I think that’s just a demographic challenge,” said Earnscliffe strategist Rob Leone.

Leone understands the challenge well. He’s a former Conservative member of provincial parliament for the riding of Cambridge, which includes that city but also a wide rural area, such as Ayr, where he calls home.

“It’s a whole electoral map,"" said Leone, speaking of the federal election. ""And I think there is a lot of strategy that goes into who’s going to win where and where are your strengths and where are your weaknesses.”

On the flipside, for Conservatives looking to fare better in big cities, Leone said they need to tackle both policy and demographic issues.

“Certainly, younger people, more educated people, tend to live in urban areas, and right now it seems the Liberals are doing a better job of attracting those kinds of voters to their fold.”

“The Liberals are making a big play on multiculturalism and diversity. Those are the kinds of ideas that are resonating among urban voters right now, and if the Conservatives want to tie into that, they certainly have to look at how they’re going to address those policy concerns for voters,” Leone said.

Back in the countryside, Allan Thompson said thinking about the rural vote means thinking beyond the polls.

“Yes, you’re trying to win. But I think you’re also trying to make sure that you properly represent Canadians across the board. And I don’t think a government can effectively do its job if it is not hearing from the 25 per cent of Canadians who live in rural communities.”

Rural campaigning is more costly and time-consuming, with no high-rise buildings where hundreds of doors and voters can be reached much faster, for example.

“Where are most of the votes in this country? They are in big urban centres. It’s actually a lot of work and it’s a bit more expensive to get off the 401 and get out to rural communities and hear what people have to say,” Thompson said.

As a result, rural concerns are not always heard “in the corridors of power,” Thompson said.



It’s an area where he and Conservative Larry Miller agree.

“Rural voters, if they’re not aware of that or not ticked off about it, they should be,” Miller said.

“They basically just take us for granted — ‘We’re not gonna win it anyways, so why would we pour money in there?’”

“And that’s another thing that divides or pounds a wedge between [rural and urban voters] — 'So you’re not even going to give me infrastructure for highway projects or whatever, but you’re going to take my tax dollars and spend it in foreign countries and in other crazy ways that rural Canada gets absolutely no benefit from?' — And that one there really sticks in the craw of rural people,” Miller said.

As he reflects back on nearly 30 years in politics, Miller attributes his own success to staying true to his roots.

“I’ve made a very conscious effort to make sure I never forgot where I came from. … I know that people appreciate that. You know, I love hockey, I love to hunt, I love all sports, love the outdoors. … I know lots of politicians, that if they hunted, they wouldn’t say a word about it because it may be unpolitically correct or politically unpopular or whatever. I don’t care about that.”

“What you see with me is what you get. And I’m very proud of my rural roots and what I do,” Miller said.

And that’s his outgoing advice for all politicians, of any political stripe, and whether aiming to woo voters in cities or towns: don’t forget where you came from.",IN-DEPTH: Courting country voters ahead of election 2019,Global News on MSN.ca,https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/politics/in-depth-courting-country-voters-ahead-of-election-2019/ar-BBVQLxa

Alison LeClaire, the senior Arctic official at Global Affairs Canada, told the Commons foreign-affairs committee last June that Russia’s ...","OTTAWA—A House of Commons committee is urging the government to work with NATO to determine Russia’s military intentions in the North and get help to protect the country’s Arctic sovereignty.

That was the top recommendation of a report tabled Wednesday by the Commons foreign-affairs committee based on a study it began last June.

It arrived one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin outlined an ambitious plan to increase Russia’s Arctic presence, including expanding its fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers and building new ports and other infrastructure.

With Arctic sea ice melting, Putin said he plans to dramatically increase Russian cargo-ship traffic in northern shipping lanes.

Russia, the U.S., Canada, Denmark and Norway are trying to settle jurisdictions in the vast territory as disappearing polar ice opens new and lucrative possibilities for oil and gas exploration as well as shipping.

The Russian leader invited foreign companies to invest in projects at both ends of the Arctic shipping route, from Murmansk in Russia’s northwest to the Kamchatka Peninsula in the east.

In contrast, Wednesday’s report says that the “Canadian Arctic continues to suffer from an infrastructure deficit” and that “vigilant foreign and defence policies are not, on their own, enough.”

“There is also the national imperative of ensuring vibrant communities,” the report says. It says a “direct line” can be drawn “between Northern and Indigenous empowerment and the assertion of Arctic sovereignty.”

The report urges Canada to work with its partners in NATO’s governing body, the North Atlantic Council, to better understand Russia’s military intentions in the Arctic and to consider the most appropriate and “measured response.”

It makes clear this is about “deterring and defending against any threat to the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.”

“Russia has been rebuilding and modernizing its military capabilities and has demonstrated a willingness to challenge the international rules-based order. Perhaps most alarming, with new missile technology, Russian aircraft and submarines can now strike targets at great distances, including from launch points well outside of North American airspace and waters,” the report says. “There is a need for deterrence through the collective will of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.”

Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland’s office said Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic is “well-established” and the government will respond to the report in detail in due course.

“Canada co-operates with all Arctic Council members, including Russia, to advance shared interests such as sustainable development and environmental protection, the role of Indigenous peoples, oceans, climate change adaptation and scientific research,” said spokesperson Adam Austen. “Canada is firmly asserting its presence in the North, ensuring we have the capability and capacity to protect and patrol the land, sea and sky in our sovereign Arctic territory. We remain firm and steadfast in defending Canada’s interests in the Arctic.”

The Arctic Council is a bloc of eight northern countries that also includes the United States.

On Tuesday, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said he “can’t talk about Russia’s actions and reasons” for its Arctic behaviour but he said the North forms a significant part of the Liberal government’s new defence policy.

Six Arctic patrol vessels will be undergoing trials shortly and the Canadian Forces have done Arctic exercises with NATO partners, including the United States, he noted.

“We are taking our Arctic sovereignty very seriously,” he said. “We’re sending a very strong message.”

In the past, the Liberals have tried to work with Russia within the Arctic Council. But Russia’s aggressive posture elsewhere—its annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, fomenting of separatism in eastern Ukraine, and allegations of cybermeddling and foreign election interference—have strained co-operation on the Arctic.

Alison LeClaire, the senior Arctic official at Global Affairs Canada, told the Commons foreign-affairs committee last June that Russia’s contributions at the Arctic Council were “important and worthwhile” but she said its behaviour elsewhere in the world hasn’t helped.

“With respect to co-operation with Russia, one need only look at a map of the circumpolar north to understand why working with them is in our interest. Together we share 75 per cent of the Arctic area,” she said.

Canada is well aware of Russia’s increased military activities in the North, including military drills, the reopening of bases, investments in its northern fleet and increased surveillance capabilities, said LeClaire.

“However, Russia’s military presence in the Arctic is still much more modest than it was in the 1980s,” she testified. “Canada sees no immediate military threat in the Arctic, but we remain vigilant and are working with our allies and partners to keep the Arctic as a zone of peace and co-operation, a goal we share with Russia.”",Committee calls on Canada to co-operate with NATO to respond to Russia in Arctic,plant.ca,https://www.plant.ca/general/committee-calls-on-canada-to-co-operate-with-nato-to-respond-to-russia-in-arctic-182826/

While it may have to deal with a new government, it is also the case that several of its members will not be running in ...","Before getting into the report’s findings however, it is important to know a bit about the group that released it. The National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) is not a parliamentary committee (which does the work of the legislature) but a committee of parliamentarians — an executive body of the government that happens to be staffed by parliamentarians. It’s the fulfillment of a campaign promise by the Liberals in 2015 to create an “all-party committee to monitor and oversee the operations of every government department and agency with national security responsibilities.”

NSICOP has 11 members, eight members of parliament (MPs) and three senators that come from the official political parties in the House of Commons as well as the Senate. Under section 8 of the NSICOP Act, it has the mandate to review a) legislative, regulatory, policy, administrative and financial framework for national security and intelligence, b) the activities of a department that relate to national security and intelligence (unless deemed too injurious to national security by the minister of that department) and c) any matter relating to national security or anything the Crown (government) refers to the committee.

Beyond a campaign promise, there were good reasons to establish such a committee. Canada was one of the few Western countries to have no legislative review of its national security and intelligence agencies. But more than being an anomaly, this situation also left MPs (who have no security clearances) in a poor position to question security and intelligence officials in parliamentary hearings. Worse, it left them with little avenue to understand the increasingly complex national security issues Canada is facing.

Finally, while some national security and intelligence agencies had their own review bodies (for example, the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service, or CSIS, is reviewed by the Security and Intelligence Review Committee, or SIRC), their ability to review is limited to one agency only — SIRC, for example, can only see what CSIS does, not what the national security and intelligence community does with information that CSIS provides them. Further, review bodies in Canada have been restricted to assessing adherence to law and policy and not efficacy (whether they were doing their job well).

In this sense NSICOP fulfills three important roles. First, it reviews any department or agency with any national security responsibilities to assess whether they are doing their jobs well and/or if there is room for improvement. Second, it provides unprecedented transparency into the Canadian national security and intelligence community — something important for all liberal democracies to strive for. Third, it provides an educative function to other MPs, but also the Canadian public on the security and intelligence community.",A much-needed review of Canada’s security and intelligence operations arrives,opencanada.org,https://www.opencanada.org/features/a-much-needed-review-of-canadas-security-and-intelligence-operations-arrives/

by Dan Healing April 12, 2019by Dan Healing

CALGARY – A lack of capital for drilling coupled with rising exploration costs make it unsurprising that fewer players are operating in Western Canada’s oil and gas fields, analysts say.

A study from consulting firm XI Technologies of Calgary finds that almost 300 names have disappeared from a roster of all companies producing oil and gas in Western Canada since global oil prices began crashing at the end of 2014.

A total of 1,334 active companies – privately held and foreign-owned entities as well as publicly traded firms – reported oil or gas production in Western Canada in December 2018, XI found.

That’s down 282 names or 17.5 per cent from 1,616 in the same month four years earlier, a shift that XI data solutions specialist Shovik Sengupta says points to a period of significant consolidation in the industry.

“There’s no capital,” said Tom Pavic, senior vice-president with Calgary-based Sayer Energy Advisors, when asked what he thinks is causing the shrinkage.

“There’s an uptick in oil prices but we’re not seeing it with the producers’ stock price on the exchange…. No one wants to touch Canada because of all the uncertainty as it relates to pipelines.”

Most of the missing names are likely to be small players who haven’t been able to win investor backing to pay for drilling expensive oil and gas wells in trendy unconventional resource oilfields like the Montney and Duvernay, added Sayer president Alan Tambosso.

The loss of producer names is more stark among publicly traded issuers.

As of Dec. 31, 2014, a total of 108 oil and gas companies with a market capitalization of $311 billion were listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, while 229 smaller companies worth $5.1 billion resided on the TSX Venture Exchange.

Four years later, the number on the senior exchange had fallen by 31 per cent to 72 with a market cap of $214 billion, and venture listings were off by 44 per cent to 119 companies worth $3.9 billion.

The market for oil and gas corporate sales looked to be heating up last year but stalled on lower global oil prices over the summer and price discounts for western Canadian oil in the fall as production exceeded export pipeline capacity, said Stephanie Stimpson, a Calgary-based partner at law firm Torys LLP specializing in oil and gas mergers and acquisitions.

“It’s really is about the access to capital here,” she said.

“There are very few financings getting done. Certainly the junior sector is not able to raise capital now.”

She said recent transactions show even Canadian energy companies and pension funds often have a preference for putting their money in the United States oilpatch instead of investing at home.

Going forward, M&A activity will depend on investor confidence, she said, which could swing up or down based on whether the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion is re-approved for construction this spring, as well as other factors including results from the Alberta provincial election next week.

Sayer data shows total Canadian oil and gas M&A value in 2014 was $49.4 billion but it fell to $16 billion in 2015 and $12.1 billion last year.

XI says it can track the government business associate codes attached to assets or companies as consolidation has taken place.

For example, it reports Calgary-based Canadian National Resources Ltd. – the largest listed producer in both 2014 and 2018 – nearly doubled the number of codes it owns from 77 to 135 over the four years, a period when it made numerous large and small acquisitions.

In spite of the acquisitions, XI reported Canadian Natural production in Western Canada (not including mined oilsands) fell from about 741,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in December 2014 to 618,000 boe/d in the same month of 2018.",Western Canada oil and gas producer count down by nearly 300 names since 2014,Canadian Manufacturing,https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/manufacturing/western-canada-oil-and-gas-producer-count-down-by-nearly-300-names-since-2014-230878/

After seeing lack of support for three earlier designs, developer Reliance Properties is proposing a project with 47 residential rental units and commercial space, hoping this latest plan for the waterfront property will win approval at city hall.

article continues below

The new plan avoids the complexities that came with previous proposals, said Reliance president Jon Stovell. The site is on Wharf Street on the south side of the Johnson Street Bridge. On the north side of the bridge is the Janion, another Reliance project incorporating a historic building.

Under the new Northern Junk plan, the site’s two old warehouses would form the base of a new development.

They would be separated by an existing open-air walkway, with a new connected building built above them for residential units. Residential space would cover 36,534 square feet.

Stovell said this would be an “adaptive reuse” of the old buildings, which would be restored to serve as commercial space, likely for food and beverage operations, topped by residential.

Artist's rendering of the new plan for the Northern Junk site, as seen from Wharf Street. April 2019 - Dialogue Design

Plans call for 9,411 square feet of commercial space.

The units would be built as market rental but it is too soon to know the rates, Stovell said.

The wood-frame structure would be six storeys on the waterfront side and five storeys on the Wharf Street side.

Its design would reflect the character of Victoria’s Old Town, with red brick on the exterior of the northern section, and an inset mural, Stovell said. The mural design has not yet been determined. The southern section of the new rental space would have an exterior of grey-coloured terra cotta tile.

A glass atrium would wrap around and protect a portion of the southern-most warehouse, Stovell said.

With the old buildings, “we are keeping all the interior walls and exterior walls. Most of the walls will still be outside in the public realm.”

The company will develop the David Foster walkway on its land, he said.

Reliance has a large portfolio of heritage properties in western Canada, he said. “We’ve got a lot of experience in adaptive re-use of heritage buildings and giving them a second lease on life.”

Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps said she can not comment because she has not seen the proposal.

The Vancouver-based company bought the site in 2010 at the edge of the city’s historic Old Town.

Earlier designs each faced opposition over issues such as height, massing, views and concerns over a contemplated purchase of a piece of city land.

None went as far as a public hearing.

Reliance has scrapped the idea of buying city land, Stovell said.

“The scheme we have now is really saying, let’s reduce the complexity and the scale of the project and the anxiety that people were having about selling city land and closing public space,” he said.

Development will be contained to the site held by Reliance.

A rezoning application will be submitted “very soon” to the city, Stovell said.

This plan is about half the size of the previous design, which was pulled prior to the fall 2018 municipal election.

Parking spaces are not included in the plan.

This proposal does not require an amendment to the area’s Official Community Plan, he said. “It meets all the requirements of the OCP and has a very unique yet proven approach to heritage and adaptive re-use, which is building above the existing buildings.”

The height is close to being compliant with city rules and its height conforms to the Official Community Plan, he said.

“So there’s a lot less things for council to struggle with.”

News that permitting issues in the U.S. would delay Enbridge Inc.’s Line 3 replacement pipeline project until the middle of 2020 instead of late this year means that yet another boost in oil export capacity has been kicked down the road.

With both the Trans Mountain expansion and Keystone XL pipeline projects in court limbo, attention is turning to alternative ideas to expand Canada’s ability to continue to get its oil to market.

In a report to Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi last month, the National Energy Board said current pipeline capacity is fully utilized and crude-by-rail infrastructure is operating at or near capacity.

But it also identified potential long-term market access solutions that could include more oilsands bitumen upgrading and reversing existing import pipelines.

Unfortunately, none of those ideas works as a meaningful short-term alternative to new pipelines — and they face many of the same speed bumps — says NEB chief economist Jean-Denis Charlebois.

“Fundamentally, what this would require is regulatory approvals and significant capital investments because those things cannot occur overnight,” he said in an interview.

“First the economics have to be there … then those alternatives need to go through a regulatory process.”

A dearth of investment dollars for traditional drilling in Western Canada means there are also fewer dollars available for developing creative options, said Kevin Birn, a vice-president with IHS Energy in Calgary.

“I think you will have some creativity but if you really want creativity, they’ve got to see a future for investment in Western Canada,” he said.

Here’s a closer look at some pipeline alternative solutions.

The diluent dilemma

Raw bitumen at room temperature has the consistency of peanut butter. Below freezing, it’s as hard as a hockey puck.

To make it flow in a pipeline, producers mix as many as three barrels of light oil “diluent” for every seven barrels of bitumen — if one can eliminate or reduce the diluent, it frees up room in the pipeline.

In January, the Alberta government announced a $440-million loan guarantee to help Value Creation Inc. build a $2-billion upgrader that would convert diluted bitumen into medium synthetic crude and diesel, both capable of flowing undiluted in a pipeline.

The facility is the first in line for up to $1 billion in provincial incentives for partial upgraders, but it isn’t expected to be operating until at least 2022.

A report prepared for the province in 2017 suggested that a 100,000-barrel-per-day partial upgrading facility could add $10 to $15 of value to each barrel of bitumen. The report listed 10 pre-commercial technologies that have been tested or proposed for deployment in Alberta.

Any plan to reduce diluent must consider the impact on U.S. customers, who have configured their refineries to use diluted bitumen, said Birn.

He added diluent will still be needed to deliver the bitumen from the field to the partial upgrader, which means diluent recovery units likely also will need to be built.

New technology

No diluent at all would be required with a new technology to mix and coat bitumen with recycled plastic and form it into solid pucks for shipping in ordinary railcars or shipping containers.

An oil company affiliated with the tiny Heart Lake First Nation in northern Alberta is building a $50-million pilot plant to test the “CanaPux” product developed by Canadian National Railway Co.

But it’s not known when a commercial facility would follow.

Pipeline efficiency

Reducing the demand for diluent in Canada could help Enbridge decide on the option to convert its Southern Lights pipeline — used to import U.S. condensate diluent into Canada — into a crude oil export pipeline with capacity of about 150,000 bpd, possibly by 2023.

Meanwhile, the operator of the biggest oil export pipeline network in Canada is getting creative as it looks at using drag reducing agents inside the pipe and redirecting some downstream U.S. injections to open up long-haul capacity for Western Canada, along with low-cost pipeline and pumping station upgrades.

It thinks it could add another 50,000 to 100,000 bpd of incremental export space by mid-year and is studying a potential 450,000 bpd of throughput optimization initiatives.

Crude-by-rail

Rail exports rose to a record of over 350,000 bpd in December before falling in January and February after Alberta imposed production cuts to reduce storage and open up space on pipelines.

They are on the rise again as Alberta loosens its production quotas and Imperial Oil Ltd. restarts rail shipments it stopped in February.

Crude shipped by rail often contains diluent but the NEB notes more oil can be put in each car if the oil isn’t diluted — although that requires the use of cars that can be heated at the destination dock to drain the bitumen.

Meanwhile, Alberta’s NDP government is pressing ahead with plans to add locomotives and railcars to move 120,000 barrels per day of crude, starting at the end of the year — although the opposition United Conservative Party has vowed to kill the order if it wins the provincial election this week.

“We’re still doing our due diligence, we’re still examining the relevant facts and information,” said Bains, adding, “I want to make sure we do our homework and have an informed decision.”

In today’s world, many politicians have reached celebrity status, always surrounded by security and staff members, on the other side of an unseen brick wall to the public.

But one MP from Oshawa was truly someone that could be called “a man of the people.”

Born Michael Starchewsky on Nov. 14, 1910, Michael Starr is one of Oshawa’s most well-known public figures.

His parents were Ukrainian immigrants who came to Canada seeking a better life. Growing up in the city, Starr dropped out of high school after Grade 10 and eventually began working with Pedlar People Limited.

According to biographer Myron Momryk, it was while working in the Pedlar People office Starr turned his sights towards politics.

He was an influential figure in the local Ukrainian community.

“There was a rather large Ukrainian population. Bloor Street was almost like a little Ukrainian village,” Momryk says.

Momryk explains Starr used his “personal popularity” to earn the vote as an Alderman for Oshawa City Council from 1944 to 1949.

He would later serve as mayor from 1949 to 1952, also running an unsuccessful bid for the Ontario Legislature in 1951.

He soon set his sights on higher aspirations.

The management and staff of Pedlar People were highly conservatively-minded, Momryk explains, and would support Starr in his political aspirations.

These became fruitful as Starr was elected to the House of Commons in 1952 as a Progressive Conservative.

He later made headlines when he became the first Canadian cabinet minister of Ukrainian descent in 1957 as Minister of Labour.

Momryk says it was a different time, and the media “kept emphasizing [Starr’s] Ukrainian descent.”

“He was a political pioneer.”

Even as his political status grew, Starr remained very accessible to the community.

“Saturday morning, there was a line up of people at his door. People would even come to him with their marital problems,” Momryk states. “He was very much a person-to-person fellow.”

Momryk says he found it particularly interesting that despite only having a Grade 10 education, Starr found himself as Labour Minister.

At the time, unemployment was a serious problem in Canada.

To combat this, Starr initiated what was called the “Winter Works” program.

Up until that time, most trade industries involving outdoor work would shut down for the winter.

“That was a very serious problem, and a real drain on the country’s finances and resources,” Momryk explains. “He was pushing so people work in trades all year round.”

Momryk says this is just one example of Starr trying “his damndest to fight

unemployment.”

Starr also worked to create a more compassionate approach for the unemployed, including extending unemployment benefits to women and seasonal workers, and increasing federal funding to provinces for vocational training.

“He was very worried about the unemployment. He saw what that did in the 1930s as he was an adult during the Great Depression,” he says.

Even after leaving politics, workers’ issues remained important to Starr, as he served as chairman of the Workers’ Compensation Board of Ontario from 1973 to 1980.

On the political front, he would serve as Opposition House Leader from 1965 to 1968.

Starr was a candidate for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1967 but was eliminated on the second ballot.

However, Momryk doesn’t believe it was something Starr was really engrossed in.

“I don’t think he had any serious ideas about being chosen as the leader of the Conservative Party,” he said.

In the interim, he would serve as Leader of the Opposition for two months before Robert Stanfield won his seat in a by-election.

Although Starr had been a conservative since the 1930s, Momryk says some would argue he was in the wrong party.

However, he remarks “there is a distinction between conservatives and progressive conservatives”, and his view, Starr was the latter, even having a “tinge of a Red Tory.”

“He believed using the government for the people’s benefit.”

While progressively minded, Starr was staunchly anti-Communist.

“That’s one thread that runs through most of his career,” Momryk says.

He notes a number of Starr’s opponents when running for Oshawa city council were “strongly left,” and it was something he spoke out against.

“He continued that up almost until he retired.”

After achieving re-election six times, Starr faced his biggest challenge during the 1968 election in the form of 32-year-old NDP candidate Ed Broadbent.

The end result saw Starr lose by a mere 15 votes, a result that Momryk says lingered with him for a long time.

“When he lost to Broadbent, that bothered him,” Momryk states, adding a lot of liberals who had previously voted for Starr were swept up in Trudeaumania.

“A lot of the young people began looking for a change rather than having these older politicians. Starr fitted into that category,” he said.

While Momryk says there wasn’t necessarily personal animosity against Broadbent from Starr, he “did not appreciate people mentioning Broadbent in his presence.”

Starr would run for office a few more times afterward, but Momryk said campaigning was much more challenging with his older age.

“After a while, it’s not easy,” he said.

Momryk notes Staff became a campaign manager for other candidates and encouraged people from ethnic groups to run for office.

There was plenty to keep him busy after politics, as he served as a citizenship court judge in Toronto, and then his run at the Workers’ Compensation Board, a position he really enjoyed, Momryk says.

“He was very happy. He dealt with unemployed workers and people who had difficulty getting jobs.”

In 1983, the Oshawa’s provincial government building was named in Starr’s honour. The seven-floor tower still dominates the city’s downtown sightline to this day.

“He was proud of that. It was a monument to his career,” Momryk says.

Also around that time, he served a four-year term as Honorary Colonel of the Ontario Regiment (RCAC) in Oshawa.

Over the years, he also awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal, Canadian Centennial Medal, and the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal.

In researching for his biography on Starr, Momyrk says a common occurrence was that almost no one had a bad word to speak of the man.

“Everyone kept saying the same thing, ‘He was a nice fellow”,” he states with a laugh.

Momryk notes while often a speaker at community events, he didn’t think Starr was always comfortable dealing with the media.

“I know when he was interviewed by the press or on television, he was a bit hesitant. He was not really a good TV performer,” he said.

However, there may have been a good reason for this.

Shortly after his defeat to Broadbent in 1968, a Toronto Star reporter interviewed him, and later wrote a story alleging the former politician was extremely despondent about the loss.

“That really, really hurt him. When he had future contact with reporters, he was a bit hesitant. It took a lot of work to draw him out,” Momryk says.

“He was a very modest man and didn’t like to talk about himself a lot.”

One other challenge for Momryk was Starr’s apparent lack of an archiving system.

“When he was defeated in 1968, he had an office full of files, dealing with labour, immigration and all types of issues,” he says. “He didn’t know about the Public Archives of Canada, and basically everything went into the dumpster.”

Therefore, when Momryk was trying to write Starr’s biography, “he had very little to show me.”

Momryk says he relied greatly on debates in the House of Commons and newspaper reports instead of interviews with Starr himself.

Fast forward to his later years, Starr remained a constant in the Oshawa community, often being invited to weddings and other events.

According to Momryk, he worked hard on creating joint projects between Canada and Ukraine after the latter’s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.

He also pushed vigorously for the creation of a university in Oshawa.

Michael Starr passed away on March 16, 2000, at the age of 89, predeceased by his wife Anne Zaritsky, and his son Dr. Robert Starr.

His daughter, Joan, passed away only a few months later.

In addition to the Michael Starr Building, there is also a recreational trail named after him in Oshawa.

So what was Starr like behind the scenes?

“Very ordinary,” Momryk says, noting Starr was a fan of watching John Wayne movies, and a proud member of the Rotary Club.

In the end, many politicians disappear from the public’s view after retiring, but Momryk is glad Starr’s contributions are still very much apparent in the City of Oshawa.

“They remember the name [of Michael Starr],” he said.

Momryk will be sharing stories from Starr’s life as part of The Oshawa Historical Society’s April Speaker Series on Tuesday, April 16 at 7 p.m.

The Speaker Series will be held at the Arts Resource Centre, located at 45 Queen Street, Oshawa. Admission is $3 or free for members of the Oshawa Historical Society.

BEHIND THE WRITING

I’ve driven by the Michael Starr Building in Oshawa likely hundreds, maybe thousands of times.

Every time I did this, I thought to myself – just who is Michael Starr?

I knew that to have your name on a building you must have done something notable.

So when I was brainstorming ideas for the Fourth Estate, the name Michael Starr again popped into my head.

Later that week, I saw that author Myron Momryk was coming to Oshawa for a speaking engagement to discuss his biography on Starr.

It was clear to me that it wasn’t just a coincidence, I needed to do some research.

I searched Mr. Momryk’s name on Google (welcome to 2019), and found his contact information.

One phone call later, and I was much more aware of who Michael Starr was.

Michael Starr was a community leader.

Michael Starr was a voice in support of the unemployed.

Michael Starr was Canada’s first Cabinet Minister of Ukrainian descent.

Having learned over the last year I too have some Ukrainian blood in my veins, I found this particularly interesting.

Through my conversation with Myron, and my own research, I learned a great deal more about an important figure in the city’s history.

Starr seems like he was a true “man of the people” politician, starting off as an alderman, then mayor, then a federal MP.

Apparently people would line up in front of his house to speak with him about their problems and concerns.

Starr passed away in 2000, when I was still in high school. I wish I had the opportunity to meet him, but I’m honoured to be able to share some of his story with our readers.

With less than a week to go before Albertans head to the polls, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is making an early exit from the capital to hit the campaign trail with his former federal caucus colleague turned United Conservative Leader, Jason Kenney, who, barring a sudden — but not, in the case of this particular province, entirely unprecedented — shift in the polls, seems all but certain to oust Rachel Notley’s New Democrats from the premier’s office.

According to the advisory, Scheer will join Kenney at a “family friendly” UCP-organized event on the baseball diamond at a Calgary grade school, where the pair will “send a message by rallying together” for the “fight to get our province, and our nation, back on track!”

Scheer can also take comfort in knowing that he likely won’t be missing out on the chance to continue his cross-examination of his chief political rival, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is also expected to skip question period this afternoon.

As per his official itinerary, Trudeau will spend the day ensconced in “private meetings,” including a mid-morning sit-down with Stelco chair Alan Kestenbaum, during which they’ll almost certainly go over the latest developments in the government’s ongoing efforts to support the steel and aluminum sectors amid the current cross-border trade tensions.

Also on the Hill agenda today: Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould teams up with senior officials from the Communications Security Establishment and the Privy Council Office to brief the House procedure committee on the plan to “safeguard” the next federal election, as well as provide MPs with a status report on the interagency task force charged with monitoring “covert, clandestine or criminal activities” that aim to “interfere with,or influence electoral processes in Canada.”

Gould’s appearance comes just days after CSE officials issued an update on the risk of foreign meddling in the upcoming federal vote, which, they warn, is virtually certain to be the target of cyber saboteurs, although not likely of the same intensity or severity as the 2016 US presidential campaign.

Elsewhere on the committee circuit, opposition members have teamed up to force a special session of the House justice committee to discuss launching a probe into what they describe as the “unprecedented breaches of confidentiality” that resulted in a series of media reports alleging a running dispute between Trudeau and then-justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould during last year’s ostensibly closed-door process of choosing a new Supreme Court justice to replace retiring chief justice Beverley McLachlin.

With Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservatives set to unveil their inaugural budget this afternoon, it’s likely not a coincidence that a full contingent of federal cabinet ministers is being dispatched to various venues across the province, where they will, naturally, be only too happy to share their concerns over Ford’s fiscal roadmap— and, of course, tout their own government’s planned initiatives — both before and after the full details are released.

Out and about in the Greater Toronto region today: Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O’Regan and Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, both of whom are booked in for panel discussions at the Public Policy Forum’s annual Canada Growth Summit, where they will focus on “Indigenous innovation” and industry renewal, respectively.

Meanwhile, Science and Sport Minister Kirsty Duncan drops by the Ontario Lacrosse Hall of Fame in St. Catharines with news on the 2021 Canada Games as Tourism Minister Mélanie Joly has back-to-back events in Timmins, where she’ll outline new federal funding “to strengthen, diversify and grow the regional economy,” as well as cash to boost “cultural and community space projects” at the Timmins Museum.

Finally, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May is in Victoria to “challenge” Canadians to “become empowered into action to protect the future” as the next guest in the St. Mary’s Lenten Speaker series.

BUT, WHAT IF …

I always enjoy reading Jim Warren’s articles in the Sun, although I seldom agree with him. But they give me food for thought and his insight in some areas that I know little about is appreciated. However, his article on Sunday about the Lavalin mess was something else. He certainly has twisted himself in a knot over this corruption case. His entire argument is based on what-ifs. In our city of Calgary (from what I can figure out), we have lost an estimated 80,000 jobs and well over 150,000 jobs in our province and Ottawa and the socialist Liberal government wasn’t concerned at all. Trudeau keeps saying he is protecting Canadian jobs (but only in Quebec — our favourite welfare province). His best line in the article was, and I quote, “But his mistakes were made with the best of intentions, which is more than I can say for anyone else involved in this mess.” I have a question for Mr Warren: Where have you been? Possibly out of the country.

Big money’s campaign to block pharmacare: First, buy influence

Since the government announced the federal Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare in the 2018 budget, the pharmaceutical and insurance industries have embarked on a lobbying frenzy in Ottawa.

No one knows exactly how much money Big Pharma, Big Insurance and billionaires are funnelling into the anti-pharmacare campaigns. No mechanism exists in Canada to ensure that level of transparency. However, it is possible to gather fragments of evidence that suggest a complex tapestry of lobbying and advertising activity being deployed by these actors to protect their interests.

Shortly after the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health issued its report endorsing publicly funded pharmacare in April 2018, members of Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association challenged the committee’s recommendations at a lobby day event on Parliament Hill. A press release stated that the Standing Committee’s recommendations could “reduce the quality of health benefit plans for millions of people.”

This was followed by a series of three half-page ads in the Hill Times in May, June and November 2018. With the headline “Better Health Benefits for Everyone,” the industry association ads reiterated its key position: that a program which preserves the private insurance industry’s market share is the best policy option for Canada. Any government changes to coverage ought simply to add another layer of targeted public coverage to the existing public-private mix, the ads suggested.

The association also turned to Twitter to spread its core message from July 18 to 20, when provincial premiers met for their annual summit in St. Andrew’s by-the-Sea, New Brunswick. During the days of the premiers’ summit, Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association-promoted ads appeared regularly on Twitter feeds geo-located to that hamlet with a population of 1,500 people.

The clear objective of the ads was to target Canada’s premiers and senior staff with a message opposing universal single-payer pharmacare.

Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association lobbying efforts also rose considerably with the launch of the advisory council. From 2017 to 2018, the association’s non-trade-related lobbying activity rose by roughly 61 per cent, according to data from the Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying. The evidence suggests a ramping-up of efforts by Big Insurance to stop pharmacare from being delivered to Canadians.

Considering the growing potential profits on the horizon from high-cost medications, the pharmaceutical industry has a lot to lose from a national pharmacare program, with the government able to negotiate prices as the strong single-payer bargainer.

According to the latest report from the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, within a decade the number of patented medicines in Canada with an annual cost of at least $10,000 more than tripled. They now account for over 40 per cent of patented medicine sales, rising from 7.6 per cent in 2006. The number of people using these medicines is less than one per cent of the population. This high-priced pharmaceutical market is, to a large degree, preserved by Canada’s current multi-payer system of drug coverage.

In 2018, Innovative Medicines Canada, a major industry association, increased its lobbying and advertising efforts substantially. It bought 15 full-colour ads in the Hill Times in 2018 alone. The ads included claims that pharmacare could result in patients being forced to go without medications. “Far-reaching changes to Canada’s patented drug regime will lead to job losses, a cutback in R&D investment and reduced access to the latest therapies,” stated one ad.

In fact, since 2000 industry revenues have soared while R&D investments have stagnated. The industry’s research investments in Canada fell in 2017 to a paltry 4.1 per cent of Canadian sales from 4.4 per cent in 2016 (4.6 per cent for members of Innovative Medicines Canada, down from 4.9 per cent in 2016). Merck, AstraZeneca, Sanofi-Aventis and Johnson & Johnson have either closed or scaled down their Canadian research facilities, laying off staff.

Innovative Medicines Canada and Canada’s pharmaceutical giants also increased lobbying efforts in 2018. In fact, IMC’s non-trade-related lobbying meetings rose from 18 in 2017 to 104 in 2018 — a 500-per-cent increase in lobbying activity in one year. The pharmaceutical industry sees the implementation of pharmacare as worthy of the deployment of unprecedented lobbying resources.

In the past two decades, drug companies in Canada and abroad have poured millions of dollars into funding patient advocacy groups, which now have a formal role in many drug policy structures. Many of these patient groups are tiny organizations that valiantly fight for the well-being of their often vulnerable patients, yet they are hamstrung by a lack of funding sources.

As one Canadian patient group recently discovered to its dismay, funding arrangements with patient groups often come with strings attached.

In October 2018, the Globe and Mail broke a story illustrating this phenomenon. In 2016 the president of the Canadian Spondylitis Association, which represents patients with a type of arthritis, attended a focus group project which ended with groups being asked to sign a report (destined for Health Canada) that said patients were “strongly opposed” to switching from their brand name drug to a cheaper biosimilar drug.

The two companies that paid for the report, Janssen and AbbVie, are two with a lot to lose from biosimilar competition. Feeling manipulated, the patient group’s president emailed members of his board and recommended the association take its name off the report. Board members agreed, despite the fact that Janssen and AbbVie had provided 90 per cent of the group’s budget the previous year. Janssen then rejected the group’s requests for funding in 2017 and 2018. (AbbVie continued its funding.)

With few other funding options available to them, cases like this suggest that many patient groups are given little choice but to take the conditions placed on them by Big Pharma funders, or face closure.

It is not easy to know the scale of pharmaceutical funding of patient groups, since few companies publicly disclose such contributions. To their credit, GlaxoSmithKline is a rare example of a company that effectively discloses its patient group funding to the public. Above is their data for 2017, likely only a drop in the bucket of all funding for patient groups.

There is also evidence that certain pharma-funded patient groups toe a similar line to the industry on the issue of a single-payer universal pharmacare plan for Canada.

One coalition of 24 patient organizations with pharmaceutical funding recently argued for “a full array of approved medicines... including more recently approved advancements” and warned that “access delayed is access denied.” Another coalition of patient advocacy groups, focused on rare disorders, told the Hill Times in 2018 that a national pharmacare program could slow or limit access to new drugs for some patients, such as those with rare diseases, who are much more likely to get access to the latest therapies under private drug plans than those who rely solely on a public plan. Innovative Medicines Canada bought a Hill Times ad two months earlier with a similar message.

These examples suggest that pharmaceutical giants are sometimes able to buy additional lobbying influence through their conditional funding of under-resourced patient groups.

Second, create echo chambers to promote your position

The second prong in the strategy to stop pharmacare is the creation of echo chambers of information designed to convince the public and media to favour policies that ultimately serve commercial interests. Information is generated and disseminated to the public via think tanks and other policy outfits funded by wealthy donors and corporations with a vested interest in stopping pharmacare from emerging in Canada. A revolving door connects the cast of characters at the Canadian think tanks to the pharmaceutical industry and larger U.S.-based conservative and business-friendly institutions. What emerges is a media campaign involving many industry-linked organizations singing from the same songbook.

Think tanks that oppose pharmacare draw funds from the ultra-rich and large corporations both from Canada and abroad. Due to murky public disclosure practices, it is challenging to uncover who the donors are and how much they contribute. Nevertheless, some examples can be traced that show part of the overall picture.

One deep-pocketed Canadian funder is the Aurea Foundation, a registered charitable organization founded by the late Canadian billionaire Peter Munk. From 2011 to 2017, Aurea gave $1.7 million to the Fraser Institute, $1.3 million to the Macdonald-Laurier Institute and $968,000 to the Montreal Economic Institute, three think tanks that oppose pharmacare. Additional funding included $5 million in donations by the Munk family in 2016 to establish the Peter Munk Centre for Free Enterprise Education at the Fraser Institute.

One of Canada’s wealthiest families, the Westons, who own Shoppers Drug Mart — Canada’s largest pharmacy chain — also frequently supports the Fraser Institute. Their charitable family foundation has a history of collaboration with the institute.

Foreign billionaires and Big Pharma lobbies are also generous donors to Canadian think tanks that oppose pharmacare.

In 2004, the U.S. pharmaceutical industry’s lobbying arm, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, known as PhRMA, ramped up its lobbying budget to US$150 million to support a series of projects that would target American legislators and also foreign governments, including Canada. The plan was dedicated to funding a standing network of economists, “thought leaders” and think tanks to act as an intellectual echo chamber sympathetic to the industry, and to develop strategic alliances with doctors, patients, universities and influential members of minority groups. The PhRMA budget included $1 million “to change the Canadian health-care system.”

One objective of PhRMA was to keep global drug prices high, including those north of the border, where our lower drug prices and public health-care system constantly remind Americans of the level of dysfunction in their system. Price control efforts in Canada were seen as particularly problematic because they created “politically unsustainable cross-border pricing differences...”

The Fraser Institute received $4.3 million in foreign funding over 10 years from billionaire U.S. donors, beginning in the early 2000s. More than half (approximately $2.7 million) of the total foreign funding came from the Eli Lilly and Co. Foundation, a charitable arm of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly. According to the U.S.-based Center for Media and Democracy — an organization that tracks corporations’ PR campaigns and identifies corporate front groups — between 1995 and 2014 the Fraser Institute received over $1 million from the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, and $400,000 from the Searle Freedom Trust, a private foundation founded with wealth from G.D. Searle pharmaceuticals (now part of Pfizer, another pharma giant).

Canadian think tanks also receive funding from the U.S.-based Atlas Network, which is funded by billionaires such as the Koch brothers. Founded and initially bankrolled by British billionaire Antony Fisher, Atlas Network was an extension of Fisher’s mission to “litter the world with free-market think tanks.” Among the 13 organizations listed as Canadian global partners of the Atlas Network are the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, the Fraser Institute, the Montreal Economic Institute and the MacDonald-Laurier Institute for Public Policy.

The Atlas Network also is actively supporting the creation of new think tanks that support its mission in Canada and abroad.

According to the Atlas Network’s Annual Report for 2016, Canadian partner organizations received over $200,000 in grant funding, though it is unclear which organizations in particular benefited.

The people who work for these industry-funded think tanks often have deep ties to the pharmaceutical sector and larger U.S.-based think tanks. Although numerous examples exist, here are three.

The Canadian Health Policy Institute is another think tank that opposes pharmacare with ties to deep-pocketed donors. Its founder is a former CEO and director of health policy studies at the Fraser Institute, and was executive director of health and economic policy at Innovative Medicines Canada for four years. Despite a staff of three, the CHPI bills itself as an “evidence-based activist think tank.”

A former federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation for six years subsequently moved on to Rx&D (the precursor to Innovative Medicines Canada) and now works as a senior director for government relations with Purdue Pharma.

The media offensive

The Fraser Institute in Vancouver is one of the most established conservative think tanks in Canada. Founded in 1974, it has maintained a long-standing campaign to oppose public single-payer health care. As interest in pharmacare picked up in recent years, the Fraser Institute began contributing to the echo chamber of opposition. In 2018 alone, the Fraser Institute published six articles opposing universal single-payer pharmacare. Articles included titles such as “Pharmacare is the wrong solution at the wrong time” and “Before implementing national pharmacare, look at what provinces already offer.”

The institute also pitches opinion pieces in local newspapers in order to access new audiences across Canada. For example, in an effort to sway public opinion in just one small province, the Fraser Institute has published opinion pieces with titles such as “Prescription Drugs in Canada — target those who need help,” in the Moncton Times, and “Pharmacare — be careful what you wish for” in the New Brunswick Telegraph-Journal.

Adding to the echo chamber, the billionaire-funded Macdonald-Laurier Institute also published five articles in 2018, opposing universal single-payer pharmacare. Titles include “Fill in the gaps to strengthen pharmacare” and “Single-payer pharmacare is a cure worse than the system,” the latter published in the Hill Times in November.

As well, the Macdonald-Laurier Institute secured publication of three opinion pieces in the Financial Post in 2018 on pharmacare, with titles such as “Canadians are being fooled into thinking we’ll like pharmacare: we really, really won’t,” “Turns out nearly all Canadians already have drug coverage, despite the pharmacare myths” and “We can make medicine affordable without the damage pharmacare will cause Canadians.”

As recently as Jan. 23, the Canadian Health Policy Institute secured the publication of another opinion piece in the Financial Post, entitled “Trudeau spreads the Big Pharmacare myth that scores of Canadians can’t afford medicine.”

The Montreal Economic Institute, an Atlas partner and recipient of funding from the Aurea Foundation, adds yet another voice to the anti-public pharmacare echo chamber. One MEI-based economist has written articles with the titles “The risks that come with a national pharmacare program” in the Globe and Mail and “National pharmacare plan not the answer” in the Ottawa Citizen.

The Canadian Taxpayers Federation has also put pharmacare in its crosshairs. The CTF published a piece against pharmacare on CBC’s Opinion website in October 2018, titled “There will be no such thing as painless national pharmacare.” In other publications, CTF parrots the lines of big-moneyed interests, declaring that “there should never be a national pharmacare program” and that rather “more participation by the private sector” is the best path forward. Armed with its base of 140,000 supporters across Canada, the CTF has a powerful capacity to bolster the Big Money echo chamber in Canada.

Domestic and foreign billionaires and pharmaceutical giants have long targeted Canada’s public health system and now want to prevent Canada from implementing a universal single-payer pharmacare plan that Canadians so badly need. In an effort to head off public antipathy towards them, these deep-pocketed interests have deployed a campaign of mass public persuasion, using echo chambers to achieve their goal.

Canadians and the powerful Big Money Club

Though seemingly diverse, virtually all the opposition to pharmacare can be traced back to a network of well-funded interests exerting their influence largely in secret. This Big Money Club — made up of pharmaceutical companies, the health insurance industry, and both Canadian and foreign free-market billionaires — are the only players who stand to lose from pharmacare. For the rest of Canadians, pharmacare would be a substantial gain.

Big Pharma Created the Opioid Epidemic; We Can Stop It read more

With deep pockets and considerable resources, the Big Money Club is employing an expansive strategy to stop the delivery of pharmacare to Canadians. Tapping into a deep well of resources and overlapping networks, they are influencing politicians and policymakers through lobbying and inflammatory advertising. They are creating echo chambers to distort the information available to the public and the media, and to promote a fear of change. Finally, they are calling for backup from the Trump Administration to exert international commercial pressure on Canada to maintain the status quo and reconsider reforms.

As Canadians look to the federal election in the fall of 2019, we cannot let the big-moneyed interests distort health policy in Canada to the exclusive benefit of their profit margins.

Canadians must demand our elected officials choose policies that defend the interests of all Canadians over Big Money.

Ben Spurr talks to officials with the Toronto Transit Commission every day and can tell just by looking at a streetcar when it went into service.

He’s been the transportation reporter at the Toronto Star for nearly three years and says he can’t help that his beat changes the way he views Toronto, but he still tries to keep a balance.

“I try to remain a bit removed from it so that I’m not too absorbed, so that I can still speak in plain language (for readers),” Spurr said.

The public is at the forefront of why journalists do their work and Spurr said he also keeps readers in mind when coming up with story ideas. For example, he noticed a lot of talk on social media and among advocacy groups about road safety being a concern, so he made a point to explore those issues.

Spurr said while he’s passionate about his beat, he’s more passionate about journalism.

“All the things that apply to the regular field of journalism – holding people powerful to account, giving a voice to people who might not otherwise have a voice – those are the stories that I find the most fulfilling and that I’m most passionate about.”

He doesn’t get tired of writing about the same topic because he feels there’s enough variety within it and said there’s an upside in the repetition: bringing insight and context from knowledge a non-beat reporter may not have.

Spurr’s March 2019 investigation into TTC officers using controversial forms to collect users’ private information prompted the TTC to stop using them. The investigation uncovered they were the same forms the police had previously used for carding, the street check system previous Star investigations had found police were using for racial profiling.

He said he’s most proud of his work that was first published in 2017 that uncovered how Ontario’s former transportation minister intervened in getting GO Transit stations approved, including one in his own riding.

“It was quite a fulfilling story to see play out,” Spurr said.

His editor, Irene Gentle, said Spurr checks of all the boxes of a great beat reporter: he breaks stories, handles breaking news well and is a “beautiful” feature writer. But a journalist like Spurr is becoming an anomaly in some newsrooms as the number of beat reporters shrinks.

J-Source spoke with Gentle and two others, one at the helm of the Whitehorse Star and the other at CTV Saskatoon. While all three editors manage differently sized offices, and approach beat reporting distinctively, they each stressed its value.

They said focusing on the same subject matter allows reporters to develop strong and trusting relationships with sources, ask the right questions, provide unique context and insight, break stories and write in-depth pieces.

But it’s a time of shrinking newsrooms, journalists having to navigate the proverbial “do more with less” and a digital landscape that outlets are still trying to master. Specialized beats emerged in the 1920s and have been on the decline for at least a decade, likely longer, according to a 2013 article from the Ryerson Review of Journalism.

The detriments of a lack of beat reporting are felt by both the public and journalists: reporters with a surface understanding of a topic, despite their best efforts, may not be as critical or ask the right questions, therefore providing audiences with less.

An editor of a large newspaper, the long-time editor of a small paper and a broadcast news director from a medium-sized market share what beat reporting looks like in their newsrooms:

The Toronto Star – reversing a trend

Virtually all newsrooms in Canada have experienced downsizing in recent years and the Toronto Star is no exception. But while other organizations cut beats, the Toronto Star did the opposite.

“In a way, I guess we may have kind of reversed a trend,” Toronto Star editor Irene Gentle said.

The Star cut general assignment reporters, rather than beat reporters. The majority of reporters at the paper are assigned to a beat, which allows for more specific and unique ones like work and wealth, the Toronto Blue Jays and affordable housing.

“If we can’t do everything, then let’s pick areas that we think are really important, that we think people will think are really important, and focus our energies there,” Gentle said, adding the paper also chooses less covered topics.

There are still beats she’d like to add to the newsroom, but said if she had unlimited staff, she still wouldn’t want every reporter assigned to a specific file.

General assignment reporters bring a “real flexibility and a real freshness” to journalism and file stories and bring ideas that just don’t fall into a beat, Gentle said.

While she feels very strongly about beat reporting, Gentle said she values all types of journalism.

“They all fit into the mix that’s important to help people be informed and to be a responsible journalistic outlet,” she says.

The Whitehorse Daily Star – informal collaboration

There are four reporters at the Whitehorse Daily Star and each is assigned to a beat: municipal affairs, legislature, courts and RCMP, and one reporter handles mining, Indigenous affairs, wildlife and the environment. Those beats have been defined at the paper for decades.

“It’s a system that’s been in use in the paper since the 1970s and we find it continues to work and we haven’t made any major changes to them,” long-time editor Jim Butler said.

He said he’s open to changing the beats but rarely gets asked, plus having the same beats for decades has served the paper well. Butler pointed to a story the paper broke in 2002 when the then-political reporter’s source divulged that the premier would be calling a territorial election. The paper had the scoop and ran a front-page story before the election date was announced.

“It caused a lot of anger and turmoil within senior government levels and amazed our competitors,” Butler said, adding it wouldn’t have been possible without the time dedicated to the beat.

Reporters have generally always stuck to a beat at the Whitehorse Star, except for a short period when the paper went down to two reporters during a recession from 1982 to 1985.

“During those three years, the beats kind of dissolved and people just did what had to be done,” Butler said.

As soon as the paper was fully staffed again, so were the beats.

General assignment and breaking news stories are divvied up among the reporters, who receive help from Butler if needed. He has been with the paper for nearly 40 years and has been editor for 31. Two of the current reporters have been there since 1985 and 2000, while the other two started last year.

The institutional knowledge benefits the new reporters. He said a smaller newsroom allows for collaboration to help with general assignments.

“We have the advantage of being a lot more informal,” Butler said.

CTV Saskatoon – areas of focus

There are two main challenges standing in the way of beats in the medium-sized market of CTV Saskatoon: staffing levels and turnover, according to news director Jill Smith.

“You see the beats disappearing all the time,” she said.

Medium-sized markets see more turnover and can be a training ground for some journalists. Young journalists can grow and develop at CTV Saskatoon. They often find their voice, learn an area of focus, then leave for a bigger market before they can become strong beat reporters, Smith said.

For reporters that do stay in the medium markets, and in the business, they often move on to more senior roles, leaving reporter positions open for less experienced journalists looking to hone their skills.

“It’s rare to see a person who has been a reporter for 20 years. They move to become producers or they’re running newsrooms,” Smith said.

There are advantages to less beat reporters, including having a group of well-rounded reporters that are flexible and can tackle any type of story.

“When breaking news happens, when a big story happens, you need the ability to be able to send any of them to that story. Especially when you’re in a smaller market.”

CTV Saskatoon has a roster of general assignment reporters, some of who have an area of focus. Smith said that comes to be organically by reporters taking an interest in a topic and being tenacious about learning it.

She helps develop this by noticing a trend with reporters’ pitches, giving feedback and asking reporters: What stories are missing that you want to do?",How beat reporting in 2019 works at 3 different-sized outlets across Canada,J-Source,http://j-source.ca/article/how-beat-reporting-in-2019-works-in-3-different-sized-newsrooms-across-canada/

He will replace former premier Brian Gallant as Liberal leader. Gallant resigned after his government lost its majority in the legislature in last September's election and then lost a confidence vote in November.

The Liberal party board will meet next Tuesday to vote on the committee's recommendation.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet in the wake of allegations that as attorney general she had been subject to inappropriate pressure to intervene in the criminal prosecution of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin. In the subsequent days Philpott also resigned her position as Treasury Board President over the government’s handling of the matter. Roughly an hour after Trudeau announced his decision, the following statement was posted on Philpott’s Facebook page:

Tonight I was expelled from the caucus of the Liberal Party of Canada. Sadly the decision was made without me being provided any opportunity to speak to national caucus. This is profoundly disheartening for me, my staff and my family – and I know people in Markham-Stouffville will also be disappointed.

I was accused publicly by people in caucus of not being loyal, of trying to bring down the Prime Minister, of being politically motivated, and of being motivated by my friendship with Jody Wilson-Raybould. These accusations were coupled with public suggestions that I should be forced out of caucus.

These attacks were based on inaccuracies and falsehoods. I did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the Prime Minister. Nor did Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former Attorney General in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould’s credibility and attempt to blame her. That approach now appears to be focused on whether Jody Wilson-Raybould should have audiotaped the Clerk instead of the circumstances that prompted Jody Wilson-Raybould to feel compelled to do so.

I was not able to support the recommended response to deny these allegations. My constitutional obligations including Cabinet solidarity and collective responsibility compelled me to resign as a Cabinet member under these circumstances.

This isn’t about a lack of loyalty. On the contrary, I recommended that the government acknowledge what happened in order to move forward. This was an expression of loyalty, not disloyalty — in the same way that Jody Wilson-Raybould attempted to protect the Prime Minister from the obvious short-term and long-term consequences of attempts to interfere with prosecutorial independence — but to no avail.

This also isn’t about political advantage or strategy. It is frankly absurd to suggest that I would leave one of the most senior portfolios in government for personal advancement or merely out of friendship with Jody Wilson-Raybould.

I have also been criticized for not telling my complete story in Parliament because I would be shielded by Parliamentary immunity. Much of the story has now been told by Jody Wilson-Raybould as a result of the additional information she provided to the Justice Committee. Anything else is covered by Cabinet privilege that has not been waived. It would be irresponsible for me to breach Cabinet privilege simply because I could do so without being prosecuted for the breach. Parliamentary privilege is not designed as a licence for breaching your constitutional and ethical obligations.

Throughout these events, I have continued to support Liberal policies and the commitments we made. As a member of Cabinet, I would have been compelled to support in Question Period and in the media the government’s response to the SNC-Lavalin case and speak in support of that response. I could not do this and as a result, I was compelled to resign. I thought there should be scope within the caucus and the party for a range of views on the SNC-Lavalin case including the views I expressed directly to the Prime Minister. Indeed, the need has never been greater for a measured re-evaluation of how the government should respond to this issue. What I have heard from Canadians is that they want to know the truth.

That being said, it appears that the caucus is intent on staying the current course, regardless of its short-term and long-term consequences to the party and to the country, and it has been decided that there is no place for me in the caucus.

I regret that relationships have been so fractured. I have nothing but good wishes for my former Liberal colleagues and all those who commit themselves to public service.

I ran to be a Member of Parliament for the purpose of improving people’s lives. Nothing will stop me from continuing in that pursuit.

He has drafted a five-point plan that calls for growing the province’s economy and population, improving health care, “transforming” education, ensuring environmental protection and making sure provincial finances are well managed.

Vickers, who also served as Canada’s ambassador to Ireland, has acknowledged spending many years away from the province, but he has also focused on his deep roots in New Brunswick.

Vickers had a long career of public service, including 29 years in the RCMP. He also served as aide-de-camp for the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick. He served as sergeant-at-arms for the House of Commons between 2006 and 2015.

On Oct. 22, 2014, Vickers was serving as sergeant-at-arms of the Commons when he shot and helped take down a man armed with a .30-30 rifle. Michael Zihaf Bibeau had barged into Centre Block on Parliament Hill after killing honour guard reservist Cpl. Nathan Cirillo at the National War Memorial.

The provincial Liberals under then-premier Brian Gallant won just 21 seats in an election last fall – one fewer than the Tories – and they relinquished their hold on power in November after losing a confidence vote in the legislature.

Premier Blaine Higgs’ minority government is relying on support from a third party – the right-leaning People’s Alliance, led by Kris Austin.

In an hour-long meeting that consisted mostly of partisan bickering, the Liberals used their 5-4 majority on the committee to reject the motion, backed by both Conservatives and New Democrats. The motion did not give a list of potential witnesses, but called for the committee to sit additional hours to study the matter and report back by May 31.

“Is this the perfect venue to investigate this matter? No it isn’t,” said Conservative MP Michael Cooper during the meeting. “But seeing as the Prime Minister is seeming to take no action, and given that the attorney general has shown no interest in pursuing the matter, we’re left with where we are today.”

In late March, while the SNC-Lavalin affair was at full boil, CTV News and The Canadian Press both reported — citing anonymous sources — that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had disagreed with Wilson-Raybould’s choice to replace chief justice Beverley McLachlin on the court in 2017. Wilson-Raybould had preferred Manitoba Chief Justice Glenn Joyal, the reports said, but Trudeau rejected that choice because he saw Joyal as too critical of how courts apply the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Trudeau eventually chose to appoint Alberta Judge Sheilah Martin to the top court and promoted sitting Justice Richard Wagner to the role of chief justice. The reports said the episode led Trudeau to doubt Wilson-Raybould’s judgment, and it soured their relationship long before the SNC-Lavalin affair came up.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the leak did not come from him or his office.

The leak was widely condemned by organizations representing lawyers and judges, who described it as a threat to the integrity of a selection process that is supposed to be highly confidential. At the time, Wilson-Raybould herself also condemned the leak, said she was not the source of it, and called for “some sort of investigation as to the source of this information.”

Joyal also issued a statement, saying he feared that “someone is using my previous candidacy to the Supreme Court of Canada to further an agenda unrelated to the appointment process. This is wrong.”

At Wednesday’s committee meeting, opposition members argued that this appeared to be the only real chance to get to the bottom of the matter.

“The integrity of how we appoint people to the highest court of our land is at issue,” said the NDP’s justice critic Murray Rankin during the meeting.

He added that it’s personal for him, as he was one of the two opposition members, along with Conservative MP Rob Nicholson, who sat on the nomination advisory committee on the agreement they keep the information secret.

“I am under a cloud of suspicion, as is my colleague from the Conservative Party,” he said. “I was prepared to go to my grave with the information as to who were the finalists in the process.”

He also rebutted Liberal accusations that they were trying to haul journalists before the committee, saying he’s focused on who leaked the information, not on journalists for doing their job in publishing it.

“I want to hear from people in the Department of Justice,” Rankin said. “I want to hear from people in Prime Minister’s Office. Somebody leaked it. It was either my Conservative friend, myself, or an official.”

Liberal MPs said they were rejecting the motion because the committee is a poor venue for investigating the leak, and pointed out there were also leaks of information over the botched 2013 Supreme Court nomination of Marc Nadon at a time when a Conservative government was in power.

The Liberals accused the opposition of just trying to play politics and keep the SNC-Lavalin affair alive in the news.

“This is really becoming an abuse of process, when we’re trying to politicize everything and trying to make sure that we don’t get around to dealing with all of the issues that Canadians expect us to deal with,” Liberal MP Ali Ehsassi said.

Rankin argued that the Liberals have condemned leaks in much stronger terms in the past. He pointed to Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale calling it “very, very serious” in 2017 when the Omar Khadr $10.5-million settlement payment was leaked. The Privy Council Office went on to investigate that leak, though it won’t say if the hunt was successful.

In 2015, the government referred an investigation to the RCMP into who leaked information about a $700-million shipbuilding project; it eventually resulted in a criminal charge against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, who has a trial scheduled for August.

Rankin told reporters that he thinks decisions over which leaks to investigate “get made on political grounds, sadly, and the administration of justice, and Canadians, deserve better.”

Philpott says Trudeau did not follow changes to the Parliament of Canada Act made in 2015 that required each party caucus to have recorded votes after the last election on whether to adopt rules in the act laying out how caucus members could be removed or reinstated.

The idea was to give MPs more power in their caucus rooms, rather than leave such decisions entirely up to the party leaders.

The fact that Michelle Rempel could now be the Liberal spokesperson on immigration wasn’t a ...,"Andrew MacDougall is a London (UK) based columnist, commentator and consultant. He was formerly Director of Communications to Stephen Harper.

Hark! Word comes from Ottawa of the vaunted channel change from SNC-Lavalin!

With everyone busy rubbernecking the multi-car, highway-closing SNC-Lavalin pile up, Finance Minister Bill Morneau went ahead and tabled his budget implementation bill. And buried in that 392-page (!) behemoth was a change to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that would make it harder to claim refugee status in Canada.

To take things in order: 1) yes, there was a federal budget this year; 2) yes, it is being jammed through the House via an omnibus bill (which the Liberals promised never to do); 3) yes, omnibus legislation is how Liberals tucked deferred prosecution agreements into the criminal code for SNC last year; and 4) the Liberals are now massive hypocrites.

Trudeau’s vaunted “Welcome to Canada” poster is now festooned with giant brand-damaging caveats: If you, dear asylum seeker, have opened a claim for refugee protection in another country, have already made an unsuccessful claim in Canada, been deemed inadmissible because of your criminal record, or been granted refugee protection elsewhere, your claim is now ineligible for consideration.

And if all of that sounds like common sense to you, welcome to where federal and provincial Conservatives have been for the past three years. Or, as the Liberals used to call it: being un-Canadian.

The budget bill sleight of hand on asylum claims follows the Liberals’ earlier fold on the Safe Third Country Agreement, which they are now looking to revise in negotiations with the United States, another step the Conservatives have been urging for the better part of two years.

“I can tell you we’ve been working very hard over the past several months to significantly reduce the number of people who are crossing our borders irregularly,” Conservative Minister Bill Blair told reporters. “There’s a right way to come to the country to seek asylum and/or to seek to immigrate to this country, and we’re trying to encourage people to use the appropriate channels and to disincentivize people from doing it improperly,” Blair added.

Blair is, of course, a Liberal. He just sounds like a Conservative, based on the volte-face evidence; 40,000+ “irregular” asylum claims from the United States will do that to you. The Liberals have been thoroughly mugged by the reality of this year’s election.

And what of the mountains of prior Liberal talk of principles, compassion and openness? One presumes they’re buried in the backlog of asylum claims Trudeau said the system was equipped to handle.

The step change in direction on entry to Canada has certainly upset the cast of immigration and asylum advocates who threw themselves at Trudeau’s feet after Trudeau threw open Canada’s doors in the midst of the 2015 refugee crisis in Europe.

Janet Dench, executive director of the Canadian Council for Refugees, anticipates a Charter challenge to Trudeau’s proposed reforms, while Maureen Silcoff, chair of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers’ litigation committee, bemoaned the “degraded” nature of the system being proposed. “This is really a devastating attack on refugee rights,” Dench concluded.

These criticisms—to say nothing of the changes themselves—should terrify the Liberals who, as they never fail to tell us, are the party of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. One wonders whether the lemmings on the Grit backbench were even made aware of them. It certainly explains why the changes were buried in a budget bill and not debated in the harsh light of day. Opaque ways, my friends.

Refugee advocates will now add their names to the rather long and distinguished list of disappointed Liberal stakeholders: electoral reform advocates, transparency gurus, balanced-budget believers, sticklers for the rule of law, Indigenous rights groups and environmentalists, to name a few.

But the criticism from the asylum crowd is of a different calibre, one that will leave a mark. The Liberals are sawing at a pillar of their core identity, to say nothing of their brand promise. Liberals of the Trudeau vintage didn’t get into politics to be a Tory on asylum and immigration.

Now that the media have spotted the change we shouldn’t be surprised if Trudeau kicks Jody Wilson-Raybould out of caucus again to change the channel. Or, barring that, give another $12 million climate gift to a wealthy grocery retailer with a history of price-fixing a food staple. The point being, the longer the discussion stays on the asylum about-face the more Trudeau will sink.

And with Liberal support continuing to bleed every which way, Trudeau could yet have further to fall. Indeed, bar the carbon tax, it’s not clear what the Liberals propose to stand on in the next election. Well, other than power for power’s sake, which has always been the Liberal proposition.

But it wasn’t Trudeau’s; he promised a different Liberal Party. The fact that Michelle Rempel could now be the Liberal spokesperson on immigration wasn’t a part of the vision he sold to Canadians.

But on asylum, as with Trudeau’s other disappointments, it turns out that #WelcomeToCanada was #OnlyAMarketingSlogan.

In your opinion, which of Canada’s major political parties is most favoured by the ...","Andrew Scheer’s Conservative Party is setting itself up to run against a familiar foe in the upcoming election: the media.

In recent weeks the party mailed a survey to Tory donors, signed by the party’s campaign director Hamish Marshall, asking them to rank major Canadian newspapers and TV stations — the Globe & Mail, Toronto Star, the Sun papers, Global, City, CTV, CBC and the National Post — based on the outlets’ perceived ideological leanings: “left of centre,” “neutral/balanced,” or “right of centre.”

The mail-out, sent to supporters as a pitch to kick in monthly donations to the party, further asks: “In your opinion, which of Canada’s major political parties is most favoured by the mainstream news media?”

A party spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the questionnaire.

“It was about raising funds for our campaign, and gathering supporters feedback on where and how they consume media, and their personal perceptions,” said party communications director Cory Hann. He added that the appeal for donations was spurred by the Liberal Party’s proposed support program for Canadian media outlets — a program that would be administered by an arms-length body, to avoid possible political favouritism.

Beyond surveying supporters’ news diet, the mail-out asks whether the party should “bypass” the news media and instead hone “an aggressive social media strategy to communicate with people directly in their homes or on their mobile devices” and whether the party “should focus on direct voter contact … that will allow us to take our message to voters unfiltered.”

It also asks whether the campaign should prioritize local and community media outlets, and invest more in advertising and a “sophisticated ground game” in order to “counter the efforts of pro-media news organizations.”

In your opinion, which of Canada’s major political parties is most favoured by the mainstream news media?

The direct-mail appeal to donors included a letter from Marshall, but the party refused to provide it to the Post.

While the Conservative Party is no stranger to taking aim at perceived bias in the media, the proliferation of hyper-partisan, conspiratorial and outright hateful online news outlets has made such tactics a riskier proposition.

As he pummelled the New York Times and CNN, Donald Trump enjoyed almost relentlessly flattering coverage from alt-right websites like Breitbart, Infowars, and the Gateway Pundit — and he, in turn, used them to relay his message to his base. He hired Breitbart co-founder Steve Bannon to apply his sharp-elbowed media tactics to the Republican presidential campaign. In so doing, though, he may have emboldened the likes of Infowars, which promotes baseless conspiracy theories including that the American government carried out the 9/11 attacks and that a 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 20 children and six adults was a hoax. Infowars has been removed from numerous platforms, including YouTube and Twitter, for promulgating hate speech.

Scheer appointed Marshall as his campaign director for the upcoming election despite controversy over Marshall’s connections to Rebel Media, an ideological cousin of Breitbart.

Marshall ran a digital strategy company, Torch Agency, from Rebel’s Toronto office, where he also ran Scheer’s leadership campaign. While with Rebel, where he was a corporate director, Marshall and Torch helped design its outreach strategies, which included aggressively microtargeting possible supporters and donors with issue-specific campaigns — a tactic he appears to have made use of in the Conservative Party as well. Often, that outreach involved attacking the mainstream media as untrustworthy.

Though a longtime Conservative strategist, Marshall’s close association with Rebel Media prompted questions, including over Scheer’s own involvement with the media organization.

Scheer made several appearances on The Rebel, but in August 2017 he announced he would no longer grant interviews to the outlet after Rebel host Faith Goldy appeared on a neo-Nazi podcast while in Virginia to cover a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, at which one person was killed. Rebel fired Goldy amid the ensuing controversy.

The questionnaire asks supporters to what extent they agree with the statements: “The mainstream Canadian media spend too much time covering left-wing social justice issues and not enough time reporting on the economy or international affairs,” and “When union leaders who represent news media workers attack Conservatives, it creates an undeniable conflict of interest.”

The party spokesperson elaborated that the mailer was referencing Jerry Dias, the president of Unifor, who has been openly critical of the Conservative Party. Unifor represents a number of newsrooms, although they represent a small fraction of the union’s 300,000-plus members.

Nutson said that the board members chose to resign independently and did not offer their resignations as ""a protest"" against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The volunteers simply ""don't have the energy"" to support another candidate, she said.

Turfed from caucus

Philpott — widely considered to be one of the most competent and respected ministers in the Trudeau government — stepped down from cabinet on March 4, saying she had lost ""confidence"" in the Liberals' handling of the SNC-Lavalin file.

The SNC-Lavalin affair has engulfed the Liberal government in the weeks since former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould claimed she'd been placed under inappropriate pressure by senior people in the government to allow SNC-Lavalin a special sentencing arrangement that would allow the Quebec-based engineering firm to avoid a trial on bribery charges.

At the time, she remained in the Liberal caucus and said she intended to run in the fall election under the Liberal Party banner.

Nearly a month later, Trudeau booted her from caucus, saying that trust had been irreparably broken.

Philpott was expelled along with former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould. Both are now back-corner independents.

Though the day highlighted the realization of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s promise to legalize cannabis during his 2015 campaign, neither he nor anyone else from the ruling Liberal party was out taking credit for it - a sign that the social stigma around marijuana is still strong.

“Canadians are accepting of legalization, but I don’t think they’re celebratory,” said Peter Donolo, a political strategist at Hill + Knowlton and communications director for former Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chretien.

Aside from difficulty keeping up with demand, legalization has gone smoothly. Online pot sales to adults began nationally on Oct. 17, but storefronts only opened in the province of Ontario, which includes the capital, on April 1.

Six months before a national election, polls show Liberals deadlocked or trailing the rival Conservative Party, and Trudeau is being cautious about weed.

Though Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has said he would not reverse legalization if elected, he has repeatedly expressed worries about safety - especially around people driving while high - and has said more young people might try marijuana now.

There are also some communities like the Vancouver suburb of Richmond, where 55 percent of the population list their ethnic origin as Chinese, which have prohibited cannabis storefronts.

“Legalization has gone well,” a government official said, but the issue is not a “primary focus”.

It is now safer to be a consumer because of regulation, the official said, adding that black market sales are falling and legal jobs and revenue are being created.

Interviews with customers and retailers at the Ottawa stores revealed that even if Trudeau is not talking about it, legalization has generated good will.

“I live close by and I’m excited to see how this store will change the neighborhood,” said Jessica, 23, who declined to give her last name. “I did not vote Liberal last time, but I might this time.”

Jessica was huddled close to an outdoor heater in front of the Fire & Flower store, which is just a 10-minute walk from both the prime minister’s office and parliament.

“We have a deep appreciation for the opportunity we’ve been granted,” said Michael Patterson, one of the shop’s two license holders.

Vivian Azer, a financial analysts who follows cannabis companies for Cowen and Company in New York, sees a bright future for Canada’s nascent marijuana industry.

She forecast cannabis retail sales reaching C$3.6 billion ($2.7 billion) in 2019, including taxes. Azer sees illicit sales declining to 11 percent of the total sales by 2025 from 90 percent last year.

By 2025, Canadian recreational weed revenue will total C$10 billion ($7.5 billion), with medical marijuana at C$2 billion ($1.5 billion), Azer estimates.

“The stigma is rolling away,” Azer said.

Cheralynn, 55, said the promise to legalize marijuana was one of the main reasons she voted for Trudeau in 2015.

“And I like Justin,” she said. “Most women do. He’s kinda cute.”","Canada's Trudeau isn't talking about it, but legal pot is going well",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKCN1RO1ZT-OCADN

Stephen Harper and Peter MacKay created the Conservative Party of Canada in the ...","Given the current morass of Brexit, it’s hard to remember that Theresa May was once an agent of change inside the British Conservative Party.

First elected in the Labour landslide of 1997, May took over as chair of her party in the summer of 2002, in the wake of a second electoral drubbing by Labour’s Tony Blair, the then-young and clued-in purveyor of “Cool Britannia.”

Staring a generation of political wilderness in the face, May took a look at her twice-battered rump of a party and spoke a few home truths at its annual convention.

“There’s a lot we need to do in this party of ours,” May urged. “Our base is too narrow and so, occasionally, are our sympathies. You know what some people call us – the Nasty Party.”

And while May’s analysis went down like a cup of cold sick in the room, the message was eventually taken to heart. David Cameron’s leadership largely succeeded in repositioning the party as pro-environment, pro-minority and pro-moderate. Well, until Brexit anyway.

Which brings us to the question at hand: Who is the Conservative Party of Canada’s Theresa May? Who will bravely pipe up about the need to widen a base that, while uber-reliable, isn’t exactly trending in the direction of modern Canada?

The answer should be Andrew Scheer, but the Tory leader has been slow off his mark on questions of nastiness since becoming leader. Every time Scheer can’t say “Muslim” in the wake of a slaughter, or finds himself at the same events as Faith Goldy, or leads the charge against meaningless UN migration compacts, a little piece of the accessible vote dies. The Tory leader always looks like he would rather be somewhere else when placed in the middle of a difficult conversation.

This discomfort is what happens when the primary concern is keeping your natives from getting restless. At some point, however, Scheer will have to treat his party membership as a foundation instead of a roof. There are only 250,000 or so CPC members, compared with the roughly 5.5 million people who voted Conservative in 2015, which itself is still a long way from the nearly seven million who voted for Justin Trudeau. Speaking to that delta population of 1.5 million ought to be a priority.

Who will bravely pipe up about the Tories’ need to widen a base that, while uber-reliable, isn’t exactly trending in the direction of modern Canada?

But how to broaden the coalition is the discussion the Conservative Party ducked in its last leadership race by limiting the contest to the slim and unrepresentative segment of society already in possession of a party membership card. And it’s the discussion the Conservative Party will want to avoid at the very moment Justin Trudeau is running the gauntlet on SNC-Lavalin. But the party needs to tackle the question head-on before the country goes to the polls this autumn.

The pressures are two-fold.

On the one hand, we have Maxime Bernier – i.e. the man who lost to Scheer by a margin so thin Trudeau would feel comfortable hanging his latest SNC defence on it – courting the nativist elements of the Conservative Party’s support. And on the other, we have a wounded and desperate Trudeau and his Liberal Party who will be searching for every bit of white nationalist hate they can scrape off the internet to affix to Scheer. The Tory leader needs to move before they can tar him.

Yes, Bernier will be condescending and shameless in response. And yes, the Liberal tactics will be pathetic and desperate. But their criticism will be pushing on an open door.

Stephen Harper and Peter MacKay created the Conservative Party of Canada in the wake of Theresa May’s “nasty party” speech and quickly set about their own plan to make sure the label didn’t stick in Canada.

Harper quickly ruled out revisiting abortion. A gay marriage vote was brought forward when it was certain to lose. Immigrant communities were courted and celebrated. The government then did its job so well it received two more mandates. The nastiness label was traded in for competence.

But by the end of the third go-round, the nastiness had soaked back in and become the narrative. Snitch lines, burqa bans and relentless political attacks were then rebuffed by sunny ways. There’s a reason Trudeau still uses Harper as his favourite curse word: it sells.

The proxy issues for nastiness at the moment are white nationalism and climate. Scheer needs to be unequivocal in his condemnation of the former and much more detailed in his policy toward the latter. He needs to tell people like Ezra Levant to jog on and tell people like Michael Chong to come forward. And, while he’s at it, he should ban his MPs from calling people a piece of poo emoji on Twitter.

Because SNC is the gift that forces Trudeau into nasty. Scheer should counter with his own version of sunny ways.

House of Commons Speaker Geoff Regan said Jane Philpott’s rights as an MP and those of Jody Wilson-Raybould were not violated. ( Sean Kilpatrick / The Canadian Press )

A new law “leaves caucuses alone with the authority to govern their internal operations,” Regan said. He said the law that Philpott was now citing explicitly stated even courts cannot review caucus decisions. “With the full authority given to caucuses themselves in such unequivocal terms, it is clear that the chair has no role in the interpretation or enforcement of this statute, even when members feel rudderless without what they feel would be clearly stated and understood rules.” The Speaker did not specifically investigate or conclude whether the Liberal caucus failed to follow proper procedures in 2015.

That’s when the Reform Act, which modified the Parliament of Canada Act, took effect and required official party caucuses to take four votes in a “recorded” manner after a general election. Those votes decide whether the caucus will adopt new powers for caucuses to have a greater say in decisions related to caucus discipline, leadership review or interim party leader. In asking Regan to intervene on Tuesday, Philpott had cited a Star report that revealed the Liberal caucus did not vote in a recorded manner in 2015. Instead the Liberal caucus came to a “consensus,” according to Liberal MP John McKay, to leave the power to decide on caucus expulsions or readmissions with the prime minister. The government and caucus chair have refused to confirm or deny how the caucus reached that consensus. Philpott said it was a breach of her privileges as an MP, and those of the former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould who backed her request to the Speaker. But Regan ruled only political party caucuses have the responsibility for ensuring proper voting procedures were followed, and their privileges were not violated even if the Liberal caucus had not done so. Trudeau had insisted the decision to eject them “was mine to make,” lawful, and backed by a united caucus.

He ejected Philpott and Wilson-Raybould last week saying they repeatedly refused to express confidence in his government and his leadership. Philpott fired back in the House of Commons.

“Expulsion should not be his decision to take unilaterally,” Philpott said Tuesday, calling it a question of fairness, due process, and the rule of law. Regan, who is an elected Liberal MP, said his only role as Speaker is to receive a letter from the caucus advising whether it made a determination on the questions. “The Speaker’s role stops there.

House of Commons Speaker Geoff Regan says he doesn't have the authority to rule on whether the law was violated or rights were breached when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled former cabinet ministers Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould from caucus.

Mr. Regan’s decision, delivered on Thursday, came in response to a question of privilege raised by Ms. Philpott in the House earlier this week. The former president of the Treasury Board said on Tuesday that her privileges were breached and the Liberals broke federal law in the process that led to the removal of herself and Ms. Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney-general and justice minister, from the party caucus last week.

At the heart of Ms. Philpott’s argument is that, after the 2015 federal election, the Liberal caucus did not conduct a recorded vote, as required under the Parliament of Canada Act, to decide whether to adopt a set of rules governing the expulsion of caucus members and other matters. Liberal MP John McKay has said “there was no vote” when the Liberal caucus met after the 2015 election to decide how to proceed with the rules.

Mr. Regan said in his decision that the authority of the Speaker is “limited to the internal affairs of the House, its own proceedings” and “does not extend to caucus matters.”

He said the law only requires he be informed of whether a party caucus has decided to adopt rules that give rank-and-file MPs more say in matters such as the removal of caucus members.

“The only role of the Speaker is to be advised of the caucus decision. … The Speaker’s role stops there. It does not, in any way, extend to interpreting the results of the votes, how the votes were taken or interpreting any other relevant provisions,” Mr. Regan said.

Opinion: Justin Trudeau, a Prime Minister of symbols, falls to Earth

Ms. Philpott said the absence of a caucus vote in November, 2015, after the federal election, meant the caucus never voted to adopt the rules, including one that said 20 per cent of a caucus must submit written notice to review an MP’s membership, and that MPs can be ejected only if a majority of all caucus members vote to do so in a secret ballot. Ms. Philpott also noted no caucus vote took place before Mr. Trudeau expelled her and Ms. Wilson-Raybould last week. Mr. Trudeau has said he consulted caucus before his decision.

The Liberals say they decided as a caucus not to adopt the rules in November, 2015, and communicated that decision to the Commons Speaker at that time.

“For these reasons, the chair is unable to conclude that the member for Markham-Stouffville has been obstructed in the fulfillment of her parliamentary functions,” Mr. Regan said in his ruling.

On Feb. 27, Ms. Wilson-Raybould told the Commons justice committee that as attorney-general she faced “consistent and sustained” pressure from Mr. Trudeau and top officials, including “veiled threats,” on the need to shelve the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott quit cabinet over the government’s handling of the matter.

Meanwhile on Thursday, the Liberals used their majority on a House of Commons committee to defeat a Conservative motion calling for an investigation into the leak of confidential information about applicants for a seat on the Supreme Court of Canada.

The Canadian Press and CTV reported on March 25 that Ms. Wilson-Raybould recommended Glenn Joyal, Chief Justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench, to become chief justice. According to sources, Mr. Trudeau was concerned about her choice because he believed Justice Joyal favoured a conservative, restrictive approach to interpreting the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Mr. Trudeau ultimately named sitting Supreme Court Justice Richard Wagner to replace retiring chief justice Beverley McLachlin. He also appointed Alberta judge Sheilah Martin to fill Western Canada’s seat on the bench (Ms. McLachlin was born and raised in Alberta and rose through the judicial ranks in British Columbia).

Conservative MP Michael Cooper, who introduced the motion, said the “shocking and unprecedented” leaks smeared respected judges and undermined the independence of the judiciary by publicizing what was supposed to be confidential information about the selection process for Supreme Court appointments.

But Liberals countered that the motion was entirely political, aimed at further dragging out the SNC-Lavalin affair, which has been plaguing the Trudeau government for more than two months.

The committee should take Mr. Trudeau at his word that neither he nor his staffers had anything to do with the leaks, Liberal MP Ali Ehsassi said.

Story continues below advertisement

The Globe and Mail reported on March 26, citing an unnamed source, that Ms. Wilson-Raybould wanted to elevate Justice Joyal to the Supreme Court to make way for an Indigenous judge to take his place at the head of the Manitoba court. The source also said Ms. Wilson-Raybould believed Justice Wagner was more conservative in his approach to the charter than Justice Joyal.

“What we have as a result of this leak is an undermining of the integrity of the appointment process,” Mr. Cooper told the committee, adding that Justice Joyal, Justice Wagner and Justice Martin have all had a “cloud” put over them. “Quite frankly, this goes to the heart of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, which has been undermined as a result of this leak.”

New Democrat MP Murray Rankin said he and Conservative MP Rob Nicholson are also under a cloud since, as their parties’ justice critics at the time, they had access to all the confidential information about the finalists recommended by an independent panel for appointment to the top court.

Liberals take Mr. Rankin and Mr. Nicholson at their words that they didn’t leak anything about the appointments, either, Mr. Ehsassi said.

He agreed the leaks were “regrettable,” but said they were not unprecedented. He noted that information about the selection process was leaked in 2014, when the Conservative government of the day named Marc Nadon to the top court – an appointment that was later struck down by the Supreme Court because Justice Nadon did not meet technical eligibility requirements. There was no investigation into that leak.

HALIFAX -- Nova Scotia's Tory leader says possible federal bids from three provincial PC legislators is a signal of Justin Trudeau's falling fortunes.

The spring session of the legislature ended Friday with three Progressive Conservative MLAs discussing potential plans to run in this year's national race.

Chris d'Entremont, the member for Argyle-Barrington and a former cabinet minister, confirmed to journalists he will seek the federal nomination in West Nova.

Eddie Orrell, the member for Northside-Westmount, also confirmed he's in the final stages of planning a potential bid for a federal nomination in Sydney.

And Alfie MacLeod, the member for Sydney River-Mira-Louisbourg, said he will take the next month to finalize his decision on whether to run in the Liberal stronghold of Cape Breton-Canso.

Party leader Tim Houston said if the exodus unfolds, it won't reflect poorly on him or suggest there is unfinished business from his recent victory in the party's leadership contest.

Rather, he says there's ""a lot of pressure to seek a federal nomination,"" for members of his 17-person caucus, who are keen to break the Liberal grip on Atlantic Canada.

""It's more a reflection of what is happening elsewhere in government,"" he said.

""I think what you're seeing here is there is pressure on members of the legislature to seek federal nominations and there's opportunities that are created by the way the (federal) Liberals are working.""

""I don't think, if this were the last federal election, that you would see that many members seeking opportunities. The landscape has changed.""

D'Entremont is a former cabinet minister in past Tory governments, and has held his seat in southern Nova Scotia for five provincial elections.

He said outside the house that he's done most of what he'd set out to do in provincial politics.

The party stalwart served in the governments of former Tory premiers John Hamm and Rodney MacDonald, and his accomplishments include bringing in the family pharmacare program while he was minister of health.

He's looking to run in the southern Nova Scotia riding of West Nova -- which has swung back and forth between the Liberals and Conservatives over the past century. Incumbent Liberal MP Colin Fraser announced last year he would not seek re-election.

Orrell said outside the house that he wants to deliver more for Cape Breton as a federal MP.

""I figure ... it's time to get back to a Tory government in Ottawa to deliver more for the area... I'm up for a challenge,"" he said.

He said he'll finalize his decision over the weekend following a discussion with his wife and family.

MacLeod, wearing his trademark tartan tie, said ""this may very well be my last question in the House of Assembly,"" during question period.

He then asked -- to loud cheers -- about what the minister's plan was to upgrade the New Boston Road, a rural route in his riding that he's complained about for the past decade.

MacLeod later told reporters his decision may be influenced by whether Cape Breton-Canso Liberal MP Roger Cuzner decides to re-offer, noting that incumbency is a key factor in Atlantic Canadian politics.

""I believe there is a switch going on. I believe there is a shift in the attitude of individuals and I want to be the agent of that change,"" said MacLeod.

The Liberal government doesn't seem to be facing a similar exodus, though Environment Minister Margaret Miller has said she won't be re-offering in 2021.

Premier Stephen McNeil wished the departing Tory members well, focusing on d'Entremont's record of cordial conduct.

He said he expects all of his party's members will be back for the legislature's fall session.

And after battling both internally and at the ballot box for decades to play more than a token role on the provincial political stage, the surprise move leaves Lamont and the party scrambling on the eve of a possible election; Premier Brian Pallister has hinted recently he may send Manitobans to the polls before the scheduled Oct. 6, 2020 vote.

If Klassen is successful in her bid to run under the Liberal banner in the federal riding of Churchill Keewatinook-Aski, Manitoba Liberal Leader Dougald Lamont and MLAs Cindy Lamoureux and former leader Jon Gerrard will be without the necessary fourth seat in the house required to maintain official status.

Her decision could significantly weaken the provincial party, which gained official status in the legislature last summer after 23 years without the funding, research staff and guaranteed participation in question period and on committees that accompany it.

Grit MLA Judy Klassen is prepared to sacrifice the gains it has taken Manitoba Liberals more than two decades to achieve in order to pursue her dream of running for Justin Trudeau in this fall's federal election.

Klassen was elected as MLA for Keewatinook in 2016, snagging an upset victory against NDP incumbent and former cabinet minister Eric Robinson.

She served as interim party leader after Rana Bokhari stepped down following the 2016 election and then fought for control of the party — eventually dropping out and throwing her support behind Lamoureux — at the October 2017 leadership convention.

Lamont acknowledged that Klassen's pending departure could put the Liberals in a bind, but told reporters he'd support her decision. In March he told the Free Press that he and his three MLAs would be seeking nominations in advance of Manitobans heading to the polls.

The prospect of an early election may be more of an immediate concern, he said.

""We’re all in an odd position because the premier seems intent on breaking his fixed election date… so because of that everything’s up in the air, so we’re trying to cover all our bases and so is (Klassen),"" he said.

Klassen, who filed her federal nomination papers Wednesday, said she plans to hold onto her provincial Liberal nomination, but would abandon it in order to legally campaign as a federal candidate.

If nominated federally, she would square off against NDP incumbent Niki Ashton, who has represented the riding since 2015 when it was established and Churchill before that, from 2008 until 2015.

""The investments that the federal government has made in the North have really greatly impacted my communities and I want to make sure that continues,"" Klassen said, adding said she's confident the Liberals will keep her seat, no matter who the candidate is.

""I’m very confident. The Manitoba Liberals have never been stronger and we will not lose that seat,"" she said.

Lamont was similarly optimistic.

""We’re going to have official party status going into this election — because I think there’s going to be an election this summer — and we’re going to come out of it with much more than official party status,"" he said.

Yet according to the latest Probe Research quarterly poll, Manitoba Liberal support is dwindling outside Winnipeg, hovering around 18 per cent in March. Within city limits, the Grits sat around 23 per cent support.

University of Winnipeg political science professor Shannon Sampert said she wasn't surprised to see Klassen seek a federal nod, but described the move as ""opportunist.""

""Holding both positions at the same time... it doesn’t do much for her constituency; while she’s out door-knocking federally, does she have her head in the game provincially?"" Sampert said.

""For First Nations however, it’s true that federal politics has more resonance and thus it is likely why she wanted to make the leap... to have more ability to help people in her area.""

Klassen is from St. Theresa Point First Nation, an isolated northern reserve that's home to about 4,500 people. The community is part of the Island Lake region, which also includes Garden Hill, Red Sucker Lake and Wasagamach.

The Churchill Keewatinook-Aski riding is one of the largest in Canada and its population is largely Indigenous. Klassen acknowledged taking on Ashton federally would be challenging. Klassen said Ashton hasn't worked hard enough to help those in the North.

""The North has been opening up and we just need that continued investment and it happened under Justin Trudeau. Whereas the incumbent was there for a long time and we’re still struggling with poverty, still struggling with so many issues,"" she said.

""Had we had proper representation for my people, I believe that we wouldn’t have had to bury so many people unnecessarily these past decades.""

Ashton's office declined a request for comment.

Neither major opposition party has released the full details of their plans to fight climate change ahead ...,"The environment minister also disagreed with opposition claims the Liberals only support corporations in the fight against climate change. She pointed to the carbon tax rebates being sent to people in provinces where the levy was imposed this month, which the government says will outweigh the expected extra costs of gasoline and other products for 80 per cent of residents. In Ontario, where the Progressive Conservative government has railed against what it calls a ""job-killing carbon tax,"" a household of four will get a $307 carbon tax rebate this year.

Loblaw is also one of 54 recipients chosen by officials at the environment department for the federal government's ""low carbon economy challenge."" The initiative includes $450 million for businesses, municipalities, Indigenous groups, not-for-profits and provinces and territories that apply for federal help with climate change initiatives. The idea is to ""leverage"" federal support with initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.

""We want to create incentives for people to do more, not less,"" McKenna said. ""We're going to continue to move forward on a plan that is going seriously reduce our emissions, doing it in an effective and affordable way.""

In an emailed statement, Loblaw Companies Ltd. spokesperson Catherine Thomas said the grocery chain plans to spend $36 million to reduce emissions from its fridges, and repeated McKenna's claim that this will be akin to taking 50,000 cars off the road. ""Our range of carbon-reduction investments is over $100 million as we work to reduce our carbon footprint by 30 [per cent] by 2030,"" she wrote.

The NDP and Conservatives have criticized the Liberals' climate change plan for favouring corporations before. Leaders from both parties have focused on how the carbon price applies to heavy industries like cement production, where firms are effectively exempt from paying the price for a portion of their emissions. The government has justified this as necessary to protect sectors that can't easily change their systems of production to reduce emissions, and those that compete with firms in other countries where a carbon tax doesn't exist.

The NDP has also accused the Liberals of stalling on a commitment to eliminate at least some federal subsidies to oil and gas companies, which a 2018 report from an environmental organization pegged at $3.3 billion per year.

Neither major opposition party has released the full details of their plans to fight climate change ahead of the federal election this fall.

Canada has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below their 2005 level by 2030 — a target that most environmentalists deem inadequate given the stark warnings from the United Nations and federal government scientists about the possible consequences of climate change in the coming decades. Canada is also on track to miss its reduction target, according to the government's own projections, though McKenna has argued future advances in green technology will make up for the projected shortfall.

Last week, federal scientists published a report that concluded Canada has warmed twice as fast as the world average because of climate change, and that efforts to reduce emissions can only now mitigate how much damage will be done. Among the consequences cited in their report was the ongoing disappearance of Arctic sea ice, rising sea levels, and an expectation that summertime water shortages and extreme weather like floods and forest fires will be more likely to occur because of climate change.

The budget ""sends a message to the world that we are serious about fiscal sustainability,"" Finance Minister Vic Fedeli told a media briefing. Canada's most ...","By Fergal Smith

TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario's Conservative government, presenting its first budget on Thursday, forecast a smaller deficit for the Canadian province in the current fiscal year and a return to balance by 2023-24 as it disclosed plans to reverse the growth in spending.

The Progressive Conservative Party, led by populist Doug Ford, won a majority of seats in last June's provincial election, promising greater fiscal prudence than the Liberal Party, which had held power for 15 years.

The budget ""sends a message to the world that we are serious about fiscal sustainability,"" Finance Minister Vic Fedeli told a media briefing.

Canada's most populous province and industrial powerhouse is projected to run a deficit of C$10.3 billion ($7.7 billion) in fiscal 2019-20, which began on April 1, including a C$1 billion reserve. That compares with an estimated deficit of C$11.7 billion in 2018-19.

The 2018-19 deficit was much more than the C$6.7 billion deficit projected by the Liberals in last year's budget, due mostly to accounting adjustments and the cancellation of a cap- and-trade carbon tax by the Conservatives.

But it was smaller than the C$13.5 billion deficit projected in February in a third-quarter update, while the 2023-24 projected timeline to eliminate the deficit was one year ahead of the Liberals' target.

That could soothe bond investors, who had been looking for evidence the Conservatives would tackle the province's heavy debt load. At about C$368 billion, estimated in 2018-19, Ontario has one of the largest sub-sovereign debts in the world.

The province, which has run deficits every year since 2008-09, pays more to borrow than some other major Canadian provinces, such as Quebec and British Columbia, that are running balanced budgets.

""I think it is positive from a market perspective,"" said Derek Burleton, deputy chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. ""The deficit implementation plan is reasonable, provided it can meet its targets. They are clearly ambitious on spending.""

SLOWER SPENDING GROWTH

The budget, which looked to expand the sale of alcohol and allow tailgating for sporting events, limited overall spending growth to an average annual rate of 1 percent between 2018-19 and 2023-24, much less than inflation.

It included lower spending on children's and social services even as the Conservatives proposed a new dental program for low-income seniors and a new refundable tax credit for childcare costs that would provide up to C$6,000 per child under the age of 7, and a lesser amount for older children.

Like the federal government, Ontario has favored faster write-offs of capital investments rather than corporate tax cuts to bolster competitiveness with the United States.

But a slowdown in the once red-hot housing market and global economic headwinds could increase the fiscal challenges for the province, which accounts for about 40 percent of Canada's economy and is a major exporter of cars and other manufactured products.

The budget projected growth to slow to 1.4 percent in 2019 from 2.2 percent in 2018, while net debt-to-GDP, a key measure of fiscal health, was estimated at 40.2 percent in 2018-19, the second highest among Canada's 10 provinces. It is projected to rise to 40.7 percent in 2019-20, before dipping to 38.6 percent in 2023-24.

As an opposition party, we have Shadow Ministers, not a cabinet, and referencing them as anything else ...","OTTAWA – Liberal MPs have penned a letter to Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer imploring him to cancel a Greater Toronto Area candidate's $250-a-ticket fundraising event billed as a discussion of ""the business of healthcare.""

The Liberals say they're concerned about the framing of the event, but also say it's ""quite clearly an attempt to sell access to power,"" in the letter obtained by CTV News.

The event, scheduled in North York, Ont. next week, includes the tagline: ""healthcare reimagined, it’s time for change."" Based on the wording of the event website it appears geared towards people who work in the health-care field.

The fundraiser is being hosted by the Conservative candidate for Don Valley West, Ont. Yvonne Robertson, and was initially described as a policy forum and cocktail reception with Conservative MPs Pierre Poilievre, or ""our next finance minister"" as the event describes, and Marilyn Gladu, ""our next health minister.""

However, the reference to the two MPs as potential future ministers was removed after CTV News approached Robertson's campaign for comment.

""There is only one person that decides cabinet, and that’s the Prime Minister of Canada. As an opposition party, we have Shadow Ministers, not a cabinet, and referencing them as anything else is not representative of their actual position. That has been changed,"" Robertson's campaign said in an email.

The letter to Scheer—sent before the event webpage was amended—said that it’s ""alarming"" that the party is promoting attendees' ability to be able to bend the ears of Poilievre and Gladu, who are described as future ministers.

""That was one of the least offensive parts,"" Rob Oliphant, the Liberal MP who currently represents the riding, told CTV News after learning that the event description had been amended. He said regardless, the event is still troubling and should be cancelled. ""It's still cash for access,"" Oliphant said, because it is inviting people to donate to the Conservative Party to be able to help shape their policy.

He was one of the seven MPs—who all are either doctors, or represent GTA ridings—who signed the letter.

The event also lists deputy Conservative Party leader Lisa Raitt, MP Peter Kent, and senators Linda Frum and Nicole Eaton, as well as others who will be there to hear ideas about improving the Canadian health-care system related to small businesses and modernizing the Canada Health Act.

""Let us know how the current healthcare system affects your practice and which policy changes you think would have the greatest positive impact on you and your patients,"" the event page reads.

Nowhere in the event listing is privatizing health care stated, though the Liberals are calling on Scheer to ""prove you support public health care, by immediately cancelling this event.""

Oliphant said he found it ""worrisome"" that the event description states that health policy should be ""shaped heavily"" by ""dedicated practitioners."" Oliphant said that while doctors and nurses should be involved, so too should patients and public health officials.

In an effort to counter the event, he's planned an open townhall earlier in the week, featuring Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor.

""The concept that the business of health care comes over the patient outcomes… that's what worries me,"" Oliphant said. ""Health care is not a business, health care is about life and death.""

In response to the Liberals’ concerns about privatization and framing of health care as a business, Robertson's campaign spokesperson Matthew Poon said that the event was designed ""to bring together small business owners like doctors who were unfairly targeted by Justin Trudeau’s small business tax hikes and discuss ways to help them better deliver health services within the principles of the Canada Health Act.""

""Conservatives have always and will always support the principles of the Canada Health Act,"" the statement said.

After coming under fire, largely from the Conservatives, for holding ""cash for access"" events — where for sizeable donations, guests could rub shoulders with the prime minister or members of his cabinet—the Liberals changed the rules to set up more transparency around these events.

The new political fundraising laws came into effect at the end of 2018, requiring parties to advertise fundraisers in advance, and report back afterwards, if they're charging $200 or more per ticket and featuring the prime minister, cabinet ministers, party leaders, or party leadership candidates.

She appealed to Speaker Geoff Regan to rule that their rights had been denied and their privileges as members of Parliament breached on the basis of the 2015 Reform Act, which set rules around the administration of party caucuses.

“This matter is urgent. … Procedural fairness and the rule of law demand this. Secret in-camera meetings or private notices should not be a shield to prevent the upholding of the law and members’ rights,” Philpott told the Commons.

“This is very concerning. It speaks to the rule of law at the heart of our democracy,” Conservative MP Michael Chong, who authored the Reform Act, told the National Post in an interview shortly after she made her arguments. So what exactly is this latest foofaraw all about?

How did the ouster from caucus go down last week?

In a brief speech last Tuesday Trudeau announced his decision to remove Philpott and Wilson-Raybould from caucus after both resigned from cabinet in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Wilson-Raybould testified that Trudeau and his top officials tried pressuring her, for political reasons, to cut a deal for Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin so it could avoid criminal prosecution for fraud and bribery.

Both initially stayed members of the Liberal caucus, citing their faith in the party’s policies despite a lack of confidence in the prime minister’s handling of the affair.

But Trudeau said last week the caucus has lost “trust” in the two former ministers. “We’ve taken every effort to address their concerns but ultimately if they can’t honestly say that they have confidence in this team despite weeks of testimony, face-to-face conversations and phone calls with myself and other members of caucus, then they cannot be part of this team.”

Trudeau announced the decision as his own, and Philpott argued Tuesday Liberal MPs never had a chance to have their say — even though the Parliament of Canada Act was amended in 2015, with Chong’s Reform Act, so that these types of situations could be avoided.

What exactly does the Reform Act say about this?

The Reform Act, which amended the Canada Elections Act and the Parliament of Canada Act, spells out rules around expulsions and readmissions of caucus members, the election or removal of caucus chairs, leadership reviews and the election of interim leaders.

The act requires caucuses, after each general election, to hold four votes on whether or not a majority of MPs in each party wants to abide by the rules it sets out on its four topics. If they reject the rules, then they do not need to follow them.

On expulsions, here are the rules that parties can opt in to, or not: A member of caucus can only be expelled, according to the Reform Act, if “the caucus chair has received a written notice signed by at least 20 per cent of the members of the caucus requesting that the member’s membership be reviewed” and if “the expulsion of the member is approved by secret ballot by a majority of all caucus members.”

Neither of those things happened in this case. Philpott said if the Reform Act rules were followed, it would have taken a recorded vote in which 90 Liberal MPs voted to expel her and Wilson-Raybould — yet no such vote took place. “We were expelled prior to the commencement of the Liberal caucus meeting,” she argued in the House Tuesday.

Did Liberals ever vote on the provisions in the Reform Act?

The answer to this question would go a long way to settling whether Liberals did anything to violate the law.

If Liberal MPs never had a chance to vote on opting into the Reform Act rules, as Philpott alleged in the House, that would inherently be an “illegal act,” argued Chong. “I’ve been concerned about it for three-and-a-half years,” he said, since the Liberals reportedly held their first caucus meeting without recording votes and reporting results to the Speaker, which the law required them to do. “It’s now come to fruition with the two questionable expulsions last week.”

But Liberals said on Tuesday that they had followed the rules. Kevin Lamoureux, the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader, told the Commons that “over three years ago,” the chair of the national Liberal caucus, Francis Scarpaleggia, sent a letter to the speaker outlining the caucus’s decisions not to have the Reform Act provisions apply.

“Given the fact that the Liberal caucus did not adopt these provisions, the points raised by the honourable Member on this issue are moot,” said Lamoureux.

Lamoureux said the only requirement, which the caucus met, was for Liberals to inform the speaker of “the results of the caucus decisions.” But the law actually stipulates that they communicate “the outcome of each vote.”

Lamoureux did not address whether individual, recorded votes were held on each element of the Reform Act, nor whether the votes occurred at the Liberals’ first caucus meeting after the election, both required under the law. Philpott is alleging that neither happened.

The House leader’s office referred questions about whether votes were actually held to Scarpaleggia, who told the Post caucus confidentiality means he can’t discuss whether individual votes occurred.

So, does Philpott have a point?

What she’s arguing is that Trudeau breached the privileges of his Liberal MPs by not allowing them to vote on the administration of their own caucus back in November 2015, after the federal election, in accordance with the law. As a result, she is arguing, Philpott’s and Wilson-Raybould’s privileges were breached when Trudeau made a unilateral decision to remove them. And the rights of the entire Liberal caucus were breached because they didn’t have an opportunity to vote on that decision by secret ballot.

Chong said Philpott spoke with him about the topic before going ahead with her arguments on Tuesday morning, and he told the Post he is fully on board with them.

“This point of privilege she has raised is vitally important because if there is no recourse here to enforce the rights of members, there is no other place,” he said. Courts have repeatedly ruled they do not have jurisdiction over matters of parliamentary administration, so he believes this is the only way for it to be enforced. The Reform Act also specifically states that caucus decisions aren’t subject to judicial review.

“The only recourse we have to uphold the rule of law and to ensure that the law is followed in the House of Commons, its parliamentary parties and committees, is in the House of Commons and by appealing to the speaker,” Chong said.

But Philippe Lagassé, a procedure expert at the University of Ottawa, said the whole thing seems more like a question around the legal interpretation of the Parliament of Canada Act rather than a matter of parliamentary privilege.

“I don’t see how this is a point of privilege in the traditional sense,” he said. If Liberal MPs didn’t vote in favour of opting in to the Reform Act rules, then they wouldn’t be bound to them, “and since the courts can’t review, I’m not sure who would enforce this,” he added.

What has the speaker said about this?

Two weeks ago, a Conservative MP raised similar issues when he complained that it seemed MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes had resigned from the Liberal caucus because she was forced out. Had the Reform Act rules been in place, he argued, there would’ve had to have been a vote.

“If you, Mr. Speaker, decline to exercise jurisdiction to entertain breaches of the statute here, then members of caucuses, like the Liberal caucus who flagrantly ignore the law, have no protection and no recourse when their rights are trampled. Because of the lack of judicial recourse, general restraint on speakers interpreting the law and the House’s privilege to manage internal affairs, I respectfully submit that the way forward, indeed the only way forward, is to allow the House to deal with this matter,” John Nater argued.

Caesar-Chavannes ultimately confirmed that she had left of her own accord. And the speaker had come back on Monday, the day before Philpott made her arguments, with a ruling that he didn’t have the jurisdiction anyway.

As relayed by Deputy Speaker Bruce Stanton, Regan’s ruling said asking the House to deal with an expulsion from caucus was “not a proper subject for a question of privilege.” Further, “I as speaker have no role in the interpretation of statute nor in the conduct of these 2015 provisions.”

Philpott acknowledged that ruling on Tuesday morning. “But with respect it is our view that this does not relieve you of your responsibility to ensure that all members are aware of their rights in this place. This is our privilege. Accordingly, a remedy is required for our situation,” she said. Regan responded: “While I am left with the difficulty, as I said in my ruling yesterday, that the speaker does not have power to enforce statutes, I will certainly consider her argument and come back to the House.”

So now what happens?

The House will have to wait for Regan to come back with an opinion on the issue. If he does find a prima facie breach of privilege, which Lagassé found unlikely, Philpott will be able to move that the matter be referred to a parliamentary committee.

Liberals have a majority in the House and on committees — including the two committees that recently decided not to pursue any further investigation of the SNC-Lavalin issue.

Asked whether he’s hopeful that some of them will vote to look at what happened here, Chong said, “We have to try. We can’t give up. … I hope that our House of Commons is strong enough to adjudicate this and to seek justice.”

This week, Liberal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna attended the “Carbon Pricing ...","That is the fraught, politically-charged reality since April 1, when Ottawa imposed its carbon tax “backstop” in four provinces that refused to match the federal minimum of $20 per tonne of emissions.

But Canada’s price, even as it climbs to $50 per tonne in 2022, is smaller than similar taxes in some of the 24 other countries that have set national carbon prices . Sweden’s tax is roughly $189 per tonne. In France, it’s $83 per tonne. And in its landmark report from October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said global carbon prices may need to be as high as several thousand dollars per tonne in 2030 if the world is to keep warming below 1.5 degrees C by the end of the century.

Federal Conservatives and their ideological companions at Queen’s Park argue this hurts the economy and isn’t necessary to reduce emissions. New Democrats and the Green party contend Canada is lagging on climate action and should, among other things, eliminate federal subsidies to the oil and gas industry.

The purpose of this group… is to talk about carbon pricing, to see what’s going on, also to share lessons learned. And there was a lot of interest in what Canada is doing, how we’re returning the revenues directly back into not only the province, but also to people. And that’s by law: 90 per cent of the revenues go back to individuals through taxes. They’re very interested in that, because how you use your revenues can help or hurt politically… Ours is using carbon pricing because it’s the most efficient way to reduce emissions, but also to make life affordable for folks. They have choices to save more money if they want by taking measures in their homes or how they get to work, transportation, to reduce emissions. Or not. But they will get the money back.

The IPCC report from October (says) if we’re going to keep warming to 1.5 degrees, the carbon tax … should be anywhere between $135 (US) to $5,500 (US) per tonne (by 2030). Do you agree that the carbon price that we’re going to have in 2022 will need to go up?

We’ve always said that pricing is only one of the tools in our tool box. So, we’ve got the price on pollution, but we’re also making historic investments in public transportation, and phasing out coal, and investing in renewables and investing in energy efficiency and clean-tech companies and innovation. So, I mean, we’ve taken an across the board approach. And our focus is really, OK, what’s effective, what is practical, and how do we do this in a way that ensures that life is affordable and you’re also creating good jobs and innovation in Canada.

But beyond 2022, is the carbon tax going to go up? Assuming, as we hear all the time, it’s the best, most efficient way to incentivize people away from pollution, wouldn’t it have to go up if we’re going to close the gap and hit our targets?

We’re committed to meeting our Paris Agreement target (to cut emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030). We’ve been clear about that, and we’re taking an across-the-board approach. The commitment is only to 2022, and that’s when we meet with provinces and territories to do a review (of Canada’s climate change framework). But there’s no intention to go up now.

It seems there’s a disconnect between the action experts say is needed to prevent the worst consequences of climate change, and the action that is politically possible for governments to do. What do you think about that?

Look, we’ve done a lot and we know we need to do more. We came in (to government), there was 10 years of inaction. We helped negotiate the Paris Agreement, then we negotiated with provinces and territories. We’re two thirds of the way to our target and we’re 11 years out… One of the challenges, of course, is when you have provinces like Ontario that backtrack. They do less, so they increase the challenge. But we are committed to it.

Why do think there is so much resistance, with Jason Kenney maybe on the cusp of winning in Alberta, what Doug Ford is doing in Ontario, other provinces that are skeptical of the efficacy of carbon pricing, or carbon taxes — why do think there’s an audience for that?

I think they’re skeptical of climate action overall. They seem to be skeptical of the science that says the enormity of the challenge and how we need to act now. We have our climate change report that says Canada is warming at double the international average, and… they aren’t making decisions based on policy and evidence. We know that carbon pricing works. We know that we need to take action. We know you can do it in an affordable way by giving the money back. But this generation of Conservative politicians wants to do less and less on climate change when the risks and the costs are enormous.

Assuming the polls are right and Kenney becomes Premier of Alberta, cancels the carbon tax in Alberta and lifts the cap on oilsands emissions, what can the Liberal government in Ottawa do? Wouldn’t that tear up the chance of Canada hitting its targets?

I’m not going to speculate on the Alberta election…We will deal with things as they come, but we’re going to continue to push. And that’s what we’ve found that, unfortunately, provinces didn’t step up — some provinces, led by Conservative politicians, didn’t step up and they made it free to pollute. And we stepped in, put a price on pollution, but also did it in an affordable way.

Sixty-two per cent of men said they agree with holding a referendum, as did 51 per cent of women.

How does equalization work?

The program is intended to address fiscal disparities between provinces, and was entrenched in Canada's Constitution in 1982.

""Parliament and the government of Canada are committed to the principle of making equalization payments to ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation,"" the Constitution reads.

It's a myth that Alberta sends money directly to Ottawa for the program. All Canadians pay income tax to the federal government, and then that money is paid out to provinces based on each region's ability to raise revenues compared with the average.

The formula that calculates how much each province gets has been controversial due to how it accounts for natural resource revenues.

For decades, Alberta has received no federal support through equalization payments, while Quebec, for example, is set to receive $13.1 billion in 2019-20.

The payments are unconditional — meaning each province can spend the money it receives as it wishes.

A survey of 1,200 Albertans undertaken by pollster Janet Brown for CBC last spring found 70 per cent think the current equalization payment system is unfair. Half strongly felt it was unfair while, while 20 per cent ""somewhat"" agreed.

Where Alberta's political parties stand

UCP Leader Jason Kenney said he plans to hold a referendum on equalization as a way to hold Ottawa's feet to the fire over getting a coastal pipeline built.

Vote Compass found a whopping 82 per cent of UCP supporters agreed with that policy.

The NDP said in a press release in March that Kenney mischaracterizes how equalization works, and pointed out that Kenney was part of the Conservative government that brought in the current equalization formula in the 2007 budget. Only 32 per cent of NDP supporters said they wanted a referendum.

The party said it supports looking at the formula but believes a referendum would be a dead-end, and also suggested that one of the UCP's equalization proposals could make the Canada Health Act unenforceable in the province.

In June 2018, the federal government announced it would extend the current payment formula until 2024 without negotiating with the provinces, several politicians said. At the time, Alberta's finance minister stated the province's opposition to the decision.

The Liberal platform states that while the equalization formula isn't fair, a ""referendum"" would not give the province power to amend the Constitution.

Instead, the party says it will demand the formula be changed to treat provinces' hydro revenue the same as Alberta oil and gas, and that if those demands aren't met, a Crown corporation will be established to remove energy royalties from equalization formula calculations.

(Vote Compass)

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel has also said he plans to push for changes to what he called an ""unfair equalization program.""

And the Freedom Conservative Party plans to demand an end to equalization and replace all federal transfers with ""tax points.""

Thirty-eight per cent of Liberal supporters agreed with the idea of holding a referendum, as did 58 per cent of Alberta Party supporters. FCP supporters were not included in the Vote Compass data.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

House Speaker says he can’t rule on whether Liberal caucus expulsions broke federal law

Story continues below advertisement

House of Commons Speaker Geoff Regan says he doesn’t have the authority to rule on whether federal law was violated or rights were breached when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled former cabinet ministers Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould from Liberal caucus.

On Tuesday, the former Treasury Board president said there should have been a secret ballot among caucus members before the two were ousted, asked Mr. Regan to rule on the matter.

Today he said that the Speaker’s authority is “limited to the internal affairs of the House, its own proceedings” and “does not extend to caucus matters.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott resigned their cabinet positions over the handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair by the Prime Minister and top aides. Read the background to the story here (for subscribers).

Here’s what you need to know about Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s first budget

Story continues below advertisement

Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s first budget has fewer cuts than expected, raises spending overall and won’t balance the books for five years. Some highlights:

While program spending for health and education will increase slightly, the budget also outlines cuts: The Ministry of Children’s and Social Services - which includes income assistance and the autism program - will see $1-billion in cuts by 2021-22.

The budget revealed significant funding changes for universities and colleges: The government is planning to tie more than half to performance outcomes, though it has not stated what those metrics would be.

There are new regulations for alcohol consumption: extending service hours to start at 9 a.m.; allowing bars to advertise “happy hour” discounts and legalizing tailgate parties.

Other budget item include a new child care tax credit and a dental care program for low-income seniors.

Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir is ousted from power as military council takes control of country

What I learned about life I learned the hard way: Stay true to your path

""There is a boon given to those who are faithful to their path. With the collapse of every dream, the breaking of every illusion, I found myself becoming more vulnerable, more open. And out of this transformation came an awakening of what I believe is the most human of all virtues, compassion. Having suffered, been hurt, failed at so many attempts to gain ‘success,’ I find myself able to reach out to others in a way I never thought possible – with compassion.

""How to describe compassion? For me it is an awareness that others, too, share the regret of mistakes made, failures endured, loves lost. That’s what happens as we become human. Realizing that we all suffer helps us accept others we meet along the way. And perhaps that is why my life unfolded as it did.

“But there is something more that makes age worth the struggle. Recently, I have found myself able to love. Not the romantic love of youth, but one that can embrace all who share this planet.” Read Austin Repath’s first-person essay here.

Magic wears off for LeBron James as shambolic Los Angeles Lakers miss the playoffs

Hours after Magic Johnson abruptly resigned as the Los Angeles Lakers’ president of basketball operations and mere minutes after his first season as the franchise cornerstone ended with a buzzer-beating loss, LeBron James left Staples Center on Tuesday night without speaking to reporters, trailed only by security officers and questions about the team’s future.

It was not the season anyone envisioned for the Lakers, who had upended the NBA by signing James last summer with the hype and expectation of returning the franchise to its glory years. One of the most storied teams in the league, the Lakers have not won a championship in nine years, and Los Angeles is frustrated, hungry and impatient.

Instead, the team collected nearly as many injuries as losses. James, who will miss the NBA playoffs beginning Saturday for the first time in 14 years, watched the final six games of the season from the bench as the team looked to preserve him for next season. Both he and Johnson left Staples Center with a losing record and a team in chaos. In some ways, it was the perfect finale to a season that trafficked in dysfunction. Read the full story here.

Indeed, Liberal Prime ...","Alberta’s Internet was in a furious swivet last night. There seemed to be something to wind everyone up as we enter the final stretch of a provincial election both sides have characterized as an epochal event sure to seal the fate of the province if it goes the wrong way.

This may have been only the anger-magnifying tendency of social media, or the “friends” and “followers” I have accumulated over the years, but I can’t ever recall seeing so many people on both sides of a political division so wound up.

There is a fringe of the Alberta right that has always been furious about pretty well everything, of course. They were enraged by the NDP’s surprise victory in May 2015 and they have been enraged about it ever since. Their fury was ratcheted up even more when Premier Rachel Notley didn’t just roll over and concede victory to the Opposition but fought back with an aggressive campaign of her own.

Still, most Albertans have been capable over the years of engaging in civil discourse when it comes to politics. This was not so evident last night, with only four more sleeps till voting day. The proximate cause, I think, was two things:

One is the sense among supporters of the NDP Government that weeks of bozo eruptions by United Conservative Party candidates and evidence of sketchy ethical practices and possibly outright illegalities by UCP activists associated with Leader Jason Kenney’s 2017 leadership campaign have had little impact on the Opposition party’s strong lead in public opinion.

The other was the news story yesterday that RCMP officers with a search warrant had swooped in late Thursday on the Calgary auto-repair business of Peter Singh, the UCP’s candidate in Calgary-East, and removed a computer hard drive, “other electronic devices,” and a suitcase.

The Mounties were tight lipped about the nature of the investigation. Mr. Singh, apparently, was nowhere to be found, although he said in a written statement the police had returned his computer. When a reporter tried to question Mr. Kenney about it, an aide pushed the door shut in her face. The details are murky. Conspiracy theories abound, especially on the right.

Last year the Calgary Herald reported allegations Mr. Singh “used at least one local resident’s credit card to advance his nomination campaign.”

According to the CBC, the UCP had earlier investigated allegations of bribery and fraud related to Mr. Singh’s nomination, but found no proof and cleared him.

Meanwhile, advance polls have been setting records. With well over 400,000 votes cast, turnout has been significantly higher in the first three days of advance polling than in all advance polls in 2015, when 162,000 advance ballots were cast. About 2.6 million Albertans are registered to vote. Today is the last day for advance polling.

Political scientists say this may not mean much – it’s easier this time to cast an advance ballot, thanks to new voting rules. But it is one more factor winding politically engaged Albertans up.

I suspect this is a sign of things to come, and not just in Alberta. We have already seen like things happen in the United States, driven by the Trump Republicans but embraced by their Democratic Party rivals.

Since anger and an appeal to the worst instincts of the base worked for the Republicans, you can count on it that their Conservative brethren in Alberta and Canada are not just paying close attention, but dealing with the same consultants.

Political parties on the centre and left, such as there is a left in Canada any more, will have no choice but to respond in kind, and so they will.

Indeed, Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, anxious to recover from his own self-inflicted political wounds, appeared to be testing an aggressive campaign strategy of his own on Thursday, lumping federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and Ontario Premier Doug Ford in with alt-right conspiracy theorists, racists and religious bigots.","RCMP raid on UCP candidate’s business, polling trends, hordes of advance voters wind up the Internet",Alberta Politics,https://albertapolitics.ca/2019/04/rcmp-raid-on-ucp-candidates-business-polling-trends-hordes-of-advance-voters-wind-up-the-internet/
67,,2019-04-13T05:45:00.0000000Z,Moreover the province’s potential for offence-taking has become as grand as Justin Trudeau’s vindictive Liberal Party of Canada. It can’t tolerate any truth-telling either. The province ...,"Oil, a commodity that nurtures dependency, has so coddled the Alberta mind that it has fostered a provincial culture of victimization as poisonous as the identity politics unsettling university campuses.

If oil were a young university student, Alberta’s politicians would now play the role of paranoid helicopter parents or politically correct campus administrators.

Every day the province’s oil-obsessed politicos warn Albertans that Canada is a dangerous place full of self-righteous climate activists (and some are indeed self-righteous), anti-pipeline protestors, dumb courts, stubborn First Nations, and nasty liberals.

Moreover the province’s potential for offence-taking has become as grand as Justin Trudeau’s vindictive Liberal Party of Canada. It can’t tolerate any truth-telling either.

The province’s allergy to criticism has grown so formidable that United Conservative Party leader Jason Kenney proposes to set up a Saudi-like war room in the energy ministry to respond to any micro-aggressions and offensive material. Should it be called Snowflake Central?

Albertans have become such a fragile, oil-reliant people, reasons Kenney, that the province now needs the equivalent of university Bias Response Teams, in this case to foster “a safe and inclusive environment” for its petroleum exporters who have now claimed Alberta’s identity as their own.

(The rulers of Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Russia, we should remember, don’t much like oil critics, either. The political records show that oil relishes conflict and breeds political aggression like no other commodity, except cocaine.)

Kenney, a belligerent proponent of oil-safetyism, would much rather play the blame game than accept the truth that the rapid development of bitumen mining in Fort McMurray violated two fundamental principles of risk mitigation: go slow and save the money.

Over many years, Alberta’s Tories repeatedly gambled that the price of bitumen, a garbage crude that requires upgrading and complex refining, could only go higher, and they bet wrong.

So did the NDP, another oil-coddled entity. (And yes, Albertans should be very angry about the gross mismanagement of their gas and oil resources by their elected politicians.)

According to former Encana CEO Gwyn Morgan, another whiner of the highest order, Alberta’s most important industry has been stomped on by bad people.

(As every adherent of identity politics knows, life is a constant battle between good and evil people. God forbid that Canadians see each other as brothers and sisters.)

Morgan, who chaired SNC-Lavalin during the Libya scandal and boldly took no responsibility for that fiasco, recently argued in the Financial Post that the “drastic decline” of Canada’s oil industry is due to “a combination of ideological antagonism to fossil fuels and tunnel vision.”

Apparently, ideology caused oil prices to crash in 2014, and the overproduction of bitumen and tight oil had nothing to do with that bitter event, which left 40,000 Albertans jobless.

Art Berman, a respected Houston oil analyst and no greenie, has a much higher respect for the truth.

He recently documented how combined Canadian and U.S. unconventional oil production from the tar sands and Permian Basin “surged in 2014 and caused oil prices to collapse.” As prices fell, producers — including OPEC — rejected any production cuts.

Yet to this day you’ll never hear an Alberta or federal politician, let alone Morgan, acknowledge how Canadian oilsands production helped precipitate the global oil price crash of 2014. (Delusion appears to be a reliable Canadian political trait for both the left and the right.)

Alberta’s political elites would never let the facts spoil the celebration of Alberta’s victimhood or the province’s politically correct view of petroleum as the Walt Disney of resources.

In Morgan’s pity analysis, 44 years of one-party rule in Alberta by the Tories played no role in Alberta’s current predicament.

But the facts show that the Conservative governments foolishly eschewed any value-added policy for the province’s junk crude, and instead promoted a low royalty regime, which encouraged the export of raw bitumen — a dismal strategy that has enriched U.S. refineries and the Koch brothers.

No matter. Those damn oil-hating and U.S.-funded tar sands campaigners are to blame for Alberta’s bad oil rap, argues Mark Scholz, president of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors in the Calgary Herald.

According to Scholz, a bunch of celebrities and “a glorious campaign of Houdini-like misdirection” are somehow responsible for the cancelling of two bitumen export pipelines, carbon taxes, and everything else that has gone wrong in Alberta.

Of course the high carbon content of bitumen and its extreme price volatility have nothing to do with declining investment in the oil sands.

The facts also tell a different story about the two cancelled pipelines. A federal court cancelled Northern Gateway’s permit (and the Harper government choose not to revive that proposal) while market conditions claimed the Energy East pipeline.

Although proponents of Energy East claimed it would end the import of Saudi oil into eastern Canada, David Hughes, a well-known Canadian energy analyst notes that eastern refineries in New Brunswick aren’t designed to process much heavy oil.

So an Energy East pipeline, if ever built, could not really put a dent in U.S. or Saudi oil imports.

Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, the industry’s powerful lobby group, also claims victimhood. “We have been the victims of a very well-orchestrated, well-planned foreign-funded attack on Canadian infrastructure,” he recently tweeted.

But Hughes notes oil sands production has grown by 376 per cent since 2000. If there was a “foreign-funded attack” it’s been grossly ineffective, he says.

Hughes adds that “the reason that there is a pipeline bottleneck is that the industry has been so successful in growing production.”

NDP Premier Rachel Notley also presents Alberta as fragile player unfairly dumped upon by bad actors in British Columbia and elsewhere.

Her vocabulary consists of pipelines, pipelines and pipelines.

Alberta can’t get full value for its bitumen “because we can’t move the product to market.”

And dastardly environmentalists have created a situation where “we are leaving world oil markets — and in some cases Eastern Canadian markets — to the Russians and the Saudis — countries that don’t care a whit about climate change or the environment.”

Yet research done for Alberta Innovates, a taxpayer-funded nonprofit, revealed that no real price advantage for bitumen exists in Asia.

The best and most lucrative market remains U.S. Gulf Coast refineries because they can handle complex heavy oil.

And what oil-exporting nation, other than Norway, truly gives a damn about climate change or the environment? They simply don’t exist.

Coddling a mind is a terrible thing, but coddling a province is a social disaster.

In the current election campaign, no politician wants to pony up and tell the truth.

It wasn’t foreigners or bad actors who created Alberta’s failings; it was Albertans and their damn greed and lack of strategic planning.

Albertans share the blame for the 2014 oil price collapse with U.S. tight oil producers (price discounts and lack of pipelines clobbered Permian producers too), and Albertans share blame for the province’s collective failure to add value to bitumen. (The more value you add, the fewer pipelines you need.)

Albertans, and only Albertans, share the blame for not collecting their fair share and saving for a rainy day.

So stop your whining and end the blame game. Cowboy up and own your oil-based problems, and recognize that the Alberta government has not responded competently to structural changes in oil and gas markets.

Recognize you’ve got both revenue and spending problems that could be a death spiral for the province.

Admit that exporting carbon-rich oil comes with high risks and that exporting more oil and building more pipelines will increase those risks.

And stop pretending that business as usual will dig Alberta out of the hole it has dug for itself.

Morgan, Kenney, Notley and the rest of Alberta-Is-Only-Oil gang might want to start with some cognitive behavioural therapy, or better still, sit down and read Butcher’s Crossing.

It’s a great novel about a buffalo hunt by the Texas writer John Williams. Some say it is probably the best western ever written — even better than True Grit — and I agree.

It tells the story of a couple of buffalo hunters who journey to Colorado for a grand slaughter with visions of prosperity.

But once the hunters locate their prey, they grow so obsessed with greed and bloodletting that winter overtakes them and traps them in the mountains.

The killers emerge from a gruelling snowy ordeal months later, only to discover that the markets for buffalo hides have crashed.

A dejected hide-buyer explains the ruinous facts. “The bottom’s dropped out of the whole market. The hide business is finished. For good.”

Oil is not finished yet, and the prospects for heavy oil remain solid in the U.S. Gulf Coast. The oil sands will shrink, but they will not disappear for decades.

But Alberta’s twisted identity politics uphold the politically correct illusion that there are more buffalo to kill, and the future doesn’t matter.

And that is an unforgiving road to ruin.

During a question on ...","Decision '19.

CHARLOTTETOWN, P.E.I. - There was minimal mudslinging among P.E.I.’s party leaders during a debate that focused on Islanders who make a living from the province’s soil.

Wednesday’s debate, hosted by the P.E.I. Federation of Agriculture, was largely cordial as the four leaders shared common ground in wanting to support the province’s major industry.

One of the few instances of direct criticism came when Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker challenged PC Leader Dennis King on his party’s plan to address climate change after King pledged earlier in the day to extend the province’s marked fuel program to all farm-plated vehicles.

During a question on Canada’s carbon tax, Bevan-Baker said when combined with rebates, it’s the most “effective, efficient and fair” emission-reduction method and pointed to P.E.I.’s poor growing season last year as an example of climate change’s impact on farmers.

“Denny talks about how important it is that we look at climate change … I’d love to hear what plans he has,” said Bevan-Baker. “We have a huge choice and a huge responsibility coming up. We don’t need some sort of haphazard grab bag of random choices, we need a coherent plan.”

Bevan-Baker listed a number of policies, including precision agriculture (using drones to pinpoint crops needing treatment), import substitution, customized buffer zones and clean energy rebates as ways to help farmers mitigate and adapt.

“There is no single solution here,” he said.

Due to the format of the debate, King did not have a chance to respond directly.

However, earlier he said the carbon tax had an unfair burden on Islanders and that P.E.I. farmers do not have transit or trails to bring produce to market.

“(It’s) having a solution for all of Canada that doesn’t make sense for independent jurisdictions such as P.E.I.,” said King. “We’re not sticking our heads in the sand … we realize we want to reduce carbon, we want to help achieve those goals. But adding to our costs without achieving the goal, I don’t think it’s a very fair solution.”

King said he was perplexed by governments who seem “more interested in catching a farmer doing something wrong” to fine them and pledged to work with industry on environmental challenges.

“It must be ironic for all of you, to find four people who don’t farm telling you the options of what you should do as a farmer. I’d rather ask you what you need from government,” said King.

Liberal Leader Wade MacLauchlan was also hesitant on increasing the marked fuel program because he said it could lead to unintended consequences in other industries.

He instead preferred to invest in new export markets and product development while also praising Island farmers for their innovation.

“If we didn’t have farming in Prince Edward Island, I don’t think we’d have bioscience,” said MacLauchlan. “And we wouldn’t have the growth we’ve seen in manufacturing.”

MacLauchlan pointed to investments in the energy cable, reforestation, the alternate land use program and increased crop insurance funds as helping farmers deal with climate challenges.

NDP Leader Joe Byrne questioned the effectiveness of carbon tax rebates, instead preferring to see more investment into new farming technology.

“Because the same capitalist market that has left farmers struggling so much, is frankly incapable of getting us out of global warming,” said Byrne.

Carbon pricing and climate change effects were just two of the issues discussed during the debate, which was hosted by former managing editor of The Guardian, Gary MacDougall.

Candidates also touched on trade agreements, soil health, labour shortages and other topics related to the industry.",Party leaders address climate challenges facing P.E.I. farmers,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.pe.ca/news/pei-election/party-leaders-address-climate-challenges-facing-pei-farmers-300520/

OTTAWA - Canola farmers whose livelihoods have been targeted by China in its feud with Canada say it's time for the federal government to be aggressive at the political level in its fight against a growing number of agricultural trade barriers around the world.

Several producers told two parliamentary committees Tuesday that China's recent rejection of Canadian canola-seed shipments is only the latest trade disruption that's hurt the country's agriculture sector.

They reminded MPs in Ottawa about a number of major trade obstacles faced by Canadian agricultural exporters in faraway markets like India, Italy, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia.

""Canada can feed the world but not if our government does not act strongly on our behalf, removing non-tariff trade barriers, enforcing existing trade agreements and removing political roadblocks,"" Alberta canola farmer Stephen Vandervalk told the House of Commons agriculture committee.

Citing concerns about pests, China has rejected canola-seed imports from Canada and has suspended the licences of two major Canadian exporters.

The moves to cut off the critical Canadian export have been widely viewed as China applying economic pressure on Canada in response to the December arrest of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver at the behest of the United States.

Any extended canola dispute with China, which imported $2.7 billion worth of canola seed from Canada last year, would deliver a painful economic blow to producers, the supply chain and the wider Canadian economy.

The price of canola has fallen since the dispute started last month. The late-winter timing of the disruption has been particularly difficult because it's forced many farmers to suddenly rethink the planting decisions vital to their businesses.

On Tuesday, producers made it clear to MPs at the committees that even with the urgency around the China conflict, the pain is not only about canola. Canadian farmers, they said, are staring at other big trade hurdles in world markets.

Several of the witnesses mentioned issues that have affected Canada's durum wheat exports to Italy, wheat sales to Vietnam, pulse exports to India and feed-barley shipments to Saudi Arabia.

Saskatchewan grain farmer Mehgin Reynolds (who is seeking a Conservative party nomination) told MPs that, for instance, her four-year crop rotation includes lentils, barley, canola and durum wheat — all products that face obstacles on foreign markets.

""The frightening reality is that almost every crop being grown in Canada is currently struggling with one trade barrier or another,"" Reynolds said.

The Liberal government has insisted it wants to find a scientific solution to the canola dispute, in keeping with China's insistence that the problem is tainted seeds.

The Liberals have established a working group that includes officials from Richardson International Ltd. and Viterra Inc. — the two exporters that have had their licences to sell canola revoked by China — and representatives from the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau has requested to send a delegation of experts to China to examine the issue. She's said officials are exploring options to support farmers by expanding existing programs.

That kind of subversion usually occurs behind ...","When it comes to defending Canada from the menace posed by the People’s Republic of China, it is now a matter of public record, and should be a matter of some embarrassment to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, if not shame, that the course his government embarked upon almost four years ago was dangerously naïve, if not recklessly thoughtless.

It’s a tragedy that it took the Chinese Ministry of State Security’s kidnapping of former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and cultural entrepreneur Michael Spavor to prove that the Beijing regime was not the “win-win, golden-decade” friend and trade partner Trudeau had incessantly harped about. Robert Schellenberg, dubiously convicted on drug-smuggling charges in the first place, had his 15-year jail sentence upgraded to a cell on death row. Canada’s canola exporters are stuck with $2.7 billion in export contracts that Beijing has ripped up. Threats of further punishment hang in the air.

It’s all because Canada detained Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou last December on a U.S. Justice Department extradition warrant. Meng is sought by the U.S. to face charges of fraud and dodging sanctions on Iran. Beijing needed to throw somebody up against a wall and slap him around, so President Xi Jinping chose Justin Trudeau.

Beijing needed to throw somebody up against a wall and slap him around, so President Xi Jinping chose Justin Trudeau.

Beijing’s complex campaigns of subversion, threats, influence-buying, bullying and espionage in Canada stretch back much farther than last December, of course. So does the sleazy tendency of Canadian politicians to look the other way, or rush to Beijing’s defence whenever anyone in the intelligence community publicly notices the obvious, or throw the director of the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service under the bus for pointing it out.

When CSIS director Richard Fadden had the temerity to point out nearly a decade ago that there were provincial cabinet ministers and other elected officials in Canada who had fallen under Beijing’s general influence, several Liberal and NDP MPs demanded his resignation.

So it was refreshing to see that Tuesday’s first-ever annual report from the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) made no bones about it. China is a threat to Canada’s national security, the committee found. Terrorism, espionage and foreign influence, cyber threats, major organized crime and weapons of mass destruction were all listed in the NSICOP report among the top threats to Canada. China figures in the report’s findings under espionage and foreign influence, and under cyber threats as well.

Russia is right up there, too, and although the report is redacted in several places, other unnamed governments were reported to be busy with the same dirty work. But it was the novelty of China being singled out for once, in a high-level federal government intelligence report, that’s worth noticing. Usually, the federal government lets China get away with anything.

“China is known globally for its efforts to influence Chinese communities and the politics of other countries. The Chinese government has a number of official organizations that try to influence Chinese communities and politicians to adopt pro-China positions, most prominently the United Front Work Department,” the report states, referring directly to Fadden’s whistle-blowing in 2010.

The report also notes a 2017 warning from David Mulroney, a former ambassador to China, about Beijing’s influence-peddling efforts in Canada. To get what it wants, Beijing mobilizes student groups, diaspora groups, “and people who have an economic stake in China, to work behind the scenes.” The report also notes the unsavoury business of lavish political donations on offer from Chinese businessmen with close links to China’s Communist Party leadership.

Two years ago, the Financial Times obtained the United Front Work Department’s training manual, which boasts about the electoral successes of 10 pro-Beijing politicians in Ontario. “We should aim to work with those individuals and groups that are at a relatively high level, operate within the mainstream of society and have prospects for advancement,” the manual states.

The reason for the public’s relative inattention to influence-and-espionage threats posed by foreign powers like China and Russia is that the federal government tends to avoid addressing the issue publicly. “As it stands now, an interested Canadian would have to search a number of government websites to understand the most significant threats to Canada,” the committee found.

“For some threats, such as terrorism, information is readily available and regularly updated … For other threats, such as organized crime or interference in Canadian politics, information is often limited, scattered among different sources or incomplete. The Committee believes that Canadians would be equally well served if more information about threats were readily available.”

That information is available, of course. It just hasn’t been coming from the federal government. In his just-published book, Claws of the Panda: Beijing’s Campaign of Influence and Intimidation in Canada, veteran foreign affairs reporter Jonathan Manthorpe painstakingly enumerates the breadth and scope of the United Front Work Department’s organizations in Canada, and Beijing’s intimate links throughout Canada’s business class. Manthorpe relied solely on the public record, showing that Beijing’s strong-arming, its inducements and its subtle and not-so-subtle intimidation have been carried out in plain sight for years.

Last year, a coalition of diaspora groups led by Amnesty International provided CSIS, Canada’s spy agency, with an exhaustive account of Beijing’s intensive campaign of bullying, threats and harassment targeting Canadian diaspora organizations devoted to Chinese democracy, the Falun Gong spiritual movement, Tibetan sovereignty, and the Uighurs. A Muslim ethnic minority in Xinjiang, the Uighur people are currently being subjected to an overwhelming tyranny of concentration camps, religious persecution, “re-education,” family separation and ’round-the-clock, pervasive surveillance. “Canada has become a battleground on which the Chinese Communist Party seeks to terrorize, humiliate and neuter its opponents,” says Manthorpe.

That kind of subversion usually occurs behind the scenes. But for years, Confucius Institutes have operated openly in dozens of Canadian universities, colleges and high schools. “In most cases,” Manthorpe contends, “they are espionage outstations for Chinese embassies and consulates through which they control Chinese students, gather information on perceived enemies and intimidate dissidents.”

Because its mandate covers more than a dozen institutions and agencies, NSICOP – first proposed 15 years ago, but only now getting off the ground – had a lot of ground to cover. More than half of the report’s 121 pages are devoted to a review of the intelligence functions of the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces. But it’s subversion by foreign governments that seems to have caught the parliamentary committee’s attention: CSIS told NSICOP the foreign-influence threat is becoming more acute, and countering it will call for “a more significant response” in the coming years.

With that in mind, the committee is already working on a follow-up review of the mandate, priority and resources the federal government provides Canada’s intelligence community to monitor and counter the foreign-influence threat. The committee’s report is expected to be released before the October federal election, but it won’t be focused on the foreign cyber threats the government is already preparing to monitor and expose during the election campaign.

“We’re going to outline the primary-threat actors, we’re going to be examining the threat those actors pose to our institutions and, to a certain extent, our ethno-cultural communities,” NSICOP chair David McGuinty told reporters Tuesday. “We’re working feverishly to get it done.”

About time, too.

They got a good laugh out of Hansel’s charge. “Between guffaws, some suggested immediate action to clear Canada of the hitherto unsuspected ...","The fanatical anti-communism of U.S. Sen. Joe McCarthy and his acolytes in the late 1940s and early ’50s is regarded as one of the low points in modern American politics.

But the red scare spilled over into Canada as well. On April 13, 1948, Social Credit MP the Rev. Ernest George Hansell stood up in the House of Commons and accused 200 Canadians of being “red dupes.”

Several prominent British Columbians were on the list, including painter Lawren Harris, B.C. Electric head Dal Grauer, University of B.C. president Dr. Norman MacKenzie, poet Earle Birney and lawyer Leon Ladner, a big cheese in the Progressive Conservative party.

They got a good laugh out of Hansel’s charge.

“Between guffaws, some suggested immediate action to clear Canada of the hitherto unsuspected ‘traitors and dupes,” said a front-page story in The Vancouver Sun.

“‘We should go about the job right away of getting rid of all these suspects — Dr. MacKenzie, Dal Grauer and all the rest,” said Harris. “We should chase them out of the country.’”

Several journalists were on Hansell’s list, including Kenneth Drury, editor of Vancouver’s third daily newspaper, the News-Herald.

“Hansell belongs to the group of semi-fascists and anti-Semites (in the Social Credit movement),” said Drury. “We are not ashamed of being against them. I don’t think they are representatives of Canadian democracy.”

The Sun speculated that Hansell’s list was drawn from a year-old petition.

“The eagle-eyed cleric apparently found his suspects on a petition originated over a year ago by B.K. Sandwell, editor of the Toronto Saturday Night (magazine),” said the story. “This sinister, though public, document called on Canada to set up a bill of rights. The proposed Dominion Bill of Rights would guarantee such individual rights as freedom of speech, press and assembly. Hansell claimed the clamour for protection of Canadian liberties did not begin until the government started to crack down on Communists.”

A who’s who of Canadians were on Hansell’s list, including Toronto Star publisher E.J. Atkinson, painter A.Y. Jackson and CCF Leader M.J. Coldwell, who Hansell said was a member of the Canadian-Soviet Friendship League, a “Communist front.”

The CCF’s Stanley Knowles “wanted to know if Prime Minister (Mackenzie) King hadn’t also been a member (of the friendship league).” Hansell said this supported his argument that “even very intelligent people can be duped into these things.”

This led King to rise and demand whether his name was on Hansell’s list. Hansell said no. Defence Minister Brooke Claxton “broke in to say that the league, ‘Was not a Communist front at that time.’ ” (This may mean King was a member of the league when Canada and the Soviet Union were allies during the Second World War.)

The Sun’s Jack Scott weighed in that “the Hansell nonsense, while quite amusing, serves to show how far this Communist bogeyman stuff had gone.”

“The truth is that almost anybody in this country can be named a Communist if you don’t like the colour of his hair or the knot in his tie,” Scott wrote. “You don’t have to be a neurotic or even the president of a big utility to be hailed as a Communist. You can be a labour organizer or a negro or just a reckless fellow who speaks his mind.

“A Communist in Canada can be a fellow who thinks veterans haven’t got the houses they deserved or that the cost of living is maybe a little bit too high or that something ought to be done about those slums over on the east side or that war isn’t really such a splendid idea.”

Ironically, The Sun’s front page on April 13 contained a story by Ray Gardner, a gifted writer who was later blacklisted after he became the executive-director of the B.C. Peace Council.

In March 1953, B.C. Liberal MP Tom Goode charged that Gardner and his wife Kay were Russian spies. Rather than defend him, Gardner’s former colleague at The Sun, Bill Fletcher, said Gardner had “caught red fever” and “become a public apologist for the phoney Russian ‘peace’ offensive.”

It was total BS, but nobody would hire Gardner in Vancouver and he left the city to work for The Toronto Star.

Hansell, meanwhile, would go on to lead the B.C. Socreds in the 1952 provincial election, even though he didn’t actually live in B.C., or even run in the election.

The poll was an early effort to look at the state of manners in our country and pinpoint some regional and generational differences.

There are many reasons that compel Canadians to swear. There is a difference in the words that we might use or hear when someone cuts us off the road while driving, or to describe the disappointing actions of a co-worker to a supervisor.

article continues below

This time, we asked Canadians about the words they hear and the words they use in four different types of conversations that may happen throughout the course of a regular day. The results show that there are situations where familiarity enables us to curse, and others where manners seem to prevail.

For starters, more than half of Canadians say they hear swear words “frequently” or “occasionally” when they are talking with friends (68%), strangers (55%), relatives (53%) and co-workers (52%).

While more than one in four Canadians (27%) say they never hear curse words in the workplace, the proportion drops when it comes to listening to relatives (15%), strangers (14%) and friends (10%).

In three provinces – British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba – seven in 10 residents (70%) report hearing swears from their friends “frequently” or “occasionally.” The most bleepable workplaces appear to be located in Ontario, where 54% of residents say their co-workers swear.

The first question deals with what we remember hearing. When it comes to our own choice of words, most Canadians (52%) admit to uttering swears “frequently” or “occasionally” when they are having a conversation with friends, but fewer say they rely on curse words when chatting with relatives (40%), co-workers (34%) and strangers (23%).

There is an elevated sense of caution in specific circumstances. Half of Canadians (49%) say they never swear when talking to strangers and two in five (41%) say they never swear when talking to co-workers.

British Columbians lead the entire country in relying on swear words “frequently” or “occasionally” when talking with friends (56%). Residents of Manitoba and Saskatchewan are first on personal swearing with relatives (45%), co-workers (41%) and strangers (26%).

Age is a factor in what we say, more than in what we hear. Canadians aged 18 to 34 are decidedly more likely to swear when chatting with friends (73%), relatives (55%), co-workers (47%) and even strangers (33%) than their older counterparts.

There is no definitive rule on when and how it is acceptable to swear. Almost half of Canadians (48%) admit that they sometimes alter the way they speak so as not to swear in front of certain people. The proportion of “conditional” swearers is highest among the youngest adult age group (57%) as well as residents of Saskatchewan and Manitoba (52%), Ontario (50%) and British Columbia (50%).

Just under two in five Canadians (38%) say they always modify the way they speak to make sure they do not swear in public. This very polite group encompasses 40% of women, 42% of baby boomers and 43% of Quebecers.

This leaves a small proportion of Canadians (14%) who claim to never alter the way they speak, and who simply do not worry about it if a swear word comes out.

On a political basis, there is no difference in the public behaviour of Liberal and Conservative voters when it comes to swearing. Equal proportions of supporters of either party in the last federal election “always” (43%), “sometimes” (43%) or “never” (14%) change the way they speak.

New Democratic Party (NDP) voters – who can point to these findings as proof of their long-standing assertion that Canada’s two major parties are the same – are less likely to “always” change their words (31%) and more likely to “sometimes” do so (58%).

Two findings leave us asking more questions. First, the gender gap is exceptionally pronounced when it comes to swearing in the workplace. While 46% of women say they never curse when chatting with co-workers, the proportion drops to 35% among men. This might point to men being more likely to get away with “locker room” talk.

Second, those in the 18-to-34 age group are the least likely to say that they never change how they speak to prevent curse words (9%), compared to 15% for baby boomers and 17% for generation X. Canada’s youngest adults have grown up in a time of looser censorship guidelines, particularly when it comes to language on television, movies and music. It is not shocking to see four-letter words in their regular thesaurus.

It’s the fulfillment of a campaign promise by the Liberals in 2015 to create an “all-party committee to monitor and oversee the operations of every ...,"Before getting into the report’s findings however, it is important to know a bit about the group that released it. The National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) is not a parliamentary committee (which does the work of the legislature) but a committee of parliamentarians — an executive body of the government that happens to be staffed by parliamentarians. It’s the fulfillment of a campaign promise by the Liberals in 2015 to create an “all-party committee to monitor and oversee the operations of every government department and agency with national security responsibilities.”

NSICOP has 11 members, eight members of parliament (MPs) and three senators that come from the official political parties in the House of Commons as well as the Senate. Under section 8 of the NSICOP Act, it has the mandate to review a) legislative, regulatory, policy, administrative and financial framework for national security and intelligence, b) the activities of a department that relate to national security and intelligence (unless deemed too injurious to national security by the minister of that department) and c) any matter relating to national security or anything the Crown (government) refers to the committee.

Beyond a campaign promise, there were good reasons to establish such a committee. Canada was one of the few Western countries to have no legislative review of its national security and intelligence agencies. But more than being an anomaly, this situation also left MPs (who have no security clearances) in a poor position to question security and intelligence officials in parliamentary hearings. Worse, it left them with little avenue to understand the increasingly complex national security issues Canada is facing.

Finally, while some national security and intelligence agencies had their own review bodies (for example, the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service, or CSIS, is reviewed by the Security and Intelligence Review Committee, or SIRC), their ability to review is limited to one agency only — SIRC, for example, can only see what CSIS does, not what the national security and intelligence community does with information that CSIS provides them. Further, review bodies in Canada have been restricted to assessing adherence to law and policy and not efficacy (whether they were doing their job well).

In this sense NSICOP fulfills three important roles. First, it reviews any department or agency with any national security responsibilities to assess whether they are doing their jobs well and/or if there is room for improvement. Second, it provides unprecedented transparency into the Canadian national security and intelligence community — something important for all liberal democracies to strive for. Third, it provides an educative function to other MPs, but also the Canadian public on the security and intelligence community.",A much-needed review of Canada’s security and intelligence operations arrives,opencanada.org,https://www.opencanada.org/features/a-much-needed-review-of-canadas-security-and-intelligence-operations-arrives/

No one pretends that it will be quick, easy or cheap to fix the problems that successive Conservative, NDP and Liberal governments have allowed to pile up into the health care mess we face today. To enumerate: the failure to recruit enough new doctors to replace those retiring or leaving the province, resulting in tens of thousands of people without family physicians and the frequent closure of emergency rooms, especially in rural areas; the disgrace of people arriving in ambulances only to be left sitting for hours waiting to even get into the emergency room, much less get a hospital bed; the woeful underfunding of mental health services, with young people with suicidal thoughts being turned away from emergency rooms and told to seek appointments only available months in the future.



In the face of this dismal situation, and the ongoing failure by politicians to put forward anything remotely resembling a systematic, long-term plan for reversing these negative trends, let me make a small suggestion that would make it easier for the rural residents of HRM to attract the doctors they so desperately need.

What I am talking about is correcting one of the graver injustices resulting from the 1996 amalgamation of Halifax County into HRM, an injustice that literally is having a life-and-death impact on people who were forced into HRM against their will by a headstrong legislature.



We’ve known for a long time that it’s harder to find doctors and nurses who want to practice in rural areas. In fact, the federal government officially recognized the problem in 2013 with the launching of the Canada Student Loan Forgiveness for Family Doctors and Nurses program. Under this program, doctors and nurses who agreed to serve in rural areas for a minimum amount of time were granted significant reductions in their outstanding student loans: for doctors, up to $8,000 a year for 5 years, or a total of $40,000; for nurses, up to $4,000 a year for 5 years, or a total of $20,000.

This program would have been great for attracting doctors and nurses to the three rural hospitals in HRM, Twin Oaks Memorial in Musquodoboit Harbour, Eastern Shore Memorial Hospital in Sheet Harbour, and Musquodoboit Valley Memorial Hospital in Middle Musquodoboit.

But now comes the amalgamation kicker. To qualify as a rural hospital, the loan program uses a three-part test: the hospital has to be in area that is not classified by Statistics Canada as a “census metropolitan area,” that does not have an urban core with more than 50,000 people, and that is not a provincial capital. So every square metre of rural HRM fails all three tests: three strikes, and you get no loan forgiveness for doctors and nurses.

Opponents of amalgamation argued fiercely that people living in rural Halifax County would get short shrift from the rule makers in the urban core. How right they were.



But these rules are not written into the Constitution. These rules are not embedded in our charter rights. It is ridiculous to apply this one-size-fits-all Ottawa rule to the rural areas of HRM.



I am calling on the Nova Scotia House of Assembly to take the lead in righting this injustice. I understand that the rule in question is a federal one, but the province has the constitutional responsibility for health care. The legislature should work with our members of Parliament to get the federal government to change its rules.



I do not see why the relevant government agencies could not come up with a rules change in a matter of weeks that would redress the peculiar injustice this rule has inflicted on the people of rural HRM.



This change will not solve the more intractable health care problems we are wrestling with. But it would be a start.

A Fernie woman has gained new insight into the inner workings of Canadian politics and a sisterhood of future female leaders after a political leadership program in Ottawa.

McKinley Richards was one of 338 women selected to represent their community and communicate their vision for Canada at the Daughters of the Vote 2019 program from April 1-4.

LOOK BACK: Fernie woman to represent Kootenay-Columbia riding in Parliament

“It was really exciting, it was a very interesting experience,” said the 21-year-old Fernie Secondary graduate. “Very insightful, I learned a lot for sure.”

During the program, delegates were addressed by every federal party leader and had a chance to engage with Ministers, critics, and advocates.

Richards was representing the Kootenay-Columbia riding and took her local MP Wayne Stetski’s seat during a historic sitting in House of Commons last Wednesday.

She previously worked as a page in the House and described the sitting as the highlight of the program.

“When I was working as a page, it was really visible that less than 30 per cent of the MPs were women,” she said.

“It was something that we noticed and something we talked about as the pages. I never thought that I would witness an all-female house and I think that’s kind of cool that (Daughters of the Vote organizer) Equal Voice made that happen.”

Richards also got a taste of the media furor and scandal that often surrounds politics.

Daughters of the Vote made headlines when a number of delegates shunned Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in protest of his handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair, which involves alleged political interference and obstruction of justice by the Prime Minister’s Office.

During the historic sitting in the House of Commons, delegates heard from the leaders of each party, with a number of women walking out during Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer’s speech then turning their backs on Trudeau.

The protest followed the ejection of former justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott from the Liberal Caucus.

Richards welcomed the opportunity to hear from each party leader. However, she was shocked by some of the media coverage of the delegates’ protest.

“It was really great that they took the time to speak to the Daughters of the Vote,” she said. “That showed that this initiative is something that’s important to them.

“There definitely was a lot of different responses to those speeches and I think whether you agree with… the responses of walking out or turning their backs, you can’t deny that it did take a lot of courage for those women to use their space and to stand up for their values and what they believe in.

“I think it did show that women are powerful and present in Canadian politics, but, more importantly, that we have that power and that’s why it’s important to include women in the conversation.

“That’s what Equal Voice is about – not the partisan side of things. It’s really to empower women to be involved and be part of the conversation.”

Richards is studying international economics and development with a minor in management at the University of Ottawa. She is passionate about global quality education, social entrepreneurship and women’s empowerment, and hoped to raise these issues during Daughters of the Vote.

“One of the biggest things I was looking forward to discussing is the importance of including women and marginalized people to take on those leadership roles, and supporting each other and being a part of important decision making,” she said.

“But a lot of the other issues that were discussed are also really important to me. There were some great speeches about climate action, further development of reconciliation, the importance of mental health awareness – things that definitely need more attention on an international scale.”

Following the Ottawa event, Richards and her fellow delegates are now eligible for a leadership grant to accelerate advocacy efforts in their local communities.

She will return to Fernie this summer before graduating from university in December.

“I’m really looking forward to working on something, most likely in Fernie,” she said.

While Daughters of the Vote may not have inspired a future career in federal politics for Richards, it has given her new insight into the inner workings of Canadian government and a sisterhood of future female leaders.

She currently works for development organization Cuso International and hopes to one day start her own non-profit or social enterprise.

“There are a lot of different ways to make change,” she said.

Equal Voice has secured funding for another Daughters of the Vote program in 2021 and Richards encouraged women aged 18-23 in the Kootenay-Columbia region to apply.

“It’s pretty cool that initiatives like this are becoming more common and are really to support that diversity inclusion in politics and in leadership in general,” said Richards.",Daughters of the Vote eye opening for Fernie woman,The Free Press,https://www.thefreepress.ca/local-news/daughters-of-the-vote-eye-opening-for-fernie-woman/

Conservative Party of Canada leader Andrew Scheer reacts to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's carbon pricing announcement ...","The head of a new national climate change institute says she is ""perturbed"" by a recent partisan attack from the office of Ontario Premier Doug Ford.

The new institute, called the Pan-Canadian Expert Collaboration, is meant to hold Ottawa to account on its policies to reduce carbon pollution. The eligibility requirements for the competitive process that established it were that Ottawa would play “no role” in its governance, operations, board or activities.

But on Tuesday, David Tarrant, Ford’s executive director of strategic communications said that description was all “Liberal spin.” In a tweet, Tarrant cast a skeptical eye on the institute’s independence, calling it an “elite pro-carbon tax ‘institute’” that contained “puppets.”

Ford's office declined to cite any evidence to back up its claim that the new climate change accountability institute was biased.

Now, two leaders at the new group are speaking out, saying they have no intention of being “partisan.” They pointed to guardrails they say will ensure any federal government stays out of their affairs.

“I did not join this institute and agree to initially lead it unless I was assured that this would be independent, and arms-length,” Kathy Bardswick told National Observer Wednesday.

“In terms of its independence, I’m perturbed by this tweet. Yes, it’s being funded by way of startup by the feds, but it’s independently governed, and that governance structure is robust,” she said.

“We really need to change this dialogue (on climate change), move it away from this partisan starting point to one that is well grounded, credibly supported, inclusive, representing interests from coast to coast to coast, generating the kind of positive discussion that is absolutely essential.”

'The institute is not about partisan politics'

As a sustainability and insurance expert, Bardswick is the former president and CEO of The Co-operators Group, a major Canadian insurance co-op. According to a bio at Foresters Financial, she has been underwriting supervisor and regional vice president of the general insurance company at the Co-operators, and held multiple chief operating officer roles there as well.

Bardswick also sat on the government’s North American Free Trade Agreement Council on the Environment, alongside two former premiers, the former president of Shell Canada and others. The body was formed in 2017 to advise Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna on the environmental protections Ottawa was seeking in the trade talks to replace NAFTA.

She will be joined at the institute by Nancy Olewiler, an environmental economist and the director of the School of Public Policy at Simon Fraser University. Olewiler has been an adviser to that school’s Adaptation to Climate Change Team.

“The institute is not about partisan politics, but finding viable and effective policy solutions to sustain Canada's long-term prosperity,” Olewiler told National Observer.

“The new institute consists of academics from across Canada who are experts in their respective fields with long track records of producing highly credible evidence-based research,” she said.

“We have a robust governance framework that is independent of whomever is the federal government of the day. We want to get on with dealing with the significant issues that face our country and affect our future and intend to do so.”

The eligibility requirements stated that the institute must put in place a board of directors that would be responsible for its “management, strategic direction and financial accountability” as well as reporting requirements like a corporate plan, annual reports and audited financial statements.

These details would be hammered out in a contribution agreement signed between the institute and Environment and Climate Change Canada “within 60 business days of the notification of approval.” Bardswick said that agreement is still “a work in progress.”

McKenna said the institute will be ""eligible to receive up to $20 million over five years"" to implement its vision. The details of how that funding will be transferred are also still being worked out.

The board will have “fiduciary and strategic oversight guided by three expert panels,” Bardswick said. The institute is expected to have three main areas of focus: clean growth, adaptation and mitigation.

Tories in Ottawa terminated previous watchdog

Bardswick’s former workplace, The Co-operators Group, is no stranger to climate change-driven extreme weather events. Last August, it made its storm surge insurance coverage available to homeowners in New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island for the first time, after Atlantic Canada was hit with significant flooding.

About three-quarters of insurance companies in Canada have introduced overland flood insurance as weather patterns change, the Insurance Bureau has said. Blair Feltmate, the head of a climate adaptation centre at the University of Waterloo, who is another leader at the new institute, said flooding is the number one cost to Canada, relative to extreme weather risk driven by climate change.

A major peer-reviewed scientific report released this month showed Canada is warming at double the average rate of the planet, and that the majority of this warming is likely caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, which release heat-trapping carbon pollution. The report showed climate change is heightening the risk of extreme heat waves, wildfires, floods and declining freshwater availability in Canada.

""Scenarios with limited warming will only occur if Canada and the rest of the world reduce carbon emissions to near zero early in the second half of the century and reduce emissions of other greenhouse gases substantially,"" it stated.

The Canadian government has previously funded a non-partisan and independent research organization that tackled similar issues. The National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy was created by the Tory government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney in 1988, but later shut down through a decision by the Harper government to terminate its $5 million in annual funding in 2012.

Shortly after, former environment minister Peter Kent suggested that the then-Conservative government could get similar advice from the internet and other research organizations, while former foreign affairs minister John Baird suggested that the government had no need for more reports about a carbon tax.

Asked about the institute Tuesday, Ford's director of media relations Simon Jefferies said ""elite economists may sit in their ivory towers and lecture hard-working families about the need to make everything more expensive, but they will never understand the struggle of counting the pennies and living paycheque to paycheque.""

""Supporting a carbon tax may win you brownie points in the faculty lounge or win the praise of jet-setting Hollywood elites, but it is not the only way to fight climate change,” he said. He pointed to the provincial government’s environment plan, which he claimed will meet federal carbon pollution reduction targets “without imposing a punishing, job-killing carbon tax on already stretched taxpayers.""

Jefferies was asked twice whether he has any evidence to back up Tarrant’s claim that the institute contains puppets. “My previous statement stands,” he said Wednesday, referring to his comments on “elites.”

On Wednesday, National Observer also asked federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer on Parliament Hill what he thought of the new institute, and whether he considered it a waste of money.

But instead of addressing this question directly, Scheer pointed to the backlash the government received over a $12-million federal contribution by McKenna to Loblaws to help make refrigerators in hundreds of their stores more energy efficient. The controversy arose because the company had hundreds of millions of dollars in net earnings last year.

“When you look at what the government’s been spending money on — the $12 million to a private company that has made hundreds of millions of dollars in profit, giving $12 million to Loblaws — while at the same time, charging Canadians higher fuel costs, higher home heating costs, we disagree with this government’s approach both to taxing Canadians and to their inaction on climate change,” Scheer said.

It's not clear whether the institute could pursue its activities beyond 2019, if a new government is elected that cancels its funding.",Head of new national climate institute is 'perturbed' by tweet from Doug Ford's office,National Observer,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/04/11/news/head-new-national-climate-institute-perturbed-tweet-doug-fords-office

While the province’s demographics and leanings are changing, and some of his United Conservative Party’s social policy proposals have met with staunch opposition and protests, his core economic promises of reducing corporate taxes, eliminating carbon taxes, and reducing regulatory timelines to encourage new investment are finding some currency as the economy sputters.

He is no ideologue, he says, highlighting that he agrees with his rivals in the NDP on “the strategic importance” of petrochemical diversification and he doesn’t want to “upset the apple cart” of gas-to-plastics projects in the province.

“I think we’ve demonstrated in my support for the federal acquisition of (the Trans Mountain pipeline) and oil curtailment that we aren’t going to be taking some kind narrowly rigid, ideological position on these questions,” Kenney said. “We’re prepared to be pragmatic.”

Kenney, 50, and Rachel Notley, the NDP’s popular 54-year-old leader running for a second term, agree on little else.

Edmonton-born Notley’s economic platform is focused on “a more directed, strategic approach” to investments and infrastructure in the province, centred on expanding the petrochemical subsidy program.

Oakville, Ont.-born Kenney’s economic platform has centered on cutting costs for the private sector and free markets.

The contrasting styles have drawn comparisons with economic platforms of two popular former Progressive Conservative premiers — with pundits noting that Notley is channelling Peter Lougheed’s government-directed spending, and Kenney is inspired by the market-oriented policies of Ralph Klein.

“You couldn’t ask for more diametrically opposed economic policies,” according to Duane Bratt, Mount Royal University political science professor.

To be fair, both the UCP and NDP have invited comparisons with Alberta’s popular past premiers on themselves. Notley has specifically referenced Lougheed in campaign speeches and Kenney has spoken of restoring the “Alberta Advantage” of low taxes championed by Klein.

The election on April 16 will determine which of the past premier’s economic visions will prevail. Unemployment stands at 7.3 per cent, real GDP growth will languish at 0.5 per cent in 2019, according to TD Bank Group forecast, and debt is estimated to be 80 per cent higher to $64.1 billion next year from 2014/15 levels. The way out of the morass isn’t all that clear given delays on all three active export pipeline projects. What’s clear is the province’s economy has not recovered to pre-2014 levels — both Kenney and Notley agree on this, too — and the electorate is seeking to vote on policies that can deliver a speedier rebound.

***

A week before calling an election, Notley stood in a southeast Calgary industrial fabrication yard against a backdrop of pipes to announce $70 million in royalty credits for an early stage, $600-million petrochemical plant proposal from Inter Pipeline Ltd. to produce acrylic acid, used to make plastic products.

The petrochemical diversification program has proven to be one of the NDP’s most popular economic policies. Days after the writ dropped, Notley said she would double the incentives available through it from $3.6 billion in total credits to $7 billion if re-elected.

“The more value add that we have in Alberta, the more we hedge against the price of the feedstock commodity going down,” Notley said in an interview, adding that she believes $7 billion in credits could attract $75 billion in spending on projects.

The province’s petrochemical program is one in a series of examples of the NDP focusing on “strategic investments” in industrial infrastructure that Notley says will pay for itself and return money to taxpayers. She has also pledged $1.3 billion to expand the province’s industrial highway network.

Given these promises, and what she invested in during her first term, Mount Royal University’s Bratt said Notley truly is “an heir to the mantle of Lougheed.”

In her first term, Notley formed a liquefied natural gas investment team to study the potential of Alberta supporting a project off the West Coast to lift local natural gas prices. Her government also announced a controversial plan to spend $3.7 billion buying railway cars to move crude oil out of the province amid steep discounts for domestic heavy oil.

“With all of these things that we’ve done so far, they all have a return on investment to Albertans in terms of the impact on the economy writ large and none of these things that we’ve invested in doesn’t pay for itself in terms of our own revenue,” Notley said.

Despite attempts to diversify the province’s oil and gas economy, Notley has been sharply criticized by economists for tabling a budget update right before the election that showed non-renewable resource revenues “appears quite important to the government’s deficit reduction plan,” according to a report from National Bank Financial.

None of these things that we’ve invested in doesn’t pay for itself in terms of our own revenue Rachel Notley

“Fact is, over the coming six years, resource royalties are expected to outgrow the remaining revenue pie by a margin of 3:1,” the report from March 22 states.

Despite the big-ticket spending, Notley says her government still plans to balance its budget as planned in 2023, even with the promises made in this election campaign.

Regardless of whether there’s a return on investment, the level of spending has opened Notley and the NDP up to criticism that Alberta’s debt is on track to hit $96 billion by 2024.

Debt ratings agencies downgraded the province’s ballooning debt at multiple points after successive budgets showed rising debt in a period of low oil prices.

Even though the province announced a lower-than-expected deficit for the current fiscal year, ratings agency DBRS kept its “negative trend” tag on the province given Alberta’s continued dependence on resource revenue amid higher spending, leading “debt-to-GDP forecast to reach approximately 20 per cent” by the end of this month.

DBRS cut Alberta’s credit rating one notch to AA in 2017, and said “Alberta’s fiscal outlook remains the weakest among all provinces, risks remain tilted to the downside.” The agency held its rating steady after the province’s 2018 budget.

Kenney believes the $3.7-billion oil-by-rail purchase is “the single largest expenditure in Alberta’s fiscal history” and vowed to scrap the deal if elected. “It’s a responsibility that belongs to the private sector and under the right market conditions, they’ll move more oil by rail,” he said.

Notley says Kenney’s promise to shred the deal is “ridiculous” and would end up costing taxpayers money and also “extend and expand” the need for oil producers in the province to curtail their production given a lack of new export pipelines.

But several executives in the energy sector have told the Financial Post, on condition of anonymity, they are concerned about cancelling the railway contracts and fear it would lead to another period of punishingly high discounts for Canadian oil.

“The industry is not unified on that proposal but we look at it as an insurance policy,” Explorers and Producers Association of Canada president Tristan Goodman said of the oil-by-rail deal. “We think we need an insurance policy involving rail.”

Energy investor Ninepoint Partners’ Eric Nuttall believes Kenney would back down from scrapping the crude-by-rail deal “despite what is being said on the campaign trail.”

“I appreciate his ‘free markets’ angle but this is one issue where, given how much of it has been screwed up by multiple levels of government, the risk/reward merits the continued involvement of the Alberta government into 2020,” Nuttall said. “It’s not a risk worth taking.”

Most economists and energy executives in Calgary are upbeat about other aspects of Kenney’s economic platform.

While Goodman wouldn’t comment on specific policy measures, the small- and mid-sized oil and gas producers he represents are looking for improvements on fiscal issues like taxes, on regulatory burdens and on new pipelines.

Research done by the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy has formed the basis for much of the UCP’s economic policies so far.

The UCP asked School of Public Policy research director on tax and economic growth Bev Dahlby to study its plan to cut the corporate tax rate from 12 per cent to 8 per cent. Dahlby found it would lead to 6.5 per cent higher real GDP growth.

However, the school’s experts declined to comment for this piece over concerns they’d be seen as endorsing the party.

Given where the UCP is polling in Calgary, Kenney may not need an endorsement.

In the course of 30 minutes at the Blackfoot Diner, Kenney was interrupted by supporters wishing him well three times — a reflection of the UCP currently polling at 51.4 per cent support in the city, close to 17 points ahead of the NDP.

Kenney rolled out his platform before the writ dropped, announcing plans for cancelling the carbon tax, cutting corporate taxes and rolling back regulations.

“The fundamental difference I have with the NDP is that they seem to think the only way to diversify or get the economy going is to pick a handful of winners and losers. Our view is to get the fundamentals right,” Kenney said.

For her part, Notley doesn’t believe corporate tax cuts are an inefficient way to attract investment “particularly in a place like ours where we are already a very competitive province relative to other provinces around investment.”

“I don’t think, in the oil and gas sector anyway, it’s a particularly helpful strategy and I think a more directed, strategic approach will work better,” she said.

Interestingly, the corporate tax cuts espoused by Kenney could have a larger effect on investments in petrochemical projects than on upstream oil and gas producers.

“What investment are we talking about?” asked ARC Energy Research Institute executive director Peter Tertzakian. “Corporate tax cuts benefit midstream and downstream companies more than the upstream industry.”

Outside of the oilsands, few exploration and production companies have high corporate tax burdens because they reinvest all or most of their earnings into new production, said Tertzakian, who is one of the top energy economists in the country, and was a member of Notley’s oil and gas royalty review panel.

Kenney plans to announce additional policies about speeding up regulatory approvals at the Alberta Energy Regulator later in the campaign. “I want to meet or beat Texas when it comes to timelines and approvals and I truly believe we can do that without reducing health or safety standards,” he said.

Kenney, who was a prominent cabinet member of Stephen Harper’s federal government, has also promised to appoint a minister responsible for cutting red tape.

I want to meet or beat Texas when it comes to timelines and approvals and I truly believe we can do that without reducing health or safety standards Jason Kenney

The former federal minister is looking to replicate “the experience of the (Gordon) Campbell Liberal government of B.C., which successfully reduced by 41 per cent the regulatory burden of the British Columbia economy, making them something of a model for North America.”

Experts in B.C. say, however, believe the Campbell government drew its inspiration from a neighbour.

“I wouldn’t know why the antecedence in Alberta wouldn’t be closer to home,” said University of British Columbia political science professor Alan Tupper of the deregulation drive. The Campbell government’s deregulation effort in British Columbia was “very influenced” by the Klein government in Alberta a decade earlier, and also by the Mike Harris government in Ontario, Tupper said.

Comparisons between Notley and Lougheed and between Kenney and Klein seem very accurate, but are also deeply ironic, Mount Royal University’s Bratt said.

Lougheed’s “fiercest critic” was Grant Notley, Rachel’s father, and at that time the NDP’s lone member in the legislature. Kenney, meanwhile, was a “thorn in Klein’s side” in the 1990s when Klein was in the premier’s office and Kenney was with the Canadian Taxpayers Federation.

Now Notley and Kenney are trying to channel Albertans’ fond memories of both former premiers, both deceased, as they seek the province’s highest office.

“The memory of Lougheed — it’s an older memory but it’s a less divisive memory than the memory of Klein,” Bratt said.

Who will bravely pipe up about the need to widen a base that ...","Given the current morass of Brexit, it’s hard to remember that Theresa May was once an agent of change inside the British Conservative Party.

First elected in the Labour landslide of 1997, May took over as chair of her party in the summer of 2002, in the wake of a second electoral drubbing by Labour’s Tony Blair, the then-young and clued-in purveyor of “Cool Britannia.”

Staring a generation of political wilderness in the face, May took a look at her twice-battered rump of a party and spoke a few home truths at its annual convention.

“There’s a lot we need to do in this party of ours,” May urged. “Our base is too narrow and so, occasionally, are our sympathies. You know what some people call us – the Nasty Party.”

And while May’s analysis went down like a cup of cold sick in the room, the message was eventually taken to heart. David Cameron’s leadership largely succeeded in repositioning the party as pro-environment, pro-minority and pro-moderate. Well, until Brexit anyway.

Which brings us to the question at hand: Who is the Conservative Party of Canada’s Theresa May? Who will bravely pipe up about the need to widen a base that, while uber-reliable, isn’t exactly trending in the direction of modern Canada?

The answer should be Andrew Scheer, but the Tory leader has been slow off his mark on questions of nastiness since becoming leader. Every time Scheer can’t say “Muslim” in the wake of a slaughter, or finds himself at the same events as Faith Goldy, or leads the charge against meaningless UN migration compacts, a little piece of the accessible vote dies. The Tory leader always looks like he would rather be somewhere else when placed in the middle of a difficult conversation.

This discomfort is what happens when the primary concern is keeping your natives from getting restless. At some point, however, Scheer will have to treat his party membership as a foundation instead of a roof. There are only 250,000 or so CPC members, compared with the roughly 5.5 million people who voted Conservative in 2015, which itself is still a long way from the nearly seven million who voted for Justin Trudeau. Speaking to that delta population of 1.5 million ought to be a priority.

Who will bravely pipe up about the Tories’ need to widen a base that, while uber-reliable, isn’t exactly trending in the direction of modern Canada?

But how to broaden the coalition is the discussion the Conservative Party ducked in its last leadership race by limiting the contest to the slim and unrepresentative segment of society already in possession of a party membership card. And it’s the discussion the Conservative Party will want to avoid at the very moment Justin Trudeau is running the gauntlet on SNC-Lavalin. But the party needs to tackle the question head-on before the country goes to the polls this autumn.

The pressures are two-fold.

On the one hand, we have Maxime Bernier – i.e. the man who lost to Scheer by a margin so thin Trudeau would feel comfortable hanging his latest SNC defence on it – courting the nativist elements of the Conservative Party’s support. And on the other, we have a wounded and desperate Trudeau and his Liberal Party who will be searching for every bit of white nationalist hate they can scrape off the internet to affix to Scheer. The Tory leader needs to move before they can tar him.

Yes, Bernier will be condescending and shameless in response. And yes, the Liberal tactics will be pathetic and desperate. But their criticism will be pushing on an open door.

Stephen Harper and Peter MacKay created the Conservative Party of Canada in the wake of Theresa May’s “nasty party” speech and quickly set about their own plan to make sure the label didn’t stick in Canada.

Harper quickly ruled out revisiting abortion. A gay marriage vote was brought forward when it was certain to lose. Immigrant communities were courted and celebrated. The government then did its job so well it received two more mandates. The nastiness label was traded in for competence.

But by the end of the third go-round, the nastiness had soaked back in and become the narrative. Snitch lines, burqa bans and relentless political attacks were then rebuffed by sunny ways. There’s a reason Trudeau still uses Harper as his favourite curse word: it sells.

The proxy issues for nastiness at the moment are white nationalism and climate. Scheer needs to be unequivocal in his condemnation of the former and much more detailed in his policy toward the latter. He needs to tell people like Ezra Levant to jog on and tell people like Michael Chong to come forward. And, while he’s at it, he should ban his MPs from calling people a piece of poo emoji on Twitter.

Because SNC is the gift that forces Trudeau into nasty. Scheer should counter with his own version of sunny ways.

In recent weeks the party mailed a survey to Tory donors, signed by the party’s campaign director Hamish Marshall, asking them to rank major Canadian newspapers and TV stations — the Globe & Mail, Toronto Star, the Sun papers, Global, City, CTV, CBC and the National Post — based on the outlets’ perceived ideological leanings: “left of centre,” “neutral/balanced,” or “right of centre.”

The mail-out, sent to supporters as a pitch to kick in monthly donations to the party, further asks: “In your opinion, which of Canada’s major political parties is most favoured by the mainstream news media?”

A party spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the questionnaire.

“It was about raising funds for our campaign, and gathering supporters feedback on where and how they consume media, and their personal perceptions,” said party communications director Cory Hann. He added that the appeal for donations was spurred by the Liberal Party’s proposed support program for Canadian media outlets — a program that would be administered by an arms-length body, to avoid possible political favouritism.

Beyond surveying supporters’ news diet, the mail-out asks whether the party should “bypass” the news media and instead hone “an aggressive social media strategy to communicate with people directly in their homes or on their mobile devices” and whether the party “should focus on direct voter contact … that will allow us to take our message to voters unfiltered.”

It also asks whether the campaign should prioritize local and community media outlets, and invest more in advertising and a “sophisticated ground game” in order to “counter the efforts of pro-media news organizations.”

In your opinion, which of Canada’s major political parties is most favoured by the mainstream news media?

The direct-mail appeal to donors included a letter from Marshall, but the party refused to provide it to the Post.

While the Conservative Party is no stranger to taking aim at perceived bias in the media, the proliferation of hyper-partisan, conspiratorial and outright hateful online news outlets has made such tactics a riskier proposition.

As he pummelled the New York Times and CNN, Donald Trump enjoyed almost relentlessly flattering coverage from alt-right websites like Breitbart, Infowars, and the Gateway Pundit — and he, in turn, used them to relay his message to his base. He hired Breitbart co-founder Steve Bannon to apply his sharp-elbowed media tactics to the Republican presidential campaign. In so doing, though, he may have emboldened the likes of Infowars, which promotes baseless conspiracy theories including that the American government carried out the 9/11 attacks and that a 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 20 children and six adults was a hoax. Infowars has been removed from numerous platforms, including YouTube and Twitter, for promulgating hate speech.

Scheer appointed Marshall as his campaign director for the upcoming election despite controversy over Marshall’s connections to Rebel Media, an ideological cousin of Breitbart.

Marshall ran a digital strategy company, Torch Agency, from Rebel’s Toronto office, where he also ran Scheer’s leadership campaign. While with Rebel, where he was a corporate director, Marshall and Torch helped design its outreach strategies, which included aggressively microtargeting possible supporters and donors with issue-specific campaigns — a tactic he appears to have made use of in the Conservative Party as well. Often, that outreach involved attacking the mainstream media as untrustworthy.

Though a longtime Conservative strategist, Marshall’s close association with Rebel Media prompted questions, including over Scheer’s own involvement with the media organization.

Scheer made several appearances on The Rebel, but in August 2017 he announced he would no longer grant interviews to the outlet after Rebel host Faith Goldy appeared on a neo-Nazi podcast while in Virginia to cover a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, at which one person was killed. Rebel fired Goldy amid the ensuing controversy.

The questionnaire asks supporters to what extent they agree with the statements: “The mainstream Canadian media spend too much time covering left-wing social justice issues and not enough time reporting on the economy or international affairs,” and “When union leaders who represent news media workers attack Conservatives, it creates an undeniable conflict of interest.”

The party spokesperson elaborated that the mailer was referencing Jerry Dias, the president of Unifor, who has been openly critical of the Conservative Party. Unifor represents a number of newsrooms, although they represent a small fraction of the union’s 300,000-plus members.

For the last three years or so, the provinces – and the rest of the world – have been going conservative. This electoral trend may – or may not – spell trouble for the Liberals in October.

Since the party was elected in 2015, after almost 10 years of Stephen Harper’s Conservatives, five provinces have defeated governments run by Liberals or New Democrats.

In Manitoba, the Conservatives defeated the NDP in 2016. The same year, the right-of-centre Saskatchewan Party was re-elected, for the third time since 2007. In British Columbia, the NDP (with the Greens) unseated the Liberals in 2017, the exception to the conservative tide. Last year, Conservatives ousted Liberals in New Brunswick and Ontario, and the Coalition Avenir Québec ousted the Liberals in Quebec.

Since the federal Liberals came to office, just one Liberal government – in Nova Scotia in 2017 – was re-elected. (The Liberals also came to power in Newfoundland in November 2015, albeit scarcely a month after Trudeau’s Liberals).

On Tuesday, Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party is expected to bury Rachel Notley’s New Democrats in Alberta.

If that happens, six provinces will be run by right-wing governments: Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

This isn’t to say that these governments are hard right; Canada dislikes philosophical extremes. Also, because a government is Conservative does not necessarily mean it is conservative; the Progressive Conservatives who long ran Ontario (1943-1985) and Alberta (1971-2015) were moderates. But Conservative governments today oppose high taxes and deficits. They are not usually fond of unions or regulation.

This isn’t to say that these governments are hard right; Canada dislikes philosophical extremes.

A measure of contemporary conservatism is the carbon tax, which provinces are challenging in court on April 15. Alberta will probably join the legal challenge if Kenney is elected.

The federal government has introduced this tax, a price on pollution, and so have Quebec and B.C. Meanwhile Ontario, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Manitoba want to reverse it. If these provinces win in court, it will be a blow to the federal Liberals, for whom carbon pricing is central to fighting climate change. Their plan includes phasing out coal and embracing renewable energy.

Electing governments of different stripes in the provinces and nationally is a historical pattern in Canadian politics. It is a peculiarly reliable system of checks and balances.

Over the near decade that the Conservatives were in Ottawa (2006-2015), the Liberals were elected or re-elected in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia; New Democrats were in power in Manitoba and New Brunswick (one term). There were Conservative governments in Alberta and Newfoundland.

Now the Liberals are in power federally, and conservative parties, big or small “c,” are winning in the provinces. This may be the natural order of things – or, it may be the coming of a different, more aggressive conservatism, reflecting the contagion that has infected Donald Trump’s Republicans, whom Ronald Reagan would barely recognize.

Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives are more conservative than Harper’s Conservatives. Astonishingly, Scheer supports Brexit, for example, which aligns him with the right-wing nationalists and nativists in Britain. He is also said to be a social conservative. In Alberta, where Jason Kenney is also socially conservative, many of his party’s candidates are, too.

""Let us know how the current healthcare system affects your practice and ...","OTTAWA – Liberal MPs have penned a letter to Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer imploring him to cancel a Greater Toronto Area candidate's $250-a-ticket fundraising event billed as a discussion of ""the business of healthcare.""

The Liberals say they're concerned about the framing of the event, but also say it's ""quite clearly an attempt to sell access to power,"" in the letter obtained by CTV News.

The event, scheduled in North York, Ont. next week, includes the tagline: ""healthcare reimagined, it’s time for change."" Based on the wording of the event website it appears geared towards people who work in the health-care field.

The fundraiser is being hosted by the Conservative candidate for Don Valley West, Ont. Yvonne Robertson, and was initially described as a policy forum and cocktail reception with Conservative MPs Pierre Poilievre, or ""our next finance minister"" as the event describes, and Marilyn Gladu, ""our next health minister.""

However, the reference to the two MPs as potential future ministers was removed after CTV News approached Robertson's campaign for comment.

""There is only one person that decides cabinet, and that’s the Prime Minister of Canada. As an opposition party, we have Shadow Ministers, not a cabinet, and referencing them as anything else is not representative of their actual position. That has been changed,"" Robertson's campaign said in an email.

The letter to Scheer—sent before the event webpage was amended—said that it’s ""alarming"" that the party is promoting attendees' ability to be able to bend the ears of Poilievre and Gladu, who are described as future ministers.

""That was one of the least offensive parts,"" Rob Oliphant, the Liberal MP who currently represents the riding, told CTV News after learning that the event description had been amended. He said regardless, the event is still troubling and should be cancelled. ""It's still cash for access,"" Oliphant said, because it is inviting people to donate to the Conservative Party to be able to help shape their policy.

He was one of the seven MPs—who all are either doctors, or represent GTA ridings—who signed the letter.

The event also lists deputy Conservative Party leader Lisa Raitt, MP Peter Kent, and senators Linda Frum and Nicole Eaton, as well as others who will be there to hear ideas about improving the Canadian health-care system related to small businesses and modernizing the Canada Health Act.

""Let us know how the current healthcare system affects your practice and which policy changes you think would have the greatest positive impact on you and your patients,"" the event page reads.

Nowhere in the event listing is privatizing health care stated, though the Liberals are calling on Scheer to ""prove you support public health care, by immediately cancelling this event.""

Oliphant said he found it ""worrisome"" that the event description states that health policy should be ""shaped heavily"" by ""dedicated practitioners."" Oliphant said that while doctors and nurses should be involved, so too should patients and public health officials.

In an effort to counter the event, he's planned an open townhall earlier in the week, featuring Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor.

""The concept that the business of health care comes over the patient outcomes… that's what worries me,"" Oliphant said. ""Health care is not a business, health care is about life and death.""

In response to the Liberals’ concerns about privatization and framing of health care as a business, Robertson's campaign spokesperson Matthew Poon said that the event was designed ""to bring together small business owners like doctors who were unfairly targeted by Justin Trudeau’s small business tax hikes and discuss ways to help them better deliver health services within the principles of the Canada Health Act.""

""Conservatives have always and will always support the principles of the Canada Health Act,"" the statement said.

After coming under fire, largely from the Conservatives, for holding ""cash for access"" events — where for sizeable donations, guests could rub shoulders with the prime minister or members of his cabinet—the Liberals changed the rules to set up more transparency around these events.

The new political fundraising laws came into effect at the end of 2018, requiring parties to advertise fundraisers in advance, and report back afterwards, if they're charging $200 or more per ticket and featuring the prime minister, cabinet ministers, party leaders, or party leadership candidates. Under these rules, there are no requirements for advertising or reporting fundraising events where MPs are the featured guests.

In the 1990s, Winona Hutchinson was a two-time Shōtōkan karate national amateur champion, studying under sensei John Palitti in Toronto.

Sonny Spina was a long-haired kid here in the Sault, winner of multiple international kuk sool won grand championship titles around North America, trained by local legend Rudy Timmerman.

Neither Hutchinson nor Spina talk much about those days now.

They've moved on to many other accomplishments.

But last night, the two elite warriors found themselves in a ballroom at Quattro Hotel and Conference Centre, contending against each other for a different kind of prize: the right to carry the Conservative Party of Canada's local banner into the Oct. 21 federal election.

Hutchinson, who placed fourth of five Ward 3 candidates in last fall's municipal election, offered administrative experience in both private and public sectors.

Her curriculum vitae includes stints at Mark's, Home Depot, Lowe's, Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services, in tax preparation and as a volunteer meet manager and Level IV referee with Swim Ontario.

Last night, speaking to party faithful, Hutchinson promised to be a fighter.

She might not be as universally liked as Constable Spina, a well-known volunteer fund-raiser and City Police spokesperson, she said.

But she'd get the job done.

""For us as Conservatives, we have to get away from voting in people because of who we know,"" Hutchinson said. ""That's what got us Trudeau.""

""You may not like me, that's okay. But you're going to love the job I can do for you. That's the key.""

""The other thing I want to mention about being a Conservative is that, we tend to be nice. We need someone who's willing to fight for you. I'm going to do that. It's your voice that matters, not mine.""

Hutchinson talked about fiscal responsibility and committed to be tough on politicians she considers climate fear-mongers.

""We've heard the whole doom-and-gloom, world's-gonna-end-in-12-years. I don't believe that, but I do believe in personal responsibility. That is our responsibility as people here in Sault Ste. Marie, to ensure that we do control our pollution. One hundred per cent. We can do that. But we need to make sure that we hold the people that are on the federal stage now accountable for the fear-mongering. It does nothing. All it does is... confuse everyone. Distraction is smoke and mirrors.""

After the votes were counted last night, it was Spina who emerged victorious.

""It's clear that there's a strong Conservative movement happening in this riding and my message tonight is clear: Terry Sheehan, your time is up,"" the former Sault Ste. Marie United Way chair said.

Having two strong candidates seeking the local party nod has considerably boosted the Sault riding association.

""Together, we've grown our local party to nearly 500 members in the last few months and that's something we can all be proud of,"" Spina said.

""Tonight was an incredible turnout,"" Spina said.

Indeed, 59.9 per cent of those 500 members came to the Quattro last night to vote.

""I want to thank Winona and her team for everything they were able to do to bring our party together tonight,"" Spina said.

""Quite honestly, if we did not have a leadership contest the way that we had tonight, our party would not have grown by such significant numbers this evening. Quite frankly, I don't think it's grown this significantly in the history of our party locally.""

""Starting tomorrow, you'll see that our team is ready, our team is willing and our team is able to start moving forward together with everyone in this party to make sure that this October, Sault Ste. Marie is Tory-blue and we'll represent every person in this city to the absolute best of our ability,"" the newly minted Tory candidate said.",Elite martial artists grapple at Conservative nomination meeting,SooToday,https://www.sootoday.com/local-news/elite-martial-artists-grapple-at-conservative-nomination-meeting-1370655

The United Conservative Party leader, likely to become premier of Alberta in elections next week, is promising lawsuits, boycotts and tax cuts to revive an oil industry under siege. Whether he can do much to solve the sector’s intractable problems, many of which are beyond his control, remains to be seen.

Kenney’s bid to reinvigorate Alberta’s oil industry -- which has suffered from a chronic pipeline shortage that’s led to low crude prices and a dearth of international investment -- will have national and global implications. The province churns out about four-fifths of Canada’s oil, an industry that accounts for 10 percent of the nation’s economy and 20 percent of its exports. The province’s 3.7 million barrels of daily production put it roughly on par with the United Arab Emirates.

“We mean business -- we’re no longer going to roll over and apologize and accept policies that damage our economy,” Kenney, 50, a former federal cabinet minister who leads the newly formed UCP, told reporters in Calgary on Tuesday. Most polls give Kenney a comfortable lead over Premier Rachel Notley and her New Democratic Party for the April 16 vote.

Pipeline Stalled

Kenney’s biggest challenge will be to get a pipeline built to ensure the increased oil-sands production planned for the next 50 years can get to market. Though he’s lashed out at Notley for failing to make much progress on new lines, the reality is that Canada hasn’t had a major crude oil pipeline built in about a decade. Notley is hardly the only one to blame.

TransCanada’s Corp.’s Keystone XL has been stalled for a decade by environmental protests and lawsuits in the U.S., while its Energy East project to the Atlantic Coast was dropped after opposition in Quebec. Kinder Morgan Inc., meanwhile, abandoned its Trans Mountain pipeline expansion to the Pacific Coast due to protests and legal challenges in British Columbia. Justin Trudeau’s government stepped in to buy it last year, though little progress has been made.

Despite Kenney’s fiery claims to get a pipeline built for Alberta, in the end it requires federal approval through the National Energy Board, not to mention tacit approval from other provinces, cities and indigenous groups.

“The biggest thing is always pipelines, and for that you need the federal government and the provinces to cooperate,” Laura Lau, who helps manage C$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion) in assets at Brompton Corp. in Toronto, said in an interview. “That’s the No. 1 issue, and there’s only so much Alberta can do on its own.”

Kenney is counting on a new pipeline to revive investment in the sector, which plunged by almost half between 2014 and 2017, as Canadian firms curbed spending and foreign operators including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Marathon Oil Corp. pulled out in favor of lower-cost, lower-emissions areas.

The UCP election platform released last week says a Kenney government’s first bill will scrap the C$30-a-ton carbon tax Notley implemented after her surprise victory in 2015. He estimates the repeal will amount to a C$1.4 billion tax cut that will create jobs, save families money and put Alberta’s energy sector on a level playing field with other jurisdictions.

If Trudeau’s federal government imposes a carbon tax on Alberta, as it has in other provinces that haven’t put forth their own plan, Kenney plans to sue to stop the imposition.

Carbon Moves

Even here, Kenney’s power to make changes will be limited. Other provinces in the same situation, including Ontario and Manitoba, have pledged to take the Trudeau government to court. In the meantime, consumers in those regions started paying a carbon tax on April 1.

Kenney’s platform acknowledges energy industry emissions are contributing to climate change and says his party is committed to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. His solution is to require large emitters to reduce intensity by 10 percent, purchase credits from other facilities or pay into a fund to develop emissions-reducing technologies.

Provincial Boycott

Kenney -- who served as immigration minister under Stephen Harper’s Conservative government from 2008 to 2013 -- is also threatening to have Alberta cease doing business with banks that boycott energy projects, cut oil shipments to provinces that fight pipeline development, and press Trudeau to kill Bill C-69, which overhauls the approval process for pipelines.

If the bill isn’t scrapped and if there isn’t substantial progress on the construction of a pipeline to the coast, Kenney plans to hold a referendum on removing equalization payments from the Constitution Act. Never mind that so-called equalization payments, in which the government in Ottawa transfers money to poorer provinces, is a federal program.

Kenney’s ire won’t be aimed solely at Trudeau. His C$30 million “war room” will combat misinformation about Alberta’s energy industry, and his government will challenge the charitable status of groups that campaign against the sector.

Crude-by-Rail

While most of those proposals will find easy support in the industry, he may receive push back on one idea: scrapping the current government’s plan to invest C$3.7 billion to add 120,000 barrels of crude-by-rail capacity. Kenney says the private market will invest to solve the problem and that the government shouldn’t risk taxpayer money.

Deloitte analyst Andrew Botterill said last week that scrapping the plan could cause a drop in local heavy crude prices, which have gained almost 90 percent this year to more than $55 a barrel, near the highest in almost a year.

Notley says Kenney’s plan imperils Alberta’s energy industry by isolating it from the rest of the country. She plans to continue pushing for changes to Bill C-69, pressing the federal government to speed construction of the Trans Mountain expansion and encouraging more local refining and upgrading.

“When you are leading a province, when you have an obligation to represent all people in the province, you need to take a determined, informed, strategic, forceful approach to advocating your position,” Notley, 54, said in Calgary on Tuesday.

Beyond the energy industry, Kenney plans to cut the business tax rate to 8 percent from 12 percent over four years. Even while cutting taxes and maintaining operating spending at current levels, he plans to balance the budget within his first term. Alberta is projected to run a C$6.93 billion deficit for the fiscal year that just ended.

Lau said most energy industry executives probably would prefer a Kenney victory because he might cut regulations and speed approvals for new oil wells. The Brompton portfolio manager is skeptical either leader can dramatically improve the situation for the sector, which has been battered by forces beyond Alberta’s borders.

“If it appears Alberta is a friendlier place to do business, that should help,” Lau said. “But even if approvals for wells are faster, there’s no point if you can’t put in a pipeline.”

So at this critical juncture ...","The ghastly attacks on two mosques in New Zealand recently show that the rise of far-right extremism has not only proven itself to be a major global threat to peace and security, but also an existential threat to conservatism itself, which has come under heavy fire for breeding, or at least tolerating in its ranks, xenophobic elements.

In a way, the New Zealand attacks may prove to become a pivotal moment for the right-wing.

Though the racism of far-right extremism has long been identified as something real and dangerous, it has also, to a large extent, remained under the radar; something ugly simmering under the surface.

But after 50 people (nearly all visible minorities) were slaughtered at a house of worship, in a modern western nation deemed to be one of the safest in the world, that ugliness has boiled over for the world to see.

What’s now clear is that it’s past time for conservatives to utterly separate themselves from any notion or any segment of their membership base that ascribes even remotely to xenophobic or Islamophobic views. It should go without saying that conservatism is a movement in which racists are not welcome. Unfortunately, this is a message that must now be shouted by conservatives across the world, including here in Canada, where anti-immigrant views have, as of late, begun to stain the brand.

READ MORE: When terror strikes the populist leaders cash in

After the New Zealand mosque attack, the leader of the People’s Party of Canada refused to offer comment (even to denounce it). Similarly, the leader of the Conservative Party’s first statement focused on how “freedom” had come under attack (not Muslims), needing a second try to get it right. The delay left the impression that the Conservative Party feared alienating a kind of voter who may hold anti-immigrant views.

Both parties have also been skeptical of Canada’s signing of the UN’s Global Compact for Migration. The Conservatives have argued that it will erode the sovereignty of our borders, while the PPC says it will open the doors to masses of migrants from poor countries. Both claims seem geared toward stoking fear among anti-immigration voters, and contrary to the reality of the massive value of immigration.

Of course, south of the border, the president of the United States has openly fraternized with far right and white supremacists while routinely raising fears about immigrants, whether it’s about building a wall to keep out Mexicans or imposing a travel ban to keep out Muslims.

It’s as if an element of the right has forgotten, or perhaps has simply not truly understood, that there is a huge difference between “nationalism” and “nation building”.

“Nationalism” as we understand it today, is increasingly a movement based on bigotry and fear-based racism—one that’s often associated with populist far right movements in Europe that have ridden a wave of anti-migrant sentiment. “Nation building” however, is a very different and noble cause; one that is about wanting to make your country great—it is not to be associated with the pettiness of racism, bigotry or Islamophobia at all.

There needs to be a refocus on positive conservatism, a movement that embraces immigration and minorities. After all, immigration is what made the U.S. the dominant power in the world, by welcoming and nurturing the best minds to fuel technology and ingenuity. (Immigrants contribute 10 per cent of America’s annual GDP and are, according to the Brookings Institution, more likely to become Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine.)

We’ve seen the immense benefits of immigration here as well, but there’s a lot more potential we have yet to tap into. And conservative thinking should be obsessed with wanting to build Canada up to reach its true greatness.

Conservatism at its best is a movement that champions individual liberties and fiscal responsibility; small government and social values. Campassionate conservatives also believe in helping others, be they refugees or fellow citizens. It’s also important to remember that in the Conservative Party of Canada’s recent past, during the time of Stephen Harper, Canada recorded record high immigration and was focused on winning over immigrant communities.

So at this critical juncture, what is stopping Canadian conservatives from building a party that embraces open doors and offers a safe haven to the world’s most needy, while making Canada an economic powerhouse? Nothing. Because most right of centre voters in Canada are welcoming to refugees and immigrants and would welcome the economic growth and innovation they bring.

This is what the new conservatism, a positive conservatism, can look like. It’s got to be about nation building, not nationalism. It’s got to be about achieving the best for Canada, in a way that includes everybody, and cuts at the root of far-right extremism. It’s time to make a separation between racist nationalism, and the positive, inclusive patriotism of nation building.

One reason for the nastiness ...","Duane Bratt is a political science professor and chair, Department of Economics, Justice, and Policy Studies, at Mount Royal University in Calgary.

I am usually skeptical about the oft-made claims that any given election is the nastiest ever. What metrics are being used? Were other campaigns examined in detail? For instance, Alberta’s 1935 election, fought amid the Great Depression, and the 1944 battle between the Social Credit Party and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation were hardly walks in the park.

But this year’s provincial election lives up to that billing for Albertans.

Story continues below advertisement

Candidates have had to withdraw or apologize for racist, homophobic or misogynist comments from their past. There have been large-scale rallies on issues such as gay-straight alliances and the federal Bill C-69, which would rewrite many of Canada’s industrial regulations, including the way capital projects such as pipelines are assessed. Social media has turned into even more of a cesspool than usual. Campaign signs have been defaced with vile language. Candidates from multiple conservative parties are raising the spectre of Alberta separatism. The RCMP is investigating the 2017 leadership race of the United Conservative Party (UCP).

One reason for the nastiness is the length of the campaign period. Officially, the campaign is 28 days long, but the unofficial beginning was the night Jason Kenney became UCP leader in October, 2017. A year and a half of almost constant campaigning – much of it negative – has set people’s nerves on edge.

Another reason has been the degree of polarization between the parties. Previous competitive elections in Alberta have been between centre-right parties, such as the Progressive Conservatives (PC), and right-wing parties – for example, the 2012 contest between the PCs and Wildrose. Even the hard-fought campaign of 1993 matched the Liberals, promising “brutal cuts” and the PCs, who vowed “massive cuts.” But in 2019, you have an NDP that may have moderated itself from its days in opposition, but remains solidly left-wing, facing a UCP that is much further to the right than the old PCs. In fact, the UCP is the most socially conservative party since the days of Ernest Manning and the Social Credit party of the 1960s. Small centrist parties such as the Alberta Party and the Alberta Liberals have not been able to exploit the big ideological hole between the NDP and UCP.

The two major parties are also running on platforms that involve substantial negative campaigning. Much of the NDP re-election strategy has been to focus on demonizing Mr. Kenney for his past views on abortion and LGBTQ rights. Meanwhile, the UCP wants to “fight back” against perceived enemies of Alberta’s oil and gas sector – Ottawa, B.C., Quebec, environmental groups, First Nations that oppose pipelines, large oil and gas firms that support climate change efforts – and wants to create a “war room” to respond to anyone who criticizes the sector. On the very first night of his leadership of the UCP, Mr. Kenney set the tone: “If we work hard, stay humble and earn every vote, we will ensure that this deceptive, divisive, debt-quadrupling, tax-hiking, job-killing, accidental socialist government is one-and-done.” The next day, Rachel Notley responded: “We will stand up against the UCP’s job-killing, climate-denying, gay-outing, school-cutting, health-privatizing, backward-looking, hope-destroying divine agenda.”

The state of the economy has only deepened the campaign’s bitterness. Since late 2014, Alberta has been suffering through a lingering economic downturn the likes of which have not been seen since the 1980s. When you combine 130,000 job losses with the difficulty of getting products to market, you end up with an angry electorate.

A final factor in the increasing nastiness of this campaign is the spread of technology. Cellphones, Google, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram all leave trails to controversies, allowing candidates to be scrutinized more than ever before, and for the results, verified or not, to be disseminated as quickly as possible. It leads to a digital arms race in which one candidate is forced to resign or apologize, leading to attacks on the other side’s candidates.

But if the UCP wins, as it is expected to, its platform – one of repeal and confrontation – suggests the party’s governance style will probably be highly divisive. It will be opposed by an NDP that will not disappear – as has generally been the case with defeated governments in Alberta – and will instead be a formidable opposition, empowered by MLAs with government and cabinet experience.

But while still a majority, the number of university-education respondents who agreed dropped significantly, to just 51 per cent.

(Vote Compass)

Sixty-two per cent of men said they agree with holding a referendum, as did 51 per cent of women.

How does equalization work?

The program is intended to address fiscal disparities between provinces, and was entrenched in Canada's Constitution in 1982.

""Parliament and the government of Canada are committed to the principle of making equalization payments to ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation,"" the Constitution reads.

It's a myth that Alberta sends money directly to Ottawa for the program. All Canadians pay income tax to the federal government, and then that money is paid out to provinces based on each region's ability to raise revenues compared with the average.

The formula that calculates how much each province gets has been controversial due to how it accounts for natural resource revenues.

For decades, Alberta has received no federal support through equalization payments, while Quebec, for example, is set to receive $13.1 billion in 2019-20.

The payments are unconditional — meaning each province can spend the money it receives as it wishes.

A survey of 1,200 Albertans undertaken by pollster Janet Brown for CBC last spring found 70 per cent think the current equalization payment system is unfair. Half strongly felt it was unfair while, while 20 per cent ""somewhat"" agreed.

Where Alberta's political parties stand

UCP Leader Jason Kenney said he plans to hold a referendum on equalization as a way to hold Ottawa's feet to the fire over getting a coastal pipeline built.

Vote Compass found a whopping 82 per cent of UCP supporters agreed with that policy.

The NDP said in a press release in March that Kenney mischaracterizes how equalization works, and pointed out that Kenney was part of the Conservative government that brought in the current equalization formula in the 2007 budget. Only 32 per cent of NDP supporters said they wanted a referendum.

The party said it supports looking at the formula but believes a referendum would be a dead-end, and also suggested that one of the UCP's equalization proposals could make the Canada Health Act unenforceable in the province.

In June 2018, the federal government announced it would extend the current payment formula until 2024 without negotiating with the provinces, several politicians said. At the time, Alberta's finance minister stated the province's opposition to the decision.

The Liberal platform states that while the equalization formula isn't fair, a ""referendum"" would not give the province power to amend the Constitution.

Instead, the party says it will demand the formula be changed to treat provinces' hydro revenue the same as Alberta oil and gas, and that if those demands aren't met, a Crown corporation will be established to remove energy royalties from equalization formula calculations.

(Vote Compass)

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel has also said he plans to push for changes to what he called an ""unfair equalization program.""

And the Freedom Conservative Party plans to demand an end to equalization and replace all federal transfers with ""tax points.""

Thirty-eight per cent of Liberal supporters agreed with the idea of holding a referendum, as did 58 per cent of Alberta Party supporters. FCP supporters were not included in the Vote Compass data.

Canada's most populous province and industrial powerhouse is projected to run a deficit of C$10.3 ...","By Fergal Smith

TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario's Conservative government, presenting its first budget on Thursday, forecast a smaller deficit for the Canadian province in the current fiscal year and a return to balance by 2023-24 as it disclosed plans to reverse the growth in spending.

The Progressive Conservative Party, led by populist Doug Ford, won a majority of seats in last June's provincial election, promising greater fiscal prudence than the Liberal Party, which had held power for 15 years.

The budget ""sends a message to the world that we are serious about fiscal sustainability,"" Finance Minister Vic Fedeli told a media briefing.

Canada's most populous province and industrial powerhouse is projected to run a deficit of C$10.3 billion ($7.7 billion) in fiscal 2019-20, which began on April 1, including a C$1 billion reserve. That compares with an estimated deficit of C$11.7 billion in 2018-19.

The 2018-19 deficit was much more than the C$6.7 billion deficit projected by the Liberals in last year's budget, due mostly to accounting adjustments and the cancellation of a cap- and-trade carbon tax by the Conservatives.

But it was smaller than the C$13.5 billion deficit projected in February in a third-quarter update, while the 2023-24 projected timeline to eliminate the deficit was one year ahead of the Liberals' target.

That could soothe bond investors, who had been looking for evidence the Conservatives would tackle the province's heavy debt load. At about C$368 billion, estimated in 2018-19, Ontario has one of the largest sub-sovereign debts in the world.

The province, which has run deficits every year since 2008-09, pays more to borrow than some other major Canadian provinces, such as Quebec and British Columbia, that are running balanced budgets.

""I think it is positive from a market perspective,"" said Derek Burleton, deputy chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. ""The deficit implementation plan is reasonable, provided it can meet its targets. They are clearly ambitious on spending.""

SLOWER SPENDING GROWTH

The budget, which looked to expand the sale of alcohol and allow tailgating for sporting events, limited overall spending growth to an average annual rate of 1 percent between 2018-19 and 2023-24, much less than inflation.

It included lower spending on children's and social services even as the Conservatives proposed a new dental program for low-income seniors and a new refundable tax credit for childcare costs that would provide up to C$6,000 per child under the age of 7, and a lesser amount for older children.

Like the federal government, Ontario has favored faster write-offs of capital investments rather than corporate tax cuts to bolster competitiveness with the United States.

But a slowdown in the once red-hot housing market and global economic headwinds could increase the fiscal challenges for the province, which accounts for about 40 percent of Canada's economy and is a major exporter of cars and other manufactured products.

The budget projected growth to slow to 1.4 percent in 2019 from 2.2 percent in 2018, while net debt-to-GDP, a key measure of fiscal health, was estimated at 40.2 percent in 2018-19, the second highest among Canada's 10 provinces. It is projected to rise to 40.7 percent in 2019-20, before dipping to 38.6 percent in 2023-24.

Though the day highlighted the realization of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s promise to legalize cannabis during his 2015 campaign, neither he nor anyone else from the ruling Liberal party was out taking credit for it - a sign that the social stigma around marijuana is still strong.

“Canadians are accepting of legalization, but I don’t think they’re celebratory,” said Peter Donolo, a political strategist at Hill + Knowlton and communications director for former Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chretien.

Aside from difficulty keeping up with demand, legalization has gone smoothly. Online pot sales to adults began nationally on Oct. 17, but storefronts only opened in the province of Ontario, which includes the capital, on April 1.

Six months before a national election, polls show Liberals deadlocked or trailing the rival Conservative Party, and Trudeau is being cautious about weed.

Though Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has said he would not reverse legalization if elected, he has repeatedly expressed worries about safety - especially around people driving while high - and has said more young people might try marijuana now.

There are also some communities like the Vancouver suburb of Richmond, where 55 percent of the population list their ethnic origin as Chinese, which have prohibited cannabis storefronts.

“Legalization has gone well,” a government official said, but the issue is not a “primary focus”.

It is now safer to be a consumer because of regulation, the official said, adding that black market sales are falling and legal jobs and revenue are being created.

Interviews with customers and retailers at the Ottawa stores revealed that even if Trudeau is not talking about it, legalization has generated good will.

“I live close by and I’m excited to see how this store will change the neighborhood,” said Jessica, 23, who declined to give her last name. “I did not vote Liberal last time, but I might this time.”

Jessica was huddled close to an outdoor heater in front of the Fire & Flower store, which is just a 10-minute walk from both the prime minister’s office and parliament.

“We have a deep appreciation for the opportunity we’ve been granted,” said Michael Patterson, one of the shop’s two license holders.

Vivian Azer, a financial analysts who follows cannabis companies for Cowen and Company in New York, sees a bright future for Canada’s nascent marijuana industry.

She forecast cannabis retail sales reaching C$3.6 billion ($2.7 billion) in 2019, including taxes. Azer sees illicit sales declining to 11 percent of the total sales by 2025 from 90 percent last year.

By 2025, Canadian recreational weed revenue will total C$10 billion ($7.5 billion), with medical marijuana at C$2 billion ($1.5 billion), Azer estimates.

“The stigma is rolling away,” Azer said.

Cheralynn, 55, said the promise to legalize marijuana was one of the main reasons she voted for Trudeau in 2015.

“And I like Justin,” she said. “Most women do. He’s kinda cute.”","Canada's Trudeau isn't talking about it, but legal pot is going well",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKCN1RO1ZT-OCADN

In order to be eligible to register to vote a person ...,"

CTVNews.ca Staff, with a report from CTV's Alberta Bureau Chief Janet Dirks





Six days before Albertans are set to vote in their provincial election, voter fraud allegations are being levelled against UCP Leader Jason Kenney over his party’s 2017 leadership race.

The RCMP is looking into whether fake email addresses were linked to the names of real people to boost votes in a race that Kenney ultimately won.

Police investigators say they received the information from former UCP MLA Prab Gill. Now, the Office of the Alberta Election Commissioner is also looking into the allegations.

Gill alleges that the fake email addresses were used to intercept PIN codes needed for members to vote in the leadership race.

“(Some) people were signed up and were saying they weren't even members,” Gill alleges.

Kenney has always denied any wrongdoing in that leadership race.

Documents show two pages of names with allegedly fake email addresses attached. Among those names are Albertans Gurwinder Athwal and his wife Sarbjit. Although Athwal confirmed he voted online, his email address is different than the one on the list.

He told CTV News: “I don't know what's going on … nobody wants any trouble.”

Gill himself resigned from the party’s caucus after an internal investigation over allegations of ballot stuffing at that same leadership race.

In a portion of a written statement from the UCP executive, the party's executive director Janice Harrington dismissed the allegations, earlier reported by CBC News. She stressed the party was confident in the integrity of the results.

“We are not going to let allegations from discredited individuals like Happy Mann and Prab Gill distract us from our task of replacing the NDP with a government that will create jobs and get Albertans back to work,” she wrote.

“The entire leadership election process was monitored by the Leadership Election Committee, to which each leadership contestant had representation on, the party's contracted vote service provider, and an independent auditor. No irregularities were identified,” Harrington stated.

She also said the leadership contest “followed the most stringent security protocols of any leadership race conducted in Canada.”

Political scientist Duane Bratttold told CTV News that the allegations of voter fraud would continue long after the election.

“It will have an impact in the long run because there remains Elections Alberta investigation and RCMP investigation -- so I think this story is not going to end on April 16th,” he said. “Those investigations are going to continue.”

Statement from UCP Executive Director Janice Harrington:

The 2017 United Conservative party Leadership contest followed the most stringent security protocols of any leadership race conducted in Canada.

In order to be eligible to register to vote a person had to hold a valid membership on or before September 29, 2017.

Those members then had to register to vote on or before October 13, 2017.

The registration process required that every eligible member provide photo identification with a valid address that matched the address on their membership in order to obtain a PIN. A PIN was not issued unless the member provided the required photo identification.

PINs were delivered in the manner specified by each member at the time they provided their photo ID during the registration process.

The entire leadership election process was monitored by the Leadership Election Committee, to which each leadership contestant had representation on, the Party’s contracted vote service provider, and an independent auditor. No irregularities were identified.

Jason Kenney won the leadership of the United Conservative Party by a margin of 17,287 votes. The United Conservative Party is confident in the integrity of these results.

Good evening.

The Lead

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is criticizing the Trudeau government for introducing changes to the country’s asylum laws in its nearly 400-page long budget implementation bill without any advance notice, though stopped short of revealing where his party stands on the policy.

The proposed law would prevent asylum seekers from making claims in Canada if they have made similar ones in certain other countries, including the United States. Scheer said its inclusion in the omnibus legislation limits opportunities for study and debate.

“This is a measure that has been slipped into an omnibus bill, that will not be given the scrutiny it deserves on its own,” he told reporters Wednesday. Jolson Lim has more.

In Canada

Only days away from Alberta’s provincial election, CBC News says it has obtained documents showing email addresses fraudulently attached to United Conservative Party memberships were used to cast ballots in the party’s 2017 leadership race won by Jason Kenney.

From a list of over 100,000 UCP members, CBC News selected a sample of 49 email addresses due to “suspicious domains.” Of those, 31 were used to cast votes in the leadership vote. The email addresses were cross-referenced with a list of people registered to vote in the leadership race and a list of those who actually voted.

Former UCP MLA Prab Gill has made allegations in a letter to the RCMP that Kenney’s leadership campaign used fraudulent emails to intercept the personal identification numbers required to vote in the race and then used them to vote for Kenney.

Kenney’s lawyer Steven Dollansky, though, sent a cease and desist letter sent to Gill, calling the allegations “plainly false and defamatory.”

As if this election needed any more intrigue.

The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls says it will release its final report at a special closing ceremony on June 3. As the Toronto Star reports, the inquiry says the report is already complete and prepared for release before the deadline of April 30 but the federal government has agreed to an extension so it can be translated.

According to a release, the inquiry said the final report will reflect the “sacred truths” of 1,484 participants and 83 experts who testified at hearings and sessions held across the country in 2017 and 2018.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford is committing $11.2 billion to expanding rapid transit services for the Toronto area, including the proposed 15-kilometre light rail “Ontario Line” that would run from Ontario Place in the city’s waterfront to the Ontario Science Centre. As the CBC reports, the Ford government is pegging the cost of the four expansion projects at $26.7 billion, meaning the federal government and the City of Toronto (and likely the neighbouring York Region) would be on the hook for the remaining $17 billion or so.

Aside from the Ontario Line, which will supplant the proposed downtown relief line, the Ford government is committing money to expanding the proposed one-stop Scarborough subway to a three-stop line ($5.5 billion), extending the Yonge-University subway line to Richmond Hill ($5.6 billion) and extending the under-construction Eglinton light-rail line to Toronto Pearson International Airport ($4.7 billion).

As the Toronto Star’s Tonda McCharles reports, the transit proposal is not sitting well with a high-profile Liberal MP who previously served as a city councillor in Toronto.

Adam Vaughan, parliamentary secretary to the Families, Children and Social Development minister (Housing and Urban Affairs), likened the plan to a Simpsons episode, saying Ford took a crayon to draw a transit “fantasy” on a map through downtown Toronto without any consideration given to cost or environmental assessments.

McCharles also reports that Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Infrastructure Minister François-Phillippe Champagne both said Ottawa has already given billions to address infrastructure needs for Ontario, with Morneau saying they need more details on Ford’s plan.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has successfully moved a motion calling on the Senate to pass legislation harmonizing Canadian laws with the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and requiring sexual assault training for judges.

Singh rose in the House after question period Wednesday to ask his fellow MPs to support sending a message to the Upper Chamber calling for both bills to be “passed into law at the earliest opportunity.” It was unanimously adopted by the House.

Marco Vigliotti has more.

The secretive government committee tasked with studying national security and intelligence issues wants to complete a report assessing the threat of foreign interference in Canadian elections before this fall’s federal vote.

The threat of foreign interference in democratic election campaigns has loomed heavily since the 2016 U.S. presidential election, with Canada’s cyber security agency releasing a report earlier this week saying it expects foreign actors to attempt to tamper in the country’s next election.

The assessment being undertaken by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians is of generalized foreign interference and what measures are in place to counter it. Charlie Pinkerton has this story.

The parliamentary secretary to the public services and procurement minister recently released new numbers showing that nearly 75 per cent of federal public servants were overpaid at least once under the Phoenix system, reports CBC News.

Gatineau MP Steven MacKinnon released the statistics in mid-March in response to a question from Conservative public services critic Kelly McCauley. According to the figures, of the roughly 300,000 workers paid through Phoenix, 223,173 had been overpaid at least once between April 2016 and January 2019.

Long-serving Tory MP Rob Nicholson says he won’t seek re-election in this fall’s vote. The former justice minister said he wants to spend more time with his family after 24 non-consecutive years in Parliament.

“I have been truly blessed to have fulfilled my dream job of serving as a member of Parliament,” he said in a statement. Vigliotti also has this story.

Keeping on the topic of elections, a one-time star Quebec junior hockey player is taking a shot at federal politics.

Angelo Esposito, a former standout for the QMJHL’s Quebec Remparts, is running for the Conservatives in the Montreal-area riding of Alfred-Pellan this fall, reports TVA.

A first pick of the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2007, Esposito never played a game in the NHL and has worked in the real estate field since hanging up his skates at the end of the 2016-17 season. He will face off against Liberal incumbent Angelo Iacono in the riding, where the Tories finished fourth in 2015.

Nearly half of Canadians say they are struggling to pay their household grocery bill while almost two-thirds of Canadians say they are confused about what is a healthy diet, a new Angus Reid survey has found.

In an online poll, 47 per cent of respondents said “that they have had more difficulty affording food in the past year, with a significant level of uniformity seen across household income levels.” Kelsey Johnson has more details.

Meanwhile, an ongoing dispute between Canada and China over canola exports is unlikely to affect how this country’s grain-handling system operates, Canada’s grain monitor says.

“We were a little concerned about that as well,” Mark Hemmes, president of Quorum Corp., said when asked what effect the trade dispute could have on Canada’s grain transportation system. Johnson also has this one.

Internationally:

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears headed for a fourth consecutive term after yesterday’s close legislative election.

Both Netanyahu, leader of the main right-wing party in Israel, and Benny Gantz, the leader of the centrist Blue and White alliance, had initially told their supporters that they won the election.

But as the New York Times reports, Gantz has conceded the race as ballots continue to be counted. He vowed to fight on “in any way I can.”

“The war is not over,” he said.

Observers are also now watching to see if Netanyahu will actually commit to some of his statements during the campaign seen as efforts to win over right-wing voters, according to Al Jazeera. It includes annexing settlements in the West Bank.

“Who says that we won’t do it? We are on the way and we are discussing it,” Netanyahu said last week.

Less than a month after the Christchurch mosque attack, New Zealand’s parliament voted 119-1 to ban military-style semi-automatic weapons.

The country’s leader, Jacinda Ardern, announced swift action in the wake of the attack that left 50 people dead last month. As the BBC reports, she held back tears speaking to Parliament.

“These weapons were designed to kill, and they were designed to maim and that is what they did on the 15th of March,” she said.

A photo of a 22-year-old woman fearlessly speaking to a crowd of protesters holding smartphones in Sudan has captured global attention. As the New York Times reports, the photo of the woman, identified as Alaa Salah, is already being called the “image of the revolution.”

Demonstrations have intensified in Sudan as repressive leader Omar Al-Bashir refuses to step down for a transitional government after 30 years in power.

Meanwhile, tens of millions of people will cast their votes in the Indian general election beginning tomorrow. The election has seven phases, spread over more than a month, that will determine who will lead the world’s largest democracy.

As the BBC reports, more than 900 million people are eligible to vote between tomorrow and May 19. Counting day is May 23.

Narendra Modi, the current prime minister and leader of the Hindu nationalist party, will face off against a resurgent left-leaning Indian Congress led by Rahul Gandhi. Unemployment and economic development are among the core issues of this election.

Lastly, the United Kingdom holds its breath as Prime Minister Theresa May awaits a decision by EU countries to delay Brexit beyond this Friday. As the BBC reports, EU leaders are expected to extend beyond May’s desired date of June 30, but with conditions.

The Kicker:

Given some of our political and social debates, Wednesday offered a refreshing reminder that we are indeed living in the 21st century.

The National Science Foundation announced earlier today that scientists using a global network of telescopes captured the first-ever picture of a black hole. The image, which is the first direct visual evidence of the existence of black holes, shows a supermassive black hole and its shadow at the centre of a galaxy known as M87, reports CNN.

Thompson wanted to learn why, and spearheaded a task force that produced an internal party report ...","Armed with a sign that reads “Have Your Say Café,” Liberal candidate Allan Thompson pops into coffee shops that dot the nearly 6,000 square kilometres of the Huron-Bruce riding to hear from voters.

“I think we do need to do a better job of being present, being out in the community, listening to people — battle this sort of a stereotype that somehow rural communities are more conservative, because I just don’t think that’s true,” the former political reporter told Global News.

But Thompson knows better than anyone that past election results have painted a different picture: this is his second shot to steal the seat from third-term Conservative MP Ben Lobb. And the southwestern Ontario Huron-Bruce riding, and all those that surround it, have been blue for at least a decade.

WATCH: Longtime Conservative MP Larry Miller on whether there’s a secret to winning rural votes.

Thompson also knows a lot about the mindset of those rural voters, and not just because he grew up on a farm in the riding.

In 2015, the Liberals won a sweeping majority across the country in large part due to their success in urban centres. But they didn’t fare well in more traditional Conservative territory: small-town, rural Canada.

Thompson wanted to learn why, and spearheaded a task force that produced an internal party report on how the Liberals could do better in Southwestern Ontario and beyond.

WATCH: Courting the country voter: what the urban/rural divide means at the polls

“One of the things we suggested was we should be more present. People should see their prime minister and cabinet ministers in rural settings, and we’ve seen a lot of that,” he said. (Thompson said Justin Trudeau’s visit to the International Plowing Match in 2017 was the first by a prime minister since Louis St. Laurent.)

In January, Trudeau created a new ministry with rural voters in mind, naming Nova Scotia MP Bernadette Jordan Minister for Rural Economic Development. That was another recommendation from Thompson’s report.

WATCH: PM Justin Trudeau put on his farmer hat at the International Plowing Match in Walton, Ont. (2017)

“It’s my campaign slogan but it’s also my motto — I really do think our political leadership needs to be reminded over and over and over that a quarter of Canadians live in a rural setting.” “And every time we’re making any decision, somebody has to be at the table to say, ‘OK that’s great, but what will that mean for people who live in a rural community?’” Thompson said.

The difference between rural and urban voters

Some of Thompson’s potential electors say they do feel forgotten by the Liberal government, and most told Global News they’ve long voted Conservative.

“I find that the Liberals just seem to focus more on the big city,” said Sarah Fagan in Goderich, Ont.,’s downtown.

“A lot of the issues that they deal with are Toronto issues and it’s not helpful to us. Any of the high-speed transportation systems, none of the stations ever get up here,” Fagan said.

One riding away to the north, longtime and popular Conservative MP Larry Miller said there’s no magic to winning the rural vote, but there are differences between urban and rural voters.

And transit is a good example.

“I totally get why transit is important, especially in larger cities, but not only is it not expected up in rural parts like Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound. … It’s just not practical,” Miller told Global News at his home just outside Wiarton.

“There’s no way that transit is going to work for me out here, and I don’t want it anyway, you know. So there’s a lot of those issues that, you know, we just don’t expect them. Ambulance, police — we know it’s going to take longer for them to get to our place and we’re OK with that.”

Miller said country voters are drawn to his party in part because of the Conservative focus on fiscal responsibility.

“We know government has to provide some services for us and that’s normal but outside of that, get out of our face and let us live our lives,” Miller said.

Very popular among voters and in his Conservative caucus, this will be Miller’s last term — he’s decided to retire after nearly 30 years in politics.

But he’s not worried about his riding swinging red. (He stole it from a Liberal back in 2004.)

“Not a chance,” Miller said.

“I can thank Justin Trudeau for that, because if there was any kind of doubt or chance in some people’s minds to vote Liberal, everything that he did here in the past couple months has totally taken that away.”

(Several of the people Global News stopped to chat politics with across Southwestern Ontario raised the handling of the SNC-Lavalin scandal as a concern, without being asked about it specifically.)

Allan Thompson hopes to land a seat for the first time by telling voters Conservatives aren’t actually in step with rural voters.

“Their definition of rural is somehow different. It’s got a slight anti-immigrant tinge and not as much focus on socially progressive issues,” Thompson said.

Helping others in need is a “core rural value,” Thompson said. “Somebody can show up at your door in a snowstorm and get a meal or a coffee or stay the night. That’s a core value that came from the pioneer and that corresponds pretty well with a lot of what the Liberal party advocates about looking out for people who are in need,” Thompson said.

In his campaign, he wants to counter stereotypes of the idyllic country lifestyle, and he thinks voters are ready to talk about that.

“There’s a lot of poverty in rural communities. It’s very striking when you knock on doors,” Thompson said. “Seniors in need, people who are homeless or live in substandard housing conditions, people who are dealing with addiction with mental health issues — those things can all be even more difficult to deal with when you’re in a rural setting.”

A question of relevance

Since the Liberals were able to win a majority in 2015 without winning rural voters, is their vote really necessary in 2019?

“Rural areas aren’t going to be as important as say, the 905 [vote-rich, battleground suburban area surrounding Toronto] or Toronto, and I think that’s just a function of the population shifting from rural communities to urban ones, and I think that’s just a demographic challenge,” said Earnscliffe strategist Rob Leone.

Leone understands the challenge well. He’s a former Conservative member of provincial parliament for the riding of Cambridge, which includes that city but also a wide rural area, such as Ayr, where he calls home.

“It’s a whole electoral map,” said Leone, speaking of the federal election. “And I think there is a lot of strategy that goes into who’s going to win where and where are your strengths and where are your weaknesses.”

On the flipside, for Conservatives looking to fare better in big cities, Leone said they need to tackle both policy and demographic issues.

“Certainly, younger people, more educated people, tend to live in urban areas, and right now it seems the Liberals are doing a better job of attracting those kinds of voters to their fold.”

“The Liberals are making a big play on multiculturalism and diversity. Those are the kinds of ideas that are resonating among urban voters right now, and if the Conservatives want to tie into that, they certainly have to look at how they’re going to address those policy concerns for voters,” Leone said.

Back in the countryside, Allan Thompson said thinking about the rural vote means thinking beyond the polls.

“Yes, you’re trying to win. But I think you’re also trying to make sure that you properly represent Canadians across the board. And I don’t think a government can effectively do its job if it is not hearing from the 25 per cent of Canadians who live in rural communities.”

Rural campaigning is more costly and time-consuming, with no high-rise buildings where hundreds of doors and voters can be reached much faster, for example.

“Where are most of the votes in this country? They are in big urban centres. It’s actually a lot of work and it’s a bit more expensive to get off the 401 and get out to rural communities and hear what people have to say,” Thompson said.

WATCH: Ontario does not want cities to get infrastructure funding, Trudeau says

As a result, rural concerns are not always heard “in the corridors of power,” Thompson said.

It’s an area where he and Conservative Larry Miller agree.

“Rural voters, if they’re not aware of that or not ticked off about it, they should be,” Miller said.

“They basically just take us for granted — ‘We’re not gonna win it anyways, so why would we pour money in there?’”

“And that’s another thing that divides or pounds a wedge between [rural and urban voters] — ‘So you’re not even going to give me infrastructure for highway projects or whatever, but you’re going to take my tax dollars and spend it in foreign countries and in other crazy ways that rural Canada gets absolutely no benefit from?’ — And that one there really sticks in the craw of rural people,” Miller said.

As he reflects back on nearly 30 years in politics, Miller attributes his own success to staying true to his roots.

“I’ve made a very conscious effort to make sure I never forgot where I came from. … I know that people appreciate that. You know, I love hockey, I love to hunt, I love all sports, love the outdoors. … I know lots of politicians, that if they hunted, they wouldn’t say a word about it because it may be unpolitically correct or politically unpopular or whatever. I don’t care about that.”

“What you see with me is what you get. And I’m very proud of my rural roots and what I do,” Miller said.

And that’s his outgoing advice for all politicians, of any political stripe, and whether aiming to woo voters in cities or towns: don’t forget where you came from.",IN-DEPTH: Courting country voters ahead of election 2019,Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5156380/rural-vs-urban-voters-canada/

There seemed to be something to wind everyone up as we enter the final stretch of a provincial election both sides have characterized as an epochal event sure to seal the fate of the province if it goes the wrong way.

This may have been only the anger-magnifying tendency of social media, or the “friends” and “followers” I have accumulated over the years, but I can’t ever recall seeing so many people on both sides of a political division so wound up.

There is a fringe of the Alberta right that has always been furious about pretty well everything, of course. They were enraged by the NDP’s surprise victory in May 2015 and they have been enraged about it ever since. Their fury was ratcheted up even more when Premier Rachel Notley didn’t just roll over and concede victory to the Opposition but fought back with an aggressive campaign of her own.

Still, most Albertans have been capable over the years of engaging in civil discourse when it comes to politics. This was not so evident last night, with only four more sleeps till voting day. The proximate cause, I think, was two things:

One is the sense among supporters of the NDP Government that weeks of bozo eruptions by United Conservative Party candidates and evidence of sketchy ethical practices and possibly outright illegalities by UCP activists associated with Leader Jason Kenney’s 2017 leadership campaign have had little impact on the Opposition party’s strong lead in public opinion.

The other was the news story yesterday that RCMP officers with a search warrant had swooped in late Thursday on the Calgary auto-repair business of Peter Singh, the UCP’s candidate in Calgary-East, and removed a computer hard drive, “other electronic devices,” and a suitcase.

The Mounties were tight lipped about the nature of the investigation. Mr. Singh, apparently, was nowhere to be found, although he said in a written statement the police had returned his computer. When a reporter tried to question Mr. Kenney about it, an aide pushed the door shut in her face. The details are murky. Conspiracy theories abound, especially on the right.

Last year the Calgary Herald reported allegations Mr. Singh “used at least one local resident’s credit card to advance his nomination campaign.”

According to the CBC, the UCP had earlier investigated allegations of bribery and fraud related to Mr. Singh’s nomination, but found no proof and cleared him.

Meanwhile, advance polls have been setting records. With well over 400,000 votes cast, turnout has been significantly higher in the first three days of advance polling than in all advance polls in 2015, when 162,000 advance ballots were cast. About 2.6 million Albertans are registered to vote. Today is the last day for advance polling.

Political scientists say this may not mean much – it’s easier this time to cast an advance ballot, thanks to new voting rules. But it is one more factor winding politically engaged Albertans up.

I suspect this is a sign of things to come, and not just in Alberta. We have already seen like things happen in the United States, driven by the Trump Republicans but embraced by their Democratic Party rivals.

Since anger and an appeal to the worst instincts of the base worked for the Republicans, you can count on it that their Conservative brethren in Alberta and Canada are not just paying close attention, but dealing with the same consultants.

Political parties on the centre and left, such as there is a left in Canada any more, will have no choice but to respond in kind, and so they will.

Indeed, Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, anxious to recover from his own self-inflicted political wounds, appeared to be testing an aggressive campaign strategy of his own on Thursday, lumping federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and Ontario Premier Doug Ford in with alt-right conspiracy theorists, racists and religious bigots.","RCMP raid on UCP candidate’s business, polling trends, hordes of advance voters wind up the Internet",Alberta Politics,https://albertapolitics.ca/2019/04/rcmp-raid-on-ucp-candidates-business-polling-trends-hordes-of-advance-voters-wind-up-the-internet/

Gar Gar told HuffPost Canada he was door-knocking in Calgary's Penbrooke neighbourhood on Wednesday when he ran into a man and a woman who said they supported his campaign. The man told Gar he wanted him to meet his mother and took the candidate back to their house.

Gar said she, too, was a supporter and was interested in a lawn sign.

""Everything went fine. I installed it for her and screwed it in,"" he said.

""We were about to go to my car, me and my wife, and I heard somebody calling me from my back and say 'hey, you, come back',"" said Gar.

The candidate said he thought it was another voter who wanted to speak about the election, but he quickly noticed the man's body language as he approached.

""Just mad. Bursting,"" Gar said, adding that he started filming when he realized something serious could happen.

The man told Gar he was the landlord of the property and didn't want the signs on his lawn.

Wanting to de-escalate the situation, Gar said he was about to offer to remove the sign when the man decided to ""take matters into his own hands.""

""Everything just happened so fast, this guy just burst in ... took [the sign] out, ripped it and said here you go,"" he said.

Election Act outlines tenants' rights

In the video he shared on Twitter, Gar can be heard asking about the woman's rights since — as several users on the social network pointed out — Alberta's Election Act prohibits landlords or condo boards from preventing tenants from displaying election advertising material.

Gar said he could ""sense the fear"" from the renters, that they wanted to avoid any problems for their living situation.

She later came to him and said that they still supported Gar. But he said she spoke in a lower voice, as if she didn't want the landlord to hear her.

""She was saying 'I'm so sorry.' She shouldn't be the one saying sorry.""

Gar said he's running in Alberta's election to help fight what he calls a stigma between renters and homeowners. He said some voters, like the woman on that lawn, might ""fear"" casting a ballot because they believe they can't make a difference.

""For every poster that goes down, it's a slap in the face to donors who believed in us. The people that go out and vote.""

This isn't the first time that Gar's election material has been damaged. Last month, he found one of his posters defaced with the phrase ""vote for your future.""

The 35-year-old Calgary resident is a “fiscal conservative” who favours low taxes and less regulation in the economy. She is no New Democrat. In fact, she grew up in B.C. and for years worked in politics as an aide to BC Liberals like Naomi Yamamoto, Ida Chong and Moira Stilwell.

Elder-Chamanara thinks the United Conservative Party candidate in her riding would make a good MLA. But she’s worried that with UCP leader Jason Kenney as Alberta premier, progress for LGBTQ people and women’s reproductive rights could be set back decades.

“As much as I like my candidate, a vote for him is a vote for Kenney, and I can’t do that,” she told The Tyee.

Elder-Chamanara was horrified when audio clips surfaced of UCP candidate Mark Smith comparing homosexuality to paedophilia and scorning women who choose to have abortions.

And she was disgusted when star UCP candidate Caylan Ford was revealed to have compared LGBTQ pride parades to “a celebration of vice and transgression,” and lamented “the demographic replacement of white peoples in their homelands.”

Elder-Chamanara isn’t sure if Kenney truly rejects what candidates like these stand for.

In a video from 2000, Kenney bragged to Canadian Alliance supporters that during his student activist days in San Francisco he helped overturn a law allowing benefits to same-sex couples — this, at the height of the AIDS crisis.

“Sure, there are things that I’ve done and said in my life that I regret,” Kenney later said. His campaign turned down The Tyee’s request for an interview.

Though Kenney condemned Ford’s comments about white nationalism and accepted her resignation, Ford was replaced with Jeremy Wong, an ordained minister and a pastor who is accused of supporting gay conversion therapy (which Wong denies).

After Smith’s comments questioning whether “homosexual love is good love” became public, Kenney rejected pressure to remove Smith from the party. Nor, when it came to light that Smith had pushed for Christian schools to be able to fire teachers for being gay, did Kenney waver in his support. Smith has been touted to be the UCP’s education minister.

In a Global News Radio interview last week, host Charles Adler asked Kenney, “Why are so many people who bash gays, and bash women, why are so many people who bash Muslims, attracted to the United Conservative Party?”

Kenney responded, “Charles, I reject that.”

So when two UCP volunteers recently showed up at Elder-Chamanara’s door, she said she asked them directly “how they were personally able to reconcile the [hateful] things that have been said with the need in my mind for balanced budgets and fiscal pragmatism?”

The doorknockers replied that “‘we’re not allowed to talk about this, we’re only allowed to talk about economic issues,’” she said.

A UCP spokesperson wrote to The Tyee that “No, there is no truth to this.”

Tensions within Albertan conservatism

The tension that Elder-Chamanara feels between her fiscal beliefs and her social conscience appears to be common these days in Alberta. “I’ve heard that anecdote over and over,” Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Calgary’s Mount Royal University, told The Tyee.

It’s not clear whether UCP candidates’ extreme positions on social issues are hurting the party, which has made repealing Alberta’s carbon tax and boosting the province’s oil sands economy central to its messaging.

A poll released April 5 showed Kenney’s UCP leading Rachel Notley’s NDP by nine points and by slightly more in crucial Calgary. That gap halves the one found by a different poll released just two days earlier.

Still, Bratt reflects the consensus that the UCP will form a majority government. Albertans, and all Canadians, he said, should be prepared “for a much more socially conservative party than we have seen in the mainstream of Alberta for a very long time.”

He added, “There is concern in the gay community and the women’s rights community that a lot of the protections that have been built up over the years... are going to be rolled back by Jason Kenney.”

‘I’m very scared’

Dylan Chevalier thinks that he and other LGBTQ people he knows in Alberta are being used as pawns in Kenney’s election strategy. The 20-year-old executive director of the group Sexual and Gender Acceptance Edmonton last month joined hundreds of people for a demonstration outside the Alberta legislature.

They were protesting a UCP policy that Chevalier believes could put young people in danger. “I’m very scared for myself and what will happen to the LGBTQ community if this party forms government,” he told The Tyee.

The UCP platform calls for the rules around gay-straight alliances in Alberta schools to be amended. Normally, students are free to set up and join these alliances, which exist for people to socialize and be open in their sexuality, without anyone at home knowing. Kenney wants to make it so that teachers have the option of informing people’s parents.

“I think it would be very rare,” Kenney said.

To Chevalier, who ran a GSA when he attended Ross Sheppard High School in Edmonton, this undermines the entire thing. “The whole purpose of a gay-straight alliance is so you can be safe — you’re not going to be outed to anyone, you don’t have to worry,” he said. “The student could be in an unsafe environment at home if they came out.”

He suspects that the only reason Kenney is making this an election issue at all is because of pressure from within the UCP. At a party convention in 2018, delegates voted in favour of informing parents about gay-straight alliance membership. Kenney opposed it.

“Let me be absolutely stone-cold clear: a United Conservative government will not be changing law or policy to require notification of parents when kids join GSAs,” he promised at the time.

Chevalier argued Kenney reversed that position on GSAs in order “to appease hardcore social conservatives” and now LGBTQ youth in Alberta have to bear the consequences.

Those consequences, tweeted one gay Albertan, could be life and death.

If a politician or school official had outed me to my father as a youth I would not be here now. That is the reality for many queer kids. What @jkenney and the #UCP are suggesting is inhuman. #abpoli — Brad Fraser (@fraser_brad) March 26, 2019

Kenney has attempted to present a moderate face by supporting Pride events last year in Edmonton and Calgary. A conservative organization known as LGBTory last year called Kenney “an ally,” claiming “there are few politicians in this country who have done as much as he has for the Canadian and global LGBTQ+ community.”

But Chevalier isn’t buying it. “He’s very clearly still homophobic,” Chevalier said. “We have a party that stands by absolutely disgusting candidates.” If the UCP wins the election, Chevalier argues, Kenney will no longer face the same electoral pressures to condemn hateful remarks and actions within the party. “They will have four years to do whatever they want,” he said.

Investigating Kenney’s past

Taylor Lambert isn’t convinced when Kenney says his views on abortion and same-sex marriage have softened since his student days as a hard-line religious activist in San Francisco. Lambert, a freelance journalist based in Calgary, told The Tyee his scepticism is rooted in basic journalistic principles. “It’s not specific to Jason Kenney — it’s true of any leader,” he said. “You have to look at their background, where they came from, and their past words and deeds.”

In January, Lambert flew to San Francisco for an independent Calgary media outlet called the Sprawl to learn more about Kenney’s history — and what Lambert found adds important context to the story the UCP leader has been telling Albertans.

Kenney has said several times that in addition to his early religious activism he spent time helping people with HIV/AIDS, once explaining in a video that “this is a disease I first saw first-hand volunteering at a hospice in San Francisco back in the 1980s.” Kenney was referring to the Gift of Love Hospice, where Catholic missionaries provided assistance to homeless men. “I was transformed,” he has said.

Lambert learned that the Gift of Love Hospice, which no longer exists, was not well known in San Francisco’s LGBTQ community. A Los Angeles Times story from 1990 suggested that the sisters who worked there expressed “discomfort or disapproval” towards gay people. “The overall impression is of a miserable place oriented less towards the comfort and care of the dying than to a religious notion of suffering for salvation,” Lambert wrote.

In a “fact-check” issued by the UCP in response to the Sprawl’s reporting, Kenney doesn’t directly address Lambert’s characterization of the hospice. Kenney argues that looking at his past makes him “realize how much my views have changed over the decades, which I think is normal for most people as they mature.”

Lambert said it’s unclear how many people across the province accept the UCP leader’s assurances. “Do you as a voter, and do we as Albertans, believe that Jason Kenney has renounced those views, or is this a transformation of political convenience?” he said.

‘What the hell is that? That’s not conservative’

The balancing act Kenney conducts in holding together his coalition of oil patch boosters with tolerant social views, and fervent foes of abortion and LGBTQ rights, is made clear by speaking with Jack Fonseca. If Kenney has genuinely moderated his positions on social issues, that makes Fonseca angry.

Fonseca is director of political operations for Campaign Life Coalition, a national anti-abortion and social conservative advocacy group which several years ago gave Kenney a “pro-life” rating, explaining “Jason had a 100 per cent, perfect voting record on life & family issues throughout his long career in the House of Commons.”

But since then the group’s opinion of Kenney has soured. “We’ve been terribly let down,” Fonseca told The Tyee.

Campaign Life Coalition was not pleased when Kenney initially questioned the UCP resolution informing parents about teens joining gay-straight alliances. And the group didn’t it like when Kenney participated in a UCP Pride breakfast last summer. “What the hell is that?” Fonseca said. “That’s not conservative.”

Campaign Life Coalition still thinks Kenney is useful to the social conservative movement. It argued that Kenney’s announcement about parental notifications for GSAs is “a step in the right direction, but does not take the UCP nearly far enough down the road to total freedom from the gay lobby’s chokehold on Alberta families.”

Fonseca thinks the UCP should entirely repeal legislation supporting gay-straight alliances in schools. He said Campaign Life Coalition and its allies plan to keep pushing Kenney to take action on this and other issues important to his social conservative base. “This is a very important election,” Fonseca said. “Parents and families and voters in general of Alberta need to put pressure on him.”

They will be joined by the Wilberforce Project, an anti-abortion group based in Edmonton. “As it stands, if the UCP wins the upcoming election, then we will have the most pro-life legislature in decades, and maybe ever,” the group wrote on its website in February. “We now need to keep the candidates who won their nominations accountable and on track to enacting pro-life policy.”

A UCP spokesperson wrote to The Tyee that “Jason Kenney has been clear that he won’t be re-opening these contentious debates.”

‘Footsy with freaks’

And yet Kenney’s campaigning remains familiar to people who have long watched his career. He may speak publicly against bigotry and intolerance, but he does far less than he could to purge his party of such elements.

Extreme social conservatives wondering if they are welcome in the UCP, therefore, need merely note who remains in their midst as party members and candidates. They can take comfort, as well, in Kenney’s past record in Alberta.

That record makes it impossible to accept that Kenney is some recent arrival surprised to find extremist elements clinging to him. Instead, Kenney cut his political teeth in Alberta. It’s where he learned how to win by explicitly courting the most deeply social conservative voters.

In 2000, a new right-wing populist federal party, the Canadian Alliance, had evolved from the Reform Party founded and headed by Preston Manning. Now a contest to lead the party was underway, pitting Manning against the Pentecostal Stockwell Day, who as an Alberta government minister had advocated denying LGBTQ people protections under the province’s human rights code.

Kenney abandoned campaigning for his mentor Manning to drum up votes for Day. Why?

As a 2014 Walrus profile recounts, Day “had earned the allegiance of fellow social conservatives by attempting to end provincial funding for abortion... Like all leadership contests, the Alliance race came down to which candidate could sign up the most new members. Manning discovered that Kenney was trolling for Day supporters at evangelical and Catholic churches, and on the website of the anti-abortion lobby Campaign Life Coalition, a practice Manning adamantly opposed.”

Day won, and became Canada’s opposition leader. He named Kenney his finance critic.

In November 2016, as Kenney made his move to unite the right in Alberta by folding the Progressive Conservative party into the more hard-right Wild Rose party, he bussed in hundreds of male students from Christian colleges to a PC policy forum in Red Deer.

According to Alberta Views magazine:

“Immediately after the policy forum, Calgary MLA and PC leadership candidate Sandra Jansen resigned from the race, citing aggressive and sexually charged verbal and written harassment during the Red Deer convention — abuse that often focused on her support for women’s reproductive rights. ‘My presence in this race has so enraged a socially regressive element,’ she said in an email to supporters, ‘that I fear it will take away from our ability to fight what is turning out to be a very hostile takeover attempt on the party.’” The only other female among the six PC candidates resigned, too.

Four months later, Kenney was elected leader of the PC party and given a mandate to forge unity with Wild Rose, which produced the Kenney-led UCP.

Last October, Kenney was forced to expel a UCP member for his white supremacist views. Kenney said he’d had no idea, though the man had run the call centre for his leadership campaign. Kenney’s former conservative opponent for the UCP leadership implored in a tweet that Kenney “stop playing footsy with freaks.”

The #UCP and @jkenney need to kick these weirdos out of the party for the sake of decency. They should never have been there in the first place. There is no place for hate and bigotry in our society or political landscape. Stop playing footsy with freaks! #ableg — Brian Jean (@BrianJeanAB) October 30, 2018

A few days ago, I checked back with Elder-Chamanara. Since we’d last spoken, the number of Kenney’s UCP party candidates espousing bigoted or hateful views had grown and continued to mount. Elder-Chamanara sent me links to three fresh “eruptions,” including one involving UCP candidate Travis Toews.

Toews, as it turns out, is also the director of an Alberta private Christian college whose handbook explains that “all sexual activity is designed by God to be used in the context of marriage between a man and woman.” The school therefore had banned not only all other types of sexual activity, but “spell casting, sorcery or demonic association.” Also yoga.

The news about Toews was just breaking. For Elder-Chamanara, was it hard to keep track of it all?

“Sadly, yes,” she said. “That alone says something about what’s happening here.”",‘Footsy with Freaks’: How Kenney Makes Room for Bigots in His Party,The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/04/08/How-Jason-Kenney-Makes-Room-Bigots/
97,LifeStyle,2019-04-13T01:44:00.0000000Z,"EDMONTON — Albertan workers contribute far more to the Canada Pension Plan than its ... at a time when Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party is planning, if it wins the election on April ...","EDMONTON — Albertan workers contribute far more to the Canada Pension Plan than its retirees take out, says a new Fraser Institute study, suggesting the rest of the country benefits greatly from the prosperity in Wild Rose Country.

The report comes at a time when Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party is planning, if it wins the election on April 16, to pick a fight over equalization payments, another federal program to which Albertans contribute disproportionately.

Unlike equalization, though, provinces can opt out of participation in the CPP; Quebec already has.

In 2017, 16.5 per cent of all CPP contributions came from Alberta workers, while just 10.6 per cent of CPP expenditures made their way back to the province. The difference between what was paid in and paid out was $2.9 billion in 2017, the most recent year for which data are available. (Alberta paid in $8.1 billion and received $5.2 billion.) Between 2008 and 2017, Albertans have contributed $27.9 billion more to CPP than retirees in the province have received back.

“What we were trying to do is really use a case study to illustrate the disproportionate contributions Albertans make to national programs,” said Jason Clemens, one of the study’s authors, in an interview on Tuesday.

Ontario is the next highest contributing province in Canada. Over the same period, from 2008 to 2017, Ontario paid in $7.4 billion more than it received back — more than $20 billion less than the loss in Alberta, and that’s in a province with more than 14 million people, compared to Alberta’s roughly four million.

However, Ontario’s fortunes turned around in 2017. The province contributed about $24 billion, but received back about $25 billion.

British Columbia paid in $8.2 billion in 2017, and received back $8 billion.

Were Alberta to drop out of the CPP — which Clemens says they’re not recommending — other provinces would have to pick up the slack by raising individual contribution rates. Were the province to withdraw, Albertans could pay as low as 5.85 per cent into an Alberta pension plan, while the rest of the country would need to up their contributions from 9.9 per cent (the 2017 contribution rate) to 10.6 per cent, the study says. The federal government already raised the contribution rate (shared equally by employers and employees) to 10.2 per cent in January, and plan to increase it to 11.9 per cent by 2023.

There are three main reasons why Albertans pay more into CPP than what retirees get out of it. More Albertans are of working age — between 15 and 64 — compared to the province’s overall population, than in other provinces in Canada.

Among that group, there are traditionally higher employment rates in Alberta. “Which means they have a higher share of the population that’s working,” Clemens said.

And, as is a partial explanation for higher equalization contributions, Albertans simply make more money than workers in other provinces, so the province has more contributions per worker. What the study does, Clemens said, is point out to the rest of Canada the contributions Alberta makes to federal programming, and it helps explain why Albertans feel left behind by the federal government and other provinces.

“The hope would be back to the discussion of, there’s a give and take,” Clemens said. “The rising frustration in Western Canada, particularly in Alberta, is legitimate, in terms of what is the balance right now of the give and take?”

“This is really happening. We need to prepare.” Albertans are the least likely in Canada to believe in climate change — last year, a poll by Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission, an independent economics organization, found 52 per cent of Albertans see conclusive or solid evidence that the Earth is warming. Sixteen per cent said there’s little or no proof, the highest rate of any province, the poll found. The same poll showed that 46 per cent of the Albertans who believed climate change was happening thought it was due to natural patterns, not human activity.

“So many livelihoods in Alberta are tied to fossil fuels,” said Marshall. “Anything that threatens that industry is going to be really controversial.” Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is one climate change-related goal, but it’s also past time to begin preparing for the impacts to come, Marshall added. For Alberta, that means projects aimed at mitigating future droughts, floods and wildfires — especially as Canada is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world, according to an Environment Canada report released earlier this month.

“The writing’s on the wall,” said Marshall.

Very few discussions about climate change-related infrastructure have happened during this election campaign. One notable exception is flood mitigation in Calgary — and more specifically, the Springbank dam. The NDP has consistently supported the dam, which would divert water from the Elbow River 15 kilometres west of Calgary into a dry reservoir that would store water during a flood. (The NDP has also pledged to spend $1 billion on other mitigation along the Bow River.) The Alberta Party has also supported the Springbank dam. Less clear is the UCP’s stance — though Kenney has promised to support it if elected, the party’s candidate for the area, Miranda Rosin of Banff-Kananaskis, has opposed it. The NDP has also proposed to build a second highway into Fort McMurray. It could serve as another escape route in the case of a catastrophic wildfire, allowing the city to avoid the clogged roads that hampered evacuation efforts in 2016. But in terms of policy aimed at saving Albertans from climate change-related disaster, that’s about it. “Responsible policy and governance (for climate change) involves thinking long-term,” said Marshall, adding that governments must look ahead as far as 2080. “I feel like we don’t see very much of that because politics and governance are really a fist fight for the current time.” And so, the centrepieces of the four major parties’ climate change plans have been their takes on the carbon tax, a policy the governing NDP introduced in 2017. Right now, Albertans pay $30 per tonne of carbon used, an added cost, for example, of about seven cents per litre on gasoline.

Carbon taxes are a global best practice for tackling climate change, said Brendan Boyd, an assistant professor at MacEwan University who studies climate change policy. But they can also be quite unpopular, requiring politicians to balance stringent rules with the need to make them publicly acceptable. “Support for the carbon tax is definitely low in Alberta compared to the rest of the country,” Boyd said. “Even though it might never be a really, really popular policy, there are different ways that you can design it to make it more politically palatable.” One of those ways would be making it revenue-neutral, meaning all of the money generated is returned to taxpayers through rebates or other tax cuts, Boyd said. The Alberta Liberal Party has proposed a plan along those lines. Another way could be narrowing the pool of people who have to pay the carbon levy — the Alberta Party, for example, has proposed exempting homes, businesses, farms, and non-profits. Though, of course, the fewer people who have to pay the tax, the smaller the reduction in emissions. The United Conservatives, meanwhile, have pledged to scrap the carbon tax entirely if elected. Though that would likely mean Albertans would have to pay a federally imposed carbon tax, the UCP has also promised it would take that fight to court. Alberta also has a program targeting large industrial emitters — it has existed in some form since 2007, but a stronger version took effect under the NDP in 2018.

The UCP has proposed replacing the carbon tax with a weaker version of the large emitters program called TIER, the Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction fund. As with the current NDP plan, a portion of the revenues would fund research aimed at reducing emissions — though the NDP plan allocates more money for that purpose. But such a plan might not reduce overall emissions and is “less stringent” than the current version, Boyd said. The UCP plan only requires companies to reduce emissions compared to their overall production, so as long as they’re getting more efficient, their emissions could actually increase. “Environmental groups have typically been opposed to that because it doesn’t actually set an absolute cap on emissions,” said Boyd. “Industry likes it, because that means they can continue to produce without having to worry about limiting their production.” When the large emitters program was first introduced, it was a progressive, incremental step toward broader carbon pricing, Boyd said. And for a province like Alberta, where a significant chunk of greenhouse gas emissions come from large, industrial polluters, it can make a dent. However, research has advanced since then. We now know that carbon taxes don’t have a hugely negative economic impact when done right, and most jurisdictions that are trying to address climate change have gone that route instead, Boyd said. “In a lot of people’s opinions, (the UCP plan) will be seen as a step back,” said Boyd. None of the parties’ plans are stringent enough to help Alberta meet its international climate targets, Boyd said. However, the targets matter less than figuring out how to reduce emissions in a way that’s both effective and popular enough for governments to enact it. “We sometimes get hung up, I think, a little bit too much on the specific targets,” Boyd said. “(Policy is) not useful if no one’s willing to accept it and no government will put it in place.”

Carbon pricing isn’t the only factor in regulating emissions. The UCP has also pledged to get rid of an NDP cap on emissions from the oilsands, and to allow coal-fired plants to keep operating past 2023 (the NDP had planned to phase them out). When it comes to renewable energy, the UCP has promised to cut NDP subsidies on solar power, saying it believes the market can support solar projects on its own. Though ending the subsidies wouldn’t exactly support the transition to renewable energy, Boyd said such a move probably wouldn’t hamper it either. “Part of that is market-driven, so as long as the price comes down and it becomes an effective, competitive fuel source for electricity, it may continue on regardless of what government is in power.” Marshall said Alberta has a lot of potential to become a future centre for renewable fuel production, if people are willing to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels. But that can’t happen if climate change threatens our water supply, or if our province is choked by wildfire smoke — things everyone in Alberta should want to avoid, he said. “It’d be nice if we started thinking about opportunity instead of entrenching in what made us wealthy,” Marshall said. “There’s so much opportunity here ... I’m sad that it’s such a partisan issue.” Emma McIntosh is an environment, justice and investigative reporter with Star Calgary. Follow her on Twitter at @EmmaMci

FORT MCMURRAY, Alta. – United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney took his pro-pipeline message to the heart of Alberta’s oilpatch Wednesday and promised to push back on policies he said are hollowing out Canada’s core industry.

Kenney told supporters at a rally in Fort McMurray that a UCP government would fight B.C. and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government if they continued to impede the oil sector.

Kenney has promised he would go to court to fight proposed federal legislation on how projects are assessed as both unconstitutional and as a major deterrent to future megaprojects.

He has also said he would proclaim legislation giving Alberta the power to reduce oil shipments to B.C. if that province continued to delay the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Alberta to the west coast.

Premier Rachel Notley has criticized Kenney’s approach as needlessly antagonistic and has said his plans could see Trans Mountain derailed just as shovels are ready to turn the ground on the pipeline.

Kenney says Notley’s failure to push back harder on Trans Mountain is the reason it remains in limbo.

“The NDP sold Alberta out to the Trudeau Liberals – and we won’t let that happen again,” Kenney said Wednesday to the cheers of supporters.

If oil were a young university student, Alberta’s politicians would now play the role of paranoid helicopter parents or politically correct campus administrators.

Every day the province’s oil-obsessed politicos warn Albertans that Canada is a dangerous place full of self-righteous climate activists (and some are indeed self-righteous), anti-pipeline protestors, dumb courts, stubborn First Nations, and nasty liberals.

Moreover the province’s potential for offence-taking has become as grand as Justin Trudeau’s vindictive Liberal Party of Canada. It can’t tolerate any truth-telling either.

The province’s allergy to criticism has grown so formidable that United Conservative Party leader Jason Kenney proposes to set up a Saudi-like war room in the energy ministry to respond to any micro-aggressions and offensive material. Should it be called Snowflake Central?

Albertans have become such a fragile, oil-reliant people, reasons Kenney, that the province now needs the equivalent of university Bias Response Teams, in this case to foster “a safe and inclusive environment” for its petroleum exporters who have now claimed Alberta’s identity as their own.

(The rulers of Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Russia, we should remember, don’t much like oil critics, either. The political records show that oil relishes conflict and breeds political aggression like no other commodity, except cocaine.)

Kenney, a belligerent proponent of oil-safetyism, would much rather play the blame game than accept the truth that the rapid development of bitumen mining in Fort McMurray violated two fundamental principles of risk mitigation: go slow and save the money.

Over many years, Alberta’s Tories repeatedly gambled that the price of bitumen, a garbage crude that requires upgrading and complex refining, could only go higher, and they bet wrong.

So did the NDP, another oil-coddled entity. (And yes, Albertans should be very angry about the gross mismanagement of their gas and oil resources by their elected politicians.)

According to former Encana CEO Gwyn Morgan, another whiner of the highest order, Alberta’s most important industry has been stomped on by bad people.

(As every adherent of identity politics knows, life is a constant battle between good and evil people. God forbid that Canadians see each other as brothers and sisters.)

Morgan, who chaired SNC-Lavalin during the Libya scandal and boldly took no responsibility for that fiasco, recently argued in the Financial Post that the “drastic decline” of Canada’s oil industry is due to “a combination of ideological antagonism to fossil fuels and tunnel vision.”

Apparently, ideology caused oil prices to crash in 2014, and the overproduction of bitumen and tight oil had nothing to do with that bitter event, which left 40,000 Albertans jobless.

Art Berman, a respected Houston oil analyst and no greenie, has a much higher respect for the truth.

He recently documented how combined Canadian and U.S. unconventional oil production from the tar sands and Permian Basin “surged in 2014 and caused oil prices to collapse.” As prices fell, producers — including OPEC — rejected any production cuts.

Yet to this day you’ll never hear an Alberta or federal politician, let alone Morgan, acknowledge how Canadian oilsands production helped precipitate the global oil price crash of 2014. (Delusion appears to be a reliable Canadian political trait for both the left and the right.)

Alberta’s political elites would never let the facts spoil the celebration of Alberta’s victimhood or the province’s politically correct view of petroleum as the Walt Disney of resources.

In Morgan’s pity analysis, 44 years of one-party rule in Alberta by the Tories played no role in Alberta’s current predicament.

But the facts show that the Conservative governments foolishly eschewed any value-added policy for the province’s junk crude, and instead promoted a low royalty regime, which encouraged the export of raw bitumen — a dismal strategy that has enriched U.S. refineries and the Koch brothers.

No matter. Those damn oil-hating and U.S.-funded tar sands campaigners are to blame for Alberta’s bad oil rap, argues Mark Scholz, president of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors in the Calgary Herald.

According to Scholz, a bunch of celebrities and “a glorious campaign of Houdini-like misdirection” are somehow responsible for the cancelling of two bitumen export pipelines, carbon taxes, and everything else that has gone wrong in Alberta.

Of course the high carbon content of bitumen and its extreme price volatility have nothing to do with declining investment in the oil sands.

The facts also tell a different story about the two cancelled pipelines. A federal court cancelled Northern Gateway’s permit (and the Harper government choose not to revive that proposal) while market conditions claimed the Energy East pipeline.

Although proponents of Energy East claimed it would end the import of Saudi oil into eastern Canada, David Hughes, a well-known Canadian energy analyst notes that eastern refineries in New Brunswick aren’t designed to process much heavy oil.

So an Energy East pipeline, if ever built, could not really put a dent in U.S. or Saudi oil imports.

Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, the industry’s powerful lobby group, also claims victimhood. “We have been the victims of a very well-orchestrated, well-planned foreign-funded attack on Canadian infrastructure,” he recently tweeted.

But Hughes notes oil sands production has grown by 376 per cent since 2000. If there was a “foreign-funded attack” it’s been grossly ineffective, he says.

Hughes adds that “the reason that there is a pipeline bottleneck is that the industry has been so successful in growing production.”

NDP Premier Rachel Notley also presents Alberta as fragile player unfairly dumped upon by bad actors in British Columbia and elsewhere.

Her vocabulary consists of pipelines, pipelines and pipelines.

Alberta can’t get full value for its bitumen “because we can’t move the product to market.”

And dastardly environmentalists have created a situation where “we are leaving world oil markets — and in some cases Eastern Canadian markets — to the Russians and the Saudis — countries that don’t care a whit about climate change or the environment.”

Yet research done for Alberta Innovates, a taxpayer-funded nonprofit, revealed that no real price advantage for bitumen exists in Asia.

The best and most lucrative market remains U.S. Gulf Coast refineries because they can handle complex heavy oil.

And what oil-exporting nation, other than Norway, truly gives a damn about climate change or the environment? They simply don’t exist.

Coddling a mind is a terrible thing, but coddling a province is a social disaster.

In the current election campaign, no politician wants to pony up and tell the truth.

It wasn’t foreigners or bad actors who created Alberta’s failings; it was Albertans and their damn greed and lack of strategic planning.

Albertans share the blame for the 2014 oil price collapse with U.S. tight oil producers (price discounts and lack of pipelines clobbered Permian producers too), and Albertans share blame for the province’s collective failure to add value to bitumen. (The more value you add, the fewer pipelines you need.)

Albertans, and only Albertans, share the blame for not collecting their fair share and saving for a rainy day.

So stop your whining and end the blame game. Cowboy up and own your oil-based problems, and recognize that the Alberta government has not responded competently to structural changes in oil and gas markets.

Recognize you’ve got both revenue and spending problems that could be a death spiral for the province.

Admit that exporting carbon-rich oil comes with high risks and that exporting more oil and building more pipelines will increase those risks.

And stop pretending that business as usual will dig Alberta out of the hole it has dug for itself.

Morgan, Kenney, Notley and the rest of Alberta-Is-Only-Oil gang might want to start with some cognitive behavioural therapy, or better still, sit down and read Butcher’s Crossing.

It’s a great novel about a buffalo hunt by the Texas writer John Williams. Some say it is probably the best western ever written — even better than True Grit — and I agree.

It tells the story of a couple of buffalo hunters who journey to Colorado for a grand slaughter with visions of prosperity.

But once the hunters locate their prey, they grow so obsessed with greed and bloodletting that winter overtakes them and traps them in the mountains.

The killers emerge from a gruelling snowy ordeal months later, only to discover that the markets for buffalo hides have crashed.

A dejected hide-buyer explains the ruinous facts. “The bottom’s dropped out of the whole market. The hide business is finished. For good.”

Oil is not finished yet, and the prospects for heavy oil remain solid in the U.S. Gulf Coast. The oil sands will shrink, but they will not disappear for decades.

But Alberta’s twisted identity politics uphold the politically correct illusion that there are more buffalo to kill, and the future doesn’t matter.

And that is an unforgiving road to ruin.

But this generation of Conservative politicians wants to do less and less on climate change when the risks and the costs are enormous. Assuming the polls are ...,"But beyond 2022, is the carbon tax going to go up? Assuming, as we hear all the time, it's the best, most efficient way to incentivize people away from pollution, wouldn't it have to go up if we're going to close the gap and hit our targets?

We're committed to meeting our Paris Agreement target (to cut emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030). We've been clear about that, and we're taking an across-the-board approach. The commitment is only to 2022, and that's when we meet with provinces and territories to do a review (of Canada's climate change framework). But there's no intention to go up now.

It seems there's a disconnect between the action experts say is needed to prevent the worst consequences of climate change, and the action that is politically possible for governments to do. What do you think about that?

Look, we've done a lot and we know we need to do more. We came in (to government), there was 10 years of inaction. We helped negotiate the Paris Agreement, then we negotiated with provinces and territories. We're two thirds of the way to our target and we're 11 years out… One of the challenges, of course, is when you have provinces like Ontario that backtrack. They do less, so they increase the challenge. But we are committed to it.

Why do think there is so much resistance, with Jason Kenney maybe on the cusp of winning in Alberta, what Doug Ford is doing in Ontario, other provinces that are skeptical of the efficacy of carbon pricing, or carbon taxes — why do think there's an audience for that?

I think they're skeptical of climate action overall. They seem to be skeptical of the science that says the enormity of the challenge and how we need to act now. We have our climate change report that says Canada is warming at double the international average, and… they aren't making decisions based on policy and evidence. We know that carbon pricing works. We know that we need to take action. We know you can do it in an affordable way by giving the money back. But this generation of Conservative politicians wants to do less and less on climate change when the risks and the costs are enormous.

Assuming the polls are right and Kenney becomes Premier of Alberta, cancels the carbon tax in Alberta and lifts the cap on oilsands emissions, what can the Liberal government in Ottawa do? Wouldn't that tear up the chance of Canada hitting its targets?

I'm not going to speculate on the Alberta election…We will deal with things as they come, but we're going to continue to push. And that's what we've found that, unfortunately, provinces didn't step up — some provinces, led by Conservative politicians, didn't step up and they made it free to pollute. And we stepped in, put a price on pollution, but also did it in an affordable way.

Wait till you see the Liberals’ new bill Hate ...","CALGARY – New laws that would impede Alberta’s oil and gas from getting to export markets represent “a stampede of stupid,” Rachel Notley said Tuesday.

Notley, the NDP leader currently running for re-election to the Alberta premier’s office, testified before a Senate committee hearing Tuesday on Bill C-48, a federal bill that would place a moratorium on oil tankers moving crude off the northern part of British Columbia’s coastline.

“At the end of the day, this has a gargantuan impact on Alberta,” Notley said during her presentation, which blasted both the content and the spirit of the bill.

A combination of Alberta politicians, oil executives and industry groups blasted federal laws on three fronts Tuesday, arguing that Ottawa’s oil tanker moratorium, and separate plans to revamp pipeline approvals and Canada’s Clean Fuel Standard would all have an outsized impact on Alberta.

In the midst of the Alberta election, much of the province’s anger over the state of the economy is being directed at Ottawa and, with a week left before Albertans vote, both major parties are stepping up their criticism of the federal government.

“You may have noted that Albertans are not fans of Ottawa these days, which is the G-rated way to put it,” Notley said in her presentation, in which she called the bill “the horribly misguided West Coast tanker ban.”

She said it contained “a glaring double standard” that allows for massive liquefied natural gas tankers to travel off British Columbia’s coast but not oil tankers, making the bill “an Alberta ban”, not a tanker ban.

Similarly, Jason Kenney, Notley’s rival and United Conservative Party leader, sent a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warning that, if elected, a UCP government would challenge the constitutionality of another federal law called Bill C-69, which would reorganize the National Energy Board and revamp the regulatory process for pipelines.

In a release he said the new regulatory regime was “a sucker punch to an already-reeling Alberta economy” and a “full frontal attack” on provincial powers.

While Notley appeared before a Senate committee on Bill C-48, a parade of executives from large Canadian oil and gas companies were making their case in Calgary that Bill C-69 needed substantial amendments.

“The current regulatory process is being abused by entities that wish to frustrate, delay and ultimately stop the production of Canadian oil and gas,” said Al Reid, an executive vice-president and general counsel at Cenovus Energy Inc., a major oilsands producer.

“As currently drafted, Bill C-69 will make this situation worse by extending timelines and increasing the risk of litigation. We don’t believe it has to be this way,” he said.

Cenovus and other large oil and gas producers took the opportunity to both criticize the bill as it’s currently formulated, but say they would support amendments to address their concerns.

“We have been working with our industry associations to advance common sense amendments that make Bill C-69 workable for oil and natural gas projects,” said Steve Laut, executive vice-chairman of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.

“We are concerned that Bill C-69, in its current form, will make the regulatory process more complicated, time consuming, and ultimately erode public and investor confidence,” Laut said.

Also on Tuesday, the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada held a press conference in Ottawa, criticizing the federal government’s plans to implement a Clean Fuel Standard, which, the group says, would effectively increase the price of carbon in Canada to $200 per tonne once it is fully implemented in 2023.

Bob Masterson, president and CEO of the CIAC, said the Fuel Standard would duplicate the costs of the carbon tax as companies would be forced to use expensive additives and blending agents in their fuel, and consumers would still pay the carbon tax to use that fuel.

He said it would also make the feedstock for petrochemical projects proposed in Alberta to rise by 30 per cent.

“It would definitely have a significant impact on the cost structure,” said Masterson.

He added the government is currently doing an economic analysis on how the new regulations would affect the industry, but added it’s “not very good policy” to propose new regulations before an analysis of those regulations has been carried out.

The Clean Fuel Standard would come into effect for all liquid fuels, including gasoline and diesel, by 2022 and for all gaseous fuels, including natural gas for home heating, by 2023.

But how well is it understood? What does it mean for Albertans? And, are misconceptions being politicized to infuriate or rally voters?

Is the carbon tax ‘a cash grab’?

“We need to recognize that the NDP’s carbon tax is just a cash grab,” UCP leader Jason Kenney said during the April 4 leaders debate. “All economic pain and no environmental gain.”

Alberta’s consumer carbon tax came into effect Jan. 1, 2017. The levy is charged on all fuels that emit greenhouse gases when combusted at a rate of $20 per tonne in 2017 and $30 per tonne in 2018. The federal carbon tax took effect April 1, 2019, applying to provinces that refused to impose their own emissions pricing.

READ MORE: How will Alberta’s carbon tax impact consumers?

Economist Trevor Tombe says one of the biggest misconceptions of the carbon tax is that it doesn’t really do anything.

“You often hear a statement that, ‘It’s all economic pain and no environmental gain,’ for example. But there’s a lot of evidence, from B.C. in particular — who’s had a carbon tax for the past 10 years or so — that people do respond to price increases.

“When things get more expensive, you try to shift into other things, not everyone of course, but overall,” said Tombe, who works out of the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy.

“Based on the B.C. experience, emissions in Alberta may fall between five and 15 per cent lower than they would be without the carbon tax.”

Watch below (Nov. 23, 2017): Alberta’s carbon tax is set to go up in the New Year. There are some big claims making the rounds on social media about exactly how hard it will hit Albertans in the wallet. Tom Vernon sets the record straight.

Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission, a non-partisan group of academics and business leaders focused on economic and environmental solutions, just published a report on carbon tax misconceptions.

The worst, the head of the commission says, is that a carbon tax doesn’t work.

“If you look at B.C., if you look at California, if you look at the U.K., if you look at Quebec, these policies do work. What they don’t do is work overnight,” Chris Ragan says.

At least five different published studies have found British Columbia’s carbon tax, introduced in 2008, has cut overall emissions, reduced per capita gasoline use by seven per cent, improved average vehicle efficiency by four per cent, cut residential natural gas use by seven per cent and diesel use by more than three per cent.

Meanwhile, the province enjoyed about three per cent annual economic growth between 2012 and 2017.

Energy economists such as Mark Jaccard at B.C.’s Simon Fraser University argue that regulations get faster, bigger results and are politically easier to enact (as opposed to a tax). The big cuts to Canada’s carbon emissions, he said, have come from closing coal-fired power plants and clean fuel rules.

“Some people will tell you you have to have carbon pricing,” he said on a recent podcast. “That’s not true. You could do it all through regulations.”

Is it a ‘massive’ expense for Albertans?

Tombe thinks this is the other broadly misunderstood aspect of Alberta’s consumer carbon tax.

“That it will add thousands of dollars per year in household costs of living. We see claims along those lines very often.”

In Alberta, the $30/tonne levy is applied on fuel purchases like gasoline (for filling vehicles) and natural gas consumption (for heating buildings).

“For the average household, it increases annual costs by about $450 per year or so,” Tombe said. “That’s counterbalanced by a refundable tax credit — $300 for an individual, it’s higher for a family, it grows with the number of children, it can be as high as $550 per year.

“So the net effect of both of those policy changes for the majority of Alberta households is fairly modest.”

Albertans earning less than $47,500 a year and families earning less than $95,00 a year get a full rebate. The NDP estimates 60 per cent of Alberta households qualify for a full or partial rebate.

Rebates are automatically applied to Alberta residents who file tax returns and meet the income criteria.

In the #abdebate, Jason Kenney claims the savings from a CTax would be $1,150. This is wrong. Here's research on CTax costs in Alberta (the UCP platform cites this research too). https://t.co/mIbbyJTK1R — Trevor Tombe (@trevortombe) April 5, 2019

How much does the carbon tax cost businesses and commercial facilities?

“It really depends on the age of your building, the size of your building and so on,” Tombe said. “But roughly speaking, on average, the amount of natural gas that’s used for heating commercial building spaces is about 1 gigajoule of natural gas per square metre, for example. The carbon tax is $1.51 per gigajoule.

“Based on how large your space is, you’re looking at about $1.50 per square metre in heating cost from the carbon tax.”

Watch below (April 18, 2017): the province provided details on energy efficiency rebates available to Albertans. They’re part of a climate strategy that includes a carbon levy. Tom Vernon looks at where revenues are going.

Can Alberta just not have a carbon tax?

Kenney has said one of the first things a UCP government would do, if elected April 16, would be eliminate Alberta’s consumer carbon tax.

“That would be extremely easy to eliminate,” Tombe said.

“It could be done as quickly as legislation could pass through the house. The most time-consuming process of eliminating the carbon tax in Alberta would be to actually have the legislation written and passed. But once that’s done, it could be done overnight.”

But Albertans themselves would still be faced with a carbon tax — a federal one. On April 1, 2019 the federal government applied a levy to every province that hadn’t already implemented their own form of carbon tax.

No province would have two carbon taxes, but if Alberta got rid of its own levy, the federal one would kick in.

“If a province were to withdraw its own price on carbon — as we’ve seen Manitoba do, for example, or more recently, Ontario — if Alberta were to eliminate its charge on fuel, then we would see very shortly after that the federal government come in and impose its carbon tax,” Tombe explained.

“So the question of what happens to carbon taxes in Alberta and Canada won’t be solved by Alberta’s election one way or the other; it’s going to be determined by the federal election later on in the year.”

Alberta’s carbon tax translates to six cents a litre of gasoline. The federal tax is four cents a litre.

Watch below: On Day 14 of the Alberta election campaign, the United Conservative Party took aim at the federal carbon tax.

Martin Olszynski, a University of Calgary law professor, said all Ottawa would have to do is pass an order in council to bring Alberta under the same federal tax that recently came into effect in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick. None of those provinces had its own tax.

“It’s a matter of getting cabinet together and writing the order,” Olszynski said.

Looking to the courts to block Ottawa’s tax is an iffy bet, he suggested.

In court hearings on Saskatchewan’s anti-tax constitutional challenge, Olszynski said, judges asked if allowing Ottawa to regulate greenhouse gases as a matter of “national concern” would impede provincial efforts to do the same.

Fact check: Does the federal carbon tax leave 8 out of 10 families better off?

“If you recognize this matter as a matter of national concern, you would strip away the provincial ability to regulate these things,” he summarized.

But Olszynski notes that courts have recognized that many issues – especially environmental ones – are best managed jointly between national and provincial governments.

Other federal arguments in favour of a national carbon tax are backed by decades of case law, Olszynski added.

Why has the carbon tax become politically volatile?

On the provincial level, the UCP are campaigning on a promise to scrap it. Kenney has said he would sue Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government if he tries to impose the federal carbon tax in Alberta.

NDP leader Rachel Notley says the carbon tax is a way to protect the future. She says the NDP’s rebate plan is working and the air is getting cleaner — that the party’s approach has already reduced greenhouse gases by seven megatons. The tax, she says, is paying for projects like public transit and flood protection.

The carbon tax has undoubtedly become a divisive political issue and one parties are capitalizing on in the hopes of motivating voters.

“The carbon tax is unpopular and it’s unpopular because it is visible,” Tombe said.

“GST is also not popular. Think back to the federal election after Brian Mulroney introduced the GST. The then-Liberal government campaigned strongly against the GST, a very unpopular tax because we see it on a regular basis… you’re exposed to it, you’re reminded of it all the time,” Tombe added.

Political scientist Duane Bratt believes there are a few reasons it’s coming up time and again on the election campaign trail.

“I would say the first is the way the NDP sold it,” Bratt said.

“There could have been lots of reasons to have a carbon tax, but they directly linked it to social license for pipelines and the pipelines haven’t been built yet. That’s the problem that the NDP is having.

“It’s very possible, I believe, that the pipeline eventually will be built in due part to the introduction of the carbon tax. But that doesn’t matter for this election because they’re getting the pain without the benefit,” Bratt said.

Another factor, he says, is timing: when the tax was implement in the context of the economic climate.

“I believe the NDP, after they were elected, didn’t think the recession would last as long as it did. Most experts were looking at two years, not four years,” Bratt said. “That’s another problem that they’ve had; just the economic downturn combined with a brand-new tax.”

104,Politics,2019-04-11T19:29:00.0000000Z,"She appealed to Speaker Geoff Regan to rule that their rights had been denied and their privileges as members of Parliament breached on the basis of the 2015 Reform Act, which set rules around the administration of party caucuses. “This matter is urgent.","OTTAWA — Former cabinet minister Jane Philpott rose in the House of Commons Tuesday morning to speak on a point of privilege, asking the Speaker of the House of Commons to consider whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau violated the law by “unilaterally” removing her and former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould from the Liberal Party caucus last week.

She appealed to Speaker Geoff Regan to rule that their rights had been denied and their privileges as members of Parliament breached on the basis of the 2015 Reform Act, which set rules around the administration of party caucuses.

“This matter is urgent. … Procedural fairness and the rule of law demand this. Secret in-camera meetings or private notices should not be a shield to prevent the upholding of the law and members’ rights,” Philpott told the Commons.

“This is very concerning. It speaks to the rule of law at the heart of our democracy,” Conservative MP Michael Chong, who authored the Reform Act, told the National Post in an interview shortly after she made her arguments. So what exactly is this latest foofaraw all about?

How did the ouster from caucus go down last week?

In a brief speech last Tuesday Trudeau announced his decision to remove Philpott and Wilson-Raybould from caucus after both resigned from cabinet in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Wilson-Raybould testified that Trudeau and his top officials tried pressuring her, for political reasons, to cut a deal for Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin so it could avoid criminal prosecution for fraud and bribery.

Both initially stayed members of the Liberal caucus, citing their faith in the party’s policies despite a lack of confidence in the prime minister’s handling of the affair.

But Trudeau said last week the caucus has lost “trust” in the two former ministers. “We’ve taken every effort to address their concerns but ultimately if they can’t honestly say that they have confidence in this team despite weeks of testimony, face-to-face conversations and phone calls with myself and other members of caucus, then they cannot be part of this team.”

Trudeau announced the decision as his own, and Philpott argued Tuesday Liberal MPs never had a chance to have their say — even though the Parliament of Canada Act was amended in 2015, with Chong’s Reform Act, so that these types of situations could be avoided.

What exactly does the Reform Act say about this?

The Reform Act, which amended the Canada Elections Act and the Parliament of Canada Act, spells out rules around expulsions and readmissions of caucus members, the election or removal of caucus chairs, leadership reviews and the election of interim leaders.

The act requires caucuses, after each general election, to hold four votes on whether or not a majority of MPs in each party wants to abide by the rules it sets out on its four topics. If they reject the rules, then they do not need to follow them.

On expulsions, here are the rules that parties can opt in to, or not: A member of caucus can only be expelled, according to the Reform Act, if “the caucus chair has received a written notice signed by at least 20 per cent of the members of the caucus requesting that the member’s membership be reviewed” and if “the expulsion of the member is approved by secret ballot by a majority of all caucus members.”

Neither of those things happened in this case. Philpott said if the Reform Act rules were followed, it would have taken a recorded vote in which 90 Liberal MPs voted to expel her and Wilson-Raybould — yet no such vote took place. “We were expelled prior to the commencement of the Liberal caucus meeting,” she argued in the House Tuesday.

Did Liberals ever vote on the provisions in the Reform Act?

The answer to this question would go a long way to settling whether Liberals did anything to violate the law.

If Liberal MPs never had a chance to vote on opting into the Reform Act rules, as Philpott alleged in the House, that would inherently be an “illegal act,” argued Chong. “I’ve been concerned about it for three-and-a-half years,” he said, since the Liberals reportedly held their first caucus meeting without recording votes and reporting results to the Speaker, which the law required them to do. “It’s now come to fruition with the two questionable expulsions last week.”

But Liberals said on Tuesday that they had followed the rules. Kevin Lamoureux, the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader, told the Commons that “over three years ago,” the chair of the national Liberal caucus, Francis Scarpaleggia, sent a letter to the speaker outlining the caucus’s decisions not to have the Reform Act provisions apply.

“Given the fact that the Liberal caucus did not adopt these provisions, the points raised by the honourable Member on this issue are moot,” said Lamoureux.

Lamoureux said the only requirement, which the caucus met, was for Liberals to inform the speaker of “the results of the caucus decisions.” But the law actually stipulates that they communicate “the outcome of each vote.”

Lamoureux did not address whether individual, recorded votes were held on each element of the Reform Act, nor whether the votes occurred at the Liberals’ first caucus meeting after the election, both required under the law. Philpott is alleging that neither happened.

The House leader’s office referred questions about whether votes were actually held to Scarpaleggia, who told the Post caucus confidentiality means he can’t discuss whether individual votes occurred.

So, does Philpott have a point?

What she’s arguing is that Trudeau breached the privileges of his Liberal MPs by not allowing them to vote on the administration of their own caucus back in November 2015, after the federal election, in accordance with the law. As a result, she is arguing, Philpott’s and Wilson-Raybould’s privileges were breached when Trudeau made a unilateral decision to remove them. And the rights of the entire Liberal caucus were breached because they didn’t have an opportunity to vote on that decision by secret ballot.

Chong said Philpott spoke with him about the topic before going ahead with her arguments on Tuesday morning, and he told the Post he is fully on board with them.

“This point of privilege she has raised is vitally important because if there is no recourse here to enforce the rights of members, there is no other place,” he said. Courts have repeatedly ruled they do not have jurisdiction over matters of parliamentary administration, so he believes this is the only way for it to be enforced. The Reform Act also specifically states that caucus decisions aren’t subject to judicial review.

“The only recourse we have to uphold the rule of law and to ensure that the law is followed in the House of Commons, its parliamentary parties and committees, is in the House of Commons and by appealing to the speaker,” Chong said.

But Philippe Lagassé, a procedure expert at the University of Ottawa, said the whole thing seems more like a question around the legal interpretation of the Parliament of Canada Act rather than a matter of parliamentary privilege.

“I don’t see how this is a point of privilege in the traditional sense,” he said. If Liberal MPs didn’t vote in favour of opting in to the Reform Act rules, then they wouldn’t be bound to them, “and since the courts can’t review, I’m not sure who would enforce this,” he added.

What has the speaker said about this?

Two weeks ago, a Conservative MP raised similar issues when he complained that it seemed MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes had resigned from the Liberal caucus because she was forced out. Had the Reform Act rules been in place, he argued, there would’ve had to have been a vote.

“If you, Mr. Speaker, decline to exercise jurisdiction to entertain breaches of the statute here, then members of caucuses, like the Liberal caucus who flagrantly ignore the law, have no protection and no recourse when their rights are trampled. Because of the lack of judicial recourse, general restraint on speakers interpreting the law and the House’s privilege to manage internal affairs, I respectfully submit that the way forward, indeed the only way forward, is to allow the House to deal with this matter,” John Nater argued.

Caesar-Chavannes ultimately confirmed that she had left of her own accord. And the speaker had come back on Monday, the day before Philpott made her arguments, with a ruling that he didn’t have the jurisdiction anyway.

As relayed by Deputy Speaker Bruce Stanton, Regan’s ruling said asking the House to deal with an expulsion from caucus was “not a proper subject for a question of privilege.” Further, “I as speaker have no role in the interpretation of statute nor in the conduct of these 2015 provisions.”

Philpott acknowledged that ruling on Tuesday morning. “But with respect it is our view that this does not relieve you of your responsibility to ensure that all members are aware of their rights in this place. This is our privilege. Accordingly, a remedy is required for our situation,” she said. Regan responded: “While I am left with the difficulty, as I said in my ruling yesterday, that the speaker does not have power to enforce statutes, I will certainly consider her argument and come back to the House.”

So now what happens?

The House will have to wait for Regan to come back with an opinion on the issue. If he does find a prima facie breach of privilege, which Lagassé found unlikely, Philpott will be able to move that the matter be referred to a parliamentary committee.

Liberals have a majority in the House and on committees — including the two committees that recently decided not to pursue any further investigation of the SNC-Lavalin issue.

Asked whether he’s hopeful that some of them will vote to look at what happened here, Chong said, “We have to try. We can’t give up. … I hope that our House of Commons is strong enough to adjudicate this and to seek justice.”

We’ve had plenty of reminders of this of late. But all the eye rolling can make it hard to spot two genuine stories that Canadians should be paying attention to, assuming they haven’t already tuned out in disgust.

Earlier this month, on April 1, Ottawa imposed its national carbon-pricing plan on the four provinces that had not developed and implemented provincial versions that met Ottawa’s standard. Residents of Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick are now paying a levy of $10 per ton of emitted carbon; the levy will rise to $50 a ton by 2022. The Liberals are promising rebates back to residents of those provinces, which will be pegged to the income of the recipient. The Liberals seem confident that the average (and even many above-average) residents will get more back in the levy than they spend in added taxes, mostly at the gas pump.

And it was at the gas pumps that Conservative politicians made their (literal) stands. The Twitter accounts of countless Tory elected officials churned out staged photos of said officials standing grimly next to their vehicles on March 31, pumping gas and staring off into the abyss before the price went up a few hours later, thus saving themselves … a dollar or two. (Or, in the case of one MPP, simply awkwardly holding a pump and giving a thumbs down, with no car to be seen.)

This was not a particularly proud moment in Canadian political life, but the Liberals aren’t exactly draping themselves in glory, either. The party’s counterattack to criticism of their carbon plans is to note, over and over, that the federal Conservatives have yet to announce what their plan to fight climate change would be.

That sounds like a good reply, until you recall that it was just a few months ago that a government report revealed that while the Liberals have a plan, it’s not working—the country is actually getting further from our Paris treaty goals, not closer to their realization.

The Liberals say we’ll close the gap with new technology and through more work by the provinces and territories. In other words, they’re counting on stuff that they either don’t control or doesn’t exist … but might, eventually, we hope. If the Liberals were trying to invent the next fad diet, they’d proudly announce their plan to wait for future calorie-free food to be invented, and for other people to eat less.

It’s a pathetic display, all around. Hell may be other people, but an awfully close second is spending an hour reading back-and-forth tweets from the party with no plan and the party with a plan that won’t work.

But while all of that was happening, much bigger news was being announced, and it makes the entire little Canadian debate look like the sideshow is truly is.

On March 27, Global Energy Monitor, an environmental NGO based out of San Francisco, released a report tracking the construction of fossil fuel infrastructure around the world. It reported that coal-fired power continues to be on a downward slope in most countries, including the United States. But it also noted that China has apparently resumed construction at a series of coal-fired power plants that had previously had their development suspended.

China’s Electricity Council, the report also noted, has proposed increasing the amount of coal-fired electrical generation in the country by almost 300 gigawatts per year — this would be more than enough to entirely offset the complete idling of the entire coal-fired power generation capacity of the United States.

Think about that for a second. Suddenly the few dozen litres of gas you’re pumping into your car (while scowling into a camera or otherwise) don’t seem like such a big deal.

As testy as the Canadian debate can be, the brutal reality is this — we simply aren’t a big player here. There are many arguments you can make in favour of a carbon tax, but in the Canadian context, the one argument that doesn’t work is that anything being proposed here will matter much to the future of humanity. The rest is just politics.

And that’s where our second story comes in.

British Columbia has long been a leader in the federation on carbon tax issues. It’s model has been oft-cited as proof that a carbon tax can work at reducing emissions while also being revenue neutral—or at least neutral enough to avoid generating public backlash. B.C. is Canada’s carbon tax success story.

Which is what made it so odd to read recently that B.C.’s NDP premier, whose minority government is backed up by the Green Party, is considering price relief for consumers unhappy with soaring gas prices.

The price of gas recently hit a record, just as B.C.’s carbon tax was increasing. In fairness, the carbon tax alone isn’t responsible for the spike. It obviously contributed to it, but the real issue seems to be constrained refinery capacity in the region.

But it still speaks to the fundamental problem: the commitment of Canada’s political class to the cause of fighting carbon extends only to the point where it stops being pain-free. The instant meaningful costs are imposed on the public—which is what a carbon-tax is designed to do—even NDP premiers backed up by the Green Party start talking about finding a way to bring down the price. B.C. is literally raising the cost of a litre of gasoline at the exact same moment they’re talking about trying to find a way to make gasoline more affordable!

It’s madness. It’s the worst of our politics. And while we fight about it, China’s going to keep right on building coal power plants. Remember that the next time you see some Canadian politician grandstanding on either side of the issue. They aren’t being serious, and we don’t have to pretend otherwise.

Ten days after the submission of a second appeal to the Conservative National Council alleging “several irregularities” with the Dufferin-Caledon Tory nomination process, Barb Shaughnessy, one of the three unsuccessful candidates, says she has documentation proving out-of-riding residents may have voted in the process.

Harzadan Singh Khattra emerged as the somewhat surprising winner of the nomination, which local Conservative members voted in on March 19. He beat out Kevin Weatherbee in the final round of voting, after Ms. Shaughnessy and former Orangeville Mayor Jeremy Williams had been eliminated in the ranked ballot voting system.

As reported in last week’s Citizen, Ms. Shaughnessy filed an initial appeal on March 21, two days after the nomination. In that appeal, she stressed it does not specifically contest the vote tally, but rather calls into question the eligibility of some persons who may or may not have voted. That appeal was quickly rejected.

A second appeal was then lodged with the Conservative National Council. A decision was expected to come down late last week, but as of press time on Wednesday evening (April 10), a final determination had yet to be made. Speaking to the Citizen this week, Ms. Shaughnessy confirmed that her team had submitted additional documentation to the National Council that, in her words, shows that ineligible members had voted during the local process.

“Mr. Khattra, he led an aggressive campaign that did, according to my affidavits, violate membership rules. He alone is responsible, in my opinion, for putting the Conservative Party in this difficult position,” Ms. Shaughnessy said. “I firmly believe this was about self-interest rather than what was best for Dufferin-Caledon. I believe if he had acted more ethically and followed the party rules, like the other candidates did, then we would not be in this position.”

She added, “The extra information we sent through to the National Council… It was about inconsistencies in the database. It was what I had identified previously, it was that we definitely had people from Brampton who considered their (primary) address to be in Brampton voting in Dufferin-Caledon.”

When asked if she was claiming that out-of-riding residents had been allowed to vote in this nomination process, Ms. Shaughnessy replied with a simple “yes”.

When approached by the Citizen, Mr. Khattra categorically denied the allegations, labelling them as false.

“There is nothing further that needs to be said beyond that,” Mr. Khattra stated.

When asked if he was surprised to hear of multiple appeals being launched, essentially contesting his nomination, Mr. Khattra simply maintained his belief that neither he, nor his team, had done anything wrong.

“Anyone would be surprised to hear an appeal. However, since my campaign didn’t do anything wrong, to my best belief, I’m anticipating a positive result in my favour,” Mr. Khattra said.

Reiterating why she felt it necessary to submit an appeal in the first place, Ms. Shaughnessy said she was simply following up on requests from “many, many people in the riding”.

“There was only one way for this process to be reviewed, and that was for one of the candidates to submit an official appeal. Originally, I had no plans to submit an appeal. It was only after two days of relentless emails and calls, and realizing that the other candidates (Mr. Weatherbee and Mr. Williams) wouldn’t be filing, that I decided to do it,” she explained. “I couldn’t ignore what I was hearing.”

She added, “For me, it really all comes down to democracy. I firmly believe in our democracy and I think our democracy was challenged by the actions of one of the candidates.”

On top of allegations that out-of-riding residents voted in the Dufferin-Caledon nomination, Ms. Shaughnessy last week claimed that ineligible international students “may, or may not, have voted” too during the process. During the nomination, only permanent residents and citizens of Canada were eligible to vote.

In other, more concerning, claims, Ms. Shaughnessy says she has spoken to individuals who have refused to divulge information “out of fear”.

“I want people to understand that individuals are now afraid to come forward. They are afraid of their position in their community and they are also afraid for their livelihood. Trying to garner more information has become increasingly difficult,” Ms. Shaughnessy said. “When I talk to members of the South Asian community, it’s clear they’re very divided on (Mr. Khattra). I have to say, some members have really stepped up to the plate because they do believe in our Canadian democracy and they have been willing to help.”

Asked when she expects to learn of the National Council’s decision, Ms. Shaughnessy said she really didn’t have a timeline, but noted the fact nothing had been heard yet at least showed the issue was being “strongly considered”.

“At this point, I’ve provided the National Council with everything that I can. I would love a decision. I’ve put myself out there, it would be nice to hear back, but all I can say is, if they’re taking their time, they’re taking their time because they understand the gravity of this issue. I would say they’re reviewing everything carefully. I’d rather they do that than come back quickly with a rushed decision,” she concluded.

In a further communication with the Citizen, Mr. Khattra stated he was simply moving forward in his role as Dufferin-Caledon Conservative nominee ahead of October’s federal election

“I have been meeting with residents and party members in the riding to discuss Justin Trudeau’s carbon tax, housing affordability and the challenges facing seniors. The Liberals are making life very unaffordable for middle class families in this riding,” Mr. Khattra said.

In conclusion, in referencing the appeal, Mr. Khattra said he has confidence in the system and is looking forward to the National Council making a final decision.

“Appeals are not uncommon in nomination races. The first appeal has already been rejected and I am waiting to hear back from National Council about the second appeal. I understand that some Conservative members may be disappointed that their candidate didn’t win, but we need to stay united to defeat Justin Trudeau and his failed policies in the fall,” Mr. Khattra said.

Saskatchewan grain farmer Mehgin Reynolds (who is seeking a Conservative party nomination) told MPs that, for instance, her four-year crop rotation includes lentils, barley, canola and durum ...","





OTTAWA - Canola farmers whose livelihoods have been targeted by China in its feud with Canada say it's time for the federal government to be aggressive at the political level in its fight against a growing number of agricultural trade barriers around the world.

Several producers told two parliamentary committees Tuesday that China's recent rejection of Canadian canola-seed shipments is only the latest trade disruption that's hurt the country's agriculture sector.

They reminded MPs in Ottawa about a number of major trade obstacles faced by Canadian agricultural exporters in faraway markets like India, Italy, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia.

""Canada can feed the world but not if our government does not act strongly on our behalf, removing non-tariff trade barriers, enforcing existing trade agreements and removing political roadblocks,"" Alberta canola farmer Stephen Vandervalk told the House of Commons agriculture committee.

Citing concerns about pests, China has rejected canola-seed imports from Canada and has suspended the licences of two major Canadian exporters.

The moves to cut off the critical Canadian export have been widely viewed as China applying economic pressure on Canada in response to the December arrest of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver at the behest of the United States.

Any extended canola dispute with China, which imported $2.7 billion worth of canola seed from Canada last year, would deliver a painful economic blow to producers, the supply chain and the wider Canadian economy.

The price of canola has fallen since the dispute started last month. The late-winter timing of the disruption has been particularly difficult because it's forced many farmers to suddenly rethink the planting decisions vital to their businesses.

On Tuesday, producers made it clear to MPs at the committees that even with the urgency around the China conflict, the pain is not only about canola. Canadian farmers, they said, are staring at other big trade hurdles in world markets.

Several of the witnesses mentioned issues that have affected Canada's durum wheat exports to Italy, wheat sales to Vietnam, pulse exports to India and feed-barley shipments to Saudi Arabia.

Saskatchewan grain farmer Mehgin Reynolds (who is seeking a Conservative party nomination) told MPs that, for instance, her four-year crop rotation includes lentils, barley, canola and durum wheat — all products that face obstacles on foreign markets.

""The frightening reality is that almost every crop being grown in Canada is currently struggling with one trade barrier or another,"" Reynolds said.

The Liberal government has insisted it wants to find a scientific solution to the canola dispute, in keeping with China's insistence that the problem is tainted seeds.

The Liberals have established a working group that includes officials from Richardson International Ltd. and Viterra Inc. — the two exporters that have had their licences to sell canola revoked by China — and representatives from the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau has requested to send a delegation of experts to China to examine the issue. She's said officials are exploring options to support farmers by expanding existing programs.

Conservative Party of Canada leader Andrew Scheer reacts to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's carbon pricing announcement in Parliament in Ottawa on Oct ...","The head of a new national climate change institute says she is ""perturbed"" by a recent partisan attack from the office of Ontario Premier Doug Ford.

The new institute, called the Pan-Canadian Expert Collaboration, is meant to hold Ottawa to account on its policies to reduce carbon pollution. The eligibility requirements for the competitive process that established it were that Ottawa would play “no role” in its governance, operations, board or activities.

But on Tuesday, David Tarrant, Ford’s executive director of strategic communications said that description was all “Liberal spin.” In a tweet, Tarrant cast a skeptical eye on the institute’s independence, calling it an “elite pro-carbon tax ‘institute’” that contained “puppets.”

Ford's office declined to cite any evidence to back up its claim that the new climate change accountability institute was biased.

Now, two leaders at the new group are speaking out, saying they have no intention of being “partisan.” They pointed to guardrails they say will ensure any federal government stays out of their affairs.

“I did not join this institute and agree to initially lead it unless I was assured that this would be independent, and arms-length,” Kathy Bardswick told National Observer Wednesday.

“In terms of its independence, I’m perturbed by this tweet. Yes, it’s being funded by way of startup by the feds, but it’s independently governed, and that governance structure is robust,” she said.

“We really need to change this dialogue (on climate change), move it away from this partisan starting point to one that is well grounded, credibly supported, inclusive, representing interests from coast to coast to coast, generating the kind of positive discussion that is absolutely essential.”

'The institute is not about partisan politics'

As a sustainability and insurance expert, Bardswick is the former president and CEO of The Co-operators Group, a major Canadian insurance co-op. According to a bio at Foresters Financial, she has been underwriting supervisor and regional vice president of the general insurance company at the Co-operators, and held multiple chief operating officer roles there as well.

Bardswick also sat on the government’s North American Free Trade Agreement Council on the Environment, alongside two former premiers, the former president of Shell Canada and others. The body was formed in 2017 to advise Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna on the environmental protections Ottawa was seeking in the trade talks to replace NAFTA.

She will be joined at the institute by Nancy Olewiler, an environmental economist and the director of the School of Public Policy at Simon Fraser University. Olewiler has been an adviser to that school’s Adaptation to Climate Change Team.

“The institute is not about partisan politics, but finding viable and effective policy solutions to sustain Canada's long-term prosperity,” Olewiler told National Observer.

“The new institute consists of academics from across Canada who are experts in their respective fields with long track records of producing highly credible evidence-based research,” she said.

“We have a robust governance framework that is independent of whomever is the federal government of the day. We want to get on with dealing with the significant issues that face our country and affect our future and intend to do so.”

The eligibility requirements stated that the institute must put in place a board of directors that would be responsible for its “management, strategic direction and financial accountability” as well as reporting requirements like a corporate plan, annual reports and audited financial statements.

These details would be hammered out in a contribution agreement signed between the institute and Environment and Climate Change Canada “within 60 business days of the notification of approval.” Bardswick said that agreement is still “a work in progress.”

McKenna said the institute will be ""eligible to receive up to $20 million over five years"" to implement its vision. The details of how that funding will be transferred are also still being worked out.

The board will have “fiduciary and strategic oversight guided by three expert panels,” Bardswick said. The institute is expected to have three main areas of focus: clean growth, adaptation and mitigation.

Tories in Ottawa terminated previous watchdog

Bardswick’s former workplace, The Co-operators Group, is no stranger to climate change-driven extreme weather events. Last August, it made its storm surge insurance coverage available to homeowners in New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island for the first time, after Atlantic Canada was hit with significant flooding.

About three-quarters of insurance companies in Canada have introduced overland flood insurance as weather patterns change, the Insurance Bureau has said. Blair Feltmate, the head of a climate adaptation centre at the University of Waterloo, who is another leader at the new institute, said flooding is the number one cost to Canada, relative to extreme weather risk driven by climate change.

A major peer-reviewed scientific report released this month showed Canada is warming at double the average rate of the planet, and that the majority of this warming is likely caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, which release heat-trapping carbon pollution. The report showed climate change is heightening the risk of extreme heat waves, wildfires, floods and declining freshwater availability in Canada.

""Scenarios with limited warming will only occur if Canada and the rest of the world reduce carbon emissions to near zero early in the second half of the century and reduce emissions of other greenhouse gases substantially,"" it stated.

The Canadian government has previously funded a non-partisan and independent research organization that tackled similar issues. The National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy was created by the Tory government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney in 1988, but later shut down through a decision by the Harper government to terminate its $5 million in annual funding in 2012.

Shortly after, former environment minister Peter Kent suggested that the then-Conservative government could get similar advice from the internet and other research organizations, while former foreign affairs minister John Baird suggested that the government had no need for more reports about a carbon tax.

Asked about the institute Tuesday, Ford's director of media relations Simon Jefferies said ""elite economists may sit in their ivory towers and lecture hard-working families about the need to make everything more expensive, but they will never understand the struggle of counting the pennies and living paycheque to paycheque.""

""Supporting a carbon tax may win you brownie points in the faculty lounge or win the praise of jet-setting Hollywood elites, but it is not the only way to fight climate change,” he said. He pointed to the provincial government’s environment plan, which he claimed will meet federal carbon pollution reduction targets “without imposing a punishing, job-killing carbon tax on already stretched taxpayers.""

Jefferies was asked twice whether he has any evidence to back up Tarrant’s claim that the institute contains puppets. “My previous statement stands,” he said Wednesday, referring to his comments on “elites.”

On Wednesday, National Observer also asked federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer on Parliament Hill what he thought of the new institute, and whether he considered it a waste of money.

But instead of addressing this question directly, Scheer pointed to the backlash the government received over a $12-million federal contribution by McKenna to Loblaws to help make refrigerators in hundreds of their stores more energy efficient. The controversy arose because the company had hundreds of millions of dollars in net earnings last year.

“When you look at what the government’s been spending money on — the $12 million to a private company that has made hundreds of millions of dollars in profit, giving $12 million to Loblaws — while at the same time, charging Canadians higher fuel costs, higher home heating costs, we disagree with this government’s approach both to taxing Canadians and to their inaction on climate change,” Scheer said.

It's not clear whether the institute could pursue its activities beyond 2019, if a new government is elected that cancels its funding.",Head of new national climate institute is 'perturbed' by tweet from Doug Ford's office,National Observer,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/04/11/news/head-new-national-climate-institute-perturbed-tweet-doug-fords-office

The riding of Edmonton-Highlands-Norwood has been about as reliable an NDP seat as any in the province.

The question this election: does that continue after Brian Mason?

Last year, the longtime NDP MLA and former party leader announced he would not run again. Former premier Ralph Klein famously said Mason was so popular in the riding that “you’re going to need an atomic bomb to get him out of there.” In 2015, Mason won again with nearly 80 per cent of the vote.

Mason’s departure is just one of the things that makes Highlands-Norwood interesting. It’s among Edmonton’s most diverse ridings. Twenty-six per cent of residents are immigrants, while 11 per cent are Indigenous — the highest rate in any Edmonton riding. It also has the lowest median income in the city and higher than average unemployment.

Janis Irwin is the NDP candidate seeking to take the baton from Mason, first elected in 2000. She’s confident Mason’s endorsement and the NDP’s policies will resonate with voters in the neighbourhood.

“To be able to say it was our government that was able to halve the rate of child poverty in two years, it’s incredible, and that’s because of explicit action that Rachel (Notley) took like introducing the Alberta child benefit.”

Two Indigenous women are also in the running. Leila Houle, the UCP candidate, comes from Whitefish Lake First Nation. She said many Indigenous families in the riding share her story: growing up on reserve and then moving to Edmonton for school or work and facing barriers.

She finds the overarching issue for residents is jobs and the economy. “That is the overwhelming response at the door.”

The Green Party’s Taz Bouchier is a former Edmonton civic candidate whose background is in social work.

“The complaint I’ve been getting is ‘Brian Mason did not listen to us. We want someone who will,’” she said.

“There’s many Indigenous people in that community, and there’s many people suffering from poverty, and they’re feeling like they’re not being listened to or heard.”

Tish Prouse, a property manager running for the Alberta Party, thinks the party can break through as a centrist alternative to the UCP and NDP.

“It’s not an ideologically driven party,” he said. “There’s considerable input and sway and … discourse (among members) to come up with varied alternatives to a particular problem.”

Two lesser known parties are hoping to convince voters.

Joe Hankins, who lives in Boyle Street, represents the Alberta Independence Party. He says people are dissatisfied with the UCP and the NCP, as well as Alberta’s place in Canada.

“It’s not hard to broach the subject” of separation at the doors, he said. “Maybe half the people are a little apprehensive about independence but they seem willing to listen.”

Representing the upstart Alberta Advantage Party is Chris Poplatek, who says he will represent residents in the riding and not the party.

“How my party decides to vote is based on each individual candidate, if we get elected,” he said, adding education, the carbon tax, seniors care and crime are the biggest issues he’s hearing.

There’s also a candidate from the Communist Party of Alberta.

“We’re the only party that says we want working people to take power and abolish capitalism,” said candidate Alex Boykowich.

News that permitting issues in the U.S. would delay Enbridge Inc.’s Line 3 replacement pipeline project until the middle of 2020 instead of late this year means that yet another boost in oil export capacity has been kicked down the road.

With both the Trans Mountain expansion and Keystone XL pipeline projects in court limbo, attention is turning to alternative ideas to expand Canada’s ability to continue to get its oil to market.

In a report to Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi last month, the National Energy Board said current pipeline capacity is fully utilized and crude-by-rail infrastructure is operating at or near capacity.

But it also identified potential long-term market access solutions that could include more oilsands bitumen upgrading and reversing existing import pipelines.

Unfortunately, none of those ideas works as a meaningful short-term alternative to new pipelines — and they face many of the same speed bumps — says NEB chief economist Jean-Denis Charlebois.

“Fundamentally, what this would require is regulatory approvals and significant capital investments because those things cannot occur overnight,” he said in an interview.

“First the economics have to be there … then those alternatives need to go through a regulatory process.”

A dearth of investment dollars for traditional drilling in Western Canada means there are also fewer dollars available for developing creative options, said Kevin Birn, a vice-president with IHS Energy in Calgary.

“I think you will have some creativity but if you really want creativity, they’ve got to see a future for investment in Western Canada,” he said.

Here’s a closer look at some pipeline alternative solutions.

The diluent dilemma

Raw bitumen at room temperature has the consistency of peanut butter. Below freezing, it’s as hard as a hockey puck.

To make it flow in a pipeline, producers mix as many as three barrels of light oil “diluent” for every seven barrels of bitumen — if one can eliminate or reduce the diluent, it frees up room in the pipeline.

In January, the Alberta government announced a $440-million loan guarantee to help Value Creation Inc. build a $2-billion upgrader that would convert diluted bitumen into medium synthetic crude and diesel, both capable of flowing undiluted in a pipeline.

The facility is the first in line for up to $1 billion in provincial incentives for partial upgraders, but it isn’t expected to be operating until at least 2022.

A report prepared for the province in 2017 suggested that a 100,000-barrel-per-day partial upgrading facility could add $10 to $15 of value to each barrel of bitumen. The report listed 10 pre-commercial technologies that have been tested or proposed for deployment in Alberta.

Any plan to reduce diluent must consider the impact on U.S. customers, who have configured their refineries to use diluted bitumen, said Birn.

He added diluent will still be needed to deliver the bitumen from the field to the partial upgrader, which means diluent recovery units likely also will need to be built.

New technology

No diluent at all would be required with a new technology to mix and coat bitumen with recycled plastic and form it into solid pucks for shipping in ordinary railcars or shipping containers.

An oil company affiliated with the tiny Heart Lake First Nation in northern Alberta is building a $50-million pilot plant to test the “CanaPux” product developed by Canadian National Railway Co.

But it’s not known when a commercial facility would follow.

Pipeline efficiency

Reducing the demand for diluent in Canada could help Enbridge decide on the option to convert its Southern Lights pipeline — used to import U.S. condensate diluent into Canada — into a crude oil export pipeline with capacity of about 150,000 bpd, possibly by 2023.

Meanwhile, the operator of the biggest oil export pipeline network in Canada is getting creative as it looks at using drag reducing agents inside the pipe and redirecting some downstream U.S. injections to open up long-haul capacity for Western Canada, along with low-cost pipeline and pumping station upgrades.

It thinks it could add another 50,000 to 100,000 bpd of incremental export space by mid-year and is studying a potential 450,000 bpd of throughput optimization initiatives.

Crude-by-rail

Rail exports rose to a record of over 350,000 bpd in December before falling in January and February after Alberta imposed production cuts to reduce storage and open up space on pipelines.

They are on the rise again as Alberta loosens its production quotas and Imperial Oil Ltd. restarts rail shipments it stopped in February.

Crude shipped by rail often contains diluent but the NEB notes more oil can be put in each car if the oil isn’t diluted — although that requires the use of cars that can be heated at the destination dock to drain the bitumen.

Meanwhile, Alberta’s NDP government is pressing ahead with plans to add locomotives and railcars to move 120,000 barrels per day of crude, starting at the end of the year — although the opposition United Conservative Party has vowed to kill the order if it wins the provincial election this week.

House of Commons Speaker Geoff Regan ruled Thursday that he has no role or responsibility to police how political party caucuses conduct themselves even if Philpott and Wilson-Raybould now feel “rudderless.”

House of Commons Speaker Geoff Regan said Jane Philpott’s rights as an MP and those of Jody Wilson-Raybould were not violated. ( Sean Kilpatrick / The Canadian Press )

A new law “leaves caucuses alone with the authority to govern their internal operations,” Regan said. He said the law that Philpott was now citing explicitly stated even courts cannot review caucus decisions. “With the full authority given to caucuses themselves in such unequivocal terms, it is clear that the chair has no role in the interpretation or enforcement of this statute, even when members feel rudderless without what they feel would be clearly stated and understood rules.” The Speaker did not specifically investigate or conclude whether the Liberal caucus failed to follow proper procedures in 2015.

That’s when the Reform Act, which modified the Parliament of Canada Act, took effect and required official party caucuses to take four votes in a “recorded” manner after a general election. Those votes decide whether the caucus will adopt new powers for caucuses to have a greater say in decisions related to caucus discipline, leadership review or interim party leader. In asking Regan to intervene on Tuesday, Philpott had cited a Star report that revealed the Liberal caucus did not vote in a recorded manner in 2015. Instead the Liberal caucus came to a “consensus,” according to Liberal MP John McKay, to leave the power to decide on caucus expulsions or readmissions with the prime minister. The government and caucus chair have refused to confirm or deny how the caucus reached that consensus. Philpott said it was a breach of her privileges as an MP, and those of the former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould who backed her request to the Speaker. But Regan ruled only political party caucuses have the responsibility for ensuring proper voting procedures were followed, and their privileges were not violated even if the Liberal caucus had not done so. Trudeau had insisted the decision to eject them “was mine to make,” lawful, and backed by a united caucus.

He ejected Philpott and Wilson-Raybould last week saying they repeatedly refused to express confidence in his government and his leadership. Philpott fired back in the House of Commons.

“Expulsion should not be his decision to take unilaterally,” Philpott said Tuesday, calling it a question of fairness, due process, and the rule of law. Regan, who is an elected Liberal MP, said his only role as Speaker is to receive a letter from the caucus advising whether it made a determination on the questions. “The Speaker’s role stops there. It does not, in any way, extend to interpreting the results of the votes, how the votes were taken, or interpreting any other relevant provisions.” Philpott sits as an independent MP for Markham-Stouffville. Wilson-Raybould is the MP for Vancouver Granville. Neither has committed to running again in the fall federal election. They quit Trudeau’s cabinet over the prime minister’s handling of Wilson-Raybould’s allegations that Trudeau and his team tried to politically pressure Wilson-Raybould to overrule the public prosecutor and mediate a settlement in the corruption trial of Quebec’s SNC-Lavalin firm.

Now, researchers in the two provinces are comparing the benefits and drawbacks of the two plans.

According to economist Brett Dolter, with the University of Regina, carbon pricing generates money and that money can be recycled back to help lower-income households, stimulate the economy, or used to further reduce emissions.

Dolter said he hopes new research will help move the carbon tax discussion from one about whether or not to price it, to one about how the revenue is best spent.

""I think that's an interesting discussion to have and a more productive discussion in my mind than just always talking about should we have [carbon pricing] or not.""

Nicolas Amaya/CBC More

Dolter is teamed up with researchers Jennifer Winter and Kent Fellows with the University of Calgary School of Public Policy to compare the two approaches.

Alberta's NDP government estimated carbon pricing would bring in $2.6 billion by the end of March, since it first came into effect. Under that plan, money flows back into a mix of consumer rebates, public transit, coal phaseouts, tax reductions and more.

If elected in next week's provincial election, the United Conservative Party is promising to get rid of Alberta's carbon tax. That would mean the federal backstop would eventually kick in, at $20 per tonne until 2020 — $10 less than Alberta's current rate.

Jennifer Winter/University of Calgary More

Alberta's approach is different from Saskatchewan's since not everyone gets the rebate.

Single people earning less than $47,500 a year, or families earning less than $95,000 a year, receive a full rebate to help offset costs of the carbon levy. Households earning more than $100,000 do not receive rebates.

The provincial carbon tax website contains a prediction that about 60 per cent of Alberta households would get full or partial rebates.

Unlike the polished, visually appealing sites the governing NDP and opposition UCP have launched to attack each other in recent weeks, this one has the black-and-white esthetic of a Windows 95 text document. However bland and antiquated its look, though, it inserts a set of damning allegations into the middle of this Alberta election campaign.

The site, not-so-artfully named after the person running it, was launched earlier this month by lawyer and former power executive Robert Hemstock, who is currently suing the Alberta government, Deputy Premier Sarah Hoffman and NDP Premier Rachel Notley’s top spokesperson Cheryl Oates for defamation. It breaks down in lawyerly detail what Hemstock considers to be a series of mistakes the NDP government made as it changed the rules governing the province’s deregulated electricity market — moves he claims cost Alberta power consumers $2 billion, a niggling scandal of the NDP’s first term.

Hemstock filed the defamation suit in July 2018, based on events dating as far back as 2015, when Notley’s New Democrats were elected. The website went live after he filed a new affidavit on March 29.

He launched the suit because he believes the government unfairly blamed him for a series of contract cancellations in the power market in 2015 and 2016, based on a clause he helped negotiate into those contracts in 2000.

He launched the website because he wants to “expose” the details of the controversial episode, and because he believes the public doesn’t understand how or why those cancelled contracts ended up saddling consumers “with an estimated $2 billion in unnecessary costs” — and how the province could have avoided those mistakes in order to save Albertans money.

Both the suit and the website also appear to be an attempt by Hemstock to clear his name.

“It’s also about how our elected representatives in the Alberta Government used their position of power and access to taxpayer funds to attempt to achieve their political objective of avoiding accountability,” the website charges.

Hemstock declined to comment on the site because his defamation suit is still before the court but the affidavit filed March 29 contains a new allegation that the government has not provided all the documents requested in the case.

“That a decision was made to defame me, by implicating me as the cause of the loss of approximately $2 billion to electricity consumers, with no records showing how that decision was arrived at discloses the defendants have not discharged their obligation to provide all relevant material records,” Hemstock states in the affidavit.

“I’m not aware of anything new being filed, but because the matter is before the courts we won’t be commenting,” said Oates, who was Notley’s communications director before the writ dropped and is working on the NDP campaign.

It is a scandal. It is absolutely a scandal

Alberta’s electricity sector is unique in Canada and is confusing even for Albertans. The province has no Crown corporation like BC Hydro, SaskPower or Hydro Quebec that produces and distributes power to its residents. Instead a jumble of private-sector companies and some city-owned utilities like Calgary’s Enmax Corp. own the power plants, transmission lines and distribution networks while multiple provincial government agencies regulate or oversee the market.

In the middle of 2015, the province’s then-new NDP government increased the price industrial companies had to pay for emitting carbon in the province, which triggered an opt-out clause for many of those power producers, letting them cancel their contracts to purchase power in the province.

On his website, Hemstock called the price increase “a mistake” that government ought to have known would trigger the opt-out clause. Further mistakes, Hemstock alleges, include trying to deflect blame for the cancelled contracts, and specifically, going “on the offensive” by blaming him.

The government called the opt-out clause the “Enron clause,” after Enron Canada had asked for it to be added before that now-defunct company agreed to bid on power contracts.

Hemstock was in-house counsel for Enron Canada in the late 1990s when Alberta was in the midst of deregulating its electricity market and when the contracts in question were signed. He later joined Enmax as an executive.

In his defamation suit, Hemstock said he was employed by Enron Canada and “was not employed by nor did he advise (parent company) Enron Corporation in relation to any financial reporting obligations in the United States of America, at any time.”

Enron Corp. — rather than Enron Canada — collapsed amid a corporate scandal that included misleading investors and falsifying financial information.

In December 2015, Enmax became the first company to make use of the opt-out clause and handed the money-losing contracts it was holding over to an arms-length government agency called the Balancing Pool.

In the following months, other money-losing power contracts were also handed to the Balancing Pool, shifting the potential losses from the contracts from companies directly onto Albertans.

One power executive, speaking on condition of anonymity because they didn’t want to run afoul of the government or comment on the defamation case, said the case should be “a cautionary tale when it comes to political interference in the electric market” because electricity “is a complicated but essential commodity.”

The issue stirred up controversy in Alberta — though many residents don’t fully understand what happened — as the government moved to support the Balancing Pool through a loan.

“What I can’t fully grasp, and perhaps this is a failing on my part in opposition, is how it is that $2.2 billion has gone into the Balancing Pool, backstopped by Alberta taxpayers, and it isn’t the single greatest scandal that Albertans have seen,” said Greg Clark, then leader of the Alberta Party, in the province’s legislature in May 2017. “It is a scandal. It is absolutely a scandal.”

A decision was made to defame me

Industry groups have also sharply criticized how the government handled the series of cancelled contracts.

“Albertans should be concerned about the government’s $2.25-billion loan to the Balancing Pool and the mounting interest cost (about $400 million), which will need to be repaid,” the Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta said in a release.

The controversy is not a key focus in the current Alberta election, partly because it’s so complicated, but it is a point that parties have included in their platforms.

The UCP has promised that, if it forms government, it will “Ask the Auditor General of Alberta to conduct a special duty audit of the NDP-incurred financial losses on the power purchase agreements held through the Balancing Pool.”

In an emailed statement, the UCP said the NDP has not been transparent about their electricity market changes.

Hemstock’s defamation case is expected to drag on long after the April 16 election. He believes the government blamed him for the power contracts being handed over to the Balancing Pool.

In their statement of defence, the provincial government, Hoffman and Oates state they never referenced Hemstock directly and “as such, the statements cannot be defamatory or cause harm to the plaintiff, as alleged or at all.”

The defence also states that comments were made “as senior government officers in the performance of their official duties and are protected by absolute privilege” and their comments were “based on true facts about matters of public interest and are fair comment on a matter of public interest.”

New Democratic Party (NDP) voters – who can point to these findings as proof of their long-standing assertion that Canada’s two major parties are ...","Earlier this year, a Research Co. survey found that almost two-thirds of Canadians (64%) witnessed someone swearing in public. The poll was an early effort to look at the state of manners in our country and pinpoint some regional and generational differences.

There are many reasons that compel Canadians to swear. There is a difference in the words that we might use or hear when someone cuts us off the road while driving, or to describe the disappointing actions of a co-worker to a supervisor.

article continues below

This time, we asked Canadians about the words they hear and the words they use in four different types of conversations that may happen throughout the course of a regular day. The results show that there are situations where familiarity enables us to curse, and others where manners seem to prevail.

For starters, more than half of Canadians say they hear swear words “frequently” or “occasionally” when they are talking with friends (68%), strangers (55%), relatives (53%) and co-workers (52%).

While more than one in four Canadians (27%) say they never hear curse words in the workplace, the proportion drops when it comes to listening to relatives (15%), strangers (14%) and friends (10%).

In three provinces – British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba – seven in 10 residents (70%) report hearing swears from their friends “frequently” or “occasionally.” The most bleepable workplaces appear to be located in Ontario, where 54% of residents say their co-workers swear.

The first question deals with what we remember hearing. When it comes to our own choice of words, most Canadians (52%) admit to uttering swears “frequently” or “occasionally” when they are having a conversation with friends, but fewer say they rely on curse words when chatting with relatives (40%), co-workers (34%) and strangers (23%).

There is an elevated sense of caution in specific circumstances. Half of Canadians (49%) say they never swear when talking to strangers and two in five (41%) say they never swear when talking to co-workers.

British Columbians lead the entire country in relying on swear words “frequently” or “occasionally” when talking with friends (56%). Residents of Manitoba and Saskatchewan are first on personal swearing with relatives (45%), co-workers (41%) and strangers (26%).

Age is a factor in what we say, more than in what we hear. Canadians aged 18 to 34 are decidedly more likely to swear when chatting with friends (73%), relatives (55%), co-workers (47%) and even strangers (33%) than their older counterparts.

There is no definitive rule on when and how it is acceptable to swear. Almost half of Canadians (48%) admit that they sometimes alter the way they speak so as not to swear in front of certain people. The proportion of “conditional” swearers is highest among the youngest adult age group (57%) as well as residents of Saskatchewan and Manitoba (52%), Ontario (50%) and British Columbia (50%).

Just under two in five Canadians (38%) say they always modify the way they speak to make sure they do not swear in public. This very polite group encompasses 40% of women, 42% of baby boomers and 43% of Quebecers.

This leaves a small proportion of Canadians (14%) who claim to never alter the way they speak, and who simply do not worry about it if a swear word comes out.

On a political basis, there is no difference in the public behaviour of Liberal and Conservative voters when it comes to swearing. Equal proportions of supporters of either party in the last federal election “always” (43%), “sometimes” (43%) or “never” (14%) change the way they speak.

New Democratic Party (NDP) voters – who can point to these findings as proof of their long-standing assertion that Canada’s two major parties are the same – are less likely to “always” change their words (31%) and more likely to “sometimes” do so (58%).

Two findings leave us asking more questions. First, the gender gap is exceptionally pronounced when it comes to swearing in the workplace. While 46% of women say they never curse when chatting with co-workers, the proportion drops to 35% among men. This might point to men being more likely to get away with “locker room” talk.

Second, those in the 18-to-34 age group are the least likely to say that they never change how they speak to prevent curse words (9%), compared to 15% for baby boomers and 17% for generation X. Canada’s youngest adults have grown up in a time of looser censorship guidelines, particularly when it comes to language on television, movies and music. It is not shocking to see four-letter words in their regular thesaurus.

Because Canadian think tanks ...","The country’s various research and policy institutes “are highly adept at getting their messages heard in today’s crowded ideas marketplace,” says one expert.

As an Anishinaabe scholar who spent much of his childhood on a reserve in Central Ontario, Hayden King says he’s always found it frustrating to hear non-Indigenous experts, many of them from think tanks with ties to big business, weighing in publicly on issues that affect Canada’s First Nations. That’s why Dr. King, a widely-published expert on Indigenous nationhood and colonialism in Canada who has held academic positions at three Ontario universities – McMaster, Carleton and Ryerson – jumped at the offer to co-found and become the first executive director of the new Yellowhead Institute.

Launched last June and housed at Ryerson, the institute bills itself as Canada’s first and only think tank rooted in First Nations community networks and devoted to Indigenous self-determination. “Our goal is to provide useful analysis and produce accessible material to help communities prepare for the speed and scope of the many critical policy changes that are happening right now in Canada,” says Dr. King, who leads a small team of mostly Indigenous researchers – a core he hopes to build on by recruiting young First Nations’ academics. “It’s time that Indigenous people were considered experts in their own lives,” he says.

By the numbers

While there is no single definition of what constitutes a think tank, they are generally seen as a grouping of scholars, academics and other professionals who conduct policy-related research, analysis and advocacy on issues linked to a specific area of interest. In Canada there are roughly 100 such organizations, according to Canada’s think tank expert, Donald Abelson. This pales in comparison to the estimated 7,000 in operation worldwide, including nearly 2,000 in the United States alone.

But what Canada lacks in think tank numbers it makes up for by the quality of their work and the influence they exert, says Dr. Abelson, who has authored numerous papers and books on the subject, including Northern Lights: Exploring Canada’s Think Tank Landscape, published in 2016 by McGill-Queen’s University Press, and Do Think Tanks Matter? Assessing the Impact of Public Policy Institutes, also published by MQUP, the third edition of which was just released in November.

Formerly a political science professor at Western University, where he also served as chair of the department, Dr. Abelson was named last August as the founding director of one of Canada’s newest think tanks, the Brian Mulroney Institute of Government at St. Francis Xavier University, where he will also hold the inaugural ECN Capital Chair in Canada-U.S. Relations.

Dr. Abelson sees a bright future for think tanks as key players in modern democratic societies – not to mention an interesting source of employment for academics young and old – provided the groups are transparent and credible with regards to funding, research and intellectual integrity. “Think tanks are highly adept at getting their messages heard in today’s crowded ideas marketplace,” he says.

Policy-relevant research

It is difficult to define think tanks because no two are alike in terms of mission, scope or funding, says Dr. Abelson. “One thing all of them share at their core is an ongoing commitment to producing timely and policy-relevant research,” he says. “What distinguishes and defines them is their sources and levels of funding.”

While some think tanks charge fees for their services, the majority rely heavily on fundraising. “The bulk of their money comes from four main sources: philanthropy, corporations, private sources and government,” says Dr. Abelson. “A very small number have endowed funding.”

Complicating the landscape further is the fact that some think tanks, including the Yellowhead Institute and the Mulroney Institute of Government, are housed on university campuses. “Campuses offer advantages because salaries and other costs get covered … and you can put on seminars and conferences,” says Dr. Abelson. “You can add layers to the cake.”

He warns, however, that the success of campus-based think tanks depends on the host university’s long-term commitment. “It’s one thing to have start-up money, but it all really boils down to having a sustainable funding model,” he says. “Many think tanks start off with a bang and quickly fizzle because they couldn’t sustain their funding.”

Canada’s most notable think tank failure, he says, was the North-South Institute. Established in 1976 as an independent policy research institute dedicated to international development (hence its motto, “Research for a Fairer World”), it ceased operations in 2014 when federal government funding, which represented more than half of its budget, dried up. “It was one of the premier think tanks in the world,” says Dr. Abelson. “But its funding wasn’t as diversified as it should have been.”

A bit of history

The 19th-century European antecedents to modern think tanks were learned societies like London’s Fabian Society, which promoted democratic socialism as a way to bring about reforms peacefully instead of through armed revolution. The think tank movement caught hold in America in the early 20th century, when philanthropist groups like the Carnegie Foundation and the Brookings Institute sought to help governments think their way through complex societal issues.

That momentum led to the later emergence of specialized groups like the Rand Corporation and the Urban Institute in the 1930s and 1940s. By the 1950s and ’60s, the emergence of a strong corporate mentality in the U.S. led to the rise of modern advocacy think tanks, which are the main focus of Dr. Abelson’s research.

“They moved away from a research model to one focused more on the marketing of ideas to influence policy makers,” he says. “It marked a watershed in the evolution of think tanks.”

According to Dr. Abelson, the new model enabled think tanks to influence government policy like never before – none more successfully than the Heritage Foundation. Created in 1973 with massive financing from big business, it assembled dozens of conservative academics and thinkers from across the U.S. who drew up the blueprint for Ronald Reagan’s presidency in the early 1980s.

Their 1,000-page report, which was hand delivered to Ed Meese, Reagan’s chief policy advisor, contained plans for both foreign and domestic policies ranging from deregulation, tax reform and privatization to what eventually became the Strategic Defence Initiative, nicknamed Star Wars. “Reagan was the poster boy for how influential think tanks can be and why they matter,” says Dr. Abelson. “They helped give structure, meaning and direction to his presidency.”

In Canada, Dr. Abelson says think tanks have been less successful in penetrating the political decision-making process. “They are not as prevalent here because ideas tend to come from the caucus and the party,” he says.

Because Canadian think tanks also have far less money at their disposal, Dr. Abelson says many of them put added value in their independence and research capabilities, and are more nuanced in their opinions. “They have to be careful not to be seen as appendages of the groups or movements they are affiliated with or their funds might dry up,” he says. “They need to be seen as doing quality work as independent bodies.”

Most Canadian think tanks, he adds, do a “very good job” of finding a niche to fill. “Their mortality rate is very low,” he says. “The most successful ones don’t alienate others.”

Two broad categories

Guillaume Lamy, a doctoral student at the Université du Québec à Montréal who has also researched think tanks, has a slightly different take, saying most of them generally fall into one of two broad categories.

“One [type] does serious, useful and good research and is not controversial,” says Mr. Lamy, who is also a host and producer with Quebec’s Canal Savoir. He points to Canada’s two wealthiest think tanks – the Conference Board of Canada, with a $40-million budget and the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), with a $25-million budget – as prime examples.

The other category is what Mr. Lamy calls “combat think tanks” that defend or advocate on behalf of ideologies and policies outside the political system. He includes within this category neoliberal economic organizations like the Fraser Institute and the Institut économique de Montréal, and – on the other end of the spectrum – environmental activist groups like the Suzuki Foundation. “These groups are sometimes very militant,” he says. “They are like the last stage of political ideology.”

The Fraser Institute is the only Canadian organization to rank among the top 25 non-U.S. think tanks in the 2018 Global Go To Think Tank Index, published by the University of Pennsylvania’s Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, of which Mr. Lamy is a collaborator. CIGI just missed the top-25 list, placing 27th in the index.

Mr. Lamy says that, like in the U.S., the advent of right-wing think tanks in Canada such as the Fraser Institute led to the creation of counterbalancing left-wing think tanks like the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives and, in Quebec, the Institut de recherche et d’informations socio-économiques. He says the research being produced by both sides – work that defends the groups’ ideologies – has led to increasing polarization.

“These think tanks are taking the place of political parties in public debate,” says Mr. Lamy. “They can be, and often are, far more radicalized and singular in their research and positions than political parties because political parties need to remain attractive to a wider population base.”

He says the continuous stream of data and opinion on matters of public interest from these groups now dominate news cycles. “You can’t have a debate today without opinions and studies and facts from think tank experts,” says Mr. Lamy. “It’s very difficult to pierce the media’s membrane if you don’t have a study with data that backs up your argument.”

Andrew Parkin, director of the Mowat Centre, agrees. The centre, which calls itself “Ontario’s Voice on Public Policy,” is housed at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, where Dr. Parkin is also an associate professor. He says groups like his are adding policy capacity to important public discussions.

“Non-urgent public policy thinking has been thinned out over time through government cutbacks, and the redeployment of public servants more towards keeping the government running and dealing with daily issues,” says Dr. Parkin, who served with the Council of Ministers of Education Canada before joining the Mowat Centre in 2017.

Dr. Parkin says the arm’s-length research being done by the Mowat Centre’s small group of researchers on subjects of their choosing – but always in line with the think tank’s core mandate – provides a way for the government of the day to “almost think out loud” by exploring ideas without a partisan agenda.

“It’s not easy for governments to generate or engage in public conversations around things that haven’t happened yet but could in two, five or 10 years from now,” says Dr. Parkin. “By doing that we’re providing a valuable public service.”

Pamela Sugiman, dean of the faculty of arts at Ryerson, sees the advent of the new Yellowhead Institute in much the same light. “Now is a good time because there is so much discussion around Indigenous issues that go way beyond the academic realm,” she Dr. Sugiman, a sociologist and scholar on gender and race politics in Canada. The institute, she says, is “the university’s response to Truth and Reconciliation” and will act as a platform for the recruitment of Indigenous students from across Canada. “There’s a lot of pride in what we’re doing.”",Think tanks fill an important niche within Canada’s public policy landscape,University Affairs,https://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/think-tanks-fill-an-important-niche-within-canadas-public-policy-landscape/

Submitted

A Fernie woman has gained new insight into the inner workings of Canadian politics and a sisterhood of future female leaders after a political leadership program in Ottawa.

McKinley Richards was one of 338 women selected to represent their community and communicate their vision for Canada at the Daughters of the Vote 2019 program from April 1-4.

LOOK BACK: Fernie woman to represent Kootenay-Columbia riding in Parliament

“It was really exciting, it was a very interesting experience,” said the 21-year-old Fernie Secondary graduate. “Very insightful, I learned a lot for sure.”

During the program, delegates were addressed by every federal party leader and had a chance to engage with Ministers, critics, and advocates.

Richards was representing the Kootenay-Columbia riding and took her local MP Wayne Stetski’s seat during a historic sitting in House of Commons last Wednesday.

She previously worked as a page in the House and described the sitting as the highlight of the program.

“When I was working as a page, it was really visible that less than 30 per cent of the MPs were women,” she said.

“It was something that we noticed and something we talked about as the pages. I never thought that I would witness an all-female house and I think that’s kind of cool that (Daughters of the Vote organizer) Equal Voice made that happen.”

Richards also got a taste of the media furor and scandal that often surrounds politics.

Daughters of the Vote made headlines when a number of delegates shunned Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in protest of his handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair, which involves alleged political interference and obstruction of justice by the Prime Minister’s Office.

During the historic sitting in the House of Commons, delegates heard from the leaders of each party, with a number of women walking out during Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer’s speech then turning their backs on Trudeau.

The protest followed the ejection of former justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott from the Liberal Caucus.

Richards welcomed the opportunity to hear from each party leader. However, she was shocked by some of the media coverage of the delegates’ protest.

“It was really great that they took the time to speak to the Daughters of the Vote,” she said. “That showed that this initiative is something that’s important to them.

“There definitely was a lot of different responses to those speeches and I think whether you agree with… the responses of walking out or turning their backs, you can’t deny that it did take a lot of courage for those women to use their space and to stand up for their values and what they believe in.

“I think it did show that women are powerful and present in Canadian politics, but, more importantly, that we have that power and that’s why it’s important to include women in the conversation.

“That’s what Equal Voice is about – not the partisan side of things. It’s really to empower women to be involved and be part of the conversation.”

Richards is studying international economics and development with a minor in management at the University of Ottawa. She is passionate about global quality education, social entrepreneurship and women’s empowerment, and hoped to raise these issues during Daughters of the Vote.

“One of the biggest things I was looking forward to discussing is the importance of including women and marginalized people to take on those leadership roles, and supporting each other and being a part of important decision making,” she said.

“But a lot of the other issues that were discussed are also really important to me. There were some great speeches about climate action, further development of reconciliation, the importance of mental health awareness – things that definitely need more attention on an international scale.”

Following the Ottawa event, Richards and her fellow delegates are now eligible for a leadership grant to accelerate advocacy efforts in their local communities.

She will return to Fernie this summer before graduating from university in December.

“I’m really looking forward to working on something, most likely in Fernie,” she said.

While Daughters of the Vote may not have inspired a future career in federal politics for Richards, it has given her new insight into the inner workings of Canadian government and a sisterhood of future female leaders.

She currently works for development organization Cuso International and hopes to one day start her own non-profit or social enterprise.

“There are a lot of different ways to make change,” she said.

Equal Voice has secured funding for another Daughters of the Vote program in 2021 and Richards encouraged women aged 18-23 in the Kootenay-Columbia region to apply.

“It’s pretty cool that initiatives like this are becoming more common and are really to support that diversity inclusion in politics and in leadership in general,” said Richards.",Daughters of the Vote eye opening for Fernie woman,The Free Press,https://www.thefreepress.ca/local-news/daughters-of-the-vote-eye-opening-for-fernie-woman/

Some 50 NDP ...","Alberta NDP supporters rallied Sunday, accusing Jason Kenney’s UCP of harbouring plans to unleash toll roads on the province should they form the next provincial government.

Some 50 NDP candidates, supporters and truck drivers gathered in Calgary to oppose a notion previously pitched by Kenney to consider “user-pay” mechanisms for new highway infrastructure.

Parmeet Singh, NDP candidate for Calgary-Falconridge, said road tolls would take money out of the pockets of Albertan families.

“Right across Alberta, families will suffer, we will suffer. They will be penalized for driving to work, picking up groceries, taking their kids to hockey or any other sports and these tolls will hurt businesses,” said Singh, who said many supporters in his riding are involved in taxi and trucking industries and would be negatively impacted.

The UCP platform, released last week, calls for the use of “alternative financing” for building public infrastructure, including public-private partnerships, but makes no reference to “user-pay” systems, commonly referred to as road tolls.

However, in January, UCP spokeswoman Christine Myatt told Postmedia if the party forms the government then tolls for projects, such as a road built to benefit industry, would be on the table.

The same month, Kenney said, “We’re going to have to find more creative ways of paying for modern infrastructure in the future, including more public-private partnerships, including, as I’ve said, where it makes sense, user-pay,” during a Facebook livestream video.

The UCP declined to comment Sunday on whether they’ve ruled out tolls for future infrastructure.

Instead, spokesman Matt Solberg only made reference to current infrastructure and said the UCP has “never suggested applying tolls to existing roads.”

Irfan Sabir, seeking re-election in Calgary-McCall, called on Kenney to “come clean” about his position on road tolls.

“We know that on six different occasions he has weighed in favour of tolls,” said Sabir, who shared Singh’s views that they would adversely impact small businesses and families.

“We are saying no to that. Premier Rachel Notley has made it abundantly clear that we will not (introduce) fees or tolls on these roads.”

Under a returning NDP government, Rachel Notley has promised to push ahead with a second route out of Fort McMurray so residents of the northern city would never have to live through the same circumstances of 2016 where residents evacuated down a single choked highway to escape raging wildfires.

The party has also vowed to expand the Alberta high-load corridor over the next six years to the tune of $1.35 billion.

The high-load corridor is a 6,500-kilometre network of roads across the province, which can accommodate heavy vehicles weighing up to 800 tonnes, and up to 12.8 metres tall. Notley’s plan would expand the network by 3,500 kilometres.

“We know that better schools, better hospitals, better roads, better bridges, they generate economic activity,” said Sabir. They attract investment, they attract businesses. So we will continue to make sure Alberta has the infrastructure that supports a diversified, 21st-century economy.”

He said the NDP is reflecting the views of Albertans.

“Today, on the doorsteps, everywhere — businesses, families — they are telling me that we cannot afford tolls on our roads,” said Sabir.",New Democratic Party urging opposition to 'come clean' on support for toll roads,Calgary Herald,https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/new-democratic-party-urging-opposition-to-come-clean-on-support-for-toll-roads

At The New York Times, resident propellerheads Nate Cohn and Kevin Quealy find that “[t]oday’s Democratic Party is increasingly perceived as dominated by its ‘woke’ left wing.","© The Federalist Will The Democratic Party Faithful Ever Notice Their Leaders Are Crazy?

Editor’s note: The opinions in this article are the author’s, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.

After almost two weeks of critical media coverage of Joe Biden’s handsy history, poll after poll indicates most Democrats do not care. The latest Quinnipiac poll—of California, no less—has the yet-to-announce Biden easily leading Bernie Sanders and favorite daughter Kamala Harris. This poll also has Harris performing better among white liberals than nonwhite voters.

These findings are mostly news to the progressive elites at the top of Democratic politics and the establishment media. The data suggesting the Democratic Party is an upstairs/downstairs coalition in which a small faction of disproportionately white progressives dominate a more diverse rank-and-file has been piling up in studies by More in Common, Pew, and Gallup. In recent days, some in the media have finally begun to notice.

At The New York Times, resident propellerheads Nate Cohn and Kevin Quealy find that “[t]oday’s Democratic Party is increasingly perceived as dominated by its ‘woke’ left wing. But the views of Democrats on social media often bear little resemblance to those of the wider Democratic electorate.” They add: “The outspoken group of Democratic-leaning voters on social media is outnumbered, roughly 2 to 1, by the more moderate, more diverse and less educated group of Democrats who typically don’t post political content online.”

Cohn and Quealy report that approximately a quarter of Democrats are progressive ideologues; only a tenth might identify as democratic socialists. “The rest of the party is easy to miss,” they write. “Not only is it less active on social media, but it is also under-represented in the well-educated, urban enclaves where journalists roam.”

Similarly, Third Way—a group representing centrist Democrats—has released a poll finding a similar chasm between the woke mob on social media and other Democrats: “On the question of whether Democrats want a candidate who will appeal to a broad range of voters or move left to energize progressives and liberals, voters who do not post on Twitter prefer broad appeal by 57 points, while active Tweeters prefer broad appeal by a much narrower 27 points.”

CNN data guru Harry Enten observes, contra the conventional wisdom, moderates and conservatives still make up roughly half of Democratic voters, while only 19 to 25 percent consider themselves “very liberal.” Moreover, “Millennials and Generation Z voters (roughly those younger than 40)... made up just about 29% of all Democratic voters in the 2018 midterm, per Catalist [a firm that maintains a voter database for Democratic and progressive causes].” Voters over fifty constituted 56 percent of Democratic voters in 2018.

Enten further reports that while Democrats are becoming more likely to have a college degree, almost 60 percent of those who voted in 2018 did not. He adds that “[e]ven among white Democrats... Catalist calculates the percentage of 2018 Democratic voters without a college degree at about 54%, compared to 46% who had a college degree.”

Enten’s analysis tracks that of Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress best known for having co-authored “The Emerging Democratic Majority,” which convinced so many on the left that demographics was destiny. Early this year, Teixiera and his colleagues found that “2016 voters were 44 percent white non-college and just 30 percent white college-educated...This suggests the exit polls were not just wrong but massively wrong, especially in the context of Rust Belt swing states, where errors were even larger and the political implications of misunderstanding graver.”

Teixiera later expanded on the implications of the exit poll distortions: “This is especially worrisome because white non-college voters remain a larger group than white college voters in almost all states — and are far larger in the Rust Belt states that gave the Democrats so much trouble in 2016: Iowa is 62 percent white non-college versus 31 percent white college; Michigan is 54 percent white non-college versus 28 percent white college; Ohio splits 55 percent to 29 percent; Pennsylvania 51 percent to 31 percent; and Wisconsin 58 percent to 32 percent.”

The woke are not only dismissive of white working-class voters, but also (ironically) of the black voters who may be crucial to the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. As Enten observed in another analysis, “black voters make up about the same part of the Democratic Party as two parts that a lot of analysts like to hype for their growing power (college-educated white voters and very liberal voters).” Black voters also often act as a bloc, a key to Barack Obama edging out Hillary Clinton in 2008, and to Clinton defeating Bernie Sanders in 2016.

Both Enten and Dan McLaughlin have emphasized the degree to which Southern states will dominate the Democratic primaries after Iowa and New Hampshire. This is where, as Cohn and Quealy map it, “the rest of the party” lives and votes. The calendar will boost the clout of more moderate, establishmentarian Democrats, both black and white.

Despite the mounting evidence, it remains easy to find pundits peddling the narrative that Democrats cannot wait to vote for a socialist or an identity politician to be their standard-bearer in 2020. On a recent edition of NBC’s “Meet The Press,” Anna Palmer and Jake Sherman of Politico were pushing the line that Biden was in trouble (he isn’t), while progressive think tanker Heather McGhee did not think “Biden represents the kind of change particularly that younger voters, who are the biggest bloc in 2020 [they likely aren’t], need to see.”

More broadly, outlets like TIME and Newsweek continue to stick Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar on their covers as the faces of the Democratic Party:

“Why are Conservatives so obsessed with the Freshman Representatives?” pic.twitter.com/eqJxLSx1Lx — Tactile Outloud (@RantsOutloud) April 9, 2019

In fairness, the Democrats are a few percent more leftward and a few percent more credentialed than in past cycles, due largely to younger Democrats growing into adult voting behavior. But it’s still closer to your parents’ Democratic Party than the woke on social media and cable news believe. The woke may be in for a rude awakening.

There are nearly 20 candidates in the race.

The leader in most polls, former Vice President Joe Biden, is still a week or more away from a possible announcement.

And in a new poll in big-prize California, Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are all out-polling a U.S. senator from New York and a former governor of Colorado.

The Democratic Party is still in the process of redefining itself. It figures to be a while before its voters can define who its 2020 candidate will be.

The next stage in campaigning will likely be all about making the stage.

With initial fundraising totals in and a pivot to the spring and summer, expect the focus to adjust over the next few months around who in the Democratic primary has qualified for the first debate.

(Steven Senne/AP, FILE) Presidential hopeful U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, addresses an audience during a meet and greet, Sunday, Feb. 17, 2019, in North Hampton, N.H.

The Democratic National Committee has imposed new debate qualification standards. Candidates must earn at least 1 percent of respondents in three national or early-state polls conducted between January 2019 and two weeks before the given debate have receive donations from at least 65,000 individuals across 20 different states, with a minimum of 200 unique donors per state. Debate participants are limited to 20.

Wednesday night, Gabbard announced that she had met one of the thresholds to secure a podium. The congresswoman from Hawaii said she received contributions from more than 65,000 donors.

Yang, a relatively unknown businessman, already announced he's cleared that watermark too.

Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who is still weighing a bid for president, signaled Wednesday he is much closer to making a final decision.

But McAuliffe, who has deep connections in Democratic circles that could make him a fundraising powerhouse, faces a familiar challenge: distinguishing himself from the pack. But he might set himself apart with a centrist appeal and a resume with extensive executive experience.

“Governors don't talk, we've got to deliver. You have to look at the governors because they are CEOs,"" he said Wednesday, sandwiched between several declared candidates who all delivered similar pro-union pitches. ""We have to work with folks to get it done. I'll work with anybody.""

This year, it seems, not so much.

While the 2019 speakers list was stacked with officials from President Donald Trump's administration and Republican Party grandees, most major Democratic presidential candidates for 2020 were missing from the conference altogether.

The three-day event, which ended Tuesday, included speeches from Vice-President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy.

So I am troubled that leading Democrats seem to have some difficulty plainly calling out anti-semitism within their own ranks. And I am troubled that many of the declared Democrat presidential candidates seem to be avoiding <a href=""https://twitter.com/AIPAC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@AIPAC</a> this year. —@senatemajldr

Nine of the biggest names in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination skipped the conference this year, and not one Democratic candidate was on the speakers list.

Jewish Americans have long aligned themselves with liberal causes. About 75 per cent of Jews voted Democratic in the 2018 midterms. But some delegates at this year's conference noted with dismay recent comments by freshman Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar that they felt trafficked in stereotypes about Jewish political influence and money.

Recent polling suggests there is more willingness among younger progressive voters to criticize Israel.

Some AIPAC attendees who spoke with CBC News wondered whether the party has shifted too far to the left. Here's what some of them said.

Michael Goldberg, 49, Democrat from New York:

Michael Goldberg is waiting for a more 'centrist' Democrat to get in the race. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

""It used to be that Democrats and Republicans had to fight to get a spot on the stage,"" Goldberg said.

Noting the lack of 2020 candidates on the speakers' list, he asked, ""Who's here that's running for the presidency for the Democrats?""

The attorney and father of three admitted that he feels ""a bit politically lost.""

He supported Barack Obama during his two terms in office. He and his wife have been ""lifelong Democrats,"" and are still registered with the party. But they voted for Trump in 2016 and may do so again in 2020, unless a Democrat they consider ""more centrist"" decides to run.

The ‘Jexodus’ movement encourages Jewish people to leave the Democrat Party. Total disrespect! Republicans are waiting with open arms. Remember Jerusalem (U.S. Embassy) and the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal! <a href=""https://twitter.com/OANN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@OANN</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/foxandfriends?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@foxandfriends</a> —@realDonaldTrump

Asked about talk of an ""Exodus"" or ""Jexodus"" — a movement begun by conservatives to woo Jewish-Americans away from the Democrats to the Republicans — Goldberg gave a knowing nod.

""It's me and my wife. That's what happened,"" he said. ""The Democrats were friends of the Jewish people. They were friends of Israel. But it's a different party now.""

Vicki Fishman, 47, Independent from Washington, D.C.:

Vicki Fishman is an Independent who lives in Washington. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

""The American Jewish community stands for social justice, and the Democratic Party has positioned itself as being the party of social justice,"" Fishman said.

She's aware the eventual Democratic nominee often addresses AIPAC in an election year, as has been the case in the past three presidential election cycles, and that the upcoming election is still 19 months away.

""This is an off-year,"" she said.

Indeed, AIPAC's policy is to invite presidential candidates to speak only in election years. Even so, Hillary Clinton addressed AIPAC in 2016 as well as the off-year in 2015. Obama spoke there before the 2008 election, as well as in 2011 and again in the lead-up to his re-election in 2012. In 2007, a non-election year, both Clinton and Obama competed for Jewish voters, holding big events at AIPAC.

Rep. Ilhan Omar's tweets have ""complicated"" the public discourse for the Democratic Party, Fishman said. But she considers it to be a distraction.

""We're living in a polarized country right now, and that's just adding to the general polarization, and maybe that's taking up within the party.""

Katie Draisen, 20, Democrat from Boston:

""There are so many conservative politicians here. It's really concerning to me as someone who is pro-Israel, Jewish-American because it feels to me like Jewish-Americans are being used by Republicans to gain voters,"" said Draisen, a self-described liberal Democrat.

""Knowing that Mitch McConnell is here, that makes me want to throw up.""

Draisen, a student at Boston University, supports Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren's bid for the Democratic nomination, though she declined to attend the conference.

Trump's closeness with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has aroused skepticism among her Gen Z progressive friends ""who see Israel and pro-Israel Americans as villains,"" Draisen said.

Netanyahu was listed as a speaker, but skipped AIPAC after a Gaza rocket attack. Netanyahu sent in a video address from Israel on Tuesday. A few months earlier, he reportedly told an aide, ""We don't need AIPAC anymore,"" reasoning he had enough support from American evangelicals and Trump.

Dismayed as she was that major Democratic 2020 hopefuls didn't attend, Draisen also said she saw political risk for them had they showed up at AIPAC. Doing so, she said, would be ""a big turnoff to most liberal Democrats.""

""It's unfortunate because I think most people don't understand the importance of supporting Israel, supporting a two-state solution, and learning.""

Marcia Jacobs, 86, Republican from Los Angeles:

Marcia Jacobs says she likes many of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

Trump wasn't Jacobs's first choice to be president, but she has come to see the commander-in-chief as a staunch ally of Israel. Among the actions that convinced her was the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, as well as its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel by moving the embassy there.

""He supports it so strongly, and [Democrats] are so anti-Trump that they're letting it affect any other issue,"" she said.

Jacobs was appalled by reports that the liberal non-profit MoveOn.org had urged Democratic candidates not to attend AIPAC.

""That's absolutely horrific,"" she said.

She also praised Trump for his tweet last week reversing more than 50 years of U.S. foreign policy on the Golan Heights by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the strategically important strip of rocky highlands located where the borders meet between northern Israel, southern Lebanon and Syria.

Manny Srulowitz, 18, Independent from Long Island, N.Y.:

Srulowitz, a moderate, said he was receiving emails last week from a pro-Israel organization informing him about the latest Democrats to pull out of AIPAC. He comes from a Republican household that voted for Trump in 2016.

""I wouldn't have enough knowledge to give you a confident answer about why the Democrats are all leaving,"" he said, ""but it's very evident the Democrats are not here.""

The high school senior from Long Island will be 20 years old in 2020, but doesn't see a Democratic candidate yet who would capture his vote.

""I have noticed there is a new wave of young and critical Democrats, usually the younger ones,"" he said of what he sees as declining support for Israel among people of his generation. ""I am not one of them. I am a big fan of the state of Israel.""

As ""middle-of-the-roaders"" who try to avoid extremes in their politics, this is a fraught time for Ira and Susan Kapinow, married retirees and strong supporters of Israel.

Susan was troubled by support among at least two Democratic newcomers in Congress for the so-called BDS movement — a campaign calling for a boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel.

""I find it offensive. Israel is a strong ally and a strong friend,"" Susan said.

The Kapinows can't see themselves happily voting for Trump in 2020. But when they look at the growing divide over Israel within the Democratic Party, they have concerns about how the progressive candidates are breaking with what they viewed as conventional pro-Israel policy.

""It's certainly a new phenomenon and it seems to be generational,"" Ira said. ""The older Democrats were more supportive of Israel, the more traditional way. The younger Democrats are moving more and more to the left on Israel. Way too far left.""

""You would like to see some presidential candidates from both sides, but we don't have the presidential candidate from the Republican side, either,"" he said.

He wasn't concerned about the lack of big-name Democratic presidential hopefuls this year, noting that top Democrats in Congress such as Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave speeches, as well as House majority leader Steny Hoyer.

Eisenberg balked at the idea of a ""Jexodus.""

""I think it's overblown,"" he said. ""You have certain people on the right and certain people on the left that have different views about Israel. Both parties have taken a turn to the radical side on both extremes, but in the general majority of the party on both sides, there has always been bipartisan support for Israel. That continues.""",Lack of big-name Democratic candidates at pro-Israel conference confirms for some voters the party has changed,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/aipac-democrats-jexodus-1.5072069

And Omar, who continues tweeting ...","House TV via CNN

Friday marks the Democrats' first 100 days in control of the House of Representatives and the first 100 days of the dynamic freshman class that has captured national attention, tested leadership, commandeered the conversation and, at times, the Democratic legislative agenda.

The group of more than 60 new Democratic members -- diverse, young, with strength in their record-setting numbers -- have not been without controversy over the last three months in office, which has threatened at times to overshadow the work of the broader Democratic House caucus.

To mark the first 100 days on their ""own terms,"" nearly all of the freshmen contributed to a video to highlight what work they have accomplished in the first 100 days, led by freshman Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois.

""I conducted oversight of big banks, credit reporting agencies and Trump officials who cheated consumers,"" says freshman Rep. Katie Porter, who has created many viral moments of her questioning during committee hearings, in the video.

Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia, whose son Vernon Jordan was killed by gun violence, says H.R. 8 is her biggest accomplishment, adding it would affect ""federal background checks for all gun sales and HR. 1112, closing the Charleston loophole.""

The video has short vignettes from all but one freshman -- some are serious, noting policy proposals they've started making headway on.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York touts the ""90 co-sponsors"" of her Green New Deal proposal. Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts mentions the amendment she's offered to lower the voting age to 16 years old. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota cites that she introduced and passed in the House the PAUL Act to strengthen the enforcement of foreign lobbying and to crack down on lobbyists who represent human rights abusers.

Others focus on the basics like building a ""diverse staff"" in the first 100 days, holding town halls or answering constituents' letters as one of their accomplishments.

""I hope that people get a chance to know some people that that they might not have heard from before. We have a lot of superstars in our class,"" Underwood told CNN about organizing the video. ""Putting out a bold statement that says we're here, we're effective, we're impactful and look at what we've done in just a short amount of time.""

Making news right out the gate

Indeed, many of the freshmen have made big impressions on the caucus, winning high-profile committee assignments and introducing key legislation for the Democratic agenda. Some, like Porter, have created viral moments by breaking the mold of typical questioning on hearings.

Their boldness has also created moments of controversy in a short amount of time.

On day one -- the first night of the new Congress -- freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan declared that she and her fellow lawmakers were going to ""impeach the motherf**ker,"" referring to President Donald Trump.

It was exactly the kind of rhetoric that Democratic leaders were worried about as they assumed the new majority. While it fired up the progressive base, it fed into a narrative that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had long been trying to manage: that Democrats were bloodthirsty for Trump's ouster and would undermine their own credibility if they moved too fast.

Tlaib's comment quickly dominated the headlines, and Democrats arrived to the Capitol the next morning facing questions from reporters about her remarks. Two months later, as Tlaib unapologetically prepared to introduce an impeachment resolution, Pelosi forcefully reiterated her view that Democrats should not pursue impeachment unless there was significant evidence. ""He's just not worth it,"" she added.

Pelosi's comments threw a massive bucket of cold water on Capitol Hill, and -- in a sign of the California Democrat's powerful influence over her caucus -- most members soon fell in line with downplaying impeachment. Only one other Democrat at the time joined Tlaib to support the resolution that she ultimately introduced in a rollout that had little fanfare.

But the drama over Tlaib's comment paled in comparison to controversial tweets made by Omar. Critics, including many Democrats, argued the Minnesota freshman invoked anti-Semitic tropes and stereotypes in her comments criticizing US support for Israel.

Within a month, the House found itself voting on two resolutions condemning anti-Semitism -- both of which were seen as rebukes against Omar. While she apologized for some of her comments, she didn't apologize for everything and the debate exposed an emotional division among Democrats about US support for Israel.

Republicans seized on the fracture, and with the President's help, started painting Democrats as an anti-Jewish party -- another distraction that Democrats lamented as they sought to promote their own legislative agenda.

And Omar, who continues tweeting provocative comments -- including just this week, calling Stephen Miller a ""white nationalist"" -- has not shied away from taking on her critics head on, even those within her party.

""It's been interesting to see such a powerful conference of people be so fearful of a freshman member of Congress,"" Omar told CNN in March responding to criticism from members of her own party at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in Washington, DC. ""I hope that they figure out a way to not allow me to have a permanent residency in their heads.""

Omar drew criticism again this week over a comment that many viewed as minimizing the tragic events of 9/11. Refusing to back down, Omar went on the ""Late Show"" with Stephen Colbert to fend off attacks over her patriotism. ""I am as American as everyone else is,"" she said.

The Twitter question

In the same way that Republican lawmakers get irked by the President's tweets, some Democrats have begun expressing similar frustration with their own colleagues, many of those freshmen who came into office with powerful social media followings.

As the Omar controversies unfolded, multiple members called for colleagues to ease up on the tweets.

""What we need to do is not be out there Twittering,"" Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan told reporters last month. ""We need to talk to each other.""

But Twitter is the same platform that has launched some of these freshmen into unprecedented fame. Many of them came into Congress using social media in nontraditional ways, from showing behind-the-scenes moments of their new journey to calling people out directly on Twitter.

Ocasio-Cortez has built the largest following on Twitter, now with close to 4 million followers, surpassing even Pelosi.

AOC, as she is known, has become a media sensation that has soaked up a significant amount of coverage of the freshmen class.

She regularly takes to her Twitter account to respond to news of the day, to take on Republican attacks directly, engage with journalists and call out what she sees as sexism on Capitol Hill. She also uses Instagram to show everyday life moments as a new congresswoman, featuring her at times cooking or assembling furniture in her apartment.

Democratic leaders have largely sought to harness her Twitter use rather than dampen it. She, along with Democratic Rep. Jim Himes, were invited to give a Twitter training in January to other members.

Still, Ocasio-Cortez's celebrity status marks a highly unusual trajectory for a freshman member and bucks the strategy that many take of laying low at the beginning of their service.

Omar, in an appearance on the Stephen Colbert this week, said she also does not agree with those who tell her to ""go slow"" in Congress.

""Women have been told to go slow and not be seen and not be heard for many years,"" she said of herself, Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez. ""We are not there to be quiet. We are not there to be invisible.""

Balancing a large class

Democratic leaders largely describe the attention on freshmen as a positive thing for the caucus, even as they try to corral and balance the power of a few within the broader context of the whole Democratic caucus.

""I think they are ... a force to reckon with and we're trying to reckon with them,"" House Whip James Clyburn told CNN last month.

""Somebody else's progress or success in the public arena is a plus for all of us,"" Pelosi said at an event last month, when asked if it bothers her at all that younger members are in the spotlight. ""It isn't a zero sum game that if you have this, then that subtracts from something else. Again, I thrive on the diversity.""

Still, some feel frustrated with the media coverage, arguing only a few members of the freshman class are getting all the attention.

""If you read the papers or watch television, and you ask who are the new members of Congress, you come up with three names,"" Hoyer told reporters last month. ""There are 59 other extraordinarily competent, capable people. I mean it's an extraordinary class. I think it deserves the attention of all of you.""

""I think the coverage does not project what is the reality,"" he added.

Leaders are eager to showcase their majority-making freshmen and the backgrounds they bring. Hoyer and Pelosi happily appear at their press conferences to support their initiatives. Hoyer, for example, joined Underwood last week as she helped announce a new caucus on black maternal health.

Rep. Colin Allred, who won a previously red district in Texas, has been a big name on efforts by Democrats to preserve the Affordable Care Act.

Leaders are also arguing their caucus is unified despite the ups and downs from the past 100 days. It's a message they've especially tried to convey to reporters at the Democratic issues conference in Virginia this week.

""We have such a unified caucus,"" Pelosi told the press, criticizing their coverage. ""You're on the wrong track. But you can waste your time on that while we go forward with what we are going to do for the American people.""",House Democratic freshmen celebrate first 100 days,channel4000.com,http://www.channel4000.com/nation/politics/house-democratic-freshmen-celebrate-first-100-days/1068510301

(Reuters) - The largest Democratic field in the modern political era is lining up to seek the party's 2020 presidential nomination - and is expected to keep growing.

The diverse group vying to challenge President Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee, includes six U.S. senators. A record six women are running, as well as black, Hispanic and openly gay candidates who would make history if one of them became the party's nominee.

Here are the Democrats who have launched campaigns or are expected to pursue a presidential bid, listed in order of their RealClearPolitics national polling average for those who register in opinion surveys.

(For a graphic, see: tmsnrt.rs/2Ff62ZC)

JOE BIDEN

The leader in polls of Democratic presidential contenders is not even a candidate yet. But Biden, who served eight years as vice president under former President Barack Obama and 36 years in the U.S. Senate, looks poised to join the 2020 race. At 76, he will be the second oldest candidate in the Democratic nominating contests, after Senator Bernie Sanders. Biden will be a key figure in the Democratic debate over whether a liberal political newcomer or a centrist veteran is needed to win back the White House. Liberal activists criticize his Senate record, including his authorship of the 1994 crime act that led to increased incarceration rates, and his ties to the financial industry, which is prominent in his home state of Delaware. Biden, who relishes his ""Middle-Class Joe"" nickname and touts his working-class roots, made unsuccessful bids for the nomination in 1988 and 2008. Biden, recently the subject of allegations of unwanted physical contact with women, pledged in a video to be ""more mindful"" of respecting ""personal space,"" an attempt to tamp down the controversy.

BERNIE SANDERS

The senator from Vermont lost the Democratic nomination in 2016 to Hillary Clinton but has jumped in for a second try. In the 2020 race, Sanders, 77, will have to fight to stand out in a packed field of liberal progressives touting issues he brought into the Democratic Party mainstream four years ago. His proposals include free tuition at public colleges, a $15 minimum wage and universal healthcare. He benefits from strong name recognition and a robust network of small-dollar donors, helping him to raise $5.9 million during his first day in the contest. Sanders, whose father was a Jewish immigrant from Poland, has shown a more personal side in this campaign, highlighting his struggles while growing up in a working-class family. He also has tried to reach out to black and Hispanic leaders after having trouble winning over minority voters in 2016.

KAMALA HARRIS

The first-term U.S. senator from California would make history as the first black woman to gain the nomination. Harris, 54, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, announced her candidacy on the holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. She has made a quick impact in a Democratic race that will be heavily influenced by women and minority voters. She raised $1.5 million in the first 24 hours of her campaign and drew record ratings on a CNN televised town hall. She supports a middle-class tax credit, Medicare for All healthcare funding reform, the Green New Deal and the legalization of marijuana. Her track record as San Francisco’s district attorney and California’s attorney general has drawn scrutiny in a Democratic Party that has shifted in recent years on criminal justice issues.

BETO O’ROURKE

The former three-term Texas congressman jumped into the race on March 14 - and has been jumping onto store countertops ever since to deliver his optimistic message to voters in early primary states. O'Rourke, 46, gained fame last year for his record fundraising and ability to draw crowds ahead of his unexpectedly narrow loss in the U.S. Senate race against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz. O'Rourke announced a $6.1 million fundraising haul for the first 24 hours of his campaign, besting his Democratic opponents. But with progressive policies and diversity at the forefront of the party's nominating battle, O'Rourke will face a challenge as a wealthy white man who is more moderate on several key issues than many of his competitors.

ELIZABETH WARREN

The 69-year-old senator from Massachusetts is a leader of the party’s liberals and a fierce Wall Street critic who was instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She has focused her presidential campaign on her populist economic message, promising to fight what she calls a rigged economic system that favors the wealthy. She also has proposed eliminating the Electoral College, vowed to break up Amazon, Google and Facebook if elected, and sworn off political fundraising events to collect cash for her bid. Warren apologized earlier this year to the Cherokee Nation for taking a DNA test to prove her claims to Native American ancestry, an assertion that has prompted Trump to mockingly refer to her as “Pocahontas.""

CORY BOOKER

Booker, 49, a black U.S. senator from New Jersey and former mayor of Newark, gained national prominence in the fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination. He has made U.S. race relations and racial disparities a focus of his campaign, noting the impact of discrimination on his family. He embraces progressive positions on Medicare coverage for every American, the Green New Deal and other key issues, and touts his style of positivity over attacks. Booker eats a vegan diet and recently confirmed rumors he is dating actress Rosario Dawson.

AMY KLOBUCHAR

The third-term U.S. senator from Minnesota was the first moderate in the Democratic field vying to challenge Trump. Klobuchar, 58, gained national attention in 2018 when she sparred with Kavanaugh during Senate hearings for his Supreme Court nomination. On the campaign trail, the former prosecutor and corporate attorney supports an alternative to traditional Medicare healthcare funding and is taking a hard stance against rising prescription drug prices. Klobuchar's campaign reported raising more than $1 million in its first 48 hours. Her campaign announcement came amid news reports that staff in her Senate office were asked to do menial tasks, making it difficult to hire high-level campaign strategists.

PETE BUTTIGIEG

The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is emerging from underdog status as he begins to build momentum with young voters. A Harvard University graduate and Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, he speaks seven languages and served in Afghanistan with the U.S. Navy Reserve. He touts himself as representing a new generation of leadership needed to combat Trump. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee of a major American political party.

JULIAN CASTRO

The secretary of housing and urban development under President Barack Obama would be the first Hispanic to win a major U.S. party's presidential nomination. Castro, 44, whose grandmother was a Mexican immigrant who immigrated to Texas, has used his family’s personal story to criticize Trump's border policies. Castro advocates for a universal pre-kindergarten program, supports Medicare for All and cites his experience to push for affordable housing. He announced his bid in his hometown of San Antonio, where he once served as mayor and a city councilman. His twin brother, Joaquin Castro, is a Democratic congressman from Texas.

KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND

Gillibrand, known as a moderate when she served as a congresswoman from upstate New York, has refashioned herself into a staunch progressive, calling for strict gun laws and supporting the Green New Deal. The senator for New York, who is 52, has led efforts to address sexual assault in the military and on college campuses, and pushed for Congress to improve its own handling of sexual misconduct allegations. On the campaign trail, she has made fiery denunciations of Trump. She released her tax returns for the years 2007 through 2018, offering the most comprehensive look to date at the finances of a 2020 White House candidate, and has called on her rivals to do the same.

JAY INSLEE

The Washington state governor has made fighting climate change the central issue of his campaign. As governor, Inslee, 68, has moved to put a moratorium on capital punishment and fully implement the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, and accompanying expansion of Medicaid health coverage for the poor. He has not settled on a position on Medicare for All but does support the Green New Deal backed by progressives. Inslee spent 15 years in Congress before being elected governor in 2012.

JOHN HICKENLOOPER

The 67-year-old former Colorado governor has positioned himself as a centrist and an experienced officeholder with business experience. He is the only Democratic presidential candidate so far to oppose the Green New Deal plan to tackle climate change, saying it would give the government too much power in investment decisions. During his two terms in office, Colorado’s economy soared and the Western state expanded healthcare, passed a gun control law and legalized marijuana. The former geologist and brewpub owner is among the many candidates who have refused to take corporate money. He previously served as mayor of Denver.

JOHN DELANEY

The former U.S. representative from Maryland became the first Democrat to enter the 2020 race, declaring his candidacy in July 2017. Delaney, 55, plans to focus on advancing only bipartisan bills during the first 100 days of his presidency if elected. He is also pushing for a universal healthcare system, raising the federal minimum wage and passing gun safety legislation.

TULSI GABBARD

The Samoan-American congresswoman from Hawaii and Iraq war veteran is the first Hindu to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. After working for her father’s anti-gay advocacy group and drafting relevant legislation, she was forced to apologize for her past views on same-sex marriage. Gabbard, 37, has been against U.S. intervention in Syria and slammed Trump for standing by Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. She endorsed Sanders during his 2016 presidential campaign.

TIM RYAN

The moderate nine-term congressman from a working-class district in the battleground state of Ohio has touted his appeal to the blue-collar voters who fled to Trump in 2016. He says Trump has turned his back on those voters and failed to live up his promise to revitalize the manufacturing industry. Ryan, 45, pledges to create jobs in new technologies and focus on public education and access to affordable healthcare. He gained national attention when he tried to unseat Nancy Pelosi as the House Democratic leader in 2016, arguing it was time for new leadership. A former college football player, he also has written books on meditation and healthy eating.

ERIC SWALWELL

The third-term congressman from a California district south of San Francisco says tackling student debt and gun violence are among the reasons he jumped into the race. Swalwell, 38, cites his work on the House Intelligence Committee and his founding of Future Forum, a group of more than 25 Democratic lawmakers that visits universities and community colleges to discuss issues important to millennial voters like student loan debt and climate change, among the reasons he would be a qualified White House candidate. In his first House campaign, Swalwell defeated a Democratic incumbent who had been in office since 1973, seven years before Swalwell was born.

ANDREW YANG

The entrepreneur and former tech executive is focusing his campaign on an ambitious universal income plan. Yang, 44, wants to guarantee all American citizens between the ages of 18 and 64 a $1,000 check every month. The son of immigrants from Taiwan, Yang also is pushing for Medicare for All and proposing a new form of capitalism that is “human-centered.” He lives in New York.

MARIANNE WILLIAMSON

The 66-year-old New York Times best-selling author, motivational speaker and Texas native believes her spirituality-focused campaign can heal America. A 1992 interview on Oprah Winfrey’s show propelled her to make a name for herself as a “spiritual guide” for Hollywood and a self-help expert. She is calling for $100 billion in reparations for slavery over 10 years, gun control, education reform and equal rights for lesbian and gay communities. In 2014, she made an unsuccessful bid for a House seat in California as an independent.

WAYNE MESSAM

Messam, 44, defeated a 16-year incumbent in 2015 to become the first black mayor of in the Miami suburb of Miramar. He was re-elected in March. The son of Jamaican immigrants, he played on Florida State University's 1993 national championship team, and then started a construction business with his wife. He has pledged to focus on reducing gun violence, mitigating climate change and reducing student loan debt and the cost of healthcare.

There is an saying in US politics, perhaps truer now than ever: every senator looks in the mirror and sees a president looking back. Before Bernie Sanders ran for the White House, his rumpled appearance and shock of unruly white hair suggested that this US senator gave his reflection no more than a fleeting glance each morning.

And yet, nearly two months into his second presidential run Sanders sits atop an unsettled Democratic field. It is a remarkable transformation for a democratic socialist from Vermont, deep into his 70s, who spent most of his decades-long career in the political wilderness.

Sanders has amassed the largest first-quarter fundraising haul, building a $28m war chest. His campaign already has about 100 staffers and continues to draw the kind of large, energized crowds that were the lifeblood of his insurgent 2016 campaign.

Polls of Iowa and New Hampshire Democrats placed him on top of those candidates who have formally declared, trailing only former vice-president Joe Biden, who is widely expected to enter the race soon. And this week, he reintroduced his signature Medicare for All healthcare bill with four Democratic 2020 rivals as co-sponsors.

He’s one of the leading candidates … because his platform is now where the center of energy is in the Democratic party Walid Shahid

“Bernie being the frontrunner should come as a surprise to no one,” said Rebecca Katz, a progressive consultant from New York. “He has spent the last four years energizing his base.”

Sanders has effectively not stopped campaigning since he began in 2015. After Donald Trump’s election, he traveled to dozens of cities rallying opposition to Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. During the midterms, he crisscrossed the country for progressive candidates.

Yet the political landscape has shifted considerably. There are 18 Democrats running for president, pitting him against younger and more diverse contenders.

“There is an embarrassment of riches in our field,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief public affairs officer for MoveOn.org who worked on Barack Obama’s campaigns in 2008 and 2012. “This time around he’s not the only person in the race talking about progressive issues.”

Being the frontrunner at such an early stage can be a blessing and a curse.

“Four years ago at this stage we were talking about Jeb Bush,” Jean-Pierre said, of the 2016 Republican primary. “And when Trump announced, he was polling at 1%. History tells us it’s way too early to tell.”

‘Like finding out Hamburglar is a vegan’

Sanders’ elevated status has attracted increased scrutiny of his policies and his past. He is under pressure to release his tax returns, which several of his competitors have done, at the same time as House Democrats are pursuing Trump’s taxes. Sanders has promised to release 10 years of returns by Monday, which is Tax Day.

The senator acknowledged earlier this week that the returns would show that he is a millionaire, owing to a “bestselling book”. Late-night talkshow host Jimmy Fallon said the revelation that the candidates who has railed against concentrated wealth for years is a millionaire was “like finding out the Hamburglar is a vegan”.

Another new dynamic: Sanders’ competitors sound a lot more like him than was the case four years ago. A number of contenders embrace his economic policies and echo his populist rhetoric. But Waleed Shahid, communications director for Justice Democrats, a group that helps elect progressives, doubted Sanders would have trouble distinguishing himself.

“He’s one of the leading candidates in part because his platform is now where the center of energy is in the Democratic party,” Shahid said. “His popularity is perhaps less about Bernie himself and more about the long track record and authenticity he brings to his policy platform alongside a populist approach that names clear enemies in America’s oligarchy.”

Donald Trump wins if voters think Democrats have gone too far left Jim Kessler

Some worry Sanders’ populism will put the party at a disadvantage against Trump.

“Donald Trump wins if voters think Democrats have gone too far left,” said Jim Kessler, a co-founder of the center-left thinktank Third Way. Pointing to research conducted by the group, Kessler said candidates who are “ambitious but also pragmatic” are best positioned to assemble a big-tent coalition needed to extinguish Trump’s right-wing populist pitch.

This weekend Sanders is traveling through midwestern states that voted Trump in 2016. He will argue that the path to the White House runs through the rust belt and say he is positioned to wrest these states back in 2020.

At a rally in Madison, Wisconsin on Friday night, Sanders accused Trump of being a “pathological liar” who has repeatedly failed to keep his promises.

“The biggest lie of all was when he said that he would stand with the working class of our country that he was on their side and that he would take on powerful special interests to protect working families,” he said. “What a monstrous lie that was.”

‘Can he grow his support?’

Sanders has moved to address the criticism that hurt his first run for president. Having concluded that his 2016 team was “too white and too male”, he has built a campaign that is majority female and 40% people of color, according to campaign officials. He has also implemented strict new sexual harassment policies in response to what former female staffers described as a toxic and misogynistic workplace.

Seeking to bolster his foreign policy credentials, Sanders led a bipartisan effort to end US military involvement in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. He has also expanded his platform to explicitly address issues of racial inequality, after being accused of prioritizing economic issues.

He must contend with a weak showing with black voters in 2016. South Carolina, where black voters make up a majority of the primary electorate and where Sanders suffered a crushing 47-point loss, will be a pivotal test.

His campaign and allies argue that his deficit with black voters was more a function of low profile at the time, and that he has since built relationships with African American leaders. But he continues to draw largely white crowds.

“Sanders has to prove he can gain supporters,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who was communications director for Clinton. “He has the most support now of the announced candidates – the question for him is: can he grow his support?”

‘A really radical and crazy idea’

Sanders is no longer the scrappy underdog. Yet the message and the messenger have changed little. He is still the same finger-jabbing, policy-rattling democratic socialist from Vermont who launched a long-shot bid for president from a patch of grass outside the Senate, known as the swamp, before hurrying back inside to vote. That is part of his pitch.

Imagine the United States joining the rest of the industrialized world and guaranteeing healthcare to all people Bernie Sanders

“I have some good news,” Sanders told activists recently at the We the People summit in Washington. “We have come a long way over the last four years.” He then galloped through list of ideas he ran on in 2016 that he said were deemed “too radical” then and are now within the Democratic mainstream.

“You want to hear a really radical and crazy idea? This is so radical, I hesitate to even bring it forward,” Sanders said, his words thick with sarcasm. “Imagine the United States joining the rest of the industrialized world and guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a right not a privilege.”

For those who met Sanders when he was a politically-lonely socialist mayor in Ronald Reagan’s America, his rise has been remarkable to watch.

“I remember in the 80s, Bernie and I would drive around to visit these small towns in Vermont,” said Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser who first worked for Sanders in 1986, when he ran unsuccessfully for governor as an independent. “We typically spoke to a room of about eight people – 25 people was a big turnout.”

Certainly not then nor at any point during the nearly two decades in which he worked for Sanders on Capitol Hill did Weaver envision what has come to pass.

The Vermont senator is “far ahead” of where the campaign was in 2016, Weaver said. He added that his early fundraising figures will allow Sanders to expand operations in the early voting states including California, and to compete in all of the Super Tuesday states, a luxury he did not have in 2016 and a “key advantage”.

“This race is a marathon, not a sprint,” Weaver said. “The candidate who will prevail is the one who can go the distance.

Though Hillary Clinton is no stranger to Tina Brown's Women in the World Summit — she's headlined a number of past conferences, including in 2017, when she made her first public appearance after losing the 2016 election — the audience at the 10th edition of the event in New York City was delightfully surprised to learn Friday that the former Democratic presidential candidate would be this year's surprise drop-in guest.

Clinton was greeted with a standing ovation, and once the applause settled down, CNN's Fareed Zakaria jumped into questions about Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan, the Mueller Report and more.

But, first, Zakaria pointed out that on this very day in 2015, Clinton announced her second presidential bid.

""I think of what an amazing experience it was traveling the country; talking to people, listening to people, making a case for the kind of America I want for my children and grandchildren,"" Clinton said. ""But I also think about what I said at the very end of that campaign when I addressed all the little girls and told them to keep dreaming and told them to be powerful, be ready to take on risks, be brave.""

Zakaria brought up a recent comment from Democratic 2020 hopeful Pete Buttigieg, in which he said, per the Washington Post Magazine, ""Donald Trump got elected because, in his twisted way, he pointed out the huge troubles in our economy and our democracy. At least he didn't go around saying that America was already great, like Hillary did.""

""I don’t want to comment on any of the candidates. Like I said, I think they have a lot to contribute not only to the Democratic party, but to the country. And it will be up to voters to decide who our nominee is,"" Clinton responded. ""But I would say this, I really do believe that we always have to appeal to our better selves. Because the wolf is at the door, my friends. Grief, despair, anxiety, resentment, anger, prejudice — that's part of human nature, and the job of a leader is to appeal to us to be more than we can be on our own.""

Though Clinton didn't delve into the specifics of the current race, she did recommend that the current crop of Democratic presidential candidates do two things simultaneously: ""You have to be able to counter and ignore where possible [and] respond where necessary to the diversion and distraction that we see, unfortunately, working by the current incumbent in the White House. So you have to do that balancing act, and I think that we have excellent candidates who are demonstrating their ability to do that.""

Clinton also praised Jacinda Ardern, the New Zealand prime minister who gained notoriety for her response to at least 50 people being killed in a mass shooting attack on two mosques in March.

""She showed the heart not only of a leader but of a mother,"" Clinton said, explaining the two met last year when Ardern was pregnant. ""Her reaching out to the Muslim community in New Zealand sent a message about how leaders should behave in the face of horrific violence conducted for ideological reasons. And I think that that was as strong a signal as we can get that, given the chance, many women will govern and lead differently.""

When Clinton's former rival — running again for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 — Bernie Sanders' recently announced Medicare for All plan was mentioned, Clinton launched into a passionate defense of the Affordable Care Act, though she did say she's ""all in favor of setting the goal"" of universal health care for every single American.

""The specifics, though, matter,"" Clinton said. ""What are the details? How do we pay for it? Who is going to get what they need? There are a lot of complicated questions.""

She ultimately urged Democrats to both defend the ACA and set bigger goals.

The talk ended on a positive note, with Zakaria asking, ""Do you think the world would be different if it were led by women?""

""Of course!"" Clinton responded, prompting roaring applause.

Rui Vieira/The Associated Press

Nigel Farage, one of the leaders of a campaign to leave the European Union, launched the Brexit Party on Friday, promising to put “the fear of God” into lawmakers he accused of betraying the United Kingdom’s decision to quit the bloc.

In the central English city of Coventry, Mr. Farage, 55, whose former party UKIP is credited by many with forcing Britain’s 2016 referendum on EU membership, told supporters his new party was fielding an impressive team in next month’s European Parliament elections.

After Prime Minister Theresa May secured another delay to Brexit in Brussels this week, parties are now preparing for the European elections despite the government’s insistence Britain could still leave the bloc without having to take part.

Story continues below advertisement

But with the British Parliament rejecting Ms. May’s deal to leave the EU three times, most parties suspect they will have to take part in the elections on May 23 – which could become a rerun, albeit on a smaller scale, of Britain’s Brexit referendum in a possible challenge to Ms. May’s Conservative Party.

Nigel Farage, one of the leaders of a campaign to leave the European Union, launched a new Brexit Party on Friday, promising to put 'the fear of God' into lawmakers he accused of betraying Britain's decision to quit the bloc. Reuters

“I’m doing this because … I did actually, rather stupidly, for a moment believe that we’d won,” Mr. Farage said, taking aim at those who campaigned to stay in the EU, known as Remainers.

“But it became clear pretty early on … that our Remainer Parliament, our Remainer cabinet and indeed our Remainer Prime Minister were going to do their utmost to delay, dilute and, in many occasions, to actually stop and overturn Brexit.”

He said his new party had raised more than £750,000 ($1.3-million) in the first 10 days of its existence and was attracting a pool of leading businesspeople to represent it.

One of his backers was Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of leading Euroskeptic Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has campaigned for a clean break with the EU.

“We have seen over the course of the last few weeks the betrayal, willful betrayal, of the greatest democratic exercise in the history of this nation,” Mr. Farage said, vowing there would be “no more Mr. Nice Guy” in what he called his fight back against Parliament.

“We can win these European elections and we can again start to put the fear of God into our members of Parliament in Westminster.

Kevin McCaffrey.

Gargiulo, 61, of Babylon Village, became the Democrats' candidate after veteran Democratic activist Bridget Middleton dropped out.

Richard Schaffer, Suffolk Democratic chairman, said he is backing Gargiulo because of his “deep roots” in the community and his ""desire to protect our quality of life at the cheapest possible,” cost.

Gargiulo also has the Independence Party line. Two years ago, McCaffrey got 2,039 of his 9,667 votes on the Conservative and Independence lines.

McCaffrey said Gargiulo's candidacy was part of an “unholy alliance, and the Conservative Party is to blame. They are not the party of conservative values, but the party of jobs, judgeships and dirty money from developers.”

Gargiulo, a retired teacher and a basketball coach, called himself an underdog, saying he “just wants to help people” and will work as hard as he can to win. He called McCaffrey “a good man” and a friend.

The contest in the 14th District is among about a half dozen county legislature races in which Suffolk Conservatives have backed Democrats or run their own candidates.

Schaffer is attempting to keep or bolster the Democrats' 11 member majority on the 18 member body. New county GOP Chairman Jesse Garcia is seeking to wrest back control of county government from Democrats.

In that race, Schaffer, who is also Babylon Town supervisor, remained neutral. But Gargiulo said he had Schaffer’s informal backing, angering progressives. At the time, Schaffer was negotiating with Conservatives for backing of Democratic District attorney candidate Timothy Sini.

Guest Opinion

Canadian provincial politics has a rich history of come-from-behind parties emerging from the margins to occupy the epicentre of power. The Greens are poised to show the rest of Canada that it can happen in P.E.I. as well.

And while the Greens may appear to lack any experience in governing, this, history shows, is not always a disqualification for office.

New, untested parties have formed effective governments. A look back into the history of provincial politics in Canada shows that the seemingly improbable can become fairly mainstream and practical.

Take Alberta, for example. A rural revolt formed the United Farmers of Alberta party, which, as the name implies, was composed of a lot of actual farmers. They won the 1921 provincial election. The result? After some initial struggles to find their footing, the party eventually caught its groove and was able to govern effectively. They were even re-elected in subsequent elections and held on to power until 1935, only to lose to Social Credit, another “new” party that emerged amid the populist rage of the Great Depression (and remained in power for four decades).

In all cases, these new parties formed what can arguably be described as effective governments. Alberta is not the exception. Other provinces have formed successful governments out of movements external to mainstream politics. British Columbia, for example, elected Social Credit to office in 1952, and the party held on until 1972.

The Co-Operative Commonwealth Federation (renamed the New Democratic Party) upset the Liberal/Conservative alteration of government in Saskatchewan by winning the 1944 election, and quite a few more afterwards.

Moving a little further east, the Parti Québécois in 1976 undermined the otherwise back-and-forth alteration between Liberal and Union Nationals governments. Interesting to note that while the PQ now appears to be in decline, another relatively new party has taken over Quebec politics, this time upsetting the PQ-Liberal alteration.

With few exceptions, these “new” parties are not entirely new. They have histories of mostly failed election campaigns. And they almost all belong to some national network. There were United Farmers parties elsewhere, as there were Social Credit and NDP/CCF chapters all over Canada.

The Green Party of P.E.I. is similar in that it, too, is part of a national, and even international, umbrella movement of parties and other organizations with a shared focus on addressing environmental concerns.

These alliances are important. It is often through these associations that parties gain a source of research and knowledge needed to develop and support policy ideas. A new party elected to office may be new to governing (which itself is not necessarily a bad thing), but their ideas are not necessarily improvised on the spot. New parties that get elected to office bring with them sophisticated and well considered ideas that emerged from their knowledge networks. And the Greens certainly belong to a vast network of researchers, policy experts, activists, and even economists.

Another common feature of such come-from-behind new parties is that they don’t necessarily spell disaster and dysfunction. They actually can deliver good government, even if at first it seems like a long shot. However, they are often challenged by how they are perceived by voters. When minor parties become more prominent, their image is still mainly defined by a narrow set views of such parties.

The UFA, the NDP, even the PQ all originally had a brand focused on a small set of issues, be it support for farmers, eradicate income inequality, or to establish a sovereign state. But when these parties get in government, they show an ability to run schools, pave roads, manage finances, promote economic growth, and so forth. They may not be perfect, but arguably, they weren’t incompetent, either.

For sure, those unaccustomed to governing, parliamentary procedure, or the sausage-making aspects of policy have to learn quickly. But that’s true of anyone who new to politics, be they a farmer, factory worker or lawyer. If a party is serious about governing, then history shows there is nothing about its “newness” that renders it unfit to govern.

By Mohamed Junayd

MALE (Reuters) - Maldives former president Mohamed Nasheed, whose party won a landslide in the archipelago's parliamentary election, on Tuesday pledged to conduct a thorough probe into deals with China.

Nasheed's Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) is set to secure 65 seats in the 87-member parliament, giving it a clear majority to push for reforms including imposing the country's first income tax and instituting a minimum wage for the first time.

President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, who is also from the MDP and unseated pro-China leader Abdulla Yameen in September, had urged voters to back his call for an investigation the scale of debts to China, which the party fears could run as high as $3 billion and risks sinking the economy.

The Indian Ocean island chain has been caught in a battle for influence between India and China, which invested millions of dollars during Yameen's rule as part of its Belt and Road plan, designed to improve Beijing's global trade reach.

Yameen denies any wrongdoing in relation to the Chinese debt.

Nasheed, the country's first democratically elected leader between 2008 and 2011 before being forced to step down in a police mutiny, said the result was ""a clear mandate to implement"" the party's pledges.

""Some of the first bills that the new parliament must consider is the pending legislation to fully empower the presidential commission on stolen assets, and deaths and disappearances,"" MDP leader Nasheed told Reuters in the capital Male.

""The government continues to scrutinize the deals signed by the previous government, many of which, we fear, were subject to large scale corruption. We must allow the government to examine these deals with forensic detail.""

Final provisional results for the election will officially be confirmed on Wednesday, an Elections Commission official told Reuters.

The MDP is just one seat shy of the three-quarters quorum required to amend the constitution in the People Majlis or parliament. This is the first time a party has had such a majority since the first multi-party elections in 2008. The MDP previously ruled in coalition.

The new parliament is expected to be inaugurated in May.

Last month, Yameen spent more than a month in police custody over a graft scandal aimed at siphoning money from the islands' tourism board. He was released on bail on March 28 in time for the last week of campaigning, and denies the charges.

The three-day retreat kicked off on Wednesday with an annual conference at the Lansdowne Resort and Spa in Leesburg, Virginia. This year’s theme - ""100 Days In: Fighting For the People"" - focuses on top policy priorities including climate change, gun safety and regulation and economic issues.

So thrilled to be introducing @chrissyteigen and @johnlegend at the House Democratic Issues Conference tonight! pic.twitter.com/8YnOW7iZPm — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) April 11, 2019

Legend, an R&B singer and Grammy winner, has been a vocal critic of Trump and has been involved in launching #FreeAmerica - a campaign advocating for America's criminal justice system. Other notable figures attending the retreat include Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Comedian Jordan Klepper and others.

Legend and Teigen delivered a pep talk to House Democrats and the risk that comes with speaking against Trump.

""Chrissy was ahead of the curve making fun of Donald Trump,"" Legend said. ""She knew before a lot of America did that he was a joke and a clown.""

Asked about the fight over immigration policies, Legend said: “I don’t think either of us are policy experts.”

“Speak for yourself,” Teigen shot back.

Legend said the country is better because of immigrants and the guiding principle for America should be ""big, bold and open,"" adding that if people want to come here, Congress should create a ""straight forward way to do it.""

“America should be open to business when it comes to that,” Legend said.

Legend said he has recognized the risks in speaking out against President Trump but has been “willing to take risks.”

“We hear from them,” he said of fans who turn against him and say they won’t buy his record. “I’m willing to sacrifice that.”

Teigen said it’s “hard to find the funny when there’s so much sad.”

“I’m not the same person that I was before the election,” she said, conceding she goes to therapy.

Legend concluded by singing a few bars of his song, “Preach.”

The Democrats were originally scheduled to hold their retreat in February but it was postponed due to the 35-day government shutdown.

While Democrats are training their attention on their agenda as they kick off their retreat at the Lansdowne resort, Pelosi scolded Attorney General William Barr for testifying Wednesday that there was “spying occurring” on the Trump campaign.

“Let me just say how very, very dismaying and disappointing that the chief law enforcement officer of our country is going off the rails yesterday and today,” Pelosi, D-Calif., said. “He is the Attorney General of the United States of America, not the Attorney General of Donald Trump.”

House Democrats kicked off their issues conference in Leesburg, holding a news conference with reporters to outline the agenda of their policy retreat.

But the focus was still fallout from the Russia investigation. Pelosi said she still wants to see the Mueller report, but indicated she believes the foundation of the counterintelligence investigation of the President's campaign was sound.

“There was an assault on the integrity of our elections in our country, the basis for our democracy, there is no doubt about that,” Pelosi said, pointing at Russia. “There is a high confidence consensus among all of our intelligence agencies that such an assault took place.”

Pelosi added she is not confident that the attorney general will conduct his investigation of the investigation in an appropriate manner.

“No,” she said in a one-word answer.

On the continuing turnover at the Department of Homeland Security, Pelosi said it is “very dismaying” as officials are leaving, adding “it's all damaging to our country.” “If you want to work in the Trump administration, know your blood type, because it is a very dangerous place to be thrown under the bus, sooner or later,” she said.

“What is happening on our border is something that is so contrary to the values of our country,” Pelosi added. “So undermining of our commitment to family values, and that this administration just is in a downward spiral of indecency.”

Pelosi called on Republicans to work with Democrats in a bipartisan manner to adopt comprehensive immigration reform despite disapproval from President Trump of prior congressional attempts to address the issue.

“So we just have to just restore order on the border, or in the White House, so that we can address who we are as a nation,” Pelosi said.

On a lighter note, as Pelosi excitedly praised House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the Baltimore native mistakenly remarked how great it was to be “in this great state of Maryland,” before quickly catching herself and accepting a moment of shame after the gaffe.

“Oh no, we’re in Virginia!” Pelosi said. “Oh my gosh.”",John Legend and Chrissy Teigen blast Trump at House Democratic Caucus retreat,ABC News,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/john-legend-chrissy-teigen-participate-panel-house-democratic/story?id=62306998

“One out of four office buildings in downtown Calgary are empty; small businesses across Calgary are struggling; 15,000 Albertans have declared personal bankruptcy,” Nenshi said. “And I was really, really disappointed to see that none of the parties, none of them, had a real plan for economic growth in Calgary.”

Prospective provincial leaders ignore Calgary’s serious financial straits at their peril, Nenshi said. Calgary accounts for approximately a third of the province’s GDP, while unemployment remains higher here than in any comparable Canadian city, including Edmonton.

The city has now published responses from all four major parties to the yycmatters.ca survey. The survey was launched to give Calgary voters a better idea where parties stand on municipal priorities.

Nenshi praised the New Democratic Party and United Conservative Party at a press conference Friday for committing to the city’s long-term capital project plan.

He also praised the leaders for promising to honour commitments to the Springbank dry dam and the Green Line — with mild admonishment to the UCP for leaving “loopholes” in its platform when it comes to flood mitigation. The UCP has said it will expedite Springbank, so long as it receives the necessary approvals and consultations with First Nations are complete.

However, Nenshi criticized all four parties for failing to offer concrete, immediate solutions for bringing jobs and investment to Calgary or assistance for businesses on the brink. Both the UCP and NDP platforms rely on long term economic plays to spur jobs indirectly, he said, either through corporate tax cuts or new green economy opportunities.

Practical steps to grow the economy in the short term were ignored, Nenshi said, including things like matching funds through the city’s opportunity investment fund or providing a “tax holiday” for the provincial portion of property taxes for business.

Nenshi asked about racist, homophobic views percolating up in this campaign. Nenshi says it’s “not a smear job” to talk about these basic values . And policy discussions are only possible once candidates demonstrate they will respect the rights of every citizen #abvote #yyccc — Meghan Potkins (@mpotkins) April 5, 2019

And the UCP plan in particular shows a lack of comprehension about how cities operate, Nenshi said.

“When your biggest promise to municipalities is, ‘we’re going to publish a report card on you’ — that pretty much shows a real lack of respect for how local government works,” Nenshi said.

“There’s a real lack of understanding of how cities work and a real lack of understanding of Calgary in particular. I would expect anyone who wants to be premier needs to understand the city very well.”

Jason Kenney fired back Friday afternoon at a press conference where the UCP leader was reacting to the latest Alberta jobs numbers.

Kenney said a UCP government would reduce the province’s corporate tax rate to eight per cent, a move he suggested would create 55,000 jobs. Currently, the province’s corporate tax rate sits at 12 per cent.

He also defended his proposal to create a report card for municipalities, arguing it would create a healthy “competition” between cities.

“All we’re proposing is that we’re going to offer Albertans a fiscal report card on an annual basis showing how much municipalities are spending, how much they are taking in, how much their tax rates have gone up or gone down,” Kenney said. “I can’t imagine why the mayor would be opposed to transparency.”

Financial data comparing Alberta municipalities on an annual basis is already available on the municipal affairs website.

The party, running for re-election, plans to work with post-secondary ...","With the provincial election on April 16 looming, and parties announcing their platforms, The Gateway compiled a summary of post-secondary education promises.

Below is a summary of what four major parties running in the general election have to say about post-secondary education in Alberta and how they envision to make it better.



United Conservative Party: more international students, better IP laws, and freedom of speech policies on campuses

The UCP had four policy goals surrounding post-secondary education in Alberta.



If elected, the UCP said they would create an international student entrepreneur plan where foreign students would be recruited to study in Alberta and relocate to the province permanently to use their newly learned skills within the labour market.



Their policy also details plans to strengthen intellectual property frameworks to create a more robust system encouraging commercialization of research and ideas from Alberta post-secondary institutions.



The UCP would also require all universities to develop and comply with freedom of speech laws that conform to the University of Chicago Statement on Principles of Free Expression. Released in 2014, the Chicago principles include maintaining a climate of civility and mutual respect while restricting speech that violates the law or defames a person.

Additionally, the party plans to monitor the success of academic programs offered at the post-secondary level by measuring “labour market outcomes.” According to the document, this would aid in identifying correlations between provincial subsidies and economic returns for taxpayers. Further, the UCP plans to monitor the outcomes of post-secondary institutions against leading global research and innovation hubs like California, Texas, Israel, London, and Hong Kong.



New Democratic Party: new funding formulas, free upgrading, and stable funding

The NDP’s platform includes three specific post-secondary education goals within their platform document.



The party, running for re-election, plans to work with post-secondary institutions to renew funding formulas and focus new resources on creating additional spaces for new students. The document also said they want to ensure a lack of seats does not halt qualified students from being enrolled in desired programs.



Additionally, the NDP said it would eliminate tuition fees associated with high school upgrading and English language learning programs offering everyone the opportunity to learn.



While detailing its five-year tuition freeze, the NDP document gives no indication that this will continue. Instead, their platform said they are committed to providing consistent and stable funding to post-secondary institutions in Alberta.



Alberta Liberal Party: STEM support, tackling deferred maintenance, and progressive financial support

The Alberta Liberal Party has set out five main policy goals for post-secondary education as part of their platform.



One of their policy goals is to support science, technology, engineering, and mathematical (STEM) fields so they remain competitive in Alberta and employable in the province. Their platform said many graduates within STEM programs leave the province and take their newfound skills with them. The party’s plan to combat this is to grow the number of seats available in these programs by 25 per cent within the next five years.



Another goal is addressing deferred maintenance on campuses across the province. Deferred maintenance describes when infrastructure components are scheduled to be repaired within a particular time but aren’t, which could result in costlier future repairs. The Liberal plan said it will fund university related deferred maintenance costs but details no specific monetary amounts.



Their last post-secondary goal is to provide more student financial aid to those who need it most. If elected, the Liberals will make post-secondary more affordable for low-income students through targeted financial supports. No additional details are provided.



Additionally, the Liberal platform said it is against voluntary student unionism (VSU).



Alberta Party: student loan forgiveness, increasing capacity, and expanding STEP

The Alberta Party has set out five main policy points with a post-secondary education focus.



Part of their platform will establish a student loan forgiveness program if a student who graduates decides to work within the province. Additional loan forgiveness will be granted to students who decide to reside and work in rural and remote areas of Alberta.



Another of their goals is to increase the post-secondary system’s capacity. The Alberta Party wants to have 45,000 more seats available for students to study at universities, colleges, and technical institutes in the province. Of these, 3,000 will be exclusively for Indigenous-led programming. The document said this would help accommodate a predicted growth within the system of 40,265 students by 2026.



The party also wants to expand employment opportunities for students in the province. Part of this would be to expand the Summer Temporary Employment Program (STEP) into a year-long initiative. Additionally, people who have graduated within 12 months will still be able to access the program.



The Alberta Party also plans to eliminate tuition fees associated with high school upgrading and English language learning programs.



If elected, the Alberta Party will continue the current level of capped tuition at all post-secondaries across the province. The party also plans to improve intellectual properties models to allow business spin-offs to be started from research or innovation programs.

All we get is politics all the time. One election ends and the next immediately begins, with endless email requests for money to support both Democratic and Republican candidates. Is that all these people do? The folks in Washington do little for the common man. They certainly do not represent me, or people like me. I frequently write my Democrat representatives – Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, Congresswoman Nydia M. Velazquez and recently elected Congressman Antonio Delgado – and I hear nothing back.

Meanwhile I get requests for financial support from Democrats beyond New York, and have given money to many, but when it comes to assisting taxpaying citizens and donors to do something for the broad public interest, these folks report I am not a “constituent” and therefore they will not help me, not even listen to or read my letters or emails. How can they expect to get non-constituents to support their election efforts?

Two years ago, I was trying to get members of the Congressional committees on health care to oppose Trump’s attempts to kill medical tax deductions. No one, not even my own representatives, would pay attention to my emails, phone calls and letters. I finally wrote an article titled “Will Donald Trump force me to kill my wife?,” which was published in The Daily Beast. My wife suffers from Parkinson’s and dementia, costing me $150,000 a year to keep her safe and comfortable—most of that expense is still tax deductible, though Trump and Republicans sought otherwise with their proposed end to medical tax deductions, which would have ruined me financially. I have no idea if my article, copies of which were sent to Congress, had any effect. Medical tax deductions, thank goodness, remain in force.

My most recent letter to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez praising her position on taxes and the attention she is paying to global warming garnered no response. I know that she is new in office and is probably understaffed. Still, she seems to be continuing the same behavior as all other electeds, ignoring her constituents.

I wrote Ocasio-Cortez as follows on January 7 of this year:

Dear Congresswoman: I am writing in support of your proposed 70% federal income tax on the very rich and a redistribution of these resources to the middle class and the poor. I support Medicare for all, college finance for those who qualify, a real program to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and more. But I would go further. We need to eliminate the $135,000 limit on the 11% Social Security and Medicare tax. There should be no limit. This is the only way to avoid the collapse of Social Security when more of us have retired and need SS to survive. A bank president who takes home $20 million a year should contribute $2.2 million to Social Security – not $13,750. You represent the South Bronx District 14, near the Hunts Point area where nearly three decades ago, as a traffic engineer and environmental activist, I assisted in forcing New York city and state officials to divert heavy trucks from the streets of the mostly Hispanic residential community. The trucks on these local streets were running over children, maiming and killing them. After a six-month study in which I got considerable community assistance (I worked with a 60-year-old woman who did not speak English – and I do not speak Spanish), I produced a traffic report that convinced government officials to reroute the trucks and save lives. I am now 80 years old and spend most of my time caring for my wife who is dying from Parkinson’s and dementia. Together, Carolyn and I devoted 65,000 hours of our professional time providing pro-bono engineering services to New York City communities over the course of 50 years, while running two engineering companies. I hope this letter actually gets to your attention. For the last decade I have been writing similar letters to Senators Schumer and Gillibrand and Congresswomen Velasquez with little response and no action. I hope that this new year, with your fantastic win in District 14, will change all this. You are our hope for the future.

Well, it has been three months since I mailed that letter – and no response from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. True, what I wrote her is nothing earth-shattering and could be easily ignored – although failure to respond to taxpaying constituents is part of what’s killing our democracy.

But some races are expected to be more heated than others, and come election day will be closely watched political battlegrounds. As the clock ticks down to election day on April 16, we bring you our picks for ridings to watch. EDMONTON—Candidates hoping to represent the people of Bonnyville-Cold Lake-St. Paul shouldn’t overlook the interests of Indigenous voters, as experts say a wave of First Nations and Métis people casting their ballots helped shape the outcome of the 2015 election that ultimately overthrew a government after decades in power.

The Kinosoo Totem Poles in Cold Lake, Alta., were made by former Cold Lake First Nations chief Ovide Jacko in 1967 as a symbol of unity between the Cold Lake First Nations and the town of Cold Lake. ( Google Maps )

Boundary redivisions have brought the Saddle Lake Cree Nation into Bonnyville-Cold Lake-St. Paul, joining a riding where now nearly one in five people identifies as First Nations, Inuit or Métis. During the last provincial election, many polling stations on or near First Nations communities saw a spike in voter turnout. Cold Lake First Nations Councillor Dean Janvier said people in his community were inspired to vote after hearing promises from candidates that mirrored their needs and interests, something he says has been sorely missing from Alberta’s prior elections.

Article Continued Below

A polling station on the Cold Lake First Nations saw a significant increase in voter turnout in 2015, jumping from single digits in 2008 and 2012 to nearly 30 per cent voter participation in 2015. Janvier said that was a direct result of the New Democratic Party acknowledging the importance of Indigenous people in Alberta in its platform and in promises made to protect the rights of Indigenous people.

Article Continued Below

“It was a welcome change from previous elections in Alberta. I think that the citizens of Cold Lake First Nations were looking for some support and acknowledgement that we’re part of Alberta too,” Janvier said. Brad Clark, assistant professor and chair of journalism programs at Mount Royal University, analyzed data from 80 polling stations on or near First Nations and Métis communities in Alberta after the 2015 provincial election and found multiple ridings where higher support from Indigenous people directly contributed to the election of NDP candidates. He said of the votes cast at those 80 polling stations, around 68 per cent were in support of the NDP. “What I think was significant going into the election was the New Democrats had a real platform targeting and speaking to First Nations and Métis people in the province across different groups, different nations, and the PCs had very little,” Clark said. Clark said the mobilization of Indigenous communities — especially in less densely populated ridings in more rural areas of Alberta — will be “a big story again.” Clark said the NDP has been able to maintain strengthened relationships with Indigenous communities since forming government in 2015, but it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to win a majority of hearts and minds in Bonnyville-Cold Lake-St. Paul, an area that remains a conservative stronghold. United Conservative Party candidate Dave Hanson secured a narrow 547-vote victory over NDP candidate Catherine Harder when he won his seat in the neighbouring riding of Lac La Biche-St. Paul-Two Hills for the Wildrose Party in 2015. Hanson secured the nomination over Wildrose Party Bonnyville-Cold Lake MLA Scott Cyr to represent the United Conservatives in the new riding of Bonnyville-Cold Lake-St. Paul in 2019. In Bonnyville-Cold Lake, nearly 77 per cent of the votes cast in 2015 were in favour of conservative candidates, split between the Wildrose and Progressive Conservative parties.

Progressive Democrats fiercely condemned Donald Trump and other Republicans’ growing efforts to smear the US representative Ilhan Omar, and urged party leaders to do the same.

The president’s attacks labeling Omar, one of the two Muslim women serving in Congress, as unpatriotic are “dangerous” and “inciting violence”, a handful of prominent Democrats said on Friday. Just last week, a Trump supporter in upstate New York was charged with threatening to kill Omar.

Two of the most progressive Democratic candidates for the 2020 presidential nomination called on the party to condemn the attacks.

Senator Bernie Sanders, one of the frontrunners for the Democratic nomination, called the attacks on Omar “disgusting and dangerous” and said that Omar would not “back down to Trump’s racism and hate, and neither will we”.

Republicans falsely claim Ilhan Omar denied 9/11 attackers were terrorists Read more

“The President is inciting violence against a sitting Congresswoman – and an entire group of Americans based on their religion,” Senator Elizabeth Warren, another 2020 candidate, wrote on Twitter. “It’s disgusting. It’s shameful. And any elected leader who refuses to condemn it shares responsibility for it.”

Trump escalated the latest round of attacks on Omar on Friday by tweeting “WE WILL NEVER FORGET!”, along with a video that was edited to suggest Omar was dismissive of the September 11 attacks.

The video pulls a snippet of Omar’s speech last month to the Council on American-Islamic Relations in which she talks about the problem of Islamophobia, describing “the discomfort of being a second-class citizen” as a Muslim in America and how, after the September 11 attacks, advocates “recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties”.

Rightwing critics have used an edited clip of the “some people did something” comment to falsely claim that Omar does not believe that September 11 was a terrorist attack, that she downplayed or demeaned the seriousness of the attack, and that she is un-American or not loyal to the United States.

Fox News and the New York Post, both owned by Rupert Murdoch, have devoted high-profile coverage to the misleading claims, including a graphic New York Post cover with her quote and an image of the World Trade Center towers in flames.

Omar and others have called the smears an “dangerous incitement” to violence against one of the first two MuslimAmerican women elected to Congress.

Rashida Tlaib, the other Muslim American woman in Congress, was the first on Friday to call on Democrats to “speak up” against the smear attacks.

“We cannot stand by,” she wrote.

Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) Enough is enough. No more silence, with NY Post and now Trump taking Ilhan’s words out of context to incite violence toward her, it’s time for more Dems to speak up. Clearly the GOP is fine with this shameful stunt, but we cannot stand by.

The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez later joined Tlaib in calling for Democrats to “speak out” about the consequences of attacks on Omar.

We must speak out.



“First they came...” pic.twitter.com/ygOX1vhE9j

Congressional Democratic leadership and some freshmen lawmakers have disagreed over how to respond to Republicans’ constant barrage of attacks on Omar. Last month, Omar apologized “unequivocally” after suggesting that American support for Israel was fueled by political donations from a pro-Israel lobby group, in comments criticized by Democratic leaders for invoking antisemitic tropes.

The controversy set off a protracted debate within the party on how to respond.

Trump’s tweet comes less than a month after a major white supremacist terror attack targeting Muslim worshippers at two mosques in New Zealand.

“The sequence of events from Christchurch to now is quite terrifying,” Jason Wilson, a reporter who covers far-right extremists in the United States and Australia, wrote on Twitter on Friday.

Trump’s own comments on September 11 have long attracted criticism. In a media interview just hours after the terror attack on the World Trade Center, Trump first described his shock and disbelief at what had happened.

Then he added a comment that left the journalists interviewing him “stunned”.

Trump, claimed, falsely, that one of his own buildings had been “the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan” after the World Trade Center.

(CNN) - Two new polls from the states that will be the first to weigh in on the Democratic field next year show former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders continue to stand ahead of the rest of the field, and provide the best evidence yet that the small group of candidates standing just behind those two includes South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

A Monmouth University poll of likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa, out Thursday, finds Biden at the top of the pack with 27% support, Sanders at 16%, Buttigieg at 9%, Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren at 7%, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke at 6%, Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 4%, Sen. Cory Booker at 3%, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro at 2%. The rest of the field stood at 1% or less in the poll, with a sizable 12% saying they are undecided among the 24 candidates tested in the poll.

In New Hampshire, site of the nation's first primary elections, a St. Anselm College poll also out Tuesday shows a similar lineup: Biden at 23%, Sanders at 16%, Buttigieg at 11%, Warren at 9%, Harris at 7%, O'Rourke at 6%, Booker at 4% and Klobuchar at 2%. The rest of the tested field landed at 1% or less. Nearly 1 in 5 said they were undecided or backing someone not named in the list of 14 candidates presented to those who took the poll.

Both surveys show Buttigieg earning broadly positive reviews as voters get to know him, with room still to grow. In Iowa, Monmouth places his favorability rating at 45% positive to 9% negative. That's a sharp improvement in both awareness and positive ratings. In early March, a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll in Iowa found 73% of likely caucusgoers unsure of how they felt about the South Bend Mayor, while 17% had a positive view and 10% a negative one.

In New Hampshire, St. Anselm finds a similar divide to Monmouth's Iowa survey: 42% view Buttigieg favorably and 6% have an unfavorable take.

It is worth noting that the error margins for both of these polls are fairly large (plus or minus 5.2 percentage points for the Monmouth poll and 5.4 percentage points for the St. Anselm poll), so Buttigieg's standing in the surveys is not meaningfully above that of Warren, Harris or O'Rourke in either poll.

Monmouth's survey in Iowa also delved into likely caucusgoers' top issues and the importance of electability. About two-thirds (64%) said they would prefer a candidate they don't agree with on most issues if he or she would be a strong candidate against President Donald Trump over a candidate who shared their views on most issues but who would have a hard time beating Trump. About a quarter said they'd stick with the candidate who matched their views on the issues (24%).

About half (49%) said it is very important to them that the Democrats nominate a candidate who supports ""Medicare for All,"" 31% said it was that important for the party to nominate someone who supports the Green New Deal, and just 16% considered it very important to back a candidate who supports impeaching Trump.

Overall, 51% named health care in an open-ended question about the top issue in deciding whom to support, 17% named climate change or global warming, 14% each immigration and education, 13% jobs and unemployment, and 12% the environment or pollution. Rounding out the list of issues that hit double-digits: 10% said Donald Trump was their top issue.

The Monmouth poll is among those that will be considered in determining which candidates qualify for the Democratic Party primary debates beginning in June. The 1% reached by former Rep. John Delaney and businessman Andrew Yang in this poll means both have reached at least 1% in three qualifying polls on the race and will meet the polling criteria. Including these two, a total of 14 candidates have hit that mark so far.

The Monmouth University poll was conducted by telephone April 4-9 among 351 likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.2 percentage points. The St. Anselm College poll was conducted by telephone April 3-8 among 326 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire, with an error margin of plus or minus 5.4 percentage points.","New polls in Iowa, New Hampshire show Pete Buttigieg on the rise",channel4000.com,http://www.channel4000.com/nation/politics/new-polls-in-iowa-new-hampshire-show-pete-buttigieg-on-the-rise/1068126106

Reminder: There are 297 days until the Iowa caucuses, and 570 days until the 2020 presidential election.

[Who’s running for president? Click here for Yahoo News’ 2020 tracker]

Who isn’t running?

Appearing on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” on Monday, Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., announced his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

“I see a country in quicksand, unable to solve problems and threats from abroad, unable to make life better for people here at home,” Swalwell said. “I’m ready to solve these problems. I’m running for president of the United States.”

“Boy, did it feel good to say that!” he added.

Swalwell became the 18th candidate to enter the race on the Democratic side, making it the largest field of presidential candidates for a major party’s presidential nomination ever. In 2016, the Republican primary had 17 candidates. And the GOP didn’t reach that number until August 2015, when former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore jumped into the race.

At this point in 2015, just two candidates — Sen. Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton — had announced presidential bids. (Today is the 4-year anniversary of Clinton’s 2016 announcement.) The eventual winner, Donald Trump, did not announce until June 16, 2015, when he took his famous escalator ride to the lobby of Trump Tower.

The 2020 Democratic field is likely to grow even more. Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to join the race later this month, while former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio continue to mull bids of their own.

Also worth remembering: While the field for the 2016 Republican primary was crowded, it thinned out before a single vote was cast. Five candidates — Rick Perry, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, Lindsey Graham and George Pataki — dropped out of the race before the Iowa caucuses.

The first Democratic debate of the 2020 cycle will be held over two nights, June 26-27, in Miami.

“In these debates, we’re not going to be talking about hand size — we’re going to be talking about health care.”

— Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, on CNN

Buttigieg buzz brings $$$

With March coming to a close, most of the 2020 candidates have released their first quarter fundraising totals. Some of the numbers are not surprising (Sen. Bernie Sanders with $18.2 million, Sen. Kamala Harris with $12 million) but one number did impress: South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who reported $7 million in donations. That number trails former Rep. Beto O’Rourke ($9.4 million) but tops sitting Sens. Elizabeth Warren ($6 million), Amy Klobuchar ($5.2 million) and Cory Booker ($5 million).

Buttigieg also has found some success in a pair of new polls, finishing third in surveys of both Iowa and New Hampshire.

According to a poll by the Saint Anselm College Survey Center at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, Buttigieg has seen a 33 percentage point increase in name recognition since February.

One of the reasons for that bump is undoubtedly his sharp criticism of Vice President Mike Pence.

“If me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade,” Buttigieg said in a speech Sunday. “And that’s the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand. That if you got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.”",2020 Vision: Democratic field now largest in history,YAHOO!,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/2020-vision-democratic-field-now-largest-in-history-184841511.html?.tsrc=jtc_news_article

Mr Farage said: ‘There's a demand for a new party is there?

‘In some ways I can scarcely believe I'm doing this.

‘I thought, well, we have won the referendum and then 448 of them said it was going to happen.

Mr Farage continued: ’This party is not here just to fight the European elections... this party is not just to express our anger - May 23 is the first step of the Brexit Party.

‘We will change politics for good.

‘Yes I'm angry but this is not a negative emotion, this is a positive emotion. I said I wanted to cause an earthquake in politics... but now we will achieve a democratic revolution in politics.’

Addressing how he believed the Government had done in handling Brexit, Mr Farage said: ‘We are lions, led by donkeys.’

Speaking about how he believes the Brexit Party would fare in the European elections, MrFarage said: ‘I went to the bookmakers this morning.

‘This morning I have put a thousand pounds on the Brexit Party in the European elections at the odds of three to one.’

The Brexit Party will have the same policies as Ukip but will be distanced from the far right, leader Mr Farage has claimed.

‘In terms of policy, there's no difference, but in terms of personnel there is a vast difference,’ he told the Today programme.

‘Ukip did struggle to get enough good people into it but unfortunately what it's chosen to do is allow the far right to join it and take it over and I'm afraid the brand is now tarnished.’

When asked about former Brexit Party leader Catherine Blaiklock, who quit after journalists revealed she had sent racist posts and retweeted those of far-right figures before joining the Brexit Party, he said she was ‘an administrator’.

He said: ‘I set the party up, she was the administrator that got it set up.’

The non-aligned Democrat Party, which many had thought could hold the balance of power between pro-military ...","Partial results from Sunday's election in Thailand showed a pro-military party slightly ahead of the populist party leading a ""democratic front,"" an unexpected and, for many, stunning outcome from the country's first poll since a 2014 army coup.

With 93 per cent of overall votes counted, the Election Commission reported the pro-military party Palang Pracharat, which is seeking to keep junta chief Prayuth Chan-ocha in power, was leading with 7.59 million votes.

Trailing with 7.12 million votes was Pheu Thai, a party linked to exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose loyalists have won every election since 2001.

The numbers were for the popular vote, but these did not reflect parliamentary constituency seats that would ultimately be won. Pheu Thai could still win the lion's share of these because of its concentrated popularity in the north and northeast of the country.

Nevertheless, there was dismay among many voters who had hoped that the poll would loosen the grip on power that traditional elites and the military have held in a country that has one of the highest measures of inequality in the world.

At Pheu Thai's headquarters in Bangkok, the mood fluctuated from cheerful to quiet disbelief.

""I didn't think this is likely. I don't think this is what the people wanted,"" said Pheu Thai supporter Polnotcha Chakphet.

A #PrayforThailand hashtag started trending on Twitter as the results trickled out, and some people tweeted that they would leave the country if Prayuth was returned to power to remain prime minister.

The Election Commission chairman said unofficial results would be announced on Monday afternoon. The commission said turnout was 66 per cent, based on 90 per cent of the vote counted.

Royal role

The royal family, which wields great influence and commands the devotion of millions of Thais, played a part in the election though how far it influenced the outcome was unclear.

On the eve of the vote, King Maha Vajiralongkorn made an unexpected and cryptic statement, recalling a comment made by his father in 1969 on the need to put ""good people"" in power and to prevent ""bad people from … creating chaos.""

His message was a departure from the approach of his late father, who died in 2016. In his latter years, the former king usually kept a distance between the monarchy and politics.

Although the king did not refer to any of the sides in the election race, there was speculation on social media that it was a coded reference to main political factions — broadly the middle class and urban establishment, who identify with the monarchy and the military, and their pro-Thaksin opponents.

King Vajiralongkorn also weighed in on electoral affairs last month after a startling turn of events when a pro-Thaksin party nominated Princess Ubolratana, the king's sister, as its prime ministerial candidate.

Within hours, the king issued a statement saying her candidacy was ""inappropriate"" and she was disqualified.

Still, the connection between the princess and Thaksin persisted in voters' minds, particularly after they were seen hugging on Friday at the wedding of his daughter in Hong Kong.

""We had a lot of drama in the last hours before the election,"" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political analyst at Chulalongkorn University. ""Thaksin overplayed with a royal involvement and that was countered by his opponent.""

Deck stacked for military

Thailand has been racked for the past 15 years by crippling street protests both by Thaksin's opponents and supporters that destabilized governments and hamstrung business.

The country has been under direct military rule for nearly five years since then-army chief Prayuth overthrew an elected government linked to populist Thaksin, who himself was thrown out by the army in 2006.

The election will determine the makeup of parliament's 500-seat House of Representatives. The lower house and the upper house, the Senate — which is appointed entirely by the ruling junta — will together select the next prime minister.

Critics have said a new, junta-devised electoral system gives a built-in advantage to pro-military parties and appears designed to prevent Pheu Thai from returning to power.

The provision means Prayuth's Palang Pracharat Party and allies have to win only 126 seats in the House, while Pheu Thai and its potential ""democratic front"" partners would need 376.

The non-aligned Democrat Party, which many had thought could hold the balance of power between pro-military and ""democratic front"" factions, appeared to have been deserted by many voters.

Its leader, former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, announced his resignation within five hours of the polls closing.",Thailand's military-backed party takes lead in 1st election since 2014 coup,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/thailand-vote-military-populists-1.5069420

Ilhan Omar.

Patrick W. Carlineo, Jr., 55, of Addison, N.Y., is in custody after allegedly threatening to kill Omar because of her Muslim faith, CNN reports.

WATCH: White House says Democrats won’t condemn Omar, Trump condemns hate in all forms

According to CNN and The Hill, a call was placed to Omar’s Washington office on March 21, during which the individual on the other line identified himself as Pat Carlineo. He asked Omar’s receptionist, “Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her, she’s a (expletive) terrorist. I’ll put a bullet in her (expletive) skull.”

Omar’s office then referred the call to the police. According to an affidavit, Carlineo provided the correct spelling of his name and his contact information to the receptionist over the call. He was interviewed by authorities, whom he told that he loved Donald Trump, that he was a U.S. patriot and “that he hates radical Muslims in our government.”

WATCH: Omar’s comments not based on ‘anti-Semitic attitude’: Pelosi

The threat from Carlineo came 10 days after Fox New Host Jeanine Pirro criticized Omar’s choice to wear a hijab. On her Twitter page, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez linked Pirro’s comments and Carlineo’s threats against Omar.

“Understand when Jeanine Pirro goes on Fox + rallies people to think hijabs are threatening, it leads to this. Folks who imply we’re “bad” for politics, the party, the country, etc. have no idea the threats we deal w/ because of that kind of language,” the tweet read.

While Pirro’s comments were widely condemned, the Fox News host found some support. U.S. President Donald Trump later tweeted:

ALSO READ: TDP MP, businessman join YSR Congress Party ...","Male, April 7 (IANS) The ruling Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) on Sunday celebrated a historic victory as preliminary results showed its candidates securing a landslide victory in the parliamentary polls deemed crucial for the island nation.

According to the preliminary results from the Elections Commission late Saturday, the MDP won 62 out of the 87 seats in the People’s Majlis, reports Efe news.

The party secured seats from all three major cities and populous islands. It also took major seats that previously belonged to the opposition Progressive Party of Maldives.

In the previous parliamentary elections held in 2009 and 2014, the MDP was unable to secure more than 26 seats.

This is the first time in the island nation’s history that a single party has secured such a majority in parliament since the advent of multi-party democracy following the new constitution of 2008.

Saturday’s voting was held without any major complaints and the voter-turnout was at around 78 per cent. Some 264,689 people were eligible to vote.

MDP supporters staged a victory rally in the capital Male late Saturday night where President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih and former leader Mohamed Nasheed addressed a jubilant crowd.

Nasheed, who also won a seat, promised to deliver on his promises.

“Our biggest job is to ensure that the government of our president continues smoothly and peacefully,” he told hundreds of people.

Solih, who became President in September as the candidate of a four-party coalition, reiterated his commitment to the coalition.

“Today’s decision by the people is proof that you still stand with the decision made on September 23rd. You have decided never to go back to corruption,” he said.

The newly-elected parliament will give legal authority to the presidential commissions formed to investigate corruption, abductions and murders, he said.

“Anyone with the intention to steal the people’s money cannot be a part of this government,” he said, stressing the role of journalists in blowing the whistle over wrongdoings.

Vice President Faisal Naseem and Tourism Minister Ali Waheed from the coalition partner the Jumhooree Party (JP) also attended Saturday night’s celebration rally.

But JP leader Gasim Ibrahim earlier formed an alliance with the opposition for the parliamentary election and hinted at leaving the coalition government if the MDP won a majority.

Gasim has accused the MDP of reneging on a coalition agreement for the four parties to jointly contest the parliamentary polls and accused Nasheed of trying to become the prime minister.

The disagreement within the coalition resulted in the JP forming an alliance with the opposition Progressive Party of Maldives and the People’s National Congress.

But six months ahead of an October election, polls suggest the 47-year-old politician with the broad smile and a penchant for colorful socks could become the first prime minister to lose power after a single majority mandate since the 1930s.

Trudeau is mired in a relentless scandal over alleged interference in a corporate corruption case that has led to the resignations of two Cabinet members, his top advisor and the head of the federal civil service.

The ruling Liberals have lost 6 percentage points since the start of the year, ceding the lead to the rival Conservatives, according to a Nanos Research poll published on Tuesday.

If an election were held now, the Conservatives would win 34.9 percent of the vote, the Liberals 32.8 percent and the left-leaning New Democratic Party 16.6 percent. The poll suggests the result would be deadlock or a fragile minority government.

“The Liberals have taken a hit, but they’re still competitive,” said pollster Nik Nanos. “The most significant effect has been the negative impact on the prime minister’s personal brand.”

WATCH: Trudeau disrupted by hecklers at Toronto funding announcement

An Ipsos poll from last month put the Conservatives at 40 percent, 10 points ahead of the Liberals.

The Ipsos poll, conducted exclusively for Global News, found Trudeau’s approval rating of 40 per cent had slipped below Trump’s 43 per cent, while the Conservative Party established a double-digit lead over the Liberals.

The poll found that if an election were to be held last month, the Conservatives would have received 40 per cent of the vote among decided voters, according to the poll of 1,002 Canadians conducted between March 25 and 27.

Trudeau, the oldest son of the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has from the start pushed a progressive agenda in support of gender equality, the environment and aboriginal rights, all issues that appeal to his core voters, but which after more than three years sound increasingly scripted to some.

Trudeau is not helped by the optics of the scandal involving SNC-Lavalin Group Inc, a prominent Montreal-based engineering and construction firm that has been accused of bribing Libyan officials to get contracts between 2001 and 2011.

The prime minister has been on the defensive over allegations government officials inappropriately pressured Canada’s former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to drop a criminal case against the company in favor of a deferred prosecution agreement, or out-of-court settlement.

WATCH: SNC-Lavalin revives bid for deal to avoid criminal trial

Wilson-Raybould, the first indigenous justice minister in Canadian history, resigned over the scandal. Former Treasury Board chief Jane Philpott also quit in protest. They were two of the highest-profile women in Trudeau’s Cabinet.

Political Pivot

So far, Trudeau’s strategy appears to have changed little, and people close to him say he plans to ride it out without major shifts in strategy.

“Successful politicians know when to pivot, and they have a strong survival instinct,” Nanos said, calling the scandal the “first major test of Justin Trudeau’s leadership.”

READ MORE: Most Canadians side with Wilson-Raybould, believe Trudeau has lost moral authority to govern: Ipsos poll

Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker said even before the crisis erupted in early February, Trudeau’s support had been softening amid complaints he had broken major commitments such as reforming the voting system and balancing the budget by 2019.

“Justin Trudeau was standing on thin ice at the end of last year, and then somebody handed him an anvil and crash, the ice broke,” Bricker said.

WATCH: MPs Wilson-Raybould and Philpott removed from Liberal caucus

“There’s a credibility problem driven by a bunch of things, one of which is promises made and not kept.”

In a bid to finally put the scandal behind him, Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus last week.

According to Nanos, the data is based on random telephone interviews of 1,000 Canadian adults using a four week rolling average of 250 respondents each week. The random sample of 1,000 respondents may be weighted by age and gender using the latest census information for Canada. The survey is accurate to ±3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

By Dave Graham

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The former political party of Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador issued a blistering attack against the veteran leftist on Wednesday, accusing him of pushing the country toward authoritarianism.

In a full-page advertisement in newspaper Reforma, the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) said Lopez Obrador was dismantling 30 years of reforms aimed at checking the power of the state under Mexico's old rulers.

""We're in the process of restoring a presidential, centralizing and authoritarian system which weakens and suppresses the legislative branch and undermines the independence of the judiciary,"" the PRD said.

Once Mexico's main left-of-center group, the PRD has been reduced to a rump of its former self since Lopez Obrador split to form a new party after finishing runner-up in the 2012 presidential election.

Spokespeople for the president and the party he founded after the leaving the PRD, the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

In office since December, the president has enjoyed soaring levels of popularity while blaming Mexico's problems on old rivals and the previous six administrations.

He has dominated the political agenda with a daily morning news conference, often using it to criticize many checks and balances on his power from within civil society and the media.

The PRD's attack on him underlines the increasingly partisan flavor of politics in Mexico under Lopez Obrador.

Lopez Obrador says he is democratizing freedom of expression with his media conferences and has regularly pushed back against suggestions he aims to install an authoritarian government.

Through MORENA and its allies, Lopez Obrador has firm control of Congress, and adversaries fear that his concentration of power could soon extend to the Supreme Court.

MORENA has proposed increasing the number of judges in the court to create an anti-corruption chamber. His supporters reject criticism that the move is aimed at controlling the body.

For most of the past century, Mexico was ruled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which melded patronage and vote-rigging with corruption and authoritarianism.

As disaffection with the party's rule grew, a group of reform-minded politicians formed the PRD in the late 1980s. Like Lopez Obrador, many of its leaders once belonged to the PRI.

Serving as PRD chairman in the late 1990s, Lopez Obrador went on to become mayor of Mexico City for the party in 2000, and narrowly failed to win the presidency six years later.

Lopez Obrador refused to accept defeat in 2006, saying he had been robbed. Relations between him and other senior PRD figures gradually broke down and he decided to leave the party behind following his 2012 election defeat.

Many former stalwarts of the PRD joined Lopez Obrador after he founded MORENA, and the remnants of the party backed a rival candidate in the 2018 presidential election.

The PRI ruled Mexico from 1929 until it was voted out in 2000. Returning to power from 2012 to 2018, the PRI suffered a record defeat at the hands of Lopez Obrador in July.

Although my father was a die-hard Democrat, he always said the best thing we could do for America is pay Congress to stay home. There is little doubt he would have major questions regarding his association with the Democratic Party today, as they have made such a drastic turn to the left.

As a veteran of World War II, serving 44 months in combat, he observed the failed lies and utter destruction of socialism that had been heaped upon a suffering humanity through North Africa, Sicily, Italy, France into Germany.

As my father considered President Franklin D. Roosevelt to be the best president, he would be seriously angered by present-day Democrats hijacking the “New Deal” slogan to create their socialist-aimed “Green New Deal.”

Even worse, he would have been infuriated by Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker from New Jersey, who compared the program to going to the moon and defeating the Nazis.

Dad would have picked up the 14-page resolution and handed page 12 to Sen. Booker, saying, “Read lines 1 to 23. Are those not the same promises Adolf Hitler promised his people in 1933 who belonged to the National Sozialistische Deutsch Arbeiterparti?” (National Socialist German Workers' Party)

No doubt Booker and other Democratic presidential hopefuls who signed onto this plan would have been shocked anyone would go back that far to check out the origins of their plan.

My question: Has anyone actually cared to consider where Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York)and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts),who authored the plan, gathered their information?

Apparently it simply didn't matter because it took just hours for two top-tier Democratic presidential hopefuls to jump on the bandwagon promoting the $93 trillion deal.

Sen. Kamala Harris tweeted,“I’m proud to co-sponsor @AOC and @EdMarkey's Green New Deal.""

Likewise, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) tweeted, “A #GreenNewDeal is ambitious. It's bold. And I’m cosponsoring this resolution with @aoc and @senmarkey because it’s exactly the kind of action it will take to conquer the biggest threat of our lifetime.”

Although Roosevelt's plan was to lift America out of the most devastating depression in history, Ocasio-Cortez's plan is to remake America in the image of socialism like no one has ever seen.

Her $93 trillion plan calls for an overhaul of transportation system in the U.S., investing high-speed rail where possible and expanding electric vehicle manufacturing, possibly ending transportation as we know it. It could also change the future of farming and how our food is produced. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the cost of the program without any overruns would be roughly $600,000 per American household.

Additionally, their plan removes nuclear, biofuel and fossil fueled power plants, replacing them with hydro-electric, solar and wind power. However, no one can estimate how many acres of quality farm land and forest will be consumed in order to build the infrastructure.

Catherine Wolfram of the Berkeley Haas School of Business says, “If the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing,you're not producing energy. We really haven't figured out a wayto scale battery storageto make up for energy losswhen wind turbines and solar panels aren't producing.”

It appears logical to believe none of the socialist Democratic candidates truly understand socialism or its probable negative impacts on America. They can never tell you where money for their programs will come from, and in all honestly they don't care. Creating a Utopian socialist America that is dependent on government for everything is their singular agenda.

Former British Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher said, “The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money.”

This is the opinion of Gerry Feld, a lifelong Central Minnesota resident whose column is published the second Sunday of the month. He writes mostly about national issues from a conservative perspective.

However, the Democratic Party’s pursuit of identity politics will alienate working class voters and make Republicans ...","Over the past 40 years, we have thought of the business wings of the Democratic and Republican Parties as the political center in America because they support more moderate economic policies on taxation and regulation than the dominant Reagan paradigm and more socially liberal policies. However, a study by the Democracy Fund’s Voter Study Group shows that the real centrists are populists who are economically more progressive and socially more conservative.

This study focuses on policy positions rather than ideological self-identification because most voters don’t think ideologically but rather hold a mix of conservative and liberal policy positions. By comparing the positions of voters in the two parties, the study finds that the issues dividing the two parties concern government redistribution or the size and role of government and identity. Identity is a new cleavage that focuses on the meaning of being American and revolves around issues of race, immigration, and morality.

Their research also breaks down voters into four major groups based on these cleavages. Consistent liberals make up 45 percent of voters while consistent conservatives are 23 percent, libertarians, who are economically conservative and socially liberal, are 4 percent, and populists are 29 percent of the public. Thus, populists are the real centrists who determine which party win elections and the policy direction of the country. These populists are in both parties as almost half of Republicans are economic liberals, primarily working class voters, and most racial minorities are more religious and conservative than white Democrats. These divisions provide tensions within each party.

With populists the real center in American politics, what might we expect politics and policy to look like in the coming years? Democrats should have a political advantage as long as they stick to economics and their policies work. However, the Democratic Party’s pursuit of identity politics will alienate working class voters and make Republicans competitive. Republicans could have more success if they seek to reform existing social services rather than eliminating them while pursuing culturally conservative policies.

Economically, since 73 percent of Americans favor more liberal economic policies, we will probably see an expanded social safety net and more progressive taxation. The U.S. will likely adopt universal health care, a higher minimum wage, free technical college and job retraining, paid family leave, subsidized child care, greater pension security, more protectionist trade policies, and policies that promote green technologies. These programs will be paid through higher taxes on all voters, but especially the rich.

The 52 percent of Americans who are social conservatives are unlikely to reverse or stop social liberal gains but they will impede social liberal adventurism. Abortion will likely remain legal but moves to legalize late term abortions and require public funding of abortions will remain unpopular. Political correctness will remain unpopular because Americans are generally tolerant and oppose attempts to squelch dissenting social views. Laws preventing discrimination against the LGBTQ community will probably pass, but most states will probably protect the religious liberty of faith-based groups because many faith based organizations provide important social services to the poor and minorities. The appeal of a color blind society will continue to lessen support for affirmative action. Finally, the U.S. will remain welcoming to immigrants but we will see greater border security and enforcement of existing immigration laws to regulate the total number of immigrants and better assimilate new arrivals.

This is the first time in the island nation’s history that a single party has secured such a majority in parliament since the advent of multi-party democracy following the new constitution of 2008.

In September last year, the MDP’s Ibrahim Mohamed Solih came to power at the head of an opposition alliance after unseating former President Abdulla Yameen in the presidential election.

“Our biggest job is to ensure that the government of our president continues smoothly and peacefully,” Nasheed told hundreds of supporters.

At the end of last year, Nasheed returned from exile. A court in the Maldives had sentenced him to 13 years in prison for terrorism, after what Anmesty International said was “a deeply flawed and politically motivated trial”.

154,ScienceAndTechnology,2019-04-08T14:03:00.0000000Z,"Now, CSE says that it is ""highly likely"" that interference in Canada’s democratic process will be done using similar tools that have been implemented in other countries, such as amplifying polarizing political issues; promoting one party over another ...","OTTAWA – The 2019 federal election is ""very likely"" going to be the target of foreign cyber interference, with voters being the most likely targets of this anticipated meddling, a new report from Canada's electronic spy agency warns.

The report is also putting renewed spotlight on the risks of not having more robust cybersecurity and transparency requirements for social media platforms and political parties in place in advance of this year’s campaign, given these two areas are cited as being potential targets for foreign actors.

""An increasing number of foreign adversaries have the cyber tools, the organizational capacity and a sufficiently advanced understanding of Canada's political landscape to direct cyber interference during the 2019 federal election, should they have the strategic intent,"" the report states.

The report is an update to the 2017 Cyber Threats to Canada's Democratic Process report published by the Communication Security Establishment (CSE).

The 2017 report noted that Canada's electoral process would not be immune from potential interference by outside actors, and that federal candidates, parties, and voters are all at risk. The update notes that the likelihood of online election meddling has increased as the amount of cyber interference in other countries has increased over the last two years.

Now, CSE says that it is ""highly likely"" that interference in Canada’s democratic process will be done using similar tools that have been implemented in other countries, such as amplifying polarizing political issues, promoting one party over another or discouraging participating in the election altogether.

The document repeatedly cites Russia as an example of a foreign country that has been proven to be conducting this kind of cyber interference, including during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Though a CSE official speaking to reporters on background said it is not anticipated that interference in the Canadian election will be on the same scale as what Americans experienced.

The intention of cyber interference is to compromise or gain access to information, or to use online means to ""covertly manipulate online information"" in order to influence voters' opinions and ultimately the outcome of the election.

CSE says that the short-term consequences of this foreign meddling include burying legitimate information and distracting voters from important election issues, while the more long-term impacts include weakening the public’s trust in the democratic process and creating divisions with international allies while promoting foreign economic or geopolitical interests.

CSE has identified four key trends from recent examples of foreign interference that could play out in Canada in the lead-up and during the upcoming election campaign:

Elections targeted by foreign threats are increasing worldwide, more than tripling in OECD countries since the last time Canada held a federal election in 2015;

Online foreign interference increasingly targets voters directly through creating and spreading misleading information on social media;

Politicians, their parties, and their staff are targets for more advanced cyber attacks such as obtaining private information for the purpose of blackmail, accessing campaign databases, or being discredited by AI-generated video that appears real, known as ""deep fakes""; and

The electoral system itself is not immune, though in Canada where paper ballots are still used it is not considered a likely or even possible avenue for meddling.

Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan held a news conference to discuss the report's findings, where both stated that ensuring the election remains secured against this threat is the government's top priority. The ministers pointed to the series of new measures unveiled earlier this year that are aimed at further shoring up Canada's electoral system from foreign interference and disinformation.

""Foreign cyber interference targeting voters has become the most common type of cyber threat activity against the democratic processes worldwide,"" Sajjan said, calling the report the ""next step"" in the government’s preparedness efforts. ""The more we talk about these threats, the better we are prepared to react.""

The initiatives the federal government unveiled in January include a new plan to inform Canadians about serious meddling attempts during the campaign, the creation of a multi-departmental task force aimed at preventing interference attempts, and launching a new campaign for citizen-literacy about misinformation online.

As well, the elections modernization Bill C-76 passed parliament in January, making broad changes to Canada's elections laws, including new limits on spending and foreign participation, while also aiming to boost accessibility and participation in democracy.

It implements new political party spending limits; adds new reporting measures for third parties conducting partisan work; and also proposes multiple changes aimed at eliminating foreign interference and spending, including prohibiting organizations selling advertising from knowingly accepting elections ads from foreign actors.

Canada already subject to meddling

Canada has already seen examples of foreign interference outside of the election period, the report notes. ""Since the 2015 federal election, Canadian political leaders and the Canadian public have been targeted by foreign cyber interference activities.""

Among the examples of how this has already played out in Canada:

A foreign adversary has ""manipulated social media using cyber tools to spread false or misleading information relating to Canada on Twitter"" and has used social media to amplify viewpoints that are critical of Canadian legislation;

There have been foreign state-sponsored media attacks on federal cabinet ministers.

While not referenced specifically in the report, an example of a minister who has been disparaged online by foreign entities is Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland, who faced questions in Canada about pro-Russian outlets ""sharing scurrilous stories"" -- as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau once put it—about her grandfather allegedly helping the Nazis during the Second World War.

Political databases 'attractive' target

CSE's report states that political parties remain “attractive targets” for attacks, as parties, candidates, and staff made up one tenth of the cyber attacks against democratic processes.

This casts back into the spotlight one area left out of Bill C-76: tougher privacy rules and oversight for political parties and the data that they harvest from the electorate.

While the legislation does require political parties to create and publish their privacy policies when it comes to the collection and protection of Canadians’ personal information, various privacy watchdogs and the New Democratic Party were pushing for more concrete measures.

""Foreign adversaries may steal voter or party databases because they fetch a price on illicit areas of the Internet, where large quantities of personal identity information are constantly bought and sold. They can steal sensitive campaign documents and communications and sell or release them,"" the report states.

As part of the existing plan, Canada's intelligence agencies have been, and will continue to advise political parties about enhancing their security and offering classified threat briefings to senior party leadership.

Defending the government’s decision to not implement more strict rules for political parties, Gould said she has asked a House of Commons committee to study the matter further, though it remains to be seen whether that study will occur and conclude in time for additional policies to be put in place before voters head to the polls.

""This is something I think can be achieved but I think requires more study,"" she said.

Gould not confident social media doing enough

In January the Liberals called on social media platforms to do more, restating their expectation that they will crack down on disinformation and enhance their transparency -- though there is no policy or legislation compelling co-operation.

Gould said conversations about the roles companies such as Facebook and Twitter play in the election have had ""varying degrees of success,"" and not as much progress as anticipated.

""I don't have the confidence that they are disclosing everything with us, and I think that from experiences that we've seen around the word, there's a lot left to be desired in terms of how seriously they’re taking these issues,"" Gould said.

The report notes that social media has become the predominate space where people access information, and as a result is often where these cyber interferers are looking to manipulate information.

""I'm not feeling great about where we are right now,"" Gould said, adding that she is still in ""active conversations"" about the potential of pursuing further regulations if these social networks don’t take more robust measures on their own.

NDP MP Nathan Cullen criticized the government’s response to the report and the ""total lack of regulations.""

""We're now just six months or so from the next election, the government failed; chose not to bring in tough new rules for their last election bill,"" Cullen said, adding that he thinks there may still be time to implore big social networks to work more collaboratively with government on this.

""There's a brawl breaking out in the public square and they should do something about it,"" Cullen said.

This would go further than what Bill C-76 has set out requirements for: the creation of a registry of all digital advertising published and paid for by third parties and political parties, as well as nominated and prospective candidates during the pre-writ and writ periods.

In response to this, Google has announced that it will instead be banning all political advertising during the election rather than trying to compile a registry, while Facebook is launching a library that will capture this information.

In a statement to CTVNews.ca, Colin McKay, head of government policy for Google Canada, said that Google is ""combating misinformation and working with the Canadian government to fight cyber threats."" McKay says there have been several meetings with key elections players including Elections Canada to discuss cybersecurity and misinformation.

""We have every intention of continuing our close work with government to protect Canada's democratic institutions and election activities,"" he said.",Foreign cyber interference in 2019 'very likely': new report,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/foreign-cyber-interference-in-2019-very-likely-new-report-1.4370321

History’s biggest democratic election begins

TENS of millions of Indians joined nationwide queues on Thursday to give their verdict on nationalist prime minister Narendra Modi as the world’s biggest election started amid deadly clashes.

Election officials reported a heavy turnout across the 20 states taking part in the first day of the massive exercise which involves 900 million eligible voters and will take nearly six weeks to complete.

While the 68-year-old Modi remains popular because of his tough stance on national security, he is under pressure over unemployment and controversial economic measures.

Insults and fake news have surged on social media in the run-up to the poll as Modi’s right wing Bharatiya Janatha Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress party stake their claims.

On the ground, security forces were on high alert and two members of regional parties were killed in clashes outside a polling station in Tadipatri, Andhras Pradesh state, media said.

After five people, including a local lawmaker, were killed by a roadside bomb planted by suspected Maoist rebels on Tuesday, the insurgents were blamed for two voting day blasts in Chhatisgarh and Maharashtra states.

Tens of thousands of armed police, paramilitaries and troops guarded polling stations in Jammu and Kashmir which is in the grip of an insurrection that took India to the verge of a new war with neighbouring Pakistan less than two months ago.

Thousands of parties and candidates are running for office in the seven separate days of voting in 543 constituencies up to May 19. Final results will be released on May 23.

Some 1.1 million electronic voting machines are being taken around the country for the votes, with some transported through jungles and carried up mountains, including to a hamlet near the Chinese border with just one voter.

Some 142 million people were eligible for the first day of voting.

Polling stations in northeastern states like Arunachal Pradesh bordering China were the first to open, followed by parts of Bihar in the north.

In Assam in the northeast, queues started forming well before voting began, including many of the 84 million first-time voters who could play a decisive role in the outcome.

“It’s a great feeling to cast the vote, which makes me a part of the democratic system and makes me responsible for electing a good leader,” Anurag Baruah, 23, said.

Modi appealed in a tweet to his 46.8 million followers to “turn out in record numbers.

He swept to power in 2014 with the biggest landslide in 30 years.

Critics, however, accuse him of imposing a Hindu agenda, emboldening attacks on Muslims and low-caste Dalits, re-writing school textbooks and re-naming cities.

Modi has simplified the tax code and made doing business easier, but some promises have fallen short. Thousands of indebted farmers have committed suicide in recent years.

Growth in Asia’s third-biggest economy has been too slow to provide jobs for the roughly one million Indians entering the labour market each month.

Rahul Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress party and the latest in his family dynasty hoping to become prime minister, has accused Modi of causing a “national disaster”.",History’s biggest democratic election begins,The Phnom Penh Post,https://www.phnompenhpost.com/international/historys-biggest-democratic-election-begins
156,,2019-04-08T21:13:00.0000000Z,"Trump said on Twitter, “I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job!” The 47-year-old McAleenan has navigated through Democratic and Republican administrations, avoiding fire-breathing ideological rhetoric and keeping a relatively low profile even ...","EL PASO, Texas - Kirstjen Nielsen’s replacement as Homeland Security secretary was practicing law in California when hijacked jets struck the World Trade Center and Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001. That night, he applied for a job with the FBI. “I was trying to pay off student loans and then go for a federal career but decided it couldn’t wait,” Kevin McAleenan told The Associated Press in 2017. Robert C. Bonner, the new head of what was then called the U.S. Customs Service, got to McAleenan before the FBI and asked him to move to Washington to help set up an anti-terrorism office. A series of promotions over the next 18 years at what is now called Customs and Border Protection culminated Sunday when President Donald Trump named McAleenan to serve as acting Homeland Security secretary, when Nielsen leaves office later this week. It is in some ways an unusual choice. Trump and his supporters have railed against both Obama administration policies and career government officials. But in picking McAleenan, Trump will have as his point person on politically charged border issues someone who served as a top Obama administration immigration official, in addition to serving under President George W. Bush. Yet McAleenan appears to have endeared himself to Trump, who tweeted Sunday: “I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job!” While avoiding fire-breathing ideological rhetoric and keeping a relatively low profile, McAleenan played a critical role executing some of Trump’s most controversial policies. As Customs and Border Protection commissioner, he helped put in practice a “zero tolerance” policy on illegal entries that caused thousands of children to be separated from their families at the border. He also oversaw the rapid spread of a practice to limit the number of asylum seekers who can enter the country at border crossings with Mexico, which he blames on processing constraints.

He has also shown strong interest in understanding why large numbers of Central American families are coming to the U.S., travelling to Guatemala’s western highlands last year on a fact-finding mission. He put renewed emphasis on providing medical attention to migrants after two Guatemalan children died in U.S. custody. But McAleenan angered many Democrats when he didn’t mention the death of one of those children, a girl, during congressional testimony last year. Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat and chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said he called for McAleenan’s resignation after the omission, which McAleenan said was an effort to avoid politicizing the little girl’s death. “He cannot be trusted as Acting DHS Secretary based on his record of prioritizing Trump’s harmful policies that undermine national security and the economy, and hurt vulnerable families and children at the border,” Castro said. “The Hispanic Caucus will continue to hold the Trump Administration accountable for its actions against immigrants and against the will of the American people.”

Still, McAleenan was confirmed as Customs and Border Protection commissioner on a 77-19 Senate vote last year and has won praise from former colleagues and politicians across the political spectrum for his sharp intellect. As commissioner, he oversaw 60,000 employees and managed an annual budget of more than $13 billion. “Kevin is a true patriot,” said Gil Kerlikowske, Customs and Border Protection commissioner from 2014 to 2017 and former police chief in Seattle and Buffalo, New York. “He’s incredibly smart, he’s got a great intellect, he’s very thoughtful, and he has a level of integrity and honesty that is very impressive. In my whole career, I can probably count on one hand the number of people that I’ve worked with that have reached Kevin’s level in all of those areas.” Jay Ahern, acting head of Customs and Border Protection in the administration of George W. Bush, said McAleenan is a quick study who can recall important data when he needs it. He praised McAleenan’s humility as border chief. “You want someone who has a certain amount of compassion for the people they encounter,” Ahern said. “You have to have that humanitarian side to be a leader for this.”

That may be at odds with the president’s hardline policies, Ahern said, but “Kevin has the ability to be very flexible and understanding of the political direction and can strike that right balance.” McAleenan says was influenced at University of Chicago Law School in the 1990s by a professor, Gidon Gottlieb, who warned that that the U.S. was ill-prepared for a terrorist attack. “He pounded the table and basically said we’re waiting for a Pearl Harbour-style terrorist attack,” McAleenan told the AP. “He was right, unfortunately.” After working on counterterrorism issues, he supervised Customs and Border Protection operations at Los Angeles International Airport from 2006 to 2008 — “the best job I’ll ever have,” he said in the 2017 interview. From there, he steadily climbed the ranks. White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Monday that McAleenan is “extremely knowledgeable” and wants to work with Trump to put the president’s policies into effect. “There’s no daylight between the two of ‘em,” Gidley said on Fox News Channel. “We’re happy to work with him.” ___ Associated Press writers Colleen Long and Jill Colvin in Washington contributed to this report.",New Homeland Security chief has worked across party lines,Toronto Star,https://www.thestar.com/news/world/us/2019/04/08/new-homeland-security-chief-has-worked-across-party-lines.html
157,,2019-04-10T20:27:00.0000000Z,"Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders has a new and improved version of his Medicare for all plan ... There is no Republican plan for universal health coverage, and the party seems lost on the issue after trying and failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act ...","Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders has a new and improved version of his Medicare for all plan. His vision for government-run health care for every American now includes long-term care for seniors and the disabled, and a few other tweaks. The 2020 presidential candidate also proposes some general ways to pay for the costly plan, such as new taxes on the wealthy, big banks and some other businesses.

The bigger news, however, is that Medicare for All now has a lot of competition. With health care continuing to be a top voter concern, Congressional Democrats have rolled out a range of proposals for making care cheaper and easier to obtain, without the huge tax hikes and massive disruption – and voter heartburn – Medicare for all would entail.

Sanders’ MFA plan—supported by at least 7 other presidential candidates—would eliminate the private insurance system through which 175 million Americans get coverage. Employers would no longer provide insurance for their workers, with everybody moving into the government plan. A surge of newly covered patients could stress the system and create long waits for some care. Doctors would get paid less, which might draw some would-be caregivers into other fields. Nobody knows if patients would be able to keep their doctors or be forced to see whoever’s available.

A Sanders-style plan would boost federal health care spending from $1.1 trillion per year to 3.5 trillion per year, according to a new analysis from Rand. That would require big tax hikes. But employers and individuals would no longer pay for health care, and it’s possible the nation might get more bang for the buck from a single national program with enhanced purchasing power. Still, the transition to a national program would produce many losers—starting with millions of insurance-company workers and others who’d lose their jobs—which makes the idea politically explosive and probably untenable.

More options

But there’s also a bill called the Medicare X plan that would establish a new federal plan for people who can’t find affordable private-sector coverage, while leaving the employer-sponsored market alone. Enrollees would pay premiums covering most of the cost, with no need for major tax hikes. The Choose Medicare Act would create a new program called Medicare Part E for anybody who doesn’t currently qualify for a federal program, which would also leave the private system in place and require enrollees in the new program to pay premiums. Another plan would let states offer Medicaid to anybody, with enrollees above certain income threshold paying premiums.

The Commonwealth Fund, which tracks health care legislation, counts at least 11 Congressional proposals for moving toward universal coverage that includes everybody. Only four of those call for a huge single-payer system. And one of those, unlike the Sanders plan, would require enrollees to pay premiums or co-pays, to help cover the cost.

The other seven plans would leave most or all of the current system in place, while seeking to expand coverage or lower costs through more government options. That approach seems more politically feasible, since in general it wouldn’t require people who like their current coverage—whether public or private—to give it up.

All of these proposals come from Democrats. There is no Republican plan for universal health coverage, and the party seems lost on the issue after trying and failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017, when Republicans controlled both branches of Congress and the White House. The Trump administration is still trying to kill the ACA, by joining a lawsuit claiming the ACA is invalid now that Congress has lowered the penalty for failing to get insurance to $0. Legal experts say the suit will probably fail. But if it doesn’t, the Trump administration has no backup plan and popular provisions of the ACA, such as a ban on insurance exclusions for pre-existing conditions, will disappear.

The time wasn’t right for another big health-care reform effort in 2016. The ACA was still highly controversial and voters, in electing Trump, decided to give a private-sector businessman a shot at something other than government solutions. Trump has done nothing on health care, and an improving economy hasn’t solved the health care affordability problems. So health care will be on the ballot in 2020. And Medicare for all may not end up the front-runner.",What’s really new about 'Medicare for all',Finance Yahoo,https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-really-new-about-medicare-for-all-202152067.html

Editor’s note: The opinions in this article are the author’s, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.

When are Democrats going to try to summon Stephen Miller to Capitol Hill and grill him under oath about his direct role in so much of the chaos, incompetence and increasingly malevolent extremism gripping the Trump administration right now?

Miller, as the chief architect of President Trump’s immigration agenda, is a key figure behind Trump’s ongoing purge of the Department of Homeland Security and the president’s related embrace of ever-more cruel and radical policies. Miller’s views drew fresh scrutiny when Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) tweeted that Miller is a “white nationalist” whose “influence on policy and political appointments” remains an “outrage.”

Subscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today’s most popular stories on The Washington Post

But, while Miller’s worldview has obviously been important in shaping Trump’s policies, his influence should be understood in another way, too: He is one of the leading figures pushing the Trump administration toward increasing venality, corruption and lawlessness.

Remarkable new revelations underscore this point — and the need for a tough Democratic reaction to it.

The Post reports that White House officials “tried to pressure U.S. immigration authorities” to release detained immigrants into “sanctuary cities” to “retaliate” against Trump’s “political adversaries.”

Relying on internal emails and interviews with administration sources, Rachael Bade and Nick Miroff report that administration officials twice proposed transporting people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement into sanctuary cities.

While these officials claimed this would ostensibly help deal with detention constraints, they expressly considered releasing them into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s district in California and into other Democratic strongholds. According to one DHS official. the rationale was “retaliation” against Democrats who at the time were resisting more money for ICE detention beds.

But senior ICE lawyers advised that this would have no legal basis. The acting deputy director of ICE told the White House that “paying to transport aliens to another location to release them” would not be a “justified expenditure.”

You’ll be shocked to hear that Miller was apparently involved in this affair. The Post reports that Miller “discussed the proposal with ICE.” As one congressional investigator who spoke to a whistle-blower revealing the scheme notes: “It was basically an idea that Miller wanted that nobody else wanted to carry out.”

The problem with this ugly scheme, obviously, is the use of migrants and the wielding of their fates as political tools — the idea that they can just be dumped anywhere for the express purpose of pressuring public officials from the opposing party to do Trump’s bidding. The presumption that this would pressure them is itself deeply problematic. Then there’s the proposed use of public resources for this purpose, which is arguably corrupt and legally dubious.

Miller’s involvement in the DHS purge

This type of flouting of the law and unbridled contempt for basic governing procedure has also saturated Trump’s ongoing purge of DHS. According to multiple reports, one key reason Trump grew enraged with DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, and ousted her, was that she would not break the law at his command by shutting down the border to asylum seekers entirely.

Miller has been deeply involved in all of this. Politico reports that Miller has personally pressured numerous officials at agencies to do more to stem the influx of migrants, in what one official described as “intimidation.” It seems plausible that, at a minimum, Miller may have egged on Trump to push Nielsen to break the law by banning asylum-seekers.

Miller should face deeper and tougher scrutiny from House Democrats about his involvement in all of it. They can hold hearings and demand that he testify — which could shed light on both Trump’s efforts to flout the law and on the colossal mess Trump is making of border policy right now.

“That would absolutely be a good use of congressional resources,” Josh Chafetz, a professor at Cornell Law School who wrote a fine book on Congress’s hidden powers, told me. Chafetz added that this is particularly urgent, given that in this “central area of policy for the administration,” many of the initiatives “seem to be coming directly from the White House.”

Chafetz said the White House would assert executive privilege to keep Miller from testifying, but that the House shouldn’t accept it. “There’s no reason Congress shouldn’t learn what’s going on with the formulation of immigration policy,” Chafetz said. “If Miller refuses to testify, they should hold him in contempt.” Chafetz suggested threatening to defund Miller’s salary to compel his testimony.

Beyond accountability?

Miller has been deeply involved in Trump’s most consequential and disastrous decisions, sometimes in highly questionable ways. He helped orchestrate the slapdash rollout of Trump’s thinly veiled Muslim ban, which proceeded despite two DHS analyses undercutting its rationale. Miller intervened to bury internal data showing refugees are a net economic positive. Miller played a major role in pushing forward Trump’s horrific family separations, despite internal warnings that they would traumatize migrant children.

Yet we face a basic problem here. Positions like that of Miller — powerful but murkily defined White House advisory roles that don’t require Senate confirmation — tend to be beyond basic scrutiny and accountability.

“Miller is effectively in charge of DHS,” Douglas Rivlin, the communications director at America’s Voice, told me. “If he’s running the show and pressuring agencies to take outlandish or illegal actions, he ought to face the same oversight that Cabinet secretaries face.”

Democrats should use every single tool at their disposal to try to hold these people accountable.

His was an ambition steeped in love for the vulnerable lot of the society. From the get-go, he pulled himself by the bootstrap, walking the path that was not only fraught with thorns, but slippery to boot.

Roland Igbadumhe, the candidate of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, in the recently concluded Edo State House of Assembly elections, lost his bid to represent the Etsako East Constituency following the declaration of Honourable Kingsley Ugabi of the All Progressives Congress, APC, as the winner but for him, a statement has already been written for posterity.

Born to the late James Ebui (J.E) Igbadume, a school principal and an alumnus of the University of Ibadan; Roland started off as a comedian at the Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, Edo state, providing top-notch entertainment on campus and neighbouring communities. In no distant time, his talent and impeccable delivery shot him into national limelight as he joined such notable names in the game as Gordons, AY, Basket Mouth, Seyi Law, I Go Dye, I Go Save, Maliki and a host of others to bring sheer excitement to Nigerians across major cities of the world.

With only a few years in the game, his stage name, Youngest Old man literally relegated his first name Roland to the background as his stage delivery turned him into one the most sought-after comedians in the country and beyond.

Such was his popularity that the then Edo state governor and now, national chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole appointed him as Senior Special Adviser on Entertainment; a position he capitalized upon to attract development projects to Ward 9, comprising Itsukwi, Imiegba and Imiakebu communities.

Speaking With Saturday Vanguard on his motive for seeking an elective position, the comedian-turned politician said: “From Oshiomhole, I learned the value of the significance of public power and how best to use it for the collective good. I love my people and it grieves my heart anytime I see most of them struggling to eke out a living. So I felt, why not give it a try and test my popularity at the polls? I am very grateful to the people of Etsako East constituency for the love and support. They demonstrated their support in ways I cannot explain.”

X-raying the factors that cost him the bid to represent his people at the Edo State House of Assembly, Roland fingered vote buying; a vice he described as disgusting and shameful, saying, “I do not believe in vote buying. While voting was ongoing, agents of the so-called big parties were going about offering financial inducement to the electorate. I believe this is why we lost but I am very proud of how we were able to take SDP to the nooks and cranny of the entire Etsako East.”

Roland’s emergence as SDP flag bearer marked the first time in 20 years a candidate from Ward 9 made it to the big stage; a feat he attributed to the tricks he learnt from Comrade Oshiomhole. According to him, “Oshiomhole taught me the rudiments of campaign and how to make a campaign message simple and interesting. In the few months our campaign lasted, we toured everywhere to sell our message of hope and redemption.”

In line with his personal principle and as mark of respect for thousands of his supporters, Roland turned down financial inducement to bow out of the race, preferring instead to test his popularity at the polls, stressing that one of the drawbacks of the nation’s political system is the perennial practice of settling for crumbs at the expense of deep-seated ideas capable of turning around the fortunes of a people and nation.

“I am not a millionaire but no amount of money in this world can buy my conscience. So when they came around, dangling carrots in front of me, I told them to go home because no pounds, euros or dollars can buy the conscience of Roland Igbadumhe,” he added.

So has Roland dumped the SDP now that the elections are over?” asked our correspondent to which the former governor’s aide had this to say: “I am a bonafide member of the SDP. There is no truth in the insinuations here and there that I have left the party. We are here for a purpose and that purpose is to make democracy count for the people. For now, there is no reason to think outside the SDP because we believe it is the platform of the people and for the people.

Despite opposition from legislative leadership and new Republican Gov. Bill Lee, members of the minority party filed several bills that would have allowed Lee to negotiate Medicaid expansion with the federal government.

A House subcommittee killed one proposal, from Rep. Gloria Johnson (D-Knoxville), on Wednesday. She called her plan the “Mike Pence Medicaid Act of 2019,” in reference to the expansion of Medicaid under then-Indiana Gov. Pence. Republicans were not amused.

“If we want to score political points, there’s a press conference room down the hall that everyone can use,” said Rep. Matthew Hill (R-Jonesborough), chairman of the House TennCare Subcommittee.

Hill also pressed Johnson on her request that the committee “be like Mike.” Indiana’s expansion, Hill said, featured copays, work requirements and monthly fees, but Johnson did not support those provisions in a potential expansion.

Rep. Mike Stewart (D-Nashville) withdrew his similar expansion proposal this week in order to back Johnson’s. Rep. Jason Hodges (D-Clarksville) pushed his expansion bill off until next year, and Stewart said the caucus would prepare to get behind that proposal moving forward.

“We’re going to have to keep pushing this issue until economic realities make it impossible for Republicans in the legislature to continue to block this sensible policy,” Stewart said. “It’s a matter of time.”

Stewart also suggested that, were Lee to back an expansion proposal, it could easily pass.

Former Republican Gov. Bill Haslam hoped to expand Medicaid, like Pence, in the state following the passage of the Affordable Care Act. But he came up against opposition from his fellow Republicans in the legislature. During last year’s gubernatorial campaign, Lee repeatedly said he did not support expansion, a key cleavage between him and his Democratic opponent, Karl Dean.",Democratic Medicaid Expansion Plays Done for the Year,Nashville Scene,https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/pith-in-the-wind/article/21063855/democratic-medicaid-expansion-plays-done-for-the-year
162,Politics,2019-04-13T04:10:00.0000000Z,"A recent New Yorker essay mentioned that ... found that two-thirds of Republicans believe their party is ‘outside the mainstream,’ on the issue.” Thus, my second main reason for arguing that Democratic presidential candidates should make climate ...","If you’re a progressive and look at all the Democratic candidates for the 2020 presidential election, you might wonder which one to support. (I realize some progressives may not support any Democrat, but that’s another issue.) Personally, I’ve decided to wait and see how things develop—for primary voters in many states, including California and Michigan (my own state) we still have almost a year to decide.

But I do know one thing: for me the top issue is climate change, and I would argue that it should be for progressives generally. The most important reason is that nothing else—including medical care, the economy, income inequality, immigration, racism, or the gender or race of a candidate—is more important. I say this as a grandfather of six, who is thinking not only of the welfare of my generation, but also of our children’s and grandchildren’s generation.

Here I will refrain from trying to convince doubters that it most certainly is the #1 issue. 36 years ago, I wrote that “the increased burning of fossil fuels might cause an increase in global temperatures, thereby possibly melting the polar ice caps, and flooding low-lying parts of the world.” For an update on that situation, see the 2015 Time article, “New Orleans and Miami Are Doomed to Be Swallowed by the Sea, Says New Study,” or the April 2019 PBS Newshour segment that proclaimed that the ice on Antarctica (a continent larger than the U.S. and Mexico combined) is melting much faster than expected and that continued rapid melting could imperil low-lying cities (like New York, Boston, and Miami), and countries like Bangladesh. My first global-warming essay on this site was posted almost a decade ago, and since then there have been many more, including “Trump’s Worst Sin,” which identifies it as his anti-environmental policies. Interested readers can view some of these works for why I think climate change is, and has been for some time, our most pressing crisis.

So given the importance of the issue, we’re back to the question of which Democratic candidate would it be best to nominate in 2020. A recent New Yorker essay mentioned that Washington Governor Jay Inslee is running for the nomination “on what is essentially a single-issue platform. ‘If we don’t solve climate change, we won’t be around to solve anything else,’ he said.” That’s right on, and I’m glad Inslee is in the race. Yet, though climate change is the most important issue, it is not the only one. Numerous other factors must also be considered, as must the personal qualifications of the various candidates—as Trump has inadvertently reminded us, character and competence matter.

Although it is a tricky problem to consider, electability also matters. Several of my friends have said to me that they could support any one of several Democratic candidates and are likely to back the one they think has the best chance of defeating Trump. I have some sympathy with that position because Trump has been an utter disaster for the environment.

One reason for not jumping in yet to support a specific candidate is that it is still too early to tell who will have the best chance of defeating Trump and who will develop the best environmental policies.

But one reason for not jumping in yet to support a specific candidate is that it is still too early to tell who will have the best chance of defeating Trump and who will develop the best environmental policies.

Yet, at this stage, I do have a favorite, and it is Bernie. A recent Time article, “How the Green New Deal Is Forcing Politicians to Finally Address Climate Change,” compares his record with that of other Democratic candidates (and senators) such as Elizabeth Warren, Corey Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Kamala Harris and finds it superior to theirs. Ditto for Beto O’Rourke. Inslee’s main problem, at this point, is that he still has not generated much support. Several other candidates, such as Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Buttigieg, recognize the climate-change crisis, and “Gabbard can arguably be considered as one of the most aggressive Democrats when it comes to climate policy.” Her congressional bill, Off Fuels for a Better Future Act, “has been cited as one of the pieces of legislation that could feature in a Green New Deal”—a congressional resolution that many of the Democratic candidates support.

Yet, heretofore, it has been Bernie Sanders that has demonstrated the most leadership on the climate question. A 2011-2015 ranking by the liberal climatehawksvote.com site, based on a variety of criteria, lists Sanders above all other Congressional candidates now running for the 2020 nomination. The Time article mentioned above notes that he has “has a long record of introducing climate legislation big and small in the Senate, [and] plans to unveil a broad environmental plan. It is expected to include massive investment in infrastructure, the elimination of fossil-fuel subsidies and a ban on fossil-fuel extraction on public lands.”

In addition, Sanders has been supported by one of the most ardent climate activist in the world, the founder of 350.org, Bill McKibben. In 2016, Bernie appointed him to the committee charged with writing the Democratic Party’s platform, and in a video on the current Sanders’ web site the two men discuss climate change. In early December, 2018, the senator hosted a climate-change town hall, on which McKibben appeared. So too did one of the co-sponsors of the Green New Deal, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who had campaigned for Bernie in 2016. She proclaimed that the Green New Deal was “going to be the Great Society, the moonshot, the civil rights movement of our generation.”

Although Republicans and conservatives have criticized many aspects of the resolution, it does at least signal the increasing public awareness of climate change. As a December 2018 Mother Jones article stated:

There are a number of reasons for the increased prominence of the issue: Recent reports from both the United Nations and the federal government that have recast climate change in the public eye from a niche, future-tense issue to an urgent problem. Record-breaking fires, extreme weather, and repeated hurricanes have given the public clear examples of what had previously been only warnings from scientists. Plus, there’s a stronger movement of youth activism than ever before, reacting to the Trump administration’s complete contempt of global warming,

Given all this, 2020 is shaping up to be a perfect storm for climate change to take on a central position in the Democratic debate.

Other observers agree that the U. S. public finally seems ready to acknowledge that climate change is important. The Time article mentioned above states: “That reality has resonated with the public: more than 70% of Americans now understand that climate change is taking place, according to data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. A February NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey found that two-thirds of Republicans believe their party is ‘outside the mainstream,’ on the issue.”

Thus, my second main reason for arguing that Democratic presidential candidates should make climate change their #1 issue: It is where Trump is most vulnerable and clearly in the wrong. No other matter provides such a golden opportunity to hammer and hammer and hammer away at Trump’s failures—his ignorance; his denial of reality; his disdain for the future, for global opinion, and for common people (including all the victims of extreme fires, floods, hurricanes, etc.); and his preference for gas, oil, and coal corporations. Of all the issues that will be contested in the 2020 elections, climate change most clearly favors the Democrats.

In her 1967 essay “Truth and Politics,” Hannah Arendt suspected that politics may “be at war with truth in all its forms.” But she also stated that truth possesses a stubborn staying power that lies lack. “This is the reason that consistent lying, metaphorically speaking, pulls the ground from under our feet and provides no other ground on which to stand.”

Her comments are especially appropriate when applied to our liar-in-chief. He may be able to obfuscate, exaggerate, and flat out lie, but truth has more lasting power. Republicans and Trump may be able to point out deficiencies in the Green New Deal resolution—it is after all not proposed legislation but more an aspirational statement—but they cannot not escape the truth that they have been terrible laggards on the most important issue of our time.

Political leaders need not only to read polls and be attuned to the concerns of voters. They also need to lead. In 2020 they, especially the Democratic contenders for the presidential nomination, need to emphasize, forcefully and imaginatively, that climate change is the #1 issue. It is so for people in coastal and low-lying cities; it is for drought and flooded areas; it is for farmers and urbanites; it is for grandparents and grandchildren; it is for our citizens and those of other countries (including some Central Americans who are fleeing their countries for reasons connected with climate change), and it is for Republicans, as well as Democrats.

In a previous LA Progressive essay, I mentioned how Trump and the Republicans will attempt to scare 2020 voters with the cries “socialism” and “socialists,” and how Sanders (the only major “socialist,” but also Democratic, presidential contender) might deal with that tactic. We still have many months to see how effective his and other contenders’ campaigns will be.

My hope is that all of the Democratic candidates will emphasize that climate change is the #1 issue, and that they will help most voters to see that such is the case. We also need them to “keep their hand on that plow,” keep their “eyes on that prize,” and develop concrete steps (legislative and otherwise) so that we will not have to say (as I indicated four years ago), “Sorry Kids: We Were Too Stupid to Deal with Global Warming.”

By the beginning of 2020, we should have a better idea which Democratic candidate has best addressed the climate-change challenge and which one has the best chance of defeating Trump and reversing the horrible legacy he has left us.

Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has advised President Muhammadu Buhari to look for competent hands in forming his new cabinet.

Ganduje offered this advice while fielding questions from State House correspondents after a private meeting with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Friday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.

He said he was in the Presidential Villa to inform the Vice President that all was set for his visit to Kano State on Saturday for a marriage ceremony.

Ganduje said he also informed Osinbajo that Kano people were ready for him as they were delighted that the All Progressives Congress (APC) won the state.

“As far as I am concerned, he should look for brains rather than considering political parties that may decide to undermine him later.

“I think what is important is to get good brains, committed people who are experienced, who are achievers. I think that is what we need at this moment.’’

He said he was not jittery that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had approached the governorship election tribunal to challenge the outcome of the state governorship election.

Ganduje said that some political parties in the state had come together to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with his party, adding that a hand of friendship would be extended to the PDP.

The governor said that he had built a solid foundation for the development of the state, especially in terms of infrastructure, education and health.

“ So, we are taking Kano to the next level.

“We have seen the gaps that are existing in terms of development and we shall fill them and make Kano great,’’ he said.

In a speech to the national assembly, meeting to enact the new constitution, Castro said Cuba had been upping defense preparedness in recent months in view of increased U.S. hostility.

The island nation had also been adopting economic measures to contend with the Trump administration’s tightening of the decades-old U.S. trade embargo, Castro told legislators.

“We will never abandon our duty of acting in solidarity with Venezuela,” Castro said. “We reject strongly all types of blackmail.”

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday the United States would announce additional action to hold Cuba accountable for its support of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Cuban security and intelligence officials of propping up Maduro’s government. Cuba denies those claims.

“Cuba is being blamed for all evils, using lies and the worst kind of Hitlerian propaganda,” Castro said. “We have told the U.S. administration Cuba is not afraid and will continue building the future of the nation without outside interference.”

The enactment of the new constitution allows Cuba’s government to launch a modest revamp of its centrally planned single party system with dozens of laws expected on everything from the justice system to political structures.

Many observers are hopeful the government will open Cuba’s still inefficient state-run economy further to free enterprise with a law recognizing private businesses, not just self-employment, although they do not expect that to be among the first pieces of legislation it tackles.

That could give a boost to an economy which has had to contend with declining aid from Venezuela and a resulting cash crunch over the past three years, prompting the government to introduce austerity measures.

Shortages of basic goods have increased recently, including flour, eggs and chicken, with the state even reducing the size and circulation of its newspapers due to a lack of newsprint.

The situation could worsen further in coming months in view of the tightening U.S. trade embargo, Castro warned.

That did not mean a return to the kind of deep crisis Cuba experienced following the 1991 collapse of its former benefactor the Soviet Union, however, as its economy had diversified since then, he said.

SLEW OF NEW LAWS

Cubans overwhelmingly ratified the new constitution in a February referendum after a year of debate, updating its 1976 Soviet-era Magna Carta.

While it retains socialism as “irrevocable,” it codifies changes in Cuban society since 1991, like the opening of the economy to free enterprise, and includes a political restructuring among other changes.

Analysts say the constitution gives some leeway as to how reformist the around 50 laws needed to bring the legal system in line with it should be.

“The formation of a more open and democratic country depends on this process and not on the constitution,” said Cuban lawyer and legal columnist for independent media Eloy Viera Cañive.

The constitution stipulates that the national assembly must approve a new electoral law to reflect the restructuring of government within six months.

Within the following three months, it must elect a president, widely expected to remain Miguel Diaz-Canel, who succeeded Castro last April. That president must then appoint provincial governors and a prime minister - a new post separating the role of head of state from head of government.

The Magna Carta stipulates that within 18 months, new laws reflecting constitutional changes to the judicial system such as the presumption of innocence in criminal cases and habeas corpus should also be introduced.

New Delhi: India has reasons to cheer with Maldives President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih’s party appearing to have secured a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections held Saturday.

The election results are yet to be announced officially. The Elections Commission of Maldives said on Monday the results will be announced on 12 April while the swearing-in ceremony will take place on 28 May.

“I haven’t forgotten the hard work by our coalition partners to bring the country back from the brink of President Yameen’s disastrous rule. I will continue to work with the leaders of all our coalition partners to ensure we deliver on our pledges to the people,” Solih, who came to power in September last year, said Sunday as initial results started coming in.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday called Solih and congratulated him on his victory, said an official statement from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). Modi said Maldives will be a priority in India’s ‘neighbourhood-first’ policy, the statement added.

The election results come as a relief to India, which had been closely watching the developments in the island nation, as it marks Maldives’ return to ‘India first’ policy while arresting its tilt towards China, official sources told ThePrint.

Yameen’s ‘dictatorial’ rule

Maldives has traditionally been an ally of India and its strategic advantage has remained one of New Delhi’s crucial foreign policy priorities. However, under the rule of previous president Abdulla Yameen, who was perceived as pro-China, Maldives began to rapidly drift away from New Delhi towards Beijing.

Presidential elections held in September last year overthrew Yameen and brought in Solih. The parliamentary elections were necessitated as several allies of Solih’s Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) had sided with the opposition.

Yameen, who was jailed on charges of corruption and embezzlement, was released days before the parliamentary elections.

With China’s support, Yameen was accused of ruling Maldives in an autocratic manner. He had jailed his predecessor Mohamed Nasheed on charges of terrorism. He had also put behind bars many of his political rivals and removed dissenting voices from institutions such as the Supreme Court, besides denying the voters their basic rights. In fact, speculation was also rife that China might build a military base in Maldives.

All these had forced India to contemplate military intervention in Maldives as it seemed the island nation may declare an emergency.

‘Maldives will have to balance it out with China’

Official sources said while India will remain important for Maldives, the island nation cannot look away from China.

China had invested heavily in infrastructure projects in Maldives such as China-Maldives Friendship Bridge and mass housing projects on reclaimed lands, which many say, have put the island nation into a debt trap. Under Yameen’s government, India had lost to China a $511-million project to develop and expand the Male airport.

Last month, during the visit of India’s External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to Maldives, both sides had agreed to maintain peace and security in the Indian Ocean region while enhancing regional maritime security. Maldives had also stated it would “remain sensitive towards India’s security and strategic concerns” while promising to kick-start some of the Indian projects that got stalled under Yameen’s regime.

Last year during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Maldives, India had offered a grant of $1.4 billion to Maldives in the form of budgetary support, currency swap and concessional lines of credit to repay its debt to China that was incurred during Yameen’s era.

“While the outcome of parliamentary elections has come in line with the September’s presidential elections, there are two things that need to be kept in mind. Firstly, India should not overestimate Maldives’ tilt towards New Delhi. They will have to balance it out with China,” said former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia.

Bhatia, who is now a Distinguished Fellow of Mumbai-based foreign policy think tank Gateway House, also said Maldives would continue to remain a priority for India in the Indian Ocean region irrespective of which political party comes to power after the Lok Sabha elections.

In a new twist, The New York Times reported yesterday that the president last ...","US President Donald Trump has said he is seriously considering funneling detained illegal migrants into the self-declared sanctuary cities that oppose his tough immigration policies.

Mr Trump's announcement on Twitter reversed a previous White House assurance that the idea - criticized as political retribution against cities led by opposition Democrats - had been dropped.

""Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities,"" Trump said.

""The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy - so this should make them very happy!"" he tweeted.

The Washington Post revealed the proposal, which would mark a new flash point in the ever growing political divide over immigration.

President Trump has staked his presidency on his insistence that the United States is being overrun by migrants and asylum seekers.

But opponents, mostly in the Democratic Party, say his push for building more walls on the Mexican border and his almost daily denunciations of migrants as dangerous criminals incites racial hatred.

In comments to reporters later, Mr Trump said that he wanted Congress, where the House of Representatives is controlled by Democrats, to tighten visas and streamline the deportation process.

Otherwise, he warned, he'll order migrants to be dumped on the sanctuary cities.

""If they don't agree we might as well do what they say they want.... We'll bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it,"" he said. ""We can give them an unlimited supply.""

Central American migrants heading in caravan to the US

Democrat cites human 'pawns'

Sanctuary cities are places where local authorities - usually Democratic-run - have refused to hand over undocumented immigrants for deportation.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed dismissed President Trump's proposal.

""This is just another in a long line of scare tactics and half-baked ideas that are just about chasing headlines and distracting people from real issues. In SF we are proud to be a sanctuary city and we'll continue to stand up for all of our residents,"" she tweeted.

Citing homeland security officials and leaked emails, the Post said White House officials first broached the plan in November, asking several agencies whether members of a caravan of migrants could be arrested at the border and then bussed ""to small- and mid-sized sanctuary cities"".

The White House told the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) that the plan was intended to alleviate a shortage of detention space, but would also send a message to Democrats, the Post said.

The suggested policy was pushed back within ICE, with a top official saying it was rife with concerns and noting ""there are PR risks as well"".

After the White House pressed the issue again earlier this year, ICE rebuffed it as ""inappropriate.""

The Post said a White House official and a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said the proposal was no longer under consideration.

""This was just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion,"" a White House statement said.

One of the centers targeted was the California constituency of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose office on Thursday blasted the plan.

""The extent of this administration's cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated,"" said Pelosi spokeswoman Ashley Etienne.

""Using human beings - including little children - as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable.""

Detentions at record high

Mr Trump's all-out fight with the Democrats over immigration comes as border agents report being overwhelmed by the number of migrants and people demanding asylum after fleeing violent Central American countries.

The number of immigrant detainees in ICE custody has approached 50,000 in recent months, the Post said, an all-time high that has strained the agency's budget.

Another of Trump's controversial proposals to resolve the situation has been to shut the border with Mexico temporarily. He backed off the idea after outcry over the likely damaging economic effects.

In a new twist, The New York Times reported yesterday that the president last week told Kevin McAleenan, the soon to be named acting secretary of homeland security, that he still wanted the border closed.

According to the Times, President Trump told Mr McAleenan that if he had any legal difficulties as a result of this, he would give him a presidential pardon.

As a result of US pressure, Mexico has stepped up detentions of would-be migrants on its southern border, long before they can get near the United States. Mexican authorities said yesterday that a new group, known as a caravan, of 2,500 people had arrived and 350 people had forced their way across the border.",Trump threatens to 'dump' illegal migrants on Democratic-run 'sanctuary cities',RTE Online,https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2019/0413/1042409-trump-detained-migrants-sanctuary-cities/

That would have a big impact on relations between Edmonton and Ottawa; it also could play a significant role in October's federal election.

Rachel Notley, the incumbent premier and Alberta NDP leader, has had a delicate relationship with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government — an ally on climate change and pension reform but an uneasy partner on pipelines. If relations between the two levels of government have become more difficult over time, they're likely to get even more combative if Kenney's United Conservatives win next week's vote.

Not only has Kenney pledged to get rid of the province's carbon tax and lift the cap on greenhouse gas emissions for the oilsands, he has said he would hold a referendum on equalization if the federal government doesn't make any changes to the equalization formula.

To discuss the potential implications of a Kenney premiership on the state of the federation and the Liberals' re-election strategy in October, Pollcast host Éric Grenier is joined by the CBC's Aaron Wherry and Vassy Kapelos, host of Power & Politics on CBC News Network.

He'd likely rather have ex-Ontario premier Kathleen Wynne still running things in Queen's Park.

But in lieu of allies and like-minded leaders, Jason Kenney and Doug Ford could provide Justin Trudeau with something he has lacked since he dispatched Stephen Harper in 2015: the right kind of adversary.

There's always Andrew Scheer, of course — standing right across from Trudeau most afternoons in the House of Commons, the two of them separated by the length of two swords. In the one way that counts — this fall's federal election — Scheer is still Trudeau's direct and official opponent.

But nearly two years after taking the job, the leader of the Official Opposition remains an amorphous character, with arguably less of a presence in Canadians' political consciousness than his lingering predecessor. Until Scheer has a set of policies to his name, a match-up with Trudeau will be a difficult fight to promote.

When Pierre Trudeau's time in office is remembered, it's not for his confrontations with Robert Stanfield, whom Trudeau faced in three federal elections. Rather, Trudeau's greatest foe was René Lévesque, the separatist premier of Quebec from 1976 to 1985.

The National Film Board commissioned a three-part documentary about the two warring leaders. Lévesque was the one Trudeau battled in the 1980 referendum campaign and during the constitutional negotiations that followed. It was those battles that animated Trudeau's political career and legacy.

Doug Ford's audition

Doug Ford has spent the last nine months auditioning for the role of the prime minister's principal antagonist, with an unending series of complaints about the federal government. The Liberals have responded by embracing every opportunity to state their differences with the Ford government, while enthusiastically linking Scheer with Ford's agenda.

The Ford government is moving now to plaster anti-carbon tax stickers on every gas pump in Ontario — a remarkable use of public funds and authority to advance a partisan argument in an election year. Ford's direct involvement in the fall federal election seems inevitable.

Since coming to office, Trudeau has been offered up by some as a liberal beacon against a tidal wave of populism, so it might seem fitting that he would be defined now by a battle with a populist at home. Trudeau and Ford disagree on nearly everything, from carbon pricing to supervised consumption sites. The Ford government's austerity measures will stand in sharp contrast to the Trudeau government's spending. And Ford's bombast and family legacy are a neat match for Trudeau's celebrity and surname.

But Jason Kenney is the more intriguing foe. For one thing, Kenney can barely hide his contempt for the prime minister. For another, they already have a history.

Trudeau vs. Kenney

It was Kenney, as federal immigration minister in 2011, who moved to ban new citizens from wearing the niqab while swearing the citizenship oath. Four years later, that ban inspired Trudeau to deliver one of the most important speeches of his political career, a treatise on freedom and diversity that would end up framing a pivotal portion of that year's election.

""It is a cruel joke to claim you are liberating people from oppression by dictating in law what they can and cannot wear. Whatever happened to a free society's requirement that we can disagree with a person's choices, but must defend their right to make them?"" Trudeau asked.

""But what's even worse than what they're saying is what they really mean. We all know what is going on here. It is nothing less than an attempt to play on people's fears and foster prejudice, directly toward the Muslim faith. This is not the spirit of Canadian liberty, my friends. It is the spirit of the Komagata Maru. Of the St. Louis. Of 'none is too many.' ""

Kenney fumed over the comparison.

The federal court already had ruled against Kenney's ban, but the government appealed. When the Federal Court of Appeal again ruled against the government in September 2015, the issue was thrust into the election.

Trudeau had staked his position. Stephen Harper doubled down on the Conservative position. Seemingly reluctant to offend their supporters in Quebec,Tom Mulcair and the NDP struggled to express a contrary view. A month later, Trudeau and the Liberals won a decisive majority.

A possible rematch

Now, Kenney is in line to become the next premier of Alberta, a province that claims its own history with Trudeau, or at least with his surname.

Kenney would invite conflict with Trudeau over climate change, the defining issue of the era. He would be eager to blame Trudeau (or British Columbia or anyone else) for the province's lack of a pipeline to the coast — this moment's foremost threat to national unity.

Kenney also is vowing to call a referendum on equalization if he doesn't get a pipeline. As Jason Markusoff wrote recently in Maclean's, Kenney's proposed approach to governing sounds a lot like Quebec's traditional posturing.

There's a dual risk here for Scheer — of being overshadowed by two premiers and of sinking his own chances by tying himself to provincial leaders courting controversy. It's possible that, by October, many voters will be looking for a PM who is more likely to stand up to the premiers of Alberta and Ontario.

The greater threat posed by Kenney and Ford is still to the prime minister's own agenda and world view. But Kenney and Ford can at least do him the favour of clarifying the choice Trudeau wants to present to Canadians this fall.

“Instead of Andrew Scheer getting on with contributing to what should be a non-partisan issue — the climate crisis — he is … doing his best to hamper the PM from doing anything about it himself,” Janet Bartram-Thomas of Richmond Hill writes. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

This could place our prime minister at risk of a long court battle, which could include testifying under oath. All of this instead of focusing on our Truth and Reconciliation agreement, which surely has taken a hit during this debacle. Pipelines aren’t being built; many Canadians don’t agree with the Liberal carbon tax; climate change issues seem to have been placed on the back burner and we’re still dealing with unfair tariffs. On top of all of this, the election is rapidly approaching. Does the prime minister have any advisers or is this another example of Trudeau’s “my way or else?”

Donald Cangiano, Oakville Lawyer Julian Porter may serve a libel suit for the Liberals and lawyer Peter Downard, acting for the Conservatives, reminds Porter that all members of the government, past and present, involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair will be called to testify in court. Obviously, this new litigation makes sure that both worlds will be talking to each other until the election in October.

If someone accuses you of fraud, specifically income-tax evasion, you do not have to provide any evidence in court that you have not committed income-tax evasion. It is up to your accuser to provide evidence of the stated claim, and it is not up to you to open all of your income tax returns and financial books over a lifetime to prove that you are clean. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer made a public statement outside of the House of Commons on March 29 that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was a liar, that his government was corrupt, and that he interfered with a criminal proceeding against SNC-Lavalin.

The PM’s threatened libel lawsuit against Scheer is not some opening for the leader of the opposition to put Trudeau on the stand, or to demand all sorts of documents in the way of discovery. Libel law does not work that way in Canada. If you accuse, then the burden is on you to prove. You don’t get to go on a fishing expedition and seek out evidence that is not already available to you. Trudeau is not making a mistake here. I hope he follows through on his lawsuit. Scheer has publicly accused the PM of a crime, but the thing is, there are no criminal charges, let alone convictions, and MP Jody Wilson-Raybould herself testified on Feb. 27 that nobody broke the law in their interactions with her. How Scheer thinks he can go on defaming Trudeau between now and the fall election without a shred of evidence to back up his claims completely escapes me. Trevor Amon, Victoria, B.C. This is a Trumpian move if I ever saw one. Instead of Scheer getting on with contributing to what should be a non-partisan issue — the climate crisis — he is putting every obstacle in the way and doing his best to hamper the PM from doing anything about it himself. This is equivalent to watching a slow fuse burning that threatens your house and, instead of doing anything about it, there are endless arguments about the hole in the fence, who put it there and who will pay for it. Get on with what is the greatest challenge we have ever faced. I have no doubt that Trudeau would like to get on with it. All Scheer seems keen on doing is spending money trying to sway public opinion away from the very sensible and necessary carbon tax. Some will believe his ads, just as there are those who are persuaded by Trump’s rhetoric. But a great many more will opt for doing their bit for future generations and giving the carbon tax a chance to have its effect on getting people to reduce their carbon footprint. Janet Bartram-Thomas, Richmond Hill Scheer believes the PM would never agree to testify in court under oath on this matter, or agree to produce secret cabinet documents as evidence, and has called his bluff by welcoming a lawsuit. This will have potential negative consequences. If Trudeau doesn’t proceed with the suit, he will look foolish. If he does, regardless of what happens with the suit, it will keep the SNC-Lavalin scandal in the public eye for the foreseeable future — something the PM surely wanted to avoid when he kicked MPs Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott out of the Liberal caucus.

Fans of each would no doubt cry, “Nothing at all!” And they’d have a point. Mr. Ford, the Progressive Conservative Premier of Ontario, and Mr. Trudeau, the Liberal Prime Minister of Canada, are by many measures very different people.

It’s almost like the progressive Mr. Trudeau was created in a laboratory specifically to antagonize Ford voters, while Mr. Trudeau’s supporters must consider the populist Ontario Premier to be punishment for long-forgotten sins.

Story continues below advertisement

But for all that differentiates them, there is one important thing they seem to share – the belief that it’s in their interest to be the centre of attention at all times, even when that attention is not positive.

The old saying about there being no such thing as bad publicity has become a political mantra that transcends party affiliation. Everyone is doing it.

How else do you explain the Ford government’s recent announcements, some of which have been so inert as to compete for a spot on the Periodic Table as a new noble gas?

Take the decision to change the slogan on Ontario license plates from “Yours to Discover” to “A Place to Grow.” The rewrite had opponents apoplectic and fearing the worst; the bland new phrase revealed a complete non-story. Historians may one day regard it as the least significant initiative of any government, ever.

Larger in scope was the Ford government’s unveiling this week of billions in promised spending on new subway lines that were hastily sketched out, developed in a vacuum and which stand a good chance of never becoming reality. His plan drew fire from the usual opponents, and almost seems like it was designed to.

Many people hold their noses at the Ford government’s puffed-up announcements made to grandiose fanfare. But there is a purpose to them: The negative reaction or mockery they generate, either on social media or in the press, prompts Mr. Ford’s voters to stiffen their allegiance to him.

Mr. Ford needs ammunition to encourage his fans to donate, and to fuel their animosity toward his political adversaries and critics in the media, whom he paints as biased and untrustworthy. At the same time, he is secure in the knowledge there is virtually nothing he can do or say that will cost him the support of his polarized base.

U.S. President Donald Trump enunciated the founding principle of this political philosophy during his election campaign in 2016, when be boasted that he ""could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any voters.”

He was right. There is apparently no misleading tweet or outright lie, no evidence of immorality, personal wrongdoing or poor choices, that can shake his supporters’ faith. By being outrageous and often stunningly self-contradictory, Mr. Trump keeps himself squarely in the centre of American politics, where he plays the righteous hero beset on all sides by those who would do his followers wrong.

This strategy may explain Mr. Trudeau’s otherwise incomprehensible threat last week to sue Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer for libel and slander over statements Mr. Scheer made related to the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

When dealing with scandals, the old strategy called for those at the centre to keep their head down and let the danger pass. Mr. Trudeau was instead to be found hand-feeding fresh meat into the maw of the beast.

It’s inexplicable, at least under the old rules of politics. But under the new ones, Mr. Trudeau’s action might make sense. It reinforces the partisan narrative of a leader who has done nothing wrong and yet finds himself beleaguered by enemies making false accusations. And his Liberals are no strangers to riling up opponents to wake up their own base.

Mr. Trudeau can suffer the derision and criticism resulting from his libel threat, because what he referred to as a call for consequences for politicians who “choose to twist the truth and distort reality” will never cost him the votes of diehard supporters whose waking nightmare is a government led by Mr. Scheer.

Aung was the Burnaby North-Seymour delegate to this year’s Daughters of the Vote, an event that brings 338 young women – one for each federal riding – to Ottawa to get a closer look at the inner workings of Canada’s political system. The first event was held in 2017, marking the 100th anniversary of women’s right to vote in federal elections.

article continues below

This year, the second in what’s planned as a biannual event, found the young women at the centre of a national media storm after two protests on April 3: one when a group of delegates turned their back on Trudeau; the other when a group walked out on Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer.

Aung, 23, had the chance to sit in Liberal MP Terry Beech’s seat for the occasion.

For the record: yes, she did turn her back on Trudeau, and no, she didn’t walk out on Scheer.

The delegates’ response to Trudeau was generally interpreted as a protest of his handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair and the decision to kick Vancouver-Granville MP Jody Wilson-Raybould and Markham-Stouffville MP Jane Philpott out of the Liberal caucus.

But Aung said Trudeau’s “mistakes” on the SNC-Lavalin file weren’t her motivator. Rather, it was his handling of questions by the delegates that eventually provoked her to get to her feet and turn her back.

“When people started asking him questions, that’s when I started getting frustrated,” she said. “He wasn’t answering any questions directly, especially about Indigenous communities. … He wasn’t giving anything tangible. It was all words to me, all fluff.”

It was the words of Hannah Martin, an Indigenous delegate from Nova Scotia, that convinced Aung to turn her back on Trudeau. Martin took the prime minister to task for his government’s “oppression” of her people, the Mi’kmaq, and told Trudeau that he couldn’t call himself a feminist if he allows corporations to rape the land.

“That’s when I stood up,” Aung said. “If you only care about a certain type of woman and don’t acknowledge the existence of another type of woman, you cannot be a feminist.”

And, no, Trudeau didn’t call on Aung to ask a question; if he had, she was ready to ask about the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project and how he could justify the potential risk to the safety of Burnaby Mountain (where, she points out, thousands of young women are studying at Simon Fraser University – so if Trudeau is truly interested in the fate of young Canadian women, shouldn’t he be concerned about their safety?).

As far as Scheer was concerned, Aung had a simple reason for not walking out.

“I do not know his politics enough to protest him,” she said.

She pointed out that Scheer at least acknowledged the fact that protesters were walking out on him, but Trudeau did not – and she’s been disappointed in Trudeau’s lack of commentary about the event since.

“We wonder, didn’t our message get through to you?” Aung said. “I do not dislike him as a person; I was just disappointed.”

Burnaby North-Seymour MP Terry Beech with Bella Aung in the House of Commons. - contributed

What also bothered Aung was the fact that, after the delegates’ session in the House of Commons, some MPs approached the young women and “scolded” them for disrespecting Trudeau and Scheer.

“It makes me very concerned about my initial impression of Canada,” Aung said, noting she always believed Canada was a place where it was safe to engage in peaceful protest, so being taken to task for doing so didn’t sit well with her.

The Myanmar-born Aung was raised in the U.S. and moved to Canada in 2017 to pursue her master’s degree in political science at Simon Fraser University.

Aung notes her life has been shaped by both her own existence as a visible minority and her family background as Indigenous people in Myanmar (her grandparents were part of the Mon and Karen people). The Indigenous experience in Myanmar – where the Indigenous population has been “double colonized” by the Burmese and the British, and where Indigenous languages have been disappearing in part because people were forced to attend Burmese-language schools – has strong parallels to that in Canada.

“Before I came to Canada, I did not know about Indigenous people at all,” she said. She was shocked to discover the reality of some of the living conditions on reservation land in Canada are “about the same living standards as the villages in Myanmar. It’s very disheartening.”

Aung said she felt privileged to be welcomed into Indigenous spaces during the Daughters of the Vote event – which, along with the House of Commons session, included a chance to attend Question Period and visit the Senate, plus take part in two days of workshops.

She noted that many of the Indigenous delegates and women of colour who were part of the event had a particularly difficult time during the week when social media turned ugly. In one instance, a Facebook page called Say No to Jagmeet Singh took aim at a group of Muslim delegates, using photos of the young women in their headscarves to illustrate that they’re not “real” Canadians.

“This experience was traumatizing, especially for the very marginalized populations,” Aung said, adding she hopes that in future years there can be better debriefing for delegates after some of the highly political sessions. “Being in a very political space can have different impacts on different types of women. I know my Indigenous sisters and my black sisters, they were more traumatized.”

Aung was also disappointed in those MPs who didn’t make themselves available to the Daughters of the Vote delegates from their own riding.

Her own experience with Beech, she said, was highly positive. He took the time to meet with her, to be there to show her around and to introduce her to other elected officials – including Minister of Science Kirsty Duncan, whose passion for women in STEM and women in politics resonated with Aung.

Beech also acknowledged Aung in a statement in the House of Commons.

“Terry is a very nice person,” Aung said. “His policies, in general, are not bad. I am a lot more radically left-wing than he is.”

Since returning from Ottawa, Aung has also had a chance to meet with former New Democrat MP Svend Robinson, who’s hoping to claim Burnaby North-Seymour for the NDP come this fall’s federal election.

“A lot of his policies I agree on,” Aung said, noting she questioned him on some of her key issues - including mental health, the pipeline and support for the LGBTQ community. “I was satisfied with his answers.”

Aung has been invited to help on Robinson’s campaign when it picks up steam later in the spring. She’s already offered the veteran politician – who’s returning to politics after a 15-year absence – some advice about becoming more social-media-savvy (who, she wonders, can run for office without an Instagram account?) and reaching out more actively to younger voters. She’d like to see Robinson at SFU working with the NDP club there in an attempt to get out the student vote.

“This riding is very vanilla, very neutral,” she said, but the presence of the university could help to disrupt the status quo – if someone can get the young voters to the polls. “There’s a lot of young voters in this riding, too, who are not politically involved. There’s not much mobilization in this riding.”

Though Aung says federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is her favourite of the federal leaders, she says Canada’s electoral system won’t allow him to become prime minister.

“I think Canada is not ready for a brown man with a turban, and an NDP leader,” she said, noting the country is likely to simply keep swinging back and forth between Liberal and Conservative governments. “Jagmeet is the leader we want, but we cannot just vote him in. … Canada needs a different type of electoral system, so we do not have to vote strategically for the lesser of two evils.”

For the coming federal election, Aung has a message for fellow young voters.

“I would just like to tell the young people of this riding to be more involved … and make sure they voice what they want from their representative,” she said. “If we don’t step out of our comfort zone and tell them what’s going on, they won’t know. … Your voice matters, and if you can mobilize, even better.”

And she has some hope for the election outcome in Burnaby North-Seymour, where she respects both Beech and Robinson.

“Both Svend and Terry actually took the time to talk to me. They were both very gracious, so I felt very lucky,” she said, adding she feels that will carry over to their work as MP, should one or the other be elected. “At least they will listen. I can not promise they would do everything we want them to do, but at least they will listen.”

WHAT IS DAUGHTERS OF THE VOTE?

It’s organized by Equal Voice, a bilingual, multi-partisan organization that, since 2001, has been advocating for the equal representation of women in Parliament, in provincial and territorial legislatures and on municipal and band councils.

Its goal is to have emerging young women leaders become familiar with Canada’s political institutions “so that they are equipped and inspired to participate in the formal political sphere.”

The 2019 event was designed to help Equal Voice continue its efforts to bring more diverse young women into formal political spaces. It included a chance for the delegates to sit in the House of Commons and participate in a public session, as well as hearing from federal leaders. It also offered skills training and workshops, including an Indigenous forum.

“The journey of women's full political participation, in all of their diversity, is far from complete. Daughters of the Vote is an important step in closing the gap,” says the website.

Burnaby had three representatives for the 2019 event: Bella Aung for Burnaby North-Seymour; Georgina Johnston for Burnaby South; and Dolma Tsundu for New Westminster-Burnaby.

Though the day highlighted the realization of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s promise to legalize cannabis during his 2015 campaign, neither he nor anyone else from the ruling Liberal party was out taking credit for it - a sign that the social stigma around marijuana is still strong.

“Canadians are accepting of legalization, but I don’t think they’re celebratory,” said Peter Donolo, a political strategist at Hill + Knowlton and communications director for former Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chretien.

Aside from difficulty keeping up with demand, legalization has gone smoothly. Online pot sales to adults began nationally on Oct. 17, but storefronts only opened in the province of Ontario, which includes the capital, on April 1.

Six months before a national election, polls show Liberals deadlocked or trailing the rival Conservative Party, and Trudeau is being cautious about weed.

Though Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has said he would not reverse legalization if elected, he has repeatedly expressed worries about safety - especially around people driving while high - and has said more young people might try marijuana now.

There are also some communities like the Vancouver suburb of Richmond, where 55 percent of the population list their ethnic origin as Chinese, which have prohibited cannabis storefronts.

“Legalization has gone well,” a government official said, but the issue is not a “primary focus”.

It is now safer to be a consumer because of regulation, the official said, adding that black market sales are falling and legal jobs and revenue are being created.

Interviews with customers and retailers at the Ottawa stores revealed that even if Trudeau is not talking about it, legalization has generated good will.

“I live close by and I’m excited to see how this store will change the neighborhood,” said Jessica, 23, who declined to give her last name. “I did not vote Liberal last time, but I might this time.”

Jessica was huddled close to an outdoor heater in front of the Fire & Flower store, which is just a 10-minute walk from both the prime minister’s office and parliament.

Vivian Azer, a financial analysts who follows cannabis companies for Cowen and Company in New York, sees a bright future for Canada’s nascent marijuana industry.

Did he fail to properly ...","Among the various ways Justin Trudeau is being slammed for his handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair, the charge that the Prime Minister has revealed himself during this controversy to be no real feminist is the hardest to pin down.

Did he fail to properly respect the independence of the attorney general, back last fall when Jody Wilson-Raybould had the job? On this core question, there are meetings and phone calls and text messages to argue about, rules and codes to interpret, in trying to arrive at an answer.

Did he botch efforts to contain the controversy after it exploded, and ultimately go too far in kicking Wilson-Raybould and her chief ally, Jane Philpott, out of the Liberal caucus? On these issues, political strategists, Parliament Hill veterans, and even pundits, have thoughts about crisis management to kick around.

Did he somehow let down the feminist side, though? This question naturally arises because the two former cabinet ministers testing Trudeau’s mettle both happen to be women. And, to quite a few commentators, that fact alone is telling enough. But it is hardly sufficient.

There’s no solid reason I’ve heard to presume that two male cabinet ministers would have fared differently had they dissented from Trudeau’s handling of a file that brings into play hard questions about the administration of justice, worrying possible economic outcomes, and, yes, potential ramifications in the coming fall election.

What’s needed to give the critiques of Trudeau’s feminist credentials heft are facts that don’t require guesses about the dynamics between men and women in Trudeau’s famously gender-balanced cabinet, or speculations about the PM’s own putative biases.

In other words, does any data show that he’s running the government in a way that’s better or worse for women than what came before him? In fact, there are at least some numbers, and they tend to bolster his feminist credentials.

Maclean’s asked the Privy Council Office (PCO), the branch of the bureaucracy that supports the Prime Minister’s Office, for recent figures on what are called Governor in Council appointees. These are the fortunate individuals who get paid to work on federal commissions, boards, Crown corporations, agencies and tribunals.

As of the end of 2018, 49 per cent of these appointments had gone to women, according to the PCO data, up markedly from 35 per cent in 2015, the year the Trudeau Liberals beat Stephen Harper’s Conservatives in an election. That 14-point rise in the share of these plum federal jobs going to women compares to just a four-point increase, from 31 per cent to 35 per cent, in the previous three-year period.

Those numbers represent—to home in on just one significant segment of them—a shift from women filing only about a third of the seats on Crown corporation boards when the Liberals took power to very nearly half now—up from 34 per cent at the end of 2015 to 48 per cent at the close of 2018. That’s up 14 points in three years of Trudeau rule, compared to six points over the previous three-year span.

Looking more broadly at women in the executive ranks of the federal public service—known to bureaucrats by their “EX 01” through “EX 05” designations—there’s been less dramatic change, but still an uptick. The number of women at that level stood at 2,567 last spring, up from 2,264 in the spring of 2015. That meant women accounted for 49 per cent of the government’s executive ranks, up from 46 per cent over that three-year period.

Arguably even more important, or at least more prestigious inside the government, is the cadre of deputy ministers—the top mandarins in federal departments. Overall the number of women filling these powerful posts climbed to 39 last year from 30 three years earlier. That translates into 46 per cent women at the deputy minister level last spring, compared to 41 per cent three years earlier.

Even taken together, of course, these numbers don’t mean Trudeau’s Liberals have excised sexism from the federal government. Still, weighed against mere impressions of what the SNC-Lavalin affair might signify about his feminist bona fides, knowing how many more women are working in key federal jobs these days has to count for something.

For the last three ...","Long before the eruptions of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, long before Justin Trudeau misplaced his halo, the re-election of the federal Liberals was no sure thing.

For the last three years or so, the provinces – and the rest of the world – have been going conservative. This electoral trend may – or may not – spell trouble for the Liberals in October.

Since the party was elected in 2015, after almost 10 years of Stephen Harper’s Conservatives, five provinces have defeated governments run by Liberals or New Democrats.

In Manitoba, the Conservatives defeated the NDP in 2016. The same year, the right-of-centre Saskatchewan Party was re-elected, for the third time since 2007. In British Columbia, the NDP (with the Greens) unseated the Liberals in 2017, the exception to the conservative tide. Last year, Conservatives ousted Liberals in New Brunswick and Ontario, and the Coalition Avenir Québec ousted the Liberals in Quebec.

Since the federal Liberals came to office, just one Liberal government – in Nova Scotia in 2017 – was re-elected. (The Liberals also came to power in Newfoundland in November 2015, albeit scarcely a month after Trudeau’s Liberals).

On Tuesday, Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party is expected to bury Rachel Notley’s New Democrats in Alberta.

If that happens, six provinces will be run by right-wing governments: Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.

This isn’t to say that these governments are hard right; Canada dislikes philosophical extremes. Also, because a government is Conservative does not necessarily mean it is conservative; the Progressive Conservatives who long ran Ontario (1943-1985) and Alberta (1971-2015) were moderates. But Conservative governments today oppose high taxes and deficits. They are not usually fond of unions or regulation.

This isn’t to say that these governments are hard right; Canada dislikes philosophical extremes.

A measure of contemporary conservatism is the carbon tax, which provinces are challenging in court on April 15. Alberta will probably join the legal challenge if Kenney is elected.

The federal government has introduced this tax, a price on pollution, and so have Quebec and B.C. Meanwhile Ontario, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Manitoba want to reverse it. If these provinces win in court, it will be a blow to the federal Liberals, for whom carbon pricing is central to fighting climate change. Their plan includes phasing out coal and embracing renewable energy.

Electing governments of different stripes in the provinces and nationally is a historical pattern in Canadian politics. It is a peculiarly reliable system of checks and balances.

Over the near decade that the Conservatives were in Ottawa (2006-2015), the Liberals were elected or re-elected in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia; New Democrats were in power in Manitoba and New Brunswick (one term). There were Conservative governments in Alberta and Newfoundland.

Now the Liberals are in power federally, and conservative parties, big or small “c,” are winning in the provinces. This may be the natural order of things – or, it may be the coming of a different, more aggressive conservatism, reflecting the contagion that has infected Donald Trump’s Republicans, whom Ronald Reagan would barely recognize.

Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives are more conservative than Harper’s Conservatives. Astonishingly, Scheer supports Brexit, for example, which aligns him with the right-wing nationalists and nativists in Britain. He is also said to be a social conservative. In Alberta, where Jason Kenney is also socially conservative, many of his party’s candidates are, too.

Meanwhile, the democratic world is trending Conservative.

In the Britain, France, Italy and Germany, the right is rising. In Turkey, Hungary and Poland, regimes are authoritarian.

The arrival of Conservative governments in Canada does not mean that Canada is following the rest of the world; no Canadian political party, for example, wants to close our borders to immigration, a litmus test of conservatism.

But if the federal Conservatives are elected this fall, it will come as no surprise. We will only be following the provinces, and much of the world. It’s the zeitgeist.

And then, a couple years later, there was Trudeau again, draping himself in gawky Indian garb on a trip to a country where Indians these days are much more comfortable in khakis and a golf shirt. That was supposed to reflect Canada’s embrace of multicultural values, at least I think it was, but it really just ended up looking dorky, and not so nice.

The theatrics didn’t even come close to the reflecting the reality of Trudeau’s leadership. Canada’s actual response to the refugee crisis in 2015 was woefully inadequate. Even today, despite all the rhetoric of openness and empathy for the world’s vulnerable, Canada still only accepted a miserly 14,790 refugee referrals in 2018. Our immigration and refugee system, as I’ve written before, is not based on values or empathy; it is based on economics.

The India fiasco was of a different species. The sartorial faux-pas could be forgiven but it was hard to overlook the presence of Jaspal Atwal, the one-time Sikh separatist convicted in India of trying to assassinate the Indian prime minister, on the list of VIPs traveling with Trudeau.

Whether flipping pancakes in a meme-ready cowboy outfit or photo-bombing newlyweds, Trudeau’s social media brand is the envy of progressive leaders around the world. The careful nurturing of his public persona—the champion of liberal values, a feminist with a high emotional IQ and other such hazy accolades—fits neatly into the political niche left vacant after Barack Obama exited the White House.

Trudeau is now everything liberals around the world hoped Obama would be, the foil to rising right wing authoritarianism, a handsome and youthful leader who speaks for the up-and-coming generations longing for a break from the old ways of politics. It’s almost become cliché outside of Canada: mention being Canadian and people inevitably say, “Oh aren’t you lucky to have Trudeau!”

We are lucky, but not because of Trudeau. We’re fortunate we have a political system that is still relatively stable and inclusive, though it may be fraying at the edges. Where our luck could run out is when ideological certainty muscles its way into complex issues, when leaders, Trudeau included, decide they have all the answers and if only the levers of democracy would align to their vision, the world would be such a better place.

Is Trudeau falling prey to his own image? His handling of the SNC Lavalin affair would suggest so. What stuck out most to me in recent revelations was the insistence with which Trudeau appeared to be pursuing his agenda. Over the course of the now-infamous 17-minute telephone conversation between Jody Wilson-Raybould and Michael Wernick, Wernick said no less than four times that the Prime Minster was “firm” about his position on the SNC-Lavalin file. “He is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another,” he warned.

Then there was the god-awful quip Trudeau attempted after a protester at a Liberal donor event was being removed. “Thank you very much for your donation tonight,” he bellowed, to the laughter and applause of the wealthy elites holding court with the PM.

His subsequent apology did little to fix the damage. And why would it? Apologies are easy. It’s much harder to re-build a broken public image, especially when it was constructed from flimsy material to begin with.

The sad fact is that the collapse of Trudeau’s brand is infecting the Liberal party. It doesn’t deserve it. I have been impressed, for instance, with Chrystia Freeland’s poise on the international stage. The Liberal government has shown more deep thinking when it comes to handling the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. It has used Canada’s resources much more effectively in places like the Mediterranean Sea and Ukraine. And its principled stand against Saudi Arabia’s excesses has been laudable.

But when the leader of a nation embraces his public façade as fact, we’re in real trouble. It is the first step toward authoritarianism.

All authoritarians believe what they do is for the good of their nation. Here in Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan rails against his critics for endangering the path of glory upon which he claims to have set his nation. Stop your moaning about due process, constitutional norms and all that cumbersome legal jibber-jabber, he intimates, I know what I’m doing.

Erdogan, of course, likes to jail his detractors, and Turkey’s laws are such that he can do so with relative abandon. Trudeau is more encumbered by law but the underlying motivation—the near-prophetic faith in his progressive mission—feels unsettlingly familiar.

Before Erdogan, secular, progressive Turks also had their white knights, the Kemalist elites who threw all sense of equanimity to the wind in pursuit of their version of progress. There was nothing inherently wrong with that vision—who wouldn’t want a pluralistic, democratic, secular Turkey based on the rule of law—but the way they went about it undermined the project itself. Kemalist disregard for pluralism, its rabid hatred of religious conservatives and Kurdish identity, only served to galvanize conservative and Kurdish discontent. Now, under Erdogan, the conservatives are taking their revenge and the Kurdish issue has metastasized into an insurgency with no sign of ending.

Of course, Canada is nowhere near the political dysfunction we’ve seen in Turkey, or the U.S., or parts of Europe. But the irony, or perhaps inevitability, is that Trudeau’s failure is precisely what could hand over power to Canada’s own right wing ideologues. This is what happens when leaders embrace their own vision of the world and believe they are the ones to impose it. There is often an equal and opposite reaction. And in Canada that could mean the end of our place atop the world’s progressive nations.

But instead of closing the door on the political controversy that's dogged his government for months, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has thrown it back open.

For months now, the ordinarily prime-time-ready prime minister has struggled to stay ahead of allegations that his team inappropriately pressured the woman who was then Canada's first indigenous attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to defer the prosecution of an engineering firm from Trudeau's home province of Quebec.

article continues below

The story seemed to culminate last week with the ouster of Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, another high-profile, female ally from Trudeau's Liberal Party, in what the National Post, called the ""Tuesday night massacre.""

Trudeau, in announcing the move, tried to cast it as a simple matter of party discipline: they were disloyal, they've been expelled, it's time to move on. Or not.

On Sunday, Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer held a news conference to announce that he had received a letter from Trudeau's lawyer threatening to sue him for comments he made about the controversy. In the letter, dated March 31, attorney Julian Porter said criticisms in a Scheer news release two days earlier had gone ""beyond the pale of fair debate and is libellous"" and warned of possible action under Ontario's Libel and Slander Act.

The news conference gave Scheer a jump-start on the news cycle and a chance to grandstand on the issue of the day. He told the cameras that he stood by every criticism Porter mentioned. He said he would welcome the chance to hear Trudeau's sworn testimony in court - an ""I double dare you to sue me"" response that evoked some sort of comical, Canadian political duel.

Trudeau is accused of pressuring Wilson-Raybould as attorney general to defer the prosecution of the Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin and then demoting her to a lesser cabinet role when she resisted.

Canadian authorities charged SNC-Lavalin with paying bribes to secure business in Moammar Gaddafi's Libya. If convicted, it could be barred from contracts with the Canadian government for 10 years. Under deferred prosecution, it could avoid a conviction by admitting wrongdoing, paying fines and committing to stricter compliance rules.

Wilson-Raybould told a parliamentary committee in February that Trudeau, top aides and government officials pressured her inappropriately to offer the company a deal. Last month, she released an audio recording of a telephone call with a senior Canadian official, angering Trudeau and his allies.

Those following the story from outside Canada might wonder whether this is normal - whether Canadian prime ministers tend to sue their political critics. It's not unprecedented: Trudeau's predecessor, Stephen Harper, once launched a multimillion-dollar libel suit against the Liberal Party after it published material alleging two Conservatives tried to bribe an independent member of Parliament. He eventually dropped the claim. Prime Minister Jean Chrtien once threatened to sue an opponent over allegations of bribery but never followed up.

Trudeau is certainly entitled to sue. But whatever the legal merits of his case, it's hard to imagine how taking legal action against the leader of the opposition would help Trudeau move past SNC-Lavalin or put the focus back on his platform heading into on election in October.

In Ottawa, there's speculation that the departure of Trudeau's closest adviser, Gerald Butts, in the early days of the scandal has left the prime minister's office short of sound, strategic advice.

Analysts have questioned, for instance, why a leader known for offering tearful apologies chose not to apologize for his treatment of Wilson-Raybould - a simple move that might have ended the issue right there.

Canadian pundits have for the most part been unsparing in their assessment of team Trudeau's performance.

In an opinion piece published Sunday, Campbell Clark, chief political correspondent for the Globe and Mail, wondered why Trudeau's team lobbed a ""slow pitch"" for his political opponent to smash out of the park.

""The Liberal strategy to put the SNC-Lavalin affair behind them is going exactly according to plan,"" he wrote. ""Unfortunately for the Liberals, it is Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's plan.""

The response from the prime minister's office has been to call out Scheer for focusing on SNC-Lavalin rather than on election issues, Clark wrote. The reality, he said, is that it's Trudeau's Liberals who ""keep bringing it up.""

The Conservative leader revealed Sunday that he received a letter on March 31 from Trudeau’s lawyer, Julian Porter, threatening a libel suit.

“If Mr. Trudeau believes he has a case against me, I urge him to follow through on his threat immediately,” Scheer said in a statement.

In March 2008, though, it was then-prime minister Stephen Harper of the Conservatives who sued the Liberal Party for $3.5 million.

Harper sued the Liberals for libel over allegations that Conservative party officials offered dying independent MP Chuck Cadman a $1-million life-insurance policy in exchange for his key vote on a confidence matter that could have defeated the Liberal government in 2005. Harper was leader of the opposition at the time and Cadman sat as an independent MP.

The Liberals alleged that Harper knew of this offer and Cadman’s vote against the budget of the Paul Martin government in 2005 would lead to a no-confidence vote that would have brought down the minority Liberals. Cadman would not be running for re-election. In fact he flew to Ottawa to vote in May 2005 shortly after undergoing chemotherapy treatment for melanoma. He ended up voting with the Liberal government, supporting their budget and allowing the party to survive the no-confidence vote tabled after the budget. Cadman died in July of that year.

Harper’s initial claim was for $2.5 million, but later increased it by $1 million for “misappropriation of personality.” He proceeded to sue the Liberal party itself, but initially filed notice of libel against Liberal Leader Stephane Dion, deputy leader Michael Ignatieff and Liberal Party house leader Ralph Goodale over allegations that he knew about the bribe. The criminal code forbids bribing a member of Parliament.

“I have every right, as does my family, to defend our reputation, and the Liberal party will, as I said, come to regret engaging in this illegal and untruthful behaviour,” Harper said at the time.

The Liberals said the lawsuit was a tactic to keep opposition MPs from looking into “alleged improprieties” of the government. It was the first time a sitting prime minister sued the opposition.

In February 2009, after Michael Ignatieff took leadership of the Liberals, the two sides said they had “settled all issues” and agreed the case will be dismissed without costs.

Scheer called Trudeau’s threatened lawsuit “an intimidation tactic” aimed at silencing the Conservatives, who have been demanding a thorough, independent investigation of the affair.

OTTAWA -- The federal Liberals are attacking the Ontario Progressive Conservative government's first budget since Doug Ford was elected premier, hoping voters across the country will connect the document's cuts to social spending and the yet-to-be-announced policy leanings of Andrew Scheer's Conservatives.

The provincial budget proposes cuts in post-secondary education and social services, scaling back the growth in spending projected by Ontario's former Liberal government.

Federal Employment Minister Patty Hajdu, an MP from Thunder Bay in northern Ontario, called the budget ""reckless"" in how it takes a knife to programs that affect everything from social security and job creation to northern development and the province's ability to fight forest fires.

At almost every turn at a news conference Friday, Hajdu told reporters in Ottawa that voters across the country can expect the same kind of ""cruel"" fiscal slashing from the federal Conservatives under Scheer's leadership, should they choose him to govern the nation in the October election.

""From my perspective, Doug Ford and his cronies are trying to pull a fast one on Ontarians,"" Hajdu said. ""It's quite clear that Andrew Scheer would take exactly the same tactic.""

Much as the federal Liberals did in 2015, the Ford government is pledging to balance Ontario's books several years down the road.

Justin Trudeau didn't deliver on his campaign pledge of ""modest"" deficit spending with a plan to balance the federal budget by 2019. Every year, his government has produced bigger deficits than it promised, and this year's is nearly $20 billion.

Balancing the provincial budget was a key election promise for the Ontario Tories. Finance Minister Vic Fedeli said Thursday he expected the province would eliminate its budget deficit by the 2023-24 fiscal year, two years beyond the end of their term.

""We have developed a reasonable path to balance,"" Fedeli said. ""Our path to balance in five years is a thoughtful and a measured approach to take.""

Federal Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre, who for months has been hounding the Trudeau Liberals to say when the federal books will be balanced, said Friday he understands the Ontario PC government was handed a tenuous fiscal situation by the province's former Liberal government.

With that in mind, the Ford government has taken a responsible approach with a plan to bring deficit spending to an eventual end, Poilievre said.

""They inherited a disastrous financial situation and they've tried to balance fiscal responsibility against the continuing needs of the people while constrained by enormous record debt,"" he said. ""I think they got the balance right.""

Under the Ontario budget, program expenses in the province are to rise over three years by an average of 0.8 per cent, compared to the 3.3 per cent in growth that the former Liberal government had projected.

The document talks about fighting climate change ""without a carbon tax,"" but provides no new money for climate programs. It does, however, earmark cash for clean-technology investments that could create jobs in industries producing solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicle charging stations.

""Canadians want us to take action on things like climate,"" Hajdu said, denouncing the Ford government's criticism of the federal carbon tax. ""They know that their children's health and safety depends on governments that are going to take responsible action.""

Hajdu wasn't focused only on the Ford government Friday. She lumped Jason Kenney's Alberta Conservatives together with the Ford government in warning Canadians that they can expect ""cuts, cuts, cuts"" to spending under a Scheer government similar to those announced in Ontario and proposed in Alberta where Kenney is fighting to unseat his province's NDP government.

By Tuesday night, he’ll know if his greatest gambit has paid off. When he returned to Alberta to take over the crumbling Progressive Conservative party and unite it with the chaotic Wildrose party to form the United Conservatives, this was the long game — to ascend to the premier’s office and restore Alberta to conservative rule.

At his Calgary haunt, the Blackfoot Diner — a dependably kitschy place where the waitresses call you “hun” and a model train track winds around the ceiling — Kenney spoke to the National Post’s Tyler Dawson just days before the biggest vote of his life.

Q: You’ve told a story about your father’s death informs your perspective on health care. Can you explain?

A: I don’t just look at health care from a cold, policy, analytical perspective. It’s a very personal perspective. And I understand why people are so sensitive about the quality of the health care system, because it is life and death, it does affect the most intimate, important challenges — personal health challenges.

My dad was taken to the emergency ward because he had an infection. He was getting disoriented. And he registered, they put him in a waiting chair in a hospital waiting room. So basically he sat there for over 12 hours without care or treatment. I was in Vancouver doing federal government work. One of my brothers, thankfully, was in town, went and raised heck at the hospital and finally got a doctor to see him. But basically, it was like, hallway health care, in a bed, and you know, they didn’t even really get test results back by the time he passed away.

I thought, “You know, if we were Americans, we probably would’ve been suing the hospital,” but we’re Canadians, so we just shrugged our shoulders and accepted it. I don’t think we should accept that — I hear stories like that from far, far too many people.

The reason I told this story is because I want people to know that I look at this through the lens of that experience. And, quite honestly, this is on of the reasons I decided to run for office at the provincial level.

I’ve said before that I’m not going to be intimidated by defenders of a status quo that too often creates those kinds of tragedies, which has people waiting for two years plus sometimes for surgery. So I’m not going to get shouted down by the usual special interests, playing their medicare campaign.

We need to move beyond the rigid dogma that has dominated the health debate in Canada.

Q: Why have you campaigned pretty openly about promising to fight against Justin Trudeau in the October election?

A: There is tremendous anxiety in this province. People feel like they’ve done everything they’re supposed to do, played by the rules, paid big taxes, contribute to the rest of the federation, and we’re just getting hemmed in, blocked in, pinned down everywhere we turn.

So that frustration could go in two different directions. It can either go in the direction of a total alienation cum separation or it can go in the direction of re-negotiating our place in the federation.

I want to take the latter half, I want to provide a positive federalist alternative to the voices of division and anger that exist in this province.

We are one charismatic, populist leader away from a very serious problem in this province, not just an economic crisis but a constitutional one.

I believe the re-election of Justin Trudeau would have a devastating impact on the future of this province’s economy.

Q: Why do you want to cut the corporate tax cut from 12 per cent to eight per cent?

A: I came to the conclusion that we needed to do something dramatic to bring investor confidence back to Alberta and just resetting wasn’t going to be good enough. I wanted a rate that was so significantly different that it would compel CEOs of businesses across Canada to really consider re-locating all or part of their operations to Alberta.

We’ve lost the advantage and we need to get it back.

Q: Shell recently pulled out of some trade associations, over pressure from shareholders and investors that it was taking an insufficiently strong line on the environment. Where does that leave you, given the plan to cut the carbon tax? Is there a disconnect?

A: You have these millionaire CEOs telling seniors on fixed incomes they’ve got to spend more to heat their homes in the winter or working families with kids that they’ve got to pay more to fill up their gas tanks.

183,Politics,2019-04-13T02:27:00.0000000Z,Justin Trudeau's government already has a pre-election war on its hands with Ontario and a number of other provinces over its recently imposed carbon tax. Next week's Alberta election could raise the climate change policy stakes to a new high just in time ...,"Ottawa has been working to meet the court-imposed conditions to restart the project for the better part of a year.

It is an open secret that Trudeau has long planned to press relaunch as soon as that process was completed — ideally in time for this summer's construction season.

His government now owns the pipeline and has, if only by default, become the prime mover behind its expansion.

The federal cabinet is expected to review the file next month. The assumption has been that it would at that time give the project the green light to resume. As of next Tuesday night, that widespread assumption could be no longer valid.

If, as the polls predict, Kenney does become the next Alberta premier, he will kill the carbon tax introduced by Notley's New Democrats, remove the ceiling cap on the carbon emissions of the oilsands and halt the phase-out of Alberta coal-fired electricity.

In so doing, a UCP government would effectively be removing the very rationale upon which the prime minister based his decision to give the Trans Mountain expansion the go-ahead in the first place.

That approval was contingent on Alberta's climate change commitments. Absent those, Trudeau would have cause to reconsider.

To give the project the green light against the backdrop of the complete withdrawal of Alberta from the federal climate change framework would cost Trudeau's signature policy its last shreds of credibility.

But to put it on hold would shatter the federal contention that the expansion is in the national interest.

For the prime minister, it could come down to an unpalatable choice as to which of his words on the pipeline-versus-climate change issue he walks back.

No one really expects Kenney to meet the federal government part of the way on the issue. If he is elected to lead the next Alberta government, he is likely to wait Trudeau out until the October election, in the hope of accelerating a return of the pipeline-friendly federal Conservatives to power.

That being said, that strategy could yet backfire on both Conservative leaders.

Kenney is looking for a prime minister liable to force the hands of B.C. and Quebec on pipelines. More than a few voters in those two provinces are bound to find that prospect unpalatable.

For better or for worse, the next episode in the Trans Mountain saga is poised to become a defining moment for the prime minister but possibly also for his main opposition rival.

In remarks Trudeau prepared to ...,"© Chris Young Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meets with parents of students who attend Toronto's John Wanless Junior Public School, on April 12, 2019.

OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is portraying Ontario Premier Doug Ford and federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer as irresponsibly fuelling anger and division in the country in order to score political gains.



In remarks Trudeau prepared to deliver to the Ontario wing of the federal Liberal party in Mississauga Friday night, Trudeau made only passing reference to the divisions within his own party over the SNC-Lavalin file, which has cost him two cabinet ministers and caucus members, and the departures of his top policy adviser and top civil servant.

Instead, he took direct aim at Ford and Scheer lumping them together repeatedly, likening them to Stephen Harper, in a speech aimed at firing up his troops for the campaign ahead.

Trudeau’s speech, a draft copy of which was released in advance, began with a focus on the economy and on climate change as a “massive economic threat to middle-class Canadians” before moving to condemn the two Conservative leaders as divisive figures.

“Conservative politicians like Doug Ford and Andrew Scheer don’t seem to believe in investing for the future. They only think as far as the next election, not the next generation,” Trudeau said.

The prime minister highlighted an alarming report from federal government scientists that warned human-caused climate change is causing Canada to warm faster than the world average.

Trudeau claimed that “scientists, business owners, and economists agree — pricing pollution is the best way to reduce emissions and fight climate change” while he portrayed Ford and Scheer as acting irresponsibly in the face of the global climate change threat.

Ford “fired Ontario’s chief scientist — just like Stephen Harper muzzled climate scientists,” said Trudeau. He criticized Ford for scrapping the mandatory vehicle emissions test, getting rid of the province’s cap-and-trade program, and for challenging the federal carbon levy-and-rebate program in court.

Trudeau took aim at Ford’s first budget, saying it was “loaded with cuts” for farmers, Franco-Ontarians, seniors, post-secondary students, Indigenous peoples, children, “and those who rely on community social services.”

He said Scheer “takes his cues from the Ontario premier, so Canadians can expect much of the same if he ever gets elected,” claiming the Conservative leader would cut the Canada Child Benefit which the Liberals introduced, and make other cuts to housing, old-age security and the Canada pension plan.

Trudeau said Scheer’s pledge to eliminate the federal carbon tax shows “he wants to take us back to Stephen Harper’s decade of inaction.”

The prime minister reserved his most critical comments for what he said was Ford and Scheer’s decision to take “the easy road, to divide people and spread heat rather than find real solutions.”

“Andrew Scheer conveniently failed to call out alt-right conspiracy theories. Andrew Scheer fought against a non-binding motion to denounce Islamophobia. And Andrew Scheer has proudly spoken at the same rallies as white nationalists,” said Trudeau.

“Is that leadership? Is that someone who will govern for all Canadians? I don’t think so,” Trudeau said.

Trudeau said it is “our responsibility to condemn this kind of speech but also to try to understand why their message resonates.”

He said Liberals in 2015 saw how hope is a powerful political motivator, but must understand that “anger is powerful, too.”

“And that anger is what Conservative parties around the world are tapping into…they’ve been somewhat successful in turning anger into political support.”

However, in move similar to his 2015 election campaign rhetoric, Trudeau also cautioned Liberal troops against confusing the “Conservative party with conservative voters. The party exploits peoples’ fears. The voters just want to be heard.”

Scheer, along with several of his Conservative MPs, including Michelle Rempel, have frequently criticized Trudeau for unfairly labelling his critics.

Trudeau told supporters Friday it would be a “terrible mistake to assume that people who vote Conservative hate the environment, or are racist, or misogynist. That type of generalization is both harmful and wrong,” saying people who vote Conservative “are our friends and neighbours.”

“Their concerns are pretty universal. They worry about the same things we all do. That’s the difference between Conservatives and Liberals. They play the blame game. We get to work,” he said.

In his only reference to his own past two months of controversy, Trudeau said it’s important for Liberals to “stay focused” and not be distracted by internal disputes.

“Let’s learn from our mistakes. Liberals fighting Liberals only helps Andrew Scheer. We have to remember what this party stands for,” Trudeau said. He signalled his party will frame next fall’s vote, in much the same terms as he framed the last: “The next election is about what kind of country we want to live in, and who we want to be.”

The letter to Trudeau highlights concerns about the inappropriate labeling of the Sikh and Muslim communities in the report, in some circumstances without sufficient evidence.

The letter noted that the report has left Canadians with many questions and many concerns specifically regarding the fact that the report uses terms such as “Sikh”, “Shia”, and “Sunni” to label and equate entire communities to extremism.

“This report unfairly stigmatizes Muslim and Sikh communities, while failing to consider dangerous and unintended consequences. These consequences include the potential to place vulnerable communities and all Canadians at greater risk, by emboldening the harmful stereotypes that fuelled terrorist attacks in Christchurch, Quebec City and Oak Creek” said Singh. “Political leaders must act with great care and responsibility, so their words are not used to exploit fear and fuel hatred – instead, they must promote solidarity and challenge hatred, whenever atrocities occur.”

Dubé added: “You have in us and in our caucus, a strong ally prepared to tackle extremism. It is of tantamount importance to us, however, that any approach avoids further divisions between groups, which in turn fuels hatred and in some circumstances violent acts.” He added “There is nothing more important to us, than the safety and security of all Canadians.”

Jagmeet Singh and the NDP urged Trudeau and his Liberal government to remove the report from government websites until all promised changes regarding these labels and references to the Sikh, Shia and Sunni communities are made, or until a clear explanation including any evidence, where appropriate, is released.

Dubé introduced the motion after sending a letter to the Minister last December, which the Minister did not answer. Dubé’s letter raised questions about the concerns expressed by Canadians regarding the labelling of Sikh and Muslim communities as extremists. His letter also raised the dangers of this labelling and its potential to lead to inappropriate stereotypes and stigmas.

Dubé went on to state: “We’ve heard from communities that are named in this report that there is concern over what impact it can have.” He added: “It’s become pretty clear that there needs to be rethinking of how these groups are identified in these reports and a better understanding of the thought process behind the decisions.” -CINEWS",NDP leader sends letter to Trudeau about labeling Muslim and Sikhs as terrorists,Canindia.com,http://www.canindia.com/ndp-leader-sends-letter-to-trudeau-about-labeling-muslim-and-sikhs-as-terrorists/

CALGARY — Federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and Alberta's United Conservative leader Jason Kenney braved a heavy snowstorm Thursday to attack what they call the ""Notley-Trudeau alliance.""

The two told a rally of hundreds of supporters gathered on a baseball diamond in Calgary that political change for Alberta and the country is in the wind.

""Rachel Notley and Justin Trudeau are cut from the same cloth. They both have the same attitude towards our energy sector. They have both demonized those who have built an industry,"" he told the crowd from the box of Kenney's blue pickup.

Kenney repeated key themes of his campaign. He told the crowd that record numbers of Albertans are out of work, the economy is struggling and support from Albertans to separate from Canada is growing.

He also criticized the NDP for using what he called American-style, attack ads during the campaign.

Notley said this week it's clear from the policies and comments from some UCP candidates that a Kenney government wouldn't protect some religions and LGBTQ groups.

She also urged voters to cast a ballot for the NDP instead of for the Liberals or Alberta Party — to join forces to beat the UCP.

Unicorn sightings during Question Period are down to zero.

After weeks of being drubbed by the opposition over LavScam, the prime minister is now threatening a lawsuit against Andrew Scheer, his chief detractor in this misbegotten affair. What’s next? Suing Andrew Coyne?

They say drowning people will clutch at anything. But a threatened lawsuit against Scheer? The Michelin Tire Man is more menacing than the leader of the Official Opposition. This guy edits his tweets when he gets a paper airplane thrown his way.

And didn’t this PM promise a new, open way of doing politics? Dumping MPs who won’t bend to his will, effectively firing a cabinet minister who didn’t take the hint on a big file, shutting down the justice committee investigation of this travesty, and now waving a libel action around does not exactly conjure up sunny ways.

Having already claimed two star female federal cabinet ministers, the clerk of the privy council, and the PM’s principal secretary, it appears the next victim of LavScam could be Justin Trudeau himself. And all because one way or another, the PM seems determined to spare SNC-Lavalin a criminal conviction for its alleged bribery and corruption in Libya. Why?

That remains the biggest mystery in Canada. On so many levels, Trudeau’s puzzling advocacy for the Quebec engineering firm is a dog that won’t hunt. Four related questions persist:

1. Why didn’t no mean no?

For starters, the judicial officers whose sole task it is to decide who gets prosecuted and who doesn’t have done their jobs.

The director of public prosecutions (DPP), decided that the company did not qualify for “remediation” under a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA). The attorney general of the day agreed.

If it had qualified, SNC-Lavalin would have been spared a possible criminal conviction for its activities in Libya. It could then continue to bid on federal contracts in Canada, as opposed to facing a 10-year ban.

It already operates under such a ban on all World Bank-financed projects in the wake of widespread corruption scandals in other countries, including Cambodia and Bangladesh.

The irony here? SNC-Lavalin has pleaded not guilty in the criminal process now underway in Quebec on the Libya charges. But one of the key conditions of qualifying for remediation, which the company badly wants, includes the admission of guilt. Go figure.

In his zeal to go to bat for SNC-Lavalin, Trudeau appears to have forgotten a few things about the justice system — apart from the fact he and his minions have no business interfering in a decision by the DPP, which is by law an independent office.

DPAs are not like birth certificates. Not everyone gets one. In the U.S., DPAs have been around for 20 years and they get handed out like hot dogs at a Little League game. In the U.K., they were only introduced five years ago, and are rare legal outcomes. The new Canadian law comes with disqualifying conditions that preclude remediation. The DPP cited three of them in turning SNC-Lavalin down for a DPA in the Libya prosecution:

The nature and gravity of the company’s alleged activities; the involvement of senior officers of the company in said activities; and the failure to self-report. Reporting after the RCMP is already on the case is not self-reporting; it is covering ass.

Take that first disqualifier. Not even the PM could argue that the charges and allegations SNC-Lavalin is facing are the stuff of a fine, a stern talking to, and some corporate quiet time:

Forty-eight million dollars in bribes to various public officials in Libya, including, Saadi Gadhafi; picking up the tab for Saadi’s Canadian Debauchery Tour, and re-decorating his luxury, fortieth-floor penthouse overlooking Lake Ontario that the United Nations still doesn’t know what to do with.

According to court filings, Canada’s DPP, Kathleen Roussel, offered the above three disqualifications. The occasion was SNC-Lavalin’s second bid to get the Federal Court to agree that it should have been afforded remediation to avoid prosecution on criminal charges.

The company’s first attempt was thrown out. The court confirmed that prosecutorial discretion is not subject to judicial review, period. The PM obviously didn’t get the memo.

2. Why no alarm about SNC’s murderous client?

Trudeau also seems to have forgotten another thing — just what sort of “family” SNC-Lavalin had been dealing with in Libya for years, right up to the civil war in that country that ended in the fall of the regime and Moammar Gadhafi’s gruesome death.

It was the Gadhafi regime that gave the world Lockerbie — the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, killing all 259 people onboard and 11 others on the ground. And according to a CIA report declassified in 2011, it was the Gadhafi regime that exported terror through groups like Abu Nidal. And it was on orders of Papa Gadhafi that Libyan dissidents living abroad were targeted for assassination.

It is worth noting that one of the reasons a DPA can be denied in Canada is if the act or omission that forms the basis of the offence was committed “for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with, a criminal organization or terrorist group.”

The Gadhafis? Hmmm.

While Canada was leading a NATO bombing campaign in Libya in 2011, officers of SNC-Lavalin were allegedly putting the wife of Saadi Gadhafi on the payroll. That information came in court documents from the company’s former executive vice president, Riadh Ben Aissa. The former SNC-Lavalin high roller ended up in a Swiss jail after pleading guilty to fraud, corruption, and money-laundering charges. He is now a cooperating witness for the RCMP in the Libya criminal case in Quebec.

Though the company now says Ben Aissa was a “rogue” executive who was secretly sympathetic to the Gadhafi regime, it was this same executive who secured billions of dollars in contracts in Libya and North Africa for SNC-Lavalin. Ben Aissa was one of the company’s top wage earners.

3. Why be soft on the scourge of bribery?

In addition to some of the finer points of the law, Trudeau seems to have forgotten another important matter: Canada’s signature on the Anti-Bribery Convention. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has not.

The OECD is desperate to stamp out corruption in international business deals — in which a staggering $1 trillion a year is paid out in bribes. Forty-four countries are party to the agreement, including Canada. The poorest countries are the worst victims of such corruption — the ones Trudeau said he would do a better job for when he came to power.

Now the OECD says it is “concerned” about allegations of political interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin and will “closely monitor” how the scandal develops. No wonder. Here’s what Article 5 of the Anti-Bribery Convention sets out:

“As a Party to the Anti-Bribery Convention, Canada is fully committed to comply with the Convention, which requires prosecutorial independence in foreign bribery cases pursuant to Article 5. In addition, political factors, such as a country’s national economic interest, and the identity of the alleged perpetrator, must not influence foreign bribery investigations and prosecutions.”

It seems obvious that the Trudeau government has already violated the Anti-Bribery Convention by citing possible job losses as a reason to decriminalize SNC-Lavalin’s case. And the OECD is not Trudeau’s only problem on the international scene. There is also the new deal to replace NAFTA.

Prominent amongst the 34 chapters, 11 annexes, and 12 side-letters of the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement is an entire chapter devoted to robust anti-corruption measures.

The bottom line is that parties to this new deal agree to establish criminal offences under the law for corruption in both the public and the private sector. The goal is to tackle corruption, not push it out of bounds along the sideline and return to the huddle, as Trudeau has done.

4. Why squander the ‘transparent’ high ground?

The PM’s final bit of amnesia? These words from his mandate letter to his minister of international development back in 2015:

“It’s time to shine more light on government... Government and its information should be open by default... It is important that we acknowledge mistakes when we make them... Canadians do not expect us to be perfect — they always expect us to be honest, open and sincere...”

Earlier this week, Kenney renewed his threat to “turn off the taps” if B.C. continues to “obstruct” the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.

On Thursday, Scheer appeared alongside Kenney at a campaign rally days before Alberta’s provincial election.

WATCH: Jason Kenney gets support from federal friends

“There’s no doubt that the people of Alberta need a change of government after four years of an NDP government punishing the energy sector,” Scheer told Global BC’s Chris Gailus in a one-on-one interview. “But what Jason is talking about is a failure at the federal level and that’s my message to the people of British Columbia.

“The people of both provinces are caught in the crossfire because Justin Trudeau has failed to create a climate where big projects can get built. And we’ve been calling on the federal Liberals to put forward a comprehensive plan to get Trans Mountain built, to unclog the approvals process. They haven’t done so, so it is creating a lot of that animosity.”

Kenney has backed UCP candidate Mark Smith, who has come under fire for past remarks that have been labelled homophobic and anti-abortion.

“I know Jason Kenney has always stood up for all the rights of all Canadians, including LGBT Canadians,” Scheer said. “He has done more for new Canadians across the country when he was [immigration] minister.”

The federal Conservatives have faced criticism in their own right. Last year, two Tory MPs took heat for giving each other a high-five after voting against an Indigenous rights bill.

Scheer said the Conservatives are an “open and inclusive party that celebrates everyone in this country.”

The Tory leader has promised to eliminate the federal carbon tax and is critical of B.C.’s provincial carbon tax. For British Columbians worried about record-high fuel costs, Scheer said the Conservatives will focus on “regulatory burdens” on the energy sector that “increase costs downstream.”

As for British Columbians who are concerned about the environmental impact of the fossil fuel industry on B.C.’s coast, Scheer said his government would have “a very robust approvals process” based on “science and evidence.”

“We have to separate the people who always want to say no, and don’t have sound science to back up their opposition to these types of projects,” he said. “Our government will assure that an approvals process takes into account those very real environmental concerns but that does so in a way that, once met, will allow projects to proceed.”

While Scheer has slammed the Liberals’ climate plan, the Tories have not presented their own version of climate policy.

Scheer emphasized that the Conservatives’ plan will be released with ample time for Canadians to review it before October’s federal election.

The Conservative leader repeated, word for word, the March 29 statement that prompted Trudeau's lawyer, Julian Porter, to send him notice of a potential libel suit.

For good measure, Scheer did it outside the House of Commons — making the point that he's not trying to hide behind parliamentary privilege that protects anything said in the chamber from lawsuits.

""I'm not withdrawing my remarks. In fact, I'm standing by them and I repeated them outside of the House of Commons,"" Scheer told Trudeau during question period a short time later.

""Will he have the backbone to stand by his threats and show up in court to fight this case?""

Trudeau did not respond directly to Scheer's repeated taunts but he didn't withdraw the threat either.

""We put (Scheer) on notice because he and his party have a history of making false and defamatory statements,"" the prime minister said.

""We won't stand by while he continues to mislead Canadians.""

Trudeau then accused Scheer of flogging the SNC-Lavalin issue to deflect attention from his own failure to distance himself from white supremacists or to produce plans for the economy and the environment.

He referred to Scheer's repeated refusal to denounce ""by name"" Faith Goldy, a white nationalist political commentator who was banned by Facebook this week. She was one of the speakers at a pro-pipeline protest on Parliament Hill in February that included some anti-immigrant, white nationalist extremists. Scheer also spoke to the protesters, showing his support of the oil and gas industry, but he did not denounce the extremists at the time.

Threat of white supremacy questioned

Trudeau also demanded Scheer denounce Conservative Sen. Leo Housakos, ""a member of his own caucus,"" for saying Tuesday there is no politician in this country ""who believes that white supremacy is a threat to our way of life in Canada.""

Scheer dismissed the ploy as ""typical Liberal smear tactics.""

""They know that I have always 100 per cent denounced white supremacy and racism and anyone who promotes those hateful ideologies ... This is what is disgusting about this. They are using the very real threat of hatred and racism in this country to cover up their corruption scandal.""

Scheer also maintained that Housakos ""withdrew and clarified"" his comments. In a series of tweets Wednesday, Housakos explained that he meant ""extremism in ALL forms is a threat to our way of life, not just one or the other."" He was challenging Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland's assertion that white supremacists and their ilk represent one of the most serious terrorist threats to western democracies.

In the March 29 statement that triggered the lawsuit threat, Scheer accused Trudeau of leading a campaign to interfere with the criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin and directing Canada's former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to break the law.

Scheer said he stands by ""every single word"" in that statement, whereas Trudeau's ""falsehoods"" in the SNC-Lavalin affair ""would be perjury in a court of law.""","Scheer repeats alleged libel, goads Trudeau to follow through on lawsuit threat",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/scheer-trudeau-snc-lavalin-lawsuit-1.5092652

By reinforcing this message, Justin Trudeau is hoping to maintain the narrative that swept in his progressive government back in 2015.

I’m not sure how successful a strategy that is. For starters, Trudeau has lost much of his early sheen. He is now tainted, both by cynicism and scandal. Furthermore, Scheer, with his pleasant demeanour and boyish grin, hardly evokes the memory of his dour predecessor.

If anything, Scheer is far more similar to a different prime minister. That, of course, would be the Rt. Hon. Joe Clark, who celebrates the 40th anniversary of becoming prime minister this year.

Clark, at the age of 39, became the youngest prime minister in Canadian history. If Scheer is successful in the October federal election, he will be prime minister at age 40.

Both conservative leaders also represent(ed) the western prairies – High River and Regina, respectively.

And of course, both Clark and Scheer exude that quintessential characteristic for which Canadians are known: “niceness.”

Other parallels are more striking.

Prior to becoming leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition, neither Clark nor Scheer maintained long-term careers outside of partisan politics. Instead, both men jumped into the political circus and contested elections while in their 20s. In contrast, many prime ministers established themselves with impressive careers long before Ottawa’s siren call beckoned them forth with the promise of influence and prestige.

For instance, Lester Pearson was a Nobel Prize-winning diplomat prior to his entry into electoral politics. Brian Mulroney, a successful businessman and lawyer. William Lyon Mackenzie King (our only prime minister to have earned a PhD) was an accomplished public servant and labour conciliator. Even Pierre Trudeau, often accused of being something of a dilettante, established himself as a journalist and constitutional professor before throwing his hat into the political arena.

Clark and Scheer also faced struggles to appear statesmanlike. In 1979, Clark sought to improve his credibility in foreign affairs by taking a trip to the Middle East. Alas, the trip proved to be a PR disaster. From his vocal support of Brexit to his outrageous claims that he would have negotiated a better NAFTA agreement, Scheer has similarly proven inept. Notwithstanding Justin Trudeau’s embarrassing trip to India, Scheer has little grounds to criticize the current prime minister on the issue of statesmanship.

Notwithstanding Justin Trudeau’s embarrassing trip to India, Andrew Scheer has little grounds to criticize the current prime minister on the issue of statesmanship.

Furthermore, with questionable policy proposals, as with his promise to allow the Quebec government to collect federal taxes, Scheer is imitating Joe Clark and his view of Canada as a “community of communities.”

But of course, one notable difference remains between the two men. Where Scheer has been cautious and timid, Clark was bold and daring.

As prime minister, Clark oversaw the resettlement of 60,000 Vietnamese refugees in a very short span of time. The achievement did not go unnoticed. In 1986, citizens of Canada were awarded the Nansen Medal, largely for the efforts of the Clark government to significantly increase refugees into the country.

Other examples include Clark’s efforts to balance the federal budget with tax increases, after a decade of inaction. Or his government’s key role in the rescue of six American diplomats during the Iranian revolution. This, in a tenure as prime minister that lasted just shy of nine months.

As historian Richard Gwyn wrote, “contrary to his public image, Clark in some ways was far bolder than Trudeau.”

In contrast, Andrew Scheer may be many things, but bold he is not.

On the issue of immigration, Scheer has sought to fear-monger with his opposition to the UN’s Global Compact for Migration. On cannabis legalization, he has conveyed no coherent message for or against the Liberal policy. His support of supply management is nothing more than weak-kneed pandering to eastern dairy farmers. And on the existential threat of climate change, Scheer remains firmly opposed to any tax on carbon, and has offered no credible, alternative course of action.

Evidently Scheer believes his strategy of merely lounging about and watching the Liberal Party self-destruct will prove successful.

If Scheer is wise, though, he will take heed of Clark and his boldness. After all, Joe Clark remains the only politician to defeat a Trudeau.

Photo Dan Toulgoet Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer was in Vancouver Friday morning and said he thinks the party’s policies on ...,"Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer was in Vancouver Friday morning and said he thinks the party’s policies on addressing housing affordability and investing in public transit will help the Conservatives make gains in the city in the upcoming federal election.

“The affordability message that I spoke about today resonates with people living in a city like Vancouver where the cost of housing is so expensive and where people are really finding their dollar stretched so much,” he told reporters following an event with the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade. “We’ll also be speaking about investments in important things like infrastructure to help people move around the city.”

The Conservative Party does not currently hold a seat in any of Vancouver’s six federal ridings. The party lost its lone seat in the city, Vancouver South, to the Liberals in 2015 when current Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan beat incumbent Conservative Wai Young.

The Liberals took a majority the Vancouver ridings, four of the six, in 2015 with New Democrats’ Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway) and Jenny Kwan (Vancouver East) winning the remaining two seats.

“A combination of measures to address housing affordability, investments in public transit and I do believe a real sense of dissatisfaction with people who voted Liberal in the past without realizing that they’re not getting what they voted for, Justin Trudeau was not as advertised, leaves me to be very confident that we will be able to regain the seats we lost in 2015,” Scheer said.

Scheer gave a definitive “No” when asked if he would be meeting with Vancouver Granville MP Jody Wilson-Raybould during his time in Vancouver. But did say he had a “brief interaction” with her after she was kicked out of the Liberal caucus earlier this month and had to cross the floor and sit on the other side of the House of Commons.

“I passed along my best wishes to her and told her that I had a great deal of respect for the decision that she made, not just to do the right thing herself but… raising an alarm that inappropriate interference could potentially be happening again after she moved,” he said.

Scheer also addressed rising gas prices, which hit $1.69.9 a litre at some Metro Vancouver stations Friday morning and the fact that United Conservative Party leader Jason Kenney has said he will invoke Alberta’s Bill 12, also known as the “turn off the taps” legislation, which would reduce the flow of gasoline to B.C. if he is elected next week.

Scheer was in Calgary yesterday supporting Kenney in his bid to be Alberta’s next premier. Election day in Alberta is next Tuesday.

“I don’t believe it will come to that,” Scheer told reporters. “I believe that in October Canadians will elect a Conservative government that will get pipelines built and I believe that is the best way to de-escalate some of the regional differences in the country is by having a federal government that works for all Canadians in all regions… We’ve called on these important pipeline projects to be declared as international interests and therefore would put all our energy towards seeing that they are actually built.”

Scheer said he had plans to meet with the B.C. Business Council later Friday followed by attending events celebrating Vaisakhi.

The two told a rally of hundreds of supporters gathered on a baseball diamond in Calgary that political change for Alberta and the country is in the wind.

""We know in our province what it's like when the NDP are in power provincially. We know the darkness that falls on the province when you have a government in power that constantly makes it harder and harder for people to get ahead,"" said Scheer, who is from Saskatchewan.

""That's why it's so important that Jason Kenney and the United Conservative Party form government this Tuesday here in Alberta.""

Scheer said the first segment of a two-part plan will be completed when Kenney defeats NDP Premier Rachel Notley on Tuesday. The second part will happen this fall in the federal election.

""Rachel Notley and Justin Trudeau are cut from the same cloth. They both have the same attitude towards our energy sector. They have both demonized those who have built an industry,"" he told the crowd from the box of Kenney's blue pickup.

""It's been winter for far too long in Alberta. But spring is right around the corner. Spring is coming.""

Hundreds of umbrella's were piled high with wet snow during the rally. Kenney maintained the weather theme in his speech.

The Canadian Press United Conservative Party leader Jason Kenney, left, and federal Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer attend a campaign rally in Calgary on April 11, 2019.

""It might feel like winter today but spring is just five days away for Alberta,"" Kenney said to cheers.

""Are you ready to scrap the carbon tax? Are you ready to stand up to the special interests that are attacking Alberta? Are you ready in five days to end the Trudeau-Notley alliance?""

Kenney repeated key themes of his campaign. He told the crowd that record numbers of Albertans are out of work, the economy is struggling and support from Albertans to separate from Canada is growing.

He also criticized the NDP for using what he called American-style, attack ads during the campaign.

Notley said this week it's clear from the policies and comments from some UCP candidates that a Kenney government wouldn't protect some religions and LGBTQ groups.

She also urged voters to cast a ballot for the NDP instead of for the Liberals or Alberta Party — to join forces to beat the UCP.

Kenney said there is one question he will continue asking Notley until Tuesday's vote.

Joined by federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer on a snowy Thursday afternoon to rally at a southwest Calgary baseball diamond, the two outlined their vision for a political field of dreams in Alberta — led by Tories at the federal and provincial levels.

Kenney, leader of Alberta’s United Conservative Party, has previously decried a supposed exodus of investment from Alberta’s energy sector under NDP Leader Rachel Notley’s premiership, vowing he’d get a pipeline built and restore investor confidence in the province.

Scheer said Kenney is the right leader to move Alberta forward.

“Rachel Notley and (Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau, they both have the same attitude toward our energy sector,” Scheer said.

“They have both demonized those who have built an industry, who have constantly struggled and striven to improve an industry.”

Scheer said Kenney has built a united right-wing party that welcomes “people from diverse backgrounds, from all walks of life,” including those from different faiths and ethnic backgrounds.

“Jason Kenney has brought more people into the conservative movement,” Scheer told a crowd of hundreds who braved a sudden snowstorm to attend the rally.

“Everywhere I go in Canada, I meet all different kinds of conservatives, but in every community I meet Jason Kenney conservatives.”

The event marked the only occasion since the writ was dropped last month in which a federal party leader has visited Alberta to campaign alongside their provincial counterpart.

Both conservative leaders took aim at Trudeau as much as they did Notley on Thursday, each vowing to replace their respective rivals at the federal and provincial levels.

“The re-election of Justin Trudeau would be a threat to the vital economic interests and the future prosperity of Alberta,” said Kenney. “It would continue to fuel a national unity crisis that has begun here under his watch.”

He said Albertans have suffered through four years of adversity, economic decline and stagnation.

“We Albertans never give up,” said Kenney. “We are resilient. We work hard. We overcome adversity and that’s what we’re going to do next Tuesday.”

The UCP continues to lead in polls despite being plagued by controversy throughout the 28-day campaign. Various conservative candidates have come under fire for past homophobic and anti-Muslim comments, while Kenney continues to face scrutiny as the RCMP investigates concerns regarding his party leadership victory in 2017.

“They’re ending this campaign like they started it,” Kenney said of the NDP. “With fear and smear and U.S.-attack style ads and the politics of personal destruction.”

Shirley Ward, who attended the rally with her husband, Wayne, said Notley’s attacks on Kenney throughout the past month have been unethical.

“She started out with a dirty campaign and it’s unfortunate,” said Ward.

“It’s messy but we’re getting used to it,” agreed her husband. “We’re going to support Jason. We’re going to support him rain or shine.”

For Brian Michaels, it’s Kenney’s optimism that inspires his support.

“I like that they have a positive spin on everything,” he said of the UCP. “Even during the debate, it seemed like there was a happy positive vibe coming from Kenney and the other groups were more hostile.”

Standing atop Kenney’s trademark blue pickup truck amid the blowing snow, Scheer said the large crowd proves it’s time for change.

“It’s been winter for far too long in Alberta, but spring is right around the corner,” he said. “Spring is coming.”

With the Liberals entangled in the SNC-Lavalin scandal, can he capitalize on his chance?

Clues emerge through conversation about his vision - these are early days in the pre-election period - but a sensible question prevails of why he and his party are not fully subsuming a Justin Trudeau government in its third month of fumbling its greatest challenge.

article continues below

The dismal Liberal period has afforded the Conservatives the lead in the polls, but rather tenuously and marginally. If this is the worst it will get for the Liberals, there are tangible prospects of a rebound.

How does Scheer ensure they do not get back on solid footing?

His appearance Friday morning at the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade offered another iteration of a leader-in-grooming who would be our prime minister. Each time he appears in the city, he is lighter on his feet and more relatable.

He is naturally self-deprecating and, yes, he has a sense of humour.

He is young as a leader but rather old for his age at 39; he jokes about Lucy moving the football from Charlie Brown and his children asking ""why do you say, 'Hang up the phone?'""

But where some leaders run into trouble when they move into the robotic world of a message track, Scheer's effectiveness actually diminishes when he improvises on the serious stuff. His tendency is to bring us into the weeds instead of paddling us through the currents.

He began by departing from a written speech, most likely for most leaders a sound strategy, but in his case well-briefed does not easily translate into well-spoken.

He brings the audience into detailed territory without a discernable beginning, middle and end to the point he wishes to make; it is often an explanation more than an incantation, and it can leave you recognizing he knows his material inside-out but cannot plainly and simply provide his position.

Obviously it is not time in April to roll out the campaign slogans he must muster in September and October, so the event is predictably rather content-free. The greatest applause he gets is for criticizing foreign-funded advocacy on the pipeline debate and - no kidding here - on how he would stop municipalities from dumping raw sewage into our waterways.

Which is not at all to say he brings weak or few messages on the economy, on the environment, on the need to review our tax burden without harming social services, or on how our country's prime minister needs to be selling our energy abroad and not apologizing for it. It's just that he hasn't found a snappy, memorable way to deliver these goods, and that he has to avoid running too fast this early in the marathon.

He is, like most public figures, more affable in person than in the limelight. Last time I encountered his predecessor, Stephen Harper, he wanted to talk hockey and the mess of the Edmonton Oilers; the second the microphone was on, though, he was on message and deliberately stern.

Scheer doesn't have quite that switch of hot and cold, so he can toggle with a little more personal ease - albeit with a fair amount of meander.

A few weeks ago, the business crowd for Finance Minister Bill Morneau left shaking its head about his disconnectedness with its issues.

Terry Pedwell, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- The federal Liberals are attacking the Ontario Progressive Conservative government's first budget since Doug Ford was elected premier, hoping voters across the country will connect the document's cuts to social spending and the yet-to-be-announced policy leanings of Andrew Scheer's Conservatives.

The provincial budget proposes cuts in post-secondary education and social services, scaling back the growth in spending projected by Ontario's former Liberal government.

Federal Employment Minister Patty Hajdu, an MP from Thunder Bay in northern Ontario, called the budget ""reckless"" in how it takes a knife to programs that affect everything from social security and job creation to northern development and the province's ability to fight forest fires.

At almost every turn at a news conference Friday, Hajdu told reporters in Ottawa that voters across the country can expect the same kind of ""cruel"" fiscal slashing from the federal Conservatives under Scheer's leadership, should they choose him to govern the nation in the October election.

""From my perspective, Doug Ford and his cronies are trying to pull a fast one on Ontarians,"" Hajdu said. ""It's quite clear that Andrew Scheer would take exactly the same tactic.""

Much as the federal Liberals did in 2015, the Ford government is pledging to balance Ontario's books several years down the road.

Justin Trudeau didn't deliver on his campaign pledge of ""modest"" deficit spending with a plan to balance the federal budget by 2019. Every year, his government has produced bigger deficits than it promised, and this year's is nearly $20 billion.

Balancing the provincial budget was a key election promise for the Ontario Tories. Finance Minister Vic Fedeli said Thursday he expected the province would eliminate its budget deficit by the 2023-24 fiscal year, two years beyond the end of their term.

""We have developed a reasonable path to balance,"" Fedeli said. ""Our path to balance in five years is a thoughtful and a measured approach to take.""

Federal Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre, who for months has been hounding the Trudeau Liberals to say when the federal books will be balanced, said Friday he understands the Ontario PC government was handed a tenuous fiscal situation by the province's former Liberal government.

With that in mind, the Ford government has taken a responsible approach with a plan to bring deficit spending to an eventual end, Poilievre said.

""They inherited a disastrous financial situation and they've tried to balance fiscal responsibility against the continuing needs of the people while constrained by enormous record debt,"" he said. ""I think they got the balance right.""

Under the Ontario budget, program expenses in the province are to rise over three years by an average of 0.8 per cent, compared to the 3.3 per cent in growth that the former Liberal government had projected.

The document talks about fighting climate change ""without a carbon tax,"" but provides no new money for climate programs. It does, however, earmark cash for clean-technology investments that could create jobs in industries producing solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicle charging stations.

""Canadians want us to take action on things like climate,"" Hajdu said, denouncing the Ford government's criticism of the federal carbon tax. ""They know that their children's health and safety depends on governments that are going to take responsible action.""

Hajdu wasn't focused only on the Ford government Friday. She lumped Jason Kenney's Alberta Conservatives together with the Ford government in warning Canadians that they can expect ""cuts, cuts, cuts"" to spending under a Scheer government similar to those announced in Ontario and proposed in Alberta where Kenney is fighting to unseat his province's NDP government.

""We see the Conservative governments behave the same way no matter where they are elected,"" said Hajdu.",Trudeau Liberals link 'reckless' Ontario budget with Scheer's Conservatives,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/trudeau-liberals-link-reckless-ontario-budget-with-scheer-s-conservatives-1.4377758

But it will also make it more difficult for Trudeau to turn the tables on Scheer and predict that the election of a Conservative government would result in a fiscal bloodbath.

Yes, the fact that Ontario will remain in the red beyond Ford’s current term in office is liable to blunt Conservative Party of Canada attacks on the ruling Liberals for accumulating deficit upon deficit since they have taken power.

By all indications, Premier Doug Ford’s fiscal plan will provide the Trudeau Liberals with less lethal ammunition to use against their Conservative rivals in the upcoming federal campaign than they had hoped for.

And yes, the course charted in Thursday’s budget will — over time — impoverish Ontario’s social services. The plan to keep the growth in program spending below the rate of inflation for the next five years cannot but result in a thinner social safety net . The province’s most vulnerable constituencies stand to be the first and the hardest hit.

In the immediate, the first batch of post-budget media analysis has left federal Conservative strategists with an embarrassment of riches to counter the Liberals’ post-budget apocalyptic scenarios.

But the full impact on most Ontarians of the measures sketched out on Thursday will not have been felt by the time Scheer and his Conservatives go door-knocking next fall.

Take this summation by my columnist colleague Martin Regg Cohn: “There are no savage cuts in the first Ford-Fedeli budget, which could easily have been delivered by former premier Dalton McGuinty back when he belatedly discovered austerity.”

Or this one from Globe and Mail columnist Tim Kiladze: “If anything, it looks more like something that would come from the Liberals he replaced — the ones he swore had been reckless with the province’s finances.”

Those comments were not written to complement the Ford Tories but to highlight the gap between their rhetoric and their actual budget.

It is hard to find in the rather sunny outlook upon which Ford’s government has based its first budget much evidence of the premier’s gloomy contentions that the provincial Liberals have left the province on the fiscal brink or that the federal carbon tax will plunge Ontario into a recession.

The contrast between Ford’s talk and his government’s budget walk will likely displease many fiscal conservatives. They had been given cause to expect a dramatic departure from the fiscal policy of the previous Liberal governments. But from Scheer’s electoral perspective, it comes as close as it could have to a do-no-harm budget.

In the lead-up to Thursday, the Trudeau Liberals had all but telegraphed their strategy of coming out swinging against the Ontario budget.

They even took the rare step of dispatching two MPs to Queen’s Park so as to have boots on the ground as soon as the budget fight got underway.

On Friday, the Liberals doubled down with a Parliament Hill news conference featuring four Ontario MPs — including three ministers. Labour Minister Patti Hajdu alleged the Ford budget was inspired by “the politics of cruelty.”

Such a federal deployment on the occasion of a provincial budget is more than unusual; it is just about unprecedented.

Just a few weeks ago the first Coalition Avenir Québec budget came and went with nary a peep from Parliament Hill.

The introduction of Quebec’s contentious Bill 21 — and the attending CAQ decision to override both the Canadian and Quebec charters on the way to removing the right of some public servants to wear religious symbols — was also greeted with a lot more federal restraint.

Mind you, it is hard to think of circumstances under which the sight of Liberal MPs lurking in the hallways of the Quebec national assembly in wait of delivering a hit on a major provincial policy announcement would not backfire.

Ford was always expected to be front and centre in the election narrative of the Trudeau Liberals.

There is a reason why the latter have been relatively restrained in the face of Alberta Conservative Leader Jason Kenney’s strategy of consistently associating outgoing NDP Premier Rachel Notley with the prime minister the better to score hits on his main rival on the provincial campaign trail.

Trudeau’s team is poised to similarly link Scheer with Ford on the hustings next fall. At this juncture the Ontario premier is both less popular and more polarizing than the federal Conservative leader.

In Ontario, the SNC-Lavalin crisis has cost Trudeau his pre-election edge on the Conservatives.

If the Liberals were to lose Canada’s largest province next fall, they would lose the election.

A take-no-prisoner battle is in the offing.

But from the strategic perspective of the federal Liberals, Thursday’s Ontario budget was a disappointment.

201,Politics,2019-04-12T01:16:00.0000000Z,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer wore rosy ties for the International Day of Pink, and a sea of MPs behind them sported yellow daffodil pins in support of cancer ...","OTTAWA — A week before Easter, the temperature in Ottawa was finally above zero and spring, or at least spring fever, seemed to have reached the House of Commons chamber.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer wore rosy ties for the International Day of Pink, and a sea of MPs behind them sported yellow daffodil pins in support of cancer research. But they couldn’t agree on much else Wednesday. The annual frenzy colloquially referred to as “silly season,” always hotter in an election year, seemed to have begun in earnest.

Despite the flowers and pastels, Liberals still seemed mired in the barren, grey winter. On the agenda Wednesday, aside from a triumphant “We freed the beer!” from Trudeau, were repeated challenges from Scheer for the prime minister to make good on a defamation lawsuit his lawyer threatened last week — apparently in the hopes that bringing the matter to court would unearth further details about the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal.

Variations on “When will I see the prime minister in court?” and “I’m just waiting for him to tell me on what day I should show up” from Scheer were met with variations on “They’re still following Stephen Harper’s playbook” and “The Opposition continues to mislead Canadians” from Trudeau.

After several rounds of the same, the Liberal leader made a joke about how Groundhog Day had been back in February, before repeating himself anew. The Conservative leader joked that with Trudeau’s father, it had been “just watch me,” but with Trudeau, it was “just watch me run away.”

Trudeau did not address, in question period or to reporters earlier Wednesday, whether or not he planned to proceed with the suit.

Conservatives had made public the libel notice from Trudeau’s lawyer, Julian Porter, on the weekend. And daring Trudeau to a game of chicken, Scheer had stood outside of the House of Commons chamber before question period to recite his allegedly defamatory March 29 statement again.

“These documents and recordings are concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal prosecution. He personally gave the orders and when the former attorney general refused to follow them and break the law, she was fired,” Scheer repeated, going on to reiterate the entire 200-word statement, which ended with a demand for Trudeau’s resignation.

Scheer was referring to documentation former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould presented to the House justice committee. In testimony she had accused the prime minister and his officials of inappropriately pressuring her to overturn, for political reasons, the Director of Public Prosecutions’s decision not to offer the Montreal company a remediation agreement.

Porter’s letter said Scheer’s comments were “highly defamatory” and “beyond the pale of fair debate.” The lawyer spelled out each of Scheer’s assertions and how they were “entirely false.” Bolstered by an enthusiastic roster of MPs, Scheer challenged Trudeau to say so in front of a judge.

In what felt like a dress rehearsal for the federal election scheduled for October, the leaders talking over each other on SNC-Lavalin led to sparring on an entirely different political issue.

Responding to Scheer’s demand for a court date, Trudeau accused Scheer of failing to denounce white supremacy, and invited him to chastise Conservative Sen. Leo Housakos for saying, during a committee exchange with Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland Tuesday, that “I would find it disturbing to believe that there’s a politician in this country that believes that white supremacy is a threat to our way of life in Canada.”

In response, Scheer said he has always denounced white supremacy and racism, and added it was “disgusting” for Trudeau to bring it up. “The Liberals are using the very real threat of hatred and racism in this country to cover up their corruption scandal,” he said.

There was a brief uproar in the House as MPs reacted to the exchange. Independent MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes was heard loudly protesting the political football over racism. “It’s real,” she was heard yelling over the crowd. Later on Twitter, she said, “Playing politics with racism, which impacts people on a daily basis is, disgusting and wrong. What just happened in the (House of Commons) is shameful.” Whether she was attacking Trudeau or Scheer — or both — wasn’t clear.

Housakos had earlier used Twitter to clarify his comments, saying his point was that no leaders in Western democracy condone white supremacist movements or extremism of any kind. Scheer, after question period, used the same platform to accuse Liberals of trying to “score cheap points.”

It had been a classic made-for-TV question period, the kind that Ottawa politicos write off as a necessary evil but that turns the stomachs of the sweet summer children in the gallery. It was chock full of combat, revealing almost nothing new, containing several dad jokes and managing to deeply offend.

There are still 194 days to go until the scheduled election day. The forecast guarantees that summer will be filled with hot air.

It’s not his yet. The gift is there, alluring in its availability, sitting on a pedestal waiting to be claimed.

He just hasn’t quite figured out how to seize it.

If Trudeau sinks, the entire operation goes with him

That the SNC-Lavalin affair has burst the balloon that was Justin Trudeau’s reputation is unquestioned. The Liberal caucus and party devotees may continue to deny it, but they have no choice. The party is so bound up in the person of its leader that if Trudeau sinks, the entire operation goes with him. That’s the consequence of an organization that has made a practice of delegating its fate to whoever happens to have won its top job. We saw that in the decade of searching that preceded Trudeau: the Liberal party doesn’t know what it is until a strong personality comes along to tell it.

So everything depends on Trudeau somehow cleaning away enough of the stain produced by his rancid performance of the past two months, and crafting a platform that can convince voters to give his gang another chance. It won’t be the hope and change campaign of 2015 (because it’s not 2015), but maybe with enough spending, some artful subterfuge and a poor performance by his opponents, the badly wounded prime minister can pull it off.

He’ll need help, however, and Scheer will have to play his part in that. Thus far, the shift in public support for his Conservatives probably derives mainly from disgust at the Liberals rather than affection for the Tories. Some of that may last, but not all of it. Scheer has to produce a reason for people to choose him, other than a desire not to vote Liberal.

There’s no indication he’s figured out to use that opportunity. Pounding away at the government’s daily pratfalls is useful enough, but the Liberals can’t be counted to keep providing new material. It’s hard to believe they could top the spectacle they produced on Tuesday, when they evicted Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from the party for the crime of revealing just how craven a group of frightened careerists they’d become.

Until the Lavalin affair came along, the Tories were banging on about immigration, the carbon tax and overspending. All are fair topics and legitimate concerns, but with finite potential as campaign issues. They may also have limited shelf life: talks are underway with the U.S. on a means to close the loophole that has allowed thousands of migrants to enter Canada illegally, with signs U.S. officials are willing to co-operate; the carbon tax is in place and represents material change in only four provinces, where outrage is tempered by the fact everyone has long known it was coming. And while the Liberals shrugged off their pledge of limited deficits ending in a balanced budget, voters seem resigned to the fact governments of all stripes learn to love living on their credit card.

The Liberals can’t be counted to keep providing new material

Scheer needs something else, and it’s not going to be his personality. Scheer once joked about being labelled “Dimples McCheery.” Stephen Harper, Jean Chrétien, Brian Mulroney and Pierre Trudeau were lots of things, but “nice” wasn’t often the word that sprang to mind. It’s noteworthy, however, that their departures were each accompanied by a strong urge for a new approach. Not just new policies, but a new attitude. Less arrogance than the Trudeau years, less greed than Mulroney, a break from the cronyism and corruption of the sponsorship scandal.

Harper made accountability and an end to sleaze a key part of his successful first campaign. Apart from a grab-bag of ambitious promises, Justin Trudeau pledged a shift away from the secrecy and cynicism that grew to engulf the Harper Tories.

The opportunity that presents itself to Scheer is that Trudeau hasn’t shown himself to be much different than the others. The Prime Minister’s Office under Trudeau has proven just as dominating and demanding as it ever was under Harper. The desperate effort to silence Wilson-Raybould echoes the Tories’ equally futile attempt to keep the Mike Duffy scandal from exploding in their faces. Before leaving her post last year, Canada’s information commissioner said openness and access to information had worsened under the Liberals, whose bill to reform the system she labelled “a bill for the bureaucracy … definitely not a bill for transparency.”

After digesting all the evidence of the confrontation with Wilson-Raybould, does anyone doubt Trudeau’s view of himself as the boss is no different than Harper’s? If nothing else, the taped conversation with privy council clerk Michael Wernick will leave the memory of his warning that Trudeau was determined to get what he wanted “one way or another,” and Wilson-Raybould’s acknowledgement that “I am not under any illusion how the prime minister has and gets things that he wants.”

Canadians may not have soured entirely on Trudeau. There may be a residual feeling that he means well. But the Liberals have seriously hurt themselves in terms of their integrity, honesty, trustability and competence. Trudeau’s handling of the SNC scandal, and his harsh treatment of Wilson-Raybould and, perhaps especially, Jane Philpott, leaves an image of a male boss unwilling to put up with a bunch of gumpf from a couple of troublesome women. Add that to his soured relationship with Indigenous communities and you have a leader whose personal standing is badly cracked.

The Liberals have seriously hurt themselves in terms of their integrity, honesty, trustability and competence

Scheer needs to promise, and project, something better. Attacking Liberal failures won’t suffice in itself, and the Tories need to show themselves as good at something besides invective. Everyone knows governments are flawed, and usually disappointing; what they want is a sign that change might bring improvement. Scheer’s challenge is to find a way to convince voters he represents a break from the Liberal circus, and its cult of personality. The Liberals have thrived on identity politics, pitting “acceptable” Canadians against undesirables and deplorables. A party that saw Canadians as something other than a collection of competing interest groups might get a positive reception.

The Conservative leader repeated, word for word, the March 29 statement that prompted Trudeau’s lawyer, Julian Porter, to send him notice of a potential libel suit.

For good measure, Scheer did it outside the House of Commons – making the point that he’s not trying to hide behind parliamentary privilege that protects anything said in the chamber from lawsuits.

“I’m not withdrawing my remarks. In fact, I’m standing by them and I repeated them outside of the House of Commons,” Scheer told Trudeau during question period a short time later.

“Will he have the backbone to stand by his threats and show up in court to fight this case?”

Trudeau did not respond directly to Scheer’s repeated taunts but he didn’t withdraw the threat either.

“We put (Scheer) on notice because he and his party have a history of making false and defamatory statements,” the prime minister said.

“We won’t stand by while he continues to mislead Canadians.”

Trudeau then accused Scheer of flogging the SNC-Lavalin issue to deflect attention from his own failure to distance himself from white supremacists or to produce plans for the economy and the environment.

He referred to Scheer’s repeated refusal to denounce “by name” Faith Goldy, a white nationalist political commentator who was banned by Facebook this week. She was one of the speakers at a pro-pipeline protest on Parliament Hill in February that included some anti-immigrant, white nationalist extremists. Scheer also spoke to the protesters, showing his support of the oil and gas industry, but he did not denounce the extremists at the time.

Trudeau also demanded Scheer denounce Conservative Sen. Leo Housakos, “a member of his own caucus,” for saying there is no politician in this country “who believes that white supremacy is a threat to our way of life in Canada.”

Scheer dismissed the ploy as “typical Liberal smear tactics.”

“They know that I have always 100% denounced white supremacy and racism and anyone who promotes those hateful ideologies … This is what is disgusting about this. They are using the very real threat of hatred and racism in this country to cover up their corruption scandal.”

Scheer also maintained that Housakos “withdrew and clarified” his comments. In a series of tweets April 10, Housakos explained that he meant “extremism in ALL forms is a threat to our way of life, not just one or the other.” He was challenging Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland’s assertion that white supremacists and their ilk represent one of the most serious terrorist threats to western democracies.

In the March 29 statement that triggered the lawsuit threat, Scheer accused Trudeau of leading a campaign to interfere with the criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin and directing Canada’s former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to break the law.

Scheer said he stands by “every single word” in that statement, whereas Trudeau’s “falsehoods” in the SNC-Lavalin affair “would be perjury in a court of law.”","Scheer repeats alleged libel, goads Trudeau to sue",plant.ca,https://www.plant.ca/general/scheer-repeats-alleged-libel-goads-trudeau-to-sue-182765/

The federal Liberals are mounting a renewed offensive against the Ontario government, dispatching federal ministers Friday to criticize the cuts proposed in the provincial budget.

The budget, unveiled on Thursday, is taking a slow pace to balancing the books, with overall program spending still expected to increase every year, but below inflation. And while some ministries are on the receiving end of cuts, others will see increases in funding.

[READ MORE: Ford government breaks campaign pledge, will balance budget in five years]

Labour and Employment Minister Patty Hajdu was among the federal Liberals from Ontario ridings who held a press conference on Parliament Hill. They said Premier Doug Ford’s social service cuts are similar to what would be put forward by a federal government led by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer.

She said the budget had attacked the federal government 25 times and accused the provincial government of “doublespeak” on health, education and safety and blaming others for its problems.

“This is a hallmark of conservative governments,” Hajdu said. “It’s quite clear Andrew Scheer would take exactly the same tactic.”



With five months still to go before the next federal election in October, Scheer’s Conservatives have not released their plans if they form government. Platforms are usually only revealed during an election campaign.

Hajdu was repeatedly asked if taking the time to bash Ford was a move made with this fall’s trek to the polls in mind. In last year’s provincial election, Ford’s Progressive Conservatives swept ridings in Toronto’s outer suburbs, a region that will be a key battleground for both Trudeau and Scheer this fall.

Her response was that conservative governments are known for “deceptive” cuts. She said neither Ford nor Scheer “value equal opportunity,” and noted the federal Liberals will present a plan that focuses on the most important issues.

In Toronto, Ontario Finance Minister Vic Fedeli dismissed the attacks from Team Trudeau.

“This has more to do with distracting from the federal government’s current issues that they’re facing brought on by themselves,” he told reporters.

“Look, here in Ontario, we are on a path to balance that respects our health care, education and core services. We are creating jobs in Ontario, we’re fighting for Ontario. The federal government is fighting against Ontario with a carbon tax and they know that we will be doing everything we can, including through the court system, to fight this job-killing carbon tax.”

Ontario’s court case against the carbon tax starts on Monday.

It’s the latest chapter in a battle that has been brewing between Trudeau and Ford since the Tories came to power last June, and it shows no signs of dying down. The Liberals seem equally willing to make adversaries of their provincial counterparts and went so far as making the rare decision to send two Ontario MPs to Queen’s Park to react to yesterday’s budget.

The intergovernmental spat largely centres around the carbon tax. Soon after Ford was elected, he moved to gut his province’s cap-and-trade program and join with other provinces in fighting the Ottawa’s carbon pricing plan in court.

His government’s budget calls the carbon tax everything from “punishing” to “regressive” to “ineffective.”



It also confirmed previously announced plans to force private gas stations to display stickers at the pumps showing the cost that the tax will have on each litre of gas. It noted a public information campaign is in the works to “highlight the true cost of the federal carbon tax.”

The budget included program cuts for post-secondary education and training, children’s and social services, as well as legal services, totalling $1.1 billion for this year. However, health and education program spending will increase and overall program funding is set to increase by $100 million.

During his election campaign, Ford had promised to balance the province’s books within his first term, but the budget showed deficit spending is only projected to end in five years. That’s midway through a second mandate — just one year ahead of what the previous provincial Liberal government planned to do.

Ford’s financial blueprint contains $163.4 billion in spending, which is $5 billion more than the one tabled by Ontario’s Liberal government in 2018. Officials speaking on background said all of that extra spending was due to accounting changes that the auditor general recommended, but the Liberals refused to make.

Despite numbers suggesting a slow pathway out of deficits, the Ford government has faced backlash for increasing class sizes and reducing the number of teachers.

It’s also calling for a review of federal transfers provided to Ontario as part of what the budget called an “overly complicated, broken system.” It said the province sends $12.9 billion more in tax dollars to Ottawa than it receives, and cited reports from the federal Parliamentary Budget Officer, who has found that Ottawa’s share of health care costs is steadily diminishing.

Hajdu noted health transfers have increased by 3 per cent under the federal Liberals, while labour market transfers providing funding for skills training have also risen.

“If they’re concerned about the health costs, they may want to think about things like increasing access to alcohol, while simultaneously cutting public health units from 35 to 10 across the province,” she said.

Toronto MP Adam Vaughan also accused Ford of cutting services by stealth in order to provide “political cover” for Scheer as October’s election nears.

“They’re going to be deep because they’re across the board, but we have no idea where they are right now and that limits the political impact [for Scheer],” he said in Ottawa.

“The leader of the Opposition pretends that he will not back down and he tries to make a show out of it,” Government House leader Bardish Chagger told the House of Commons on Monday. “We know that is false because while he is saying that, he has already been editing online statements or erasing them entirely.”

Scheer revealed Sunday that he’d received a letter from Trudeau’s lawyer, Julian Porter, serving notice of a possible libel suit over a statement issued on March 29, in which the Conservative leader accused Trudeau of leading a campaign to politically interfere with the criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin and directing his former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to break the law.

The notice is not an actual lawsuit, just a threat that one might come—a standard first step in a defamation claim. In the Commons on Monday, Scheer repeatedly taunted the Liberals to bring it on.

“Canadians are looking forward to the prime minister finally appearing under oath and testifying in a setting that he, himself, cannot control,” Scheer said, repeatedly asking the government to set a date for legal proceedings to begin.

Scheer denied having edited or deleted any posts on Twitter.

“No, I have not deleted tweets because I stand by everything I said in those statements,” he said.

But Chagger pointed to a tweet Scheer posted on March 31, the same day he received Porter’s letter. Originally, it referred to Trudeau telling “lies” about not knowing about a conversation the clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick, had with Wilson-Raybould on Dec. 19. The tweet was later deleted and a new one posted, she said, to replace the word “lies” with “falsehoods.”

Wilson-Raybould surreptitiously recorded that conversation with Wernick to bolster her contention that the top public servant had issued “veiled threats” that her job as justice minister and attorney general was at risk if she didn’t agree to intervene to stop the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya. Wernick’s lawyer said the clerk never relayed that conversation to Trudeau because everyone went on holiday the next day. When they returned in the new year, the lawyer said, they got consumed with planning a cabinet shuffle, in which Wilson-Raybould was moved to Veterans Affairs.

Chagger pointed to another tweet Scheer posted on Feb. 11, in which he asserted there is “potentially criminality at play in the Prime Minister’s Office.” That tweet was deleted, she said.

And she brought up a tweet Scheer deleted back in December after Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains served notice of a potential libel suit over the Conservative leader’s assertion that the minister was under RCMP investigation related to a land deal in Brampton.

“It is important that Canadians always know that we will not stand idly by while the Conservatives intentionally mislead Canadians,” Chagger said, adding that the Conservatives and their leader “have a history of making untrue and defamatory statements just for political gains.”

Scheer spokesman Brock Harrison said tweets such as the ones Chagger referred to “are deleted and reposted for a number of reasons, usually to correct typos or to better align the language between English and French.”

“However, contrary to what Ms. Chagger implied in question period, Mr. Trudeau’s threatened lawsuit has nothing to do with these tweets or any other tweets,” Harrison said.

In 2008, then Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper launched a libel suit against the Liberal party over allegations that he had known about an alleged attempt by Conservatives to bribe independent MP Chuck Cadman in exchange for his support in a key confidence vote in 2005.

The lawsuit made it difficult for then Liberal leader Stephane Dion to raise the issue during the 2008 election campaign. A few months after the election, which returned Harper’s Conservatives to power with a minority in Parliament, Harper settled the matter out of court with Dion’s successor, Michael Ignatieff.",Libs say lawsuit threat needed to stop Scheer’s ‘misinformation’ on SNC-Lavalin,plant.ca,https://www.plant.ca/general/libs-say-lawsuit-threat-needed-to-stop-scheers-misinformation-on-snc-lavalin-182732/

“While [Singh] is working, if he chooses to be a police officer, we would ask him to remove his turban while at work, yes,” Skeete told Solomon.

Singh would be just one of many people impacted by the secularism bill, which was introduced in Quebec’s National Assembly Thursday. The proposed legislation would prevent certain public sector employees from wearing overt religious symbols at work. The bill specifically mentions teachers, police and court clerks, among other people in positions of authority in public sector workplaces.

“We’re saying that when you come to work, when you exercise the power of the state, that you leave your religion at the door, and I don’t think that’s too much to ask in a secular society,” Skeete said.

“Of course, they can always wear their religious symbols when they’re finished work.”

The bill has come under fire from civil rights groups and groups representing religious minorities. While the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects freedoms of conscience, religious expression and the right to equality, the bill invokes the notwithstanding clause to override those charter rights.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who represents a Quebec riding in the House of Commons, also criticized the proposed legislation.

“I don't think a lot of people feel that in a free society we should be legitimizing discrimination of our citizens based on religion,"" he said, speaking with reporters in New Brunswick on Thursday.

Singh has addressed Bill 21 as well. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, he said “it’s something that’s going to hurt people.”

“I remember what it’s like to grow up and not feel like I belong, and I think about all the young people in Quebec right now that won’t be able to pursue, maybe, their dream job that won’t be able to become a police officer or a judge or a teacher -- and that, to me, is sad,” Singh said.

The Quebec government, however, has been defending its proposed legislation. They say they’re addressing something that has been a conversation in Quebec for 12 years -- and Skeete said Quebecers support the proposed law, even if advocacy groups warn it could tread on minority rights.

“Well we do live in a democracy, so you know, the majority often does determine the orientation that we take, but we always have to be careful when we make laws like this to make sure that we do respect minority rights,” he said.

Skeete emphasized that the legislation is all about balance.

“I think it’s just a question of how do we balance individual rights from collective rights and I realize that we’re on that line… but I do believe that ultimately it’s more important to have a truly secular state,” he said.

Skeete said the bill will undergo a consultation period where it will seek support from other parties and hear the concerns of affected groups. While he said the government is open to changing the bill, he said the changes would only take place “where we think it’s acceptable,” and “where it’s in line with what the population wants.”",Proposed secularism bill would force Singh to remove turban in public sector gig: Quebec MNA,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/proposed-secularism-bill-would-force-singh-to-remove-turban-in-public-sector-gig-quebec-mna-1.4358767

OTTAWA -- New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh has been sworn in as a member of Parliament.

The NDP says Singh becomes the first racialized party leader to sit in the House of Commons.

He won a byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South in February, taking roughly 39 per cent of the vote.

The win means Singh can finally go toe-to-toe in the House of Commons with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- something he hasn't been able to do since taking over the party reins from Tom Mulcair in October 2017.

In a statement, Singh says he will use his new position to pressure the Liberal government to take action on affordable housing and bringing down prescription drug costs.

He says as a kid, he never would have imagined being in this position.

""I would've never imagined that someone who looks like me could ever run to be prime minister,"" Singh said in a statement issued by the party on Sunday.

Singh said he is committed to building on late NDP leader Jack Layton's message of love, hope and optimism with courage.",NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh sworn in as member of Parliament for Burnaby South,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/ndp-leader-jagmeet-singh-sworn-in-as-member-of-parliament-for-burnaby-south-1.4340018

Singh intends to announce the policy proposal Friday during his keynote speech at the Broadbent Institute’s Progress Summit, an annual gathering of progressive thinkers and New Democrats near Parliament Hill.

In an interview with the Star on Thursday, Singh said he wants to increase the proportion of capital gains profits that are taxed by the federal government. This “inclusion rate” is currently set at 50 per cent — meaning only half the profits people make by selling property or securities investments is subject to income tax. The NDP wants to increase that rate to 75 per cent, which Singh said party researchers predict would bring an additional $2.7 billion in tax revenue to the federal government each year. Capital gains are profits made from selling real estate — other than your primary residence — and from the sale of other investments, like stocks or certain businesses, that aren’t held in registered retirement or tax-free savings accounts. “The vast, vast majority of people that use this benefit are the wealthiest, the richest people in Canada,” Singh said, contrasting the capital gains inclusion rate with how most people’s salaries are taxed.

“We want a fairer system.” Capital gains taxes have been around for decades, and the inclusion rate Singh wants to increase has been changed as well — most recently in 2000, when the Liberal government led by Jean Chrétien slashed it from 75 to 50 per cent. Singh would reverse that change.

Article Continued Below

There were several media reports ahead of the 2017 budget that saw business analysts warn that increasing the proportion of capital gains that gets taxed would deter investment and innovation in Canada. Singh dismissed such concerns on Thursday, arguing a 75 per cent rate still gives capital gains better tax treatment than employee income. He added that the change would bring in more money that an NDP government would use to extend public health care to cover prescription medicine, dental and eye care, as well to build affordable housing units and fund a transition to cleaner energy. “There’s got to be some fairness to pay for the things that people need,” he said. “This is one of the ways we can do it.” The proposal to increase the tax on capital gains follows an announcement last fall, when Singh touted a trio of policy changes to crack down on tax dodgers and prevent the wealthy from hiding their money. He said the NDP would make changes to prevent companies from moving money overseas to avoid corporate taxes, and ban special types of company shares — called bearer bonds — that don’t require disclosure of who owns them. Singh also called on the Liberal government to close the so-called stock option “loophole,” which allows corporate executives to avoid income taxes by receiving compensation in company shares instead of through regular paycheques. The Liberals banned the issuance of new bearer bonds in legislation last year, and the Trudeau government announced in the recent federal budget that it intends to cap stock compensation at $200,000 per year so high income earners no longer benefit disproportionately from the option. But Singh said he does not believe the Liberals will follow through on the stock option limit, contending Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has demonstrated he is beholden to business interests through the SNC-Lavalin controversy and by not moving faster to create a government pharmacare program for all Canadians. “The track record of this government now makes it clear that they’re not going to make changes that will help out everyday families,” Singh said. Friday’s policy announcement is part of a series that Singh and the NDP plan to make in the coming weeks. The party has said its entire 2019 election platform will be public before the end of spring.

The federal NDP leader pitched the plan Friday during a keynote speech to the annual Broadbent Institute's Progress Summit, which brings together progressives and New Democrats from across the country.

It is expected to form a key plank in the NDP's election platform this fall alongside other policy proposals the party says will target the rich, pay for more services for Canadians and cool the housing market.

""A fairer tax system means more funding for services that Canadians need like universal pharmacare, child care, affordable housing and post-secondary education,"" Singh said in a statement.

Watch: Singh calls out Quebec's secularism bill

While the government currently taxes 50 per cent of profits made on investments, known as capital gains, the NDP wants to increase that threshold — known as the ""inclusion rate"" — to 75 per cent.

The party estimates the move, which would also apply to the sale of most real estate but not primary residences, tax-free savings accounts or registered retirement plans, would generate nearly $3 billion in additional revenue for the federal treasury.

""When you go to work, you're taxed on almost all of your income,"" Singh said. ""It doesn't make sense that someone making their money from investments is taxed on only half.""

The inclusion rate for capital gains has fluctuated since it was introduced in 1972, when it was 50 per cent. It was raised several times in the intervening years to a high of 75 per cent, before Jean Chretien's government cut it to its current rate in 2000.

A hotly debated topic

The question of raising the inclusion rate on capital gains has been hotly debated for years, with some suggesting it would address inequality and others arguing it would hurt Canadians' savings and make the country less attractive for investors.

New Democrats have also previously talked about closing a stock-option loophole and cracking down on the use of bearer shares and foreign tax havens they say help the rich hide their wealth and avoid paying their fair share of taxes.

The government in its most recent budget moved to address the stock-option loophole by putting a $200,000-limit on the tax-deductible amount on employee stock options.

The stock-option deduction works by taxing only 50 per cent of the earnings an employee receives when they cash in any stock options received as part of their compensation packages, if certain conditions are met.

The new limit appears aimed at tightening the loophole while acknowledging concerns that closing it entirely would make it more difficult for companies to attract talent and discourage start-ups.",Singh: New Democrats Will Tax The Rich To Pay For Pharmacare,HuffPost Canada,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/03/29/jagmeet-singh-pharmacare_a_23702695/

Singh has developed a double-skewering narrative, calling Liberal indifference about economic anxiety a fuel for Conservative exclusion. He can’t let up on it.""

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh sees the opening. His challenge, before summer, is to climb through it and make it a three-way race.

The Trudeau Liberals dragged out the Burnaby South byelection, pinning the seatless NDP leader on the west coast as long as possible — at 164 days from seat vacancy to byelection vote, the longest a Prime Minister has ever blocked an opposition leader. Singh’s support eroded, dropping the NDP to about 13 per cent.

But Singh made opportunity from necessity, building Vancouver-area networks. Coming out of the byelection, his NDP has continuing BC support. Premier John Horgan’s popular NDP government helps.

With the byelection done, Singh quickly pivoted to Quebec. He appointed MP Alexandre Boulerice as his new deputy, boosted new Montreal candidate Nima Machouf (who holds a strong Quebec Solidaire connection), and met Premier François Legault.

And since winning, three recent polls — IPSOS, Angus Reid and Nanos — show a significant rebound. A Quebec recovery may be underway — while IPSOS still puts NDP’s Quebec support at 12 per cent, both Angus Reid and Nanos put it at 18. Angus Reid shows Singh’s NDP leading in the city of Vancouver. And nationally, NDP support is pegged at 21, 17 and 20 per cent, respectively.

Written off only weeks ago, Singh’s NDP is back in business. But no cork-popping: before summer Singh needs to hit the next level — 25 per cent — to say it’s a three-way race.

He has opportunities. The SNC-Lavalin scandal has set the Liberal house afire — and the burnline couldn’t be better for him. The scandal shows Trudeau Liberals doing just about anything to aid powerful corporate friends. And it exposes the pretense of Liberal identity politics — a clever play to use appropriated identities as cloaks over same-old Liberal politics.

Quebec political realignment may help. The Parti Quebecois, which took the Quebec left in a cultural-nationalist direction, is being edged out by Quebec Solidaire, which has helpful NDP policy overlaps. The QS, in a policy switch last weekend, will oppose the CAQ bill on religious symbols, arguing secularism is for institutions, not individuals. Now, on this sensitive issue, the federal NDP position is backed by a party inside the Quebec National Assembly — no longer a foreign intervention from outside Quebec’s cultural debates.

Climate change voters are an opportunity. Doing a bit more than climate do-nothings isn’t working. Canada, at the end of 2018, was further from carbon targets than in 2017. Canada needs a bold federal Green New Deal that partners with provinces to decarbonize. To make buildings more efficient. To shift to electricity-powered vehicles. To expand and operate transit. To end coal burning — still a mainstay in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia — and build clean energy production.

But Singh also faces challenges — particularly to gain ground on nominations and get supporters to open their wallets. First quarter fundraising results come soon. The past can’t be changed, but the second quarter needs to show bounce.

He needs more signature policies. He’s announced a plan to build 500,000 affordable housing units. He pledged to reverse a Liberal tax cut that lets the ultra-wealthy pay tax on only half their capital gains income — even from the largest fortunes. Monday he returned to pharmacare. Singh needs a full suite of actions focused on affordability.

He needs the key that unlocks Liberal Fortress Toronto. He knows what it looks like — trace the seats the Ontario NDP took last year in while winning the popular vote in Toronto and Brampton. To some, Toronto is a notoriously self-centred city of affluence. But in the 31 seats of Brampton and Toronto, all Liberal held, are millions of voters frustrated with low wages, high costs, bad transit and provincial cuts.

And Singh needs to prevent Trudeau and Scheer from polarizing a culture war. Singh has developed a double-skewering narrative, calling Liberal indifference about economic anxiety a fuel for Conservative exclusion. He can’t let up on it.

Singh’s got the opening. If by summer his NDP can climb to 25 per cent, then the game really is on.

Ottawa: On Thursday (April 4), the Leader of the NDP, Jagmeet Singh, and the NDP Public Safety Critic, Matthew Dubé, sent a letter to the Prime Minister regarding the 2018 Public Report on the Terrorism Threat to Canada that labelled the Sikh and Muslim communities as extremists.

The letter to Prime Minister Trudeau highlights concerns about the inappropriate labelling of the Sikh and Muslim communities in the report, in some circumstances without sufficient evidence.

The letter noted that the report has left Canadians with many questions and many concerns specifically regarding the fact that the report uses terms such as “Sikh”, “Shia”, and “Sunni” to label and equate entire communities to extremism.

“This report unfairly stigmatizes Muslim and Sikh communities, while failing to consider dangerous and unintended consequences. These consequences include the potential to place vulnerable communities and all Canadians at greater risk, by emboldening the harmful stereotypes that fuelled terrorist attacks in Christchurch, Quebec City and Oak Creek” said Singh. Adding that, “Political leaders must act with great care and responsibility, so their words are not used to exploit fear and fuel hatred – instead, they must promote solidarity and challenge hatred, whenever atrocities occur.”

Dubé added, “You have in us and in our caucus, a strong ally prepared to tackle extremism. It is of tantamount importance to us, however, that any approach avoids further divisions between groups, which in turn fuels hatred and in some circumstances violent acts.” Adding that, “There is nothing more important to us, than the safety and security of all Canadians.”

Jagmeet Singh and Canada’s New Democrats urged the Prime Minister and his Liberal government to remove the report from government websites until all promised changes regarding these labels and references to the Sikh, Shia and Sunni communities are made, or until a clear explanation including any evidence, where appropriate, is released.

Dubé introduced the motion after sending a letter to the Minister last December, which the Minister did not answer.

Dubé went on to state: “We’ve heard from communities that are named in this report that there is concern over what impact it can have.” He added: “It’s become pretty clear that there needs to be rethinking of how these groups are identified in these reports and a better understanding of the thought process behind the decisions.”",Jagmeet Singh writes to Trudeau about labeling Muslim and Sikh communities as terrorists,Voice Online,https://www.voiceonline.com/jagmeet-singh-writes-to-trudeau-about-labeling-muslim-and-sikh-communities-as-terrorists/

On Sunday he began campaigning with NDP leader Jagmeet Singh at his side. Dean Stoltz reports.

Bob Chamberlin is well-known locally, but it didn’t hurt to have NDP leader Jagmeet Singh at his side for day one of his campaign in the Nanaimo-Ladysmith by-election.

“Now we have Bob Chamberlin as our next candidate who will be the next MP in this riding, that’s a hugely exciting thing,” Singh told supporters Sunday outside Chamberlin’s new Nanaimo campaign office.

Chamberlin has a long history of First Nations leadership in B.C. as chief councilor of the Kwikwasut’inuxw Haxwa’mis First Nation based on Gilford Island, and Vice-President of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs.

But eight weeks ago Chamberlin decided now is the right time to enter federal politics.

“The work that I’ve done on this coast to protect this beautiful coastline that we all enjoy is hand and glove with the issues that I’ve heard so far here in Nanaimo,” Chamberlin said.

Chamberlin was nominated Saturday as the NDP candidate, and Singh today, sang his praises.

“What Bob brings is an incredible wealth of leadership experience,” said Singh.

“He’s got the ability to be a strong advocate, someone who’s willing to stand up for the community with what the community needs and someone who’s an effective communicator.”

The NDP has 13 federal seats in BC and badly wants to re-capture Nanaimo-Ladysmith after Sheila Malcolmson resigned to run provincially in February.

It’s been NDP since 2004, (Nanaimo-Cowichan) and the party will try to capitalize on the Trudeau Liberal’s infighting over the SNC Lavalin affair.

“What we have now is an opportunity to ensure that a strong party, the NDP party is represented by as many Members of Parliament as possible to ensure that the average Canadian’s needs are spoken to so we don’t see governments that have the ease and think that it’s ok to mix politics with justice and cut political favours or legal favours for political friends,” added Chamberlin.

OTTAWA – While the richest use loopholes to evade their taxes, regular people are paying the price. In a keynote speech at Broadbent Institute's Progress Summit, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh made an announcement that unlike Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, the NDP will have the courage to address our unfair tax system that is preventing Canadians from getting the public services they need.

“For far too long, people have been working hard to make ends meet, and they just want things to be a little easier. When you go to work, you’re taxed on almost all of your income. It doesn’t make sense that someone making their money from investments is taxed on only half,” said Singh. “Trudeau’s Liberals have refused to limit the capital gains tax benefit for the wealthiest. This is hurting hard-working Canadians who are forced to pay the price.”

To make our tax system fairer, Jagmeet Singh and the NDP will increase the capital gains inclusion rate from the current 50 to 75%. This plan will bring in almost $3 billion more in government revenue every year to fund the services Canadians need, like childcare, education, and housing. New Democrats are committed to a fairer and more progressive tax system and will get rid of tax loopholes for the wealthiest, by increasing taxes on investment profits and by getting tough on tax evasion.

As it stands, 88% of the capital gains tax benefit goes to the 1%. Under the Liberal tax plan, people earning less than $45,000 get nothing – and that’s the majority of Canadians. Meanwhile, those earning over three times that salary receive much higher tax cuts. This is unfair for people who are trying to build a better future for their families.

“A fairer tax system means more funding for services that Canadians need like universal pharmacare, childcare, affordable housing and post-secondary education,” added Singh. “Everybody wins when we deliver better services that Canadians can rely on. New Democrats have the courage to bring in a fairer tax system that will help people build a better future.”",Singh: Let's Help People by Bringing in a Fairer Tax System,New Democratic Party,https://www.ndp.ca/news/singh-lets-help-people-bringing-fairer-tax-system

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced details of the pharmacare plan today with health critic Don Davies at an event in Coquitlam.

article continues below

The party says the plan would see every Canadian covered for a list of prescription drugs determined by an arms-length group of experts that it says would be protected from industry and political pressure.

The party says the plan would save families who don't currently have private drug coverage an average $550 per year and it would save employers about $600 per employee with extended health benefits.

The legislation would be modeled on the Canada Health Act and provide an annual pharmacare transfer to the provinces and territories, with provinces paying about 60 per cent of the total cost and the federal government providing the remaining 40 per cent.

Davies, who represents Vancouver Kingsway, says the cost to provinces will be about the same as they are paying now.

An analysis from the parliamentary budget officer says the total cost of a national pharmacare program would be $23.7 billion in 2020, representing a $4.2 billion savings each year over the current amount being spent on drugs in Canada.

Last week, Singh said an NDP government would expand the tax on investment profits as part of a package of measures aimed to pay for pharmacare, affordable child care and housing.

""Those measures would free up billions that would be available for this as well. The rest of financing would be a matter of discussion between the federal government and provinces and territories,"" Davies said.

The federal government taxes 50 per cent of profits made on investments, also known as capital gains, but the NDP wants to increase that threshold — known as the inclusion rate — to 75 per cent. It says that would raise about $3 billion in revenue.

The New Democrats have also talked about closing a stock-option loophole and cracking down on the use of bearer shares and foreign tax havens, which they say help the rich avoid paying their fair share of taxes to society.

In its budget last month, the Liberal government said Canada's patchwork of drug coverage, which comprises more than 100 public programs and 100,000 private insurance plans, is not well equipped to handle the increasingly expensive drugs now coming to market.

The 40-year-old former Ontario legislator has lacked a voice in Parliament since becoming party leader in the fall of 2017. Now he finally has his chance in Burnaby South as voters in the riding cast their ballots on Monday after a six-week race.

The Liberals got off to a rocky start when their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh’s ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Singh said he’s not taking anything for granted but he’s confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off.

“I think people are very disappointed with what’s going on with the Liberal government,” he said.

“Canadians expect our government works in our interest. It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation.”

Trudeau has denied he or his office directed Wilson-Raybould on the matter. Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, recently said Trudeau repeatedly assured Wilson-Raybould a decision on the prosecution was hers alone to make.

Richard T. Lee, the Liberal candidate who replaced Wang in Burnaby South, said few people are raising the issue on the doorstep.

“I understand some people are concerned about that, but the office of the prime minister and the prime minister himself have made a statement already,” he said.

Byelections typically have low turnouts, but there is evidence the results of them are driven by the popularity of the government and its leader, said Richard Johnston, a University of British Columbia political science professor.

“(Singh) may have been handed the gift of some voters as a result of all this,” he said. “Although it’s just one thing amongst many, boy, he could use a win right now.”

Singh has faced criticism for poor fundraising and low poll numbers. Burnaby South occupies historically strong NDP territory, so if Singh can’t win in the riding, it adds to the interpretation that he hasn’t secured the support of party loyalists, said Johnston.

The NDP beat the Liberals by just over 500 votes in the riding in 2015, but Johnston said he never expected the Liberals to do as well this time in Burnaby South.

“That was kind of a high point and their support might drop even further,” he said.

Lee said local issues, especially affordable housing, are more important to Burnaby South voters than the situation in Ottawa.

He has touted the Liberal government’s national housing strategy, which promises $40 billion over 10 years, while Conservative candidate Jay Shin has called for lower taxes and job-creation measures to help residents earn and save more money.

Singh has unveiled a plan to build 500,000 affordable homes across Canada. He challenged Trudeau to eliminate the GST for developers building affordable homes, subsidize low-income renters and double the first-time homebuyers’ tax credit.

Byelections will also take place in York-Simcoe in Ontario and Outremont in Montreal on Monday. The results might provide insight into whether Quebec MP Maxime Bernier’s new right-wing People’s Party of Canada can snatch votes from the Conservatives.

A recent debate in Burnaby South became heated when People’s Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson discussed immigration.

An online video of the debate shows Singh urging audience members to recognize they are all immigrants, unless they are Indigenous.

When Tyler Thompson raises the murder of Burnaby teen Marrisa Shen — in which a Syrian national has been charged — to argue for more careful vetting of refugees, an audience member yells: “That is racist! Shame on you!”

“It’s not racist to have safety,” replies Tyler Thompson.

Shin, the Conservative candidate, recently distributed flyers taking aim at Tyler Thompson, accusing her of supporting supervised injection sites and the legalization of marijuana, which she described as a “smear campaign” based on “lies.”

However, Shin said he isn’t worried about Tyler Thompson and doesn’t think her message is resonating.

“When I speak with voters at the doors, I don’t get a sense of that at all,” he said.

Tyler Thompson, a former Christian TV show host who opposes abortion and has protested teaching resources that educate kids about gay and transgender identities, said she believes the Conservatives are threatened by the People’s Party.

We’re can save families money and get better coverage for everyone. Here’s how.

Too many people in Quebec are having to make impossible choices every day – seniors are cutting their pills in half in order to make them last, and families are being forced to choose between paying rent on time or filling their prescriptions.

The cost of deductibles and copays can make it hard to make ends meet.

Trudeau’s Liberal government wants a patchwork plan that works for their friends at the big pharmaceutical and insurance companies – but won’t do anything to help Quebec strengthen it’s groundbreaking pharmacare program.

With Quebec paying the highest drug prices in the country, and 32% of Quebecers reporting they pay more than $500 a year for prescriptions, it’s clear we need leaders who will be allies in helping Quebec lower costs and improve pharmacare.

That’s why I was so excited to announce our plan that will save Quebecers with insurance $550 a year on average.

Our plan will let you use your health card instead of your credit card, and save Quebec billions every year.

I’m hoping you’ll join our NDP team as we fight for public, universal, comprehensive Pharmacare for all. You can find out more about our plan and share your story here.

He won the seat won with 38.8% of the vote over Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee who managed 26.1% of the vote, with 96% of polls counted.

It was a crucial election for Singh because until now, he has been without a seat in the House of Commons.

Publisher Simon & Schuster says the book follows Singh, who is Sikh, from childhood as he learns lessons about overcoming adversity and the impact of not belonging.

Rather than a political memoir, it’s being billed as a story about “how strengthening the connection between us all is the way to build a better world.”

The title alludes to Singh’s oft-invoked call for “love and courage,” which he deployed in a viral response to a heckler at a 2017 NDP leadership campaign event.

After taking the reins of the federal party, Singh earned a seat in the House of Commons in a byelection last month.

His sights are now set on the post of prime minister as Canadians prepare to vote in this fall’s federal election.

“This book is the story of my family and my personal experiences growing up — sometimes difficult ones. I often felt alone, unworthy, ashamed,” Singh said in a statement.

“I hope this book helps some people feel less alone and know that they deserve love and happiness, no matter what they’ve gone through.”

The NDP’s standard bearer in the riding will be selected on Saturday.

The byelection already features an interesting cast of characters, including a jilted Conservative who lost a bid for her party’s candidacy and jumped to Maxime Bernier’s Peoples Party of Canada (PPC); a Green candidate who had a falling out with the NDP ahead of the last federal election; and a Liberal Indigenous candidate with as big a profile as Jody Wilson-Raybould when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recruited her for the Liberals in 2015.

Singh, who took a seat in the House of Commons for the first time last week after winning his own byelection in the greater Vancouver riding of Burnaby South last month, will greet the NDP candidate in Nanaimo on Sunday, his office told iPolitics.

A roster of four NDP candidates suggests the New Democrat’s confidence in the riding, despite a late entry into the race and a hike in Green Party support in the past years. Prime Minister Trudeau announced the byelection on March 24.

A day after Trudeau set the byelection date, he surfaced in Nanaimo to circulate and draw attention to a star Liberal candidate, who the party had announced only a week earlier. That candidate, Michelle Corfield, is a prominent and highly successful Indigenous leader who holds a doctorate from Simon Fraser University’s Beedie School of Business.

Corfield is also chair of the Nanaimo Port Authority, chair of the Legislative Council of Ucluelet First Nation and a founding member of a settlement trust at Ucluelet First Nation on the western coast of Vancouver Island. Corfield is an executive resident at the Beedie School’s Indigenous Business and Economic Development Knowledge Exchange.

Despite the credentials of his party’s candidate, or perhaps to ensure Corfield was the one in the limelight during an ongoing confrontation between Trudeau and one of his star 2015 candidates, Vancouver Liberal MP and former justice minister Wilson-Raybould, Trudeau declined to take questions from local news media.

Even with as prominent a candidate as Corfield, the Liberal party faces an uphill battle toward May 6.

Vancouver Island resisted the Liberal wave of 2015, voting in New Democrats in six of the island’s seven federal electoral districts. The seventh, Saanich—Gulf Islands, was won by Green Party Leader Elizabeth May for her second term in the House of Commons.

The contests were close and Angus Reid Institute’s polling analyst Shachi Kurl notes that Vancouver Island has been a tug-of-war between New Democrats and Conservatives over the past years.

“The island has a tendency to swing orange or blue,” Kurl said in a phone interview from her Vancouver office.

Nanaimo News Bulletin reporter Nicholas Pescod says he expects the NDP will continue to hold Nanaimo—Ladysmith. “I suspect the NDP will do well,” he said in a telephone interview from the News Bulletin newsroom.

Kurl noted low-turnout byelections can hinge on local organization, for which the NDP is famous in B.C.

Nanaimo—Ladysmith was left vacant after popular former NDP MP Sheila Malcolmson, announced last fall that she was making the jump to provincial politics. She resigned her Commons seat on Jan. 2 to contest and win a byelection in the provincial electoral district of Nanaimo. That Jan. 30 byelection was crucial for the survival of the province’s NDP coalition government.

For the May 6 federal byelection, the NDP field of four candidates also includes a prominent Indigenous candidate, Bob Chamberlin, who is vice-president of the long-established Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and chief councillor with the Kwikwasutinuxw Haxwa’mis First Nation at the north end of Vancouver Island.

The other three NDP hopefuls include Lauren Sample, a former constituency assistant to Malcolmson, a past president of Nanaimo Pride, and a women’s rights advocate; Maeve O’Byrne, a founder of the Nanaimo and District Hospital Foundation who coaches volunteers working in refugee camps; and Fred Statham, whose electoral experience includes two attempts at election to Nanaimo city council.

The nominated field for other parties is just as unique.

The Green Party and Conservative candidates launched their nomination bids last fall, after Malcolmson announced she would not seek re-election federally.

Green candidate Paul Manly, who came third against Malcolmson in 2015, was acclaimed as the Green candidate on Feb. 3, after launching his nomination campaign last Oct. 25. According to commenters on a Reddit forum and other media, Manly tried to contest the NDP riding’s general election nomination in 2015, but claimed later his candidacy was rejected because he protested Israel’s treatment of his father, former NDP MP Jim Manley, who was arrested after taking part in an attempt to breach Israel’s 2012 sea blockade of the Gaza Strip.

The nominated Conservative candidate for the byelection, Sun Life office manager John Hirst, won his nomination on Nov. 17 last year. His opponent for the Tory nomination, Jennifer Clarke, was picked up to run for the PPC.

For politicians eager to tap into an electorally powerful ethnic group, the huge version of Khalsa Day in Surrey, B.C., is a veritable gold mine.

But barring a significant change of tune by the federal government over the next week, this year’s edition will impose an unprecedented policy. Unless certain demands are met, Liberal MPs will be barred from speaking from its stages on April 20, says organizer Moninder Singh.

“We’ve never had to take steps like this,” said the B.C. Gurdwara Council spokesman. “But we can’t be giving platforms where half a million people are out walking around, when we don’t see a genuine relationship being formed with the community.”

The threatened ban was over an issue causing growing consternation in the Sikh community: an annual Public Safety Canada report on terrorism that for the first time this December contained a small section on the alleged threat of Sikh extremism.

Community activists insist that violent support for the independence of Sikh-dominated Punjab state from India ended in the years after the 1985 Air India bombing, Canada’s worst-ever terror act — and call the report a smear job.

Critics see the hidden hand of India, allegedly manipulating Canada to malign a diaspora fixated on Punjab separation. The government says that’s hogwash, while others warn against politicians meddling in a report penned by independent security agencies. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale has apologized for language that he says inadvertently disparaged Sikhs.

Regardless, community activists say the issue could have major implications for Canadian politics, setting off a potentially seismic shift in a minority group with wildly disproportionate political muscle.

At stake are nine Sikh-dominated ridings – in the Toronto-area suburbs, Calgary and lower-mainland B.C. — all of which went Liberal in the 2015 election, many flipping from the Conservatives.

Another eight, mostly Liberal seats across the country could be decided by the Sikh vote if the races are “competitive,” says Jaskaran Singh Sandhu, executive director of the World Sikh Organization (WSO), while 18 more are susceptible to Sikh influence if particularly close.

“Nine seats make or break their (Liberal) majority,” said Sandhu. “Sikhs can decide that.”

There are already signs of trouble for the party: a slate of candidates tied to the fathers of two Liberal MPs was roundly defeated in a recent election for the board of North America’s largest Sikh temple. The winners contend Ottawa’s terror report was a factor; the losers say it was just about religion.

About 400 people crowded into a round-table meeting on the issue in Brampton, Ont., Sunday, grilling the lone Liberal MP — Ruby Sahota — who attended.

And more Khalsa Day parades and gurdwaras — Sikh temples — are considering bans of their own on Liberal politicians speaking if the report is not changed, said B.C.’s Singh.

Other Sikhs, though, question whether there is a movement afoot, or just some very vocal leaders concerned about a niche matter.

“My sense is that it is a dead issue,“ says Ujjal Dosanjh, a former Liberal cabinet minister who has long crossed swords with the Punjabi separatist — or Khalistani — movement.

Shinder Purewal, both a political scientist at B.C.’s Kwantlen Polytechnic University and now a Conservative federal candidate, believes the south Asian community generally is souring on the Liberals, and shares others’ misgivings about the terror report. But he doesn’t expect it to play a big role in the Oct. 21 election.

“I don’t think that is one of the burning issues,” Purewal said. “People have the impression that immigrant communities have a separate agenda from other Canadians. They don’t. They care about the same issues.”

No one can question, though, that the Sikh community has some considerable political weight to throw around.

Recent elections have produced 18 Sikh MPs, including four cabinet ministers and a party leader. All from a minority community of 500,000 — barely one per cent of Canada’s population.

Canadians of Hindu Indian descent actually outnumber them, but Hindus and other south-Asian subgroups have not had the same influence politically.

That out-sized activism and clout stems partly from Sikh Canadians’ concentration in a relatively few ridings. But there may be another, more philosophical explanation, too. The religion melds the spiritual and secular in a way that encourages political service as an extension of the community-giving expected of followers, argues Sandhu.

Purewal says such an intersection of godly and earthly is common in many religions, and suggests that Sikh history — including a need to repulse a succession of invaders who targeted the Punjab — may be a better explanation for high levels of political engagement.

Whatever their reasons for getting involved, Sikhs have traditionally voted Liberal, the party they see as generally more friendly to immigrants and immigration, said Singh, though he adds they are becoming more discriminating. Purewal says the wave of Sikh support for Liberals in 2015 was largely a reaction to the Conservatives’ legislation stripping citizenship from dual citizens convicted of terrorism.

Regardless, the terror report in December was, for some Sikh leaders at least, a rude awakening after a spate of political victories.

“We thought we’d finally arrived,” Balpreet Singh, legal counsel for the World Sikh Organization, told Sunday’s town hall. “(But) what we’ve seen in the last year has been a wound to the Sikh community we haven’t seen in decades.”

The complaints centre around the document’s reference to “Sikh (Khalistani) extremism” — seen as defaming an entire, peaceful community rather than singling out a specific entity — and the lack of any evidence to support the claim of present danger. The report mentions the Air India bombing 33 years ago and two terror groups critics say have long been inactive.

Singh believes the passage stems from a counter-terrorism co-operation agreement signed between Canadian and Indian national-security czars last year, as well as the government’s desire to improve fractured relations with New Delhi.

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh suggested the report is having a “massive” effect on Sikh politics, and warned it could spark hate crimes.

“This is the type of report by the government … that is going to result in people saying, ‘Well, if Sikhs are terrorists, then maybe we should take action,’ ” he told the town hall. “That is deeply offensive.”

Conservative Garnett Genuis, though an MP from Alberta, also attended the Brampton meeting and earned generous applause when he defended the right to peacefully advocate for Punjab independence.

Sahota voiced her own concerns about the report’s language, and the lack of clarity on why Khalistanis were suddenly included after years of silence. But in a spirited defence of her government, she stressed the document was the product of independent security services, not the party.

“We can’t take it to a point where we are politically interfering with our intelligence agencies,” the Brampton North MP said. “This didn’t wind up in there by accident … Obviously there is a reason.”

Goodale has said future iterations would not reference Sikh extremism but only “extremists who support violent means to establish an independent state within India.” He has not, though, disavowed the issue’s inclusion in the report.

Asked about the lack of backup evidence, a spokesman for the minister said: “Intelligence can precede criminal charges or other law enforcement action that would result in further public disclosure.”

Meanwhile, Dosanjh says he’s appalled by the Liberal MPs of Sikh background who publicly talk down the report’s Khalistani section.

“It’s horrifying to see,” he said. “Politicians have to rise above pandering and look to the national interest.”

Organizers of the Surrey Khalsa view things rather differently. They say the government must commit to re-issuing December’s report without the mention of Sikhs as a menace — or forget about politicking at the April 20 parade.

This being 2019, opponents of the report have made their demand clear, in a Twitter slogan: #ProveitorRemoveit .

But there has been a bipartisan pile-on over Ottawa’s move to give the Loblaw supermarket chain – part of the multibillion-dollar George Weston food empire – $12-million to buy new energy efficient refrigerators.

Never mind that the money represents a small outlay from Ottawa’s $2-billion Low Carbon Economy Fund.

From tree huggers to climate-change deniers, the subsidy has struck a nerve on social media. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh questioned why the government would give handouts to “rich corporations” that can’t seem to pay many of their employees a living wage. Conservative MP Michelle Rempel contrasted Loblaw’s windfall to the plight of a small Manitoba grocery-store owner who can’t afford to replace a broken fridge.

Many people pointed out that Loblaw is particularly undeserving, given its involvement in a long-running bread price-fixing scheme and last year’s court finding that it owes the feds nearly $400-million in taxes from an offshore banking subsidiary.

Behind all the outrage, Canadians may be missing some important lessons about how best to curb carbon emissions.

There is nothing inherently wrong about giving money to Loblaw, whose chairman Galen Weston is among the richest Canadians. Mr. Weston’s wealth is largely irrelevant.

The problem is that it may not be the best way to encourage climate-friendly behaviour.

“Subsidies have a general problem: You may be paying a lot of money to get people to do things they would do anyway,” says McGill University economist Christopher Ragan, chairman of Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission.

As a result, subsidies are a very expensive way to curb greenhouse gas emissions, compared with putting a price on carbon, which the federal government is also doing.

“A higher price would encourage Loblaw to swap out its refrigerators for more efficient ones,” Mr. Ragan explained. “That’s how a carbon tax works. It encourages people to use energy more efficiently, no matter what.”

Loblaw must replace its refrigeration equipment every few years anyway. The prospect of a lower electricity bill is a strong driver to use the most efficient technology available. And that signal grows more powerful as the price of energy rises.

The downside of any subsidy – to consumers or businesses – is that the money may be wasted. It’s very difficult for governments to determine exactly how much of a financial incentive is needed to change people’s behaviour. The tipping point may be different for Loblaw than for the owner of a small grocery store.

The same flaw is inherent in other “green” subsidies, such as the large rebates offered by some provinces on luxury electric vehicles. Most of the eligible models are beyond what average Canadians can afford. Rich Uncle Pennybags doesn’t need our collective help to buy that Tesla Roadster he was going to get anyway.

The optics of giving money to large, profitable companies isn’t good, but it can be a useful tool in the government’s broader “carrot-and-stick” plan to reduce emissions, argues Isabelle Turcotte, national policy director at the Pembina Institute. She says subsidies can also provide intangible benefits, such as creating a new market in Canada for low-emission refrigeration technology.

“Loblaw is such a powerful first purchaser,” Ms. Turcotte says.

Another way to curb emissions is through regulation. But by simply capping emissions, companies may have little incentive to innovate and to do better than the rules require.

Shifting away from coal – the most carbon-intensive fuel – should be the top priority. And pricing discourages consumption of the most carbon-intensive energy sources on a sliding scale – from coal to oil, and from oil to natural gas, and eventually from fossil fuels to renewables.

Ottawa, however, seems content with a scatter-gun approach to saving the planet.

“We need to take action across the board,” Environment Minister Catherine McKenna insisted this week as she defended giving money to the grocery chain. “Everyone has to be reducing their emissions.”

That may be true. But giving money to companies such as Loblaw could prove to be a costly – and unpopular – way to get there.

The predicament for the government is that carbon pricing, while highly effective, could prove to be even less popular.","Yes, Galen Weston is rich, but that’s not why we shouldn’t be giving him money",The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-yes-galen-weston-is-rich-but-thats-not-why-we-shouldnt-be-giving/

Arun Tyagi, a property dealer and resident of Dundahera ...","New Delhi, April 6 (IANS) It was once known as the badlands on the eastern fringes of the national where only the brave stirred after dark. Then came roads, industries, a railway junction, educational institutes, shopping complexes, Metro connectivity and even condominiums, so much so that it has become the preferred residential destination of Noida’s young upwardly mobile brigade.

Along the way, it has become a high profile parliamentary constituency – being represented by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Minister of State for External Affairs V.K. Singh.

In fact, according to a survey conducted by the City Mayors Foundation, a global think tank on urban affairs, Ghaziabad is the second fastest growing city in the world.

Unlike its sister constituency Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad has a distinctly urban sheen. Of the total 27.26 lakh registered voters in the Lok Sabha seat, the metropolitan assembly constituencies of Sahibabad and Ghaziabad together account for 51 per cent of votes.

It’s a tougher battle for votes in the rural pocket. The rural part of the Ghaziabad Lok Sabha seat – comprising Loni, Dhaulana (partial) and Muradnagar assembly constituencies – accounts for only 32 per cent of the voters.

As per the 2011 Census, the constituency has 25.34 per cent Muslims, 72.93 per cent Hindus and 16.5 per cent people from the Scheduled Castes. Unofficial caste estimates put Gujjars at 11.2 per cent of the total population, Vyasas 9.6 per cent, Rajputs 8.6 per cent, Tyagis 8.22 per cent, Brahmins 4.6 per cent and Yadavs 2 per cent.

To this extent, although General V. K. Singh won the 2014 Lok Sabha polls with a margin of more than over 5 lakh votes – the second highest after Prime Minister Narendra Modi – retaining the Ghaziabad constituency will have to depend on a lot more than the euphoria generated by his political plunge immediately after stepping down as the Indian Army chief.

A major factor in the election is the resentment of the local MLAs at not being given a shot at the seat.

Singh is facing a tough challenge from Samajwadi Party (SP) candidate Suresh Bansal, a former Ghaziabad MLA who had fought the 2017 assembly election on a BSP ticket but lost to the BJP’s Atul Garg.

In 2017 Assembly polls, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had won all the five Assembly segments of this parliamentary constituency and many of the MLAs were contenders for a Lok Sabha ticket.

In 2009, the BJP had fielded Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and he won. He became the first Lok Sabha MP from Ghaziabad after the constituency came into existence in 2008 as part of the delimitation process.

Singh had defeated the Congress party’s Surendra Prakash Goyal by a margin of 90,681 votes at a time when there were 16 candidates in the fray.

In last Lok Sabha polls, the BJP again denied a ticket to any of the locals and fielded V.K. Singh. Gaining from the Modi wave, the former General bagged the seat in 2014 with a record margin and later became a minister in the Modi government.

Singh, who filed his nomination papers on Monday, had announced that he will focus on development of his constituency but locals said he was busy in urban areas and could not focus on rural areas.

“The General will win for sure. But the people in the villages are not happy with him because he kept his focus on urban areas,” Nitesh a resident of Loni, said.

Rahul Chouhan, a resident of Crossing Republik, said that the General will secure victory because the BJP has a huge following in the constituency, but the fight will be tough because SP’s Bansal has the support of both the SP and the BSP supporters.

“Bansal’s selection is really a good choice of alliance parties and he would undoubtedly give a fight to the BJP,” Chouhan said.

Arun Tyagi, a property dealer and resident of Dundahera, told IANS that the BJP’s inner clash against outsider candidates may shrink its vote bank but there is no doubt about the party’s victory.

“V.K. Singh’s margin of vote is going to shrink this time because there is the issue of local and outsider candidate. The five MLAs of the BJP were waiting that the party would select one of them for the seat as they are the hard working candidates of the party.

“But the renomination of the General really has affected their blind faith in the party which is being seen on the ground. The issue is not new for this constituency,” Tyagi said.

Arpit Sirohi, who runs a medical shop in Raj Nagar, agreed.

“BJP will win from the seat but his vote margin will go down as Sharma of the Congress will cut its Brahmin votes and help Bansal,” Sirohi said.

Bansal, on the other hand, is from the Vaishya community and has a good hold in the business community, he added.

Meanwhile, his party colleagues ...","1 of 3 2 of 3

March 25 will go down as another dreadful day in the history of the world’s so-called largest democracy.

After all, an Indian court refused to give bail to a well-known human rights defender—Delhi University Professor G.N. Saibaba—who is being incarcerated under inhuman conditions despite being 90 percent disabled below the waist.

Saibaba was convicted and sentenced to life in prison after being accused of being a sympathizer of Maoist insurgents who are fighting a class war in the tribal areas of India.

He had been raising his voice against the repression of Indigenous peoples who are being forcibly evicted by big mining companies. These corporations are eyeing these people's traditional lands to extract rich minerals without their informed consent, yet with the backing of the Indian state.

The police have become a ready tool in the hands of these companies and frequently target any voice of resistance. Often, state repression forces Indigenous peoples to join the Maoist ranks to escape police brutality.

Since Saibaba was instrumental in mobilizing public opinion against the exploitation of tribal communities, he was arrested in 2014 after being branded as a Maoist sympathizer. He was given his life sentence in March, 2017 under the country's draconian laws.

Recently, his family applied for bail plea on medical grounds for the wheelchair-dependent Saibaba, who has suffered from 19 ailments.

Because he's paralyzed from the waist down, Prof. Saibaba relies on a wheelchair for his mobility. Gurpreet Singh

However, a court in Nagpur not only rejected his bail application, but refused to show any leniency, stating that he is ""mentally fit"" and is working as a ""think tank for Maoists"".

This is nothing but defiance to international bodies, such as the United Nations, whose experts have called for his immediate release on compassionate grounds. Last year, UN rights experts urged the New Delhi government to let him of jail in the light of his deteriorating health.

Now, contrast this with the Indian Supreme Court’s decision to grant freedom to a mass murderer on medical grounds.

About two weeks before Saibaba’s bail plea was rejected, the apex court in India granted bail to Babu Bajrangi—a Hindu extremist who convicted of being involved in the anti-Muslim pogrom of 2002 in Gujarat.

Thousands of Muslims were slaughtered in the state following the burning of a train carrying Hindu pilgrims.

More than 50 people died in the initial incident, which was blamed on Muslims by the ruling right-wing Hindu nationalist Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP).

Back in 2002, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was chief minister of Gujarat when the violence broke out. Though he was never charged, human rights activists and survivors of the violence believe he was complicit in the crime—an allegation he has consistently denied.

It is pertinent to mention that ever since Modi became prime minister in 2014, attacks on religious minorities and political dissidents have grown. Saibaba has also been critical of Hindu chauvinism.

Babu Bajrangi was a foot soldier of the Hindu right. He confessed his involvement in a media sting operation and was given life sentence for the crime. And yet, on March 7, the Indian Supreme Court granted him bail, citing his major bypass surgery and other medical conditions.

Video of The Truth: Gujarat 2002: Babu Bajrangi In 2007, the Indian magazine Tehelka used a hidden camera to capture Babu Bajrangi talking about the killing of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002.

The Saibaba case is not only a national shame for India where mass murderers like Babu Bajrangi continue to enjoy state patronage under the BJP government. It is also a matter of shame for countries like Canada that remain indifferent to such an important issue.

This is despite the fact that more than 1,000 people signed a petition concerning Saibaba, which was drafted by lawyer and human rights activist Amandeep Singh on behalf of Radical Desi Publications Ltd.

Singh is the former New Democratic Party candidate in Richmond-Queensborough.

The petition, which asks the Canadian government to intervene, was submitted to the Canadian House of Commons by two MPs, Sukh Dhaliwal and Peter Julian. But the Canadian government has refused to step in.

New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh issued a statement on social media in the past expressing his concern over the deteriorating health condition of Saibaba.

Meanwhile, his party colleagues, including former MP and strong human rights advocate Svend Robinson, have also spoken out for Saibaba in light of recent decision of Nagpur High Court.

Other groups that have come forward to raise their voice for Saibaba in Canada include the International League of People's Struggles, South Asian Network for Secularism and Democracy, East Indian Defence Committee, and the B.C. Federation of Labour. In addition, members of Alliance Against Displacement, the residents of seniors' home run by Progressive Inter Cultural Community Services in Surrey, Sikh Nation, and the World Sikh Organization have spoken out.

The Sikh community supported the cause by enthusiastically signing the petition at two Vaisakhi parades in Greater Vancouver in 2017. Members of Gurdwara Dashmesh Darbar and Sukh Sagar Sikh temple in New Westminster have also vehemently come out in favour of Saibaba's release.

On April 3, University of British Columbia students are going to organize “A Night of Awareness for G.N. Saibaba” at 6 p.m. at the Institute of Asian Research (1855 West Mall, Point Grey campus). It's an open event and anyone can attend.

Considering the sentiments of people who are concerned with the situation of Saibaba, the Canadian government that claims to be a human rights leader in the world needs to break its silence over growing repression in India.

It must stand up for Saibaba and others like him who are being punished for merely fighting for a just society.","Gurpreet Singh: Shame on Indian state for persecuting disabled, harmless scholar while patronizing mass killers",The Georgia Straight,https://www.straight.com/news/1221616/gurpreet-singh-shame-indian-state-persecuting-disabled-harmless-scholar-while

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced details of the pharmacare plan Monday with health critic Don Davies at an event in Coquitlam, B.C.

""This is a bold plan, it's going to take some courage. It's going to take us standing up to pharmaceutical industries and insurance companies who don't want us to bring this plan in, but we know this plan will work,"" Singh said.

The plan would see every Canadian covered for a list of prescription drugs determined by an arm's-length group of experts that it said would be protected from industry and political pressure. The agency would evaluate drugs for coverage based on what is scientifically proven to be safe and effective, and on the best value for money, the party said.

It would save families who don't currently have private drug coverage an average $550 per year and it would save employers about $600 per employee with extended health benefits, the party said.

Medications covered under the formulary would always have at least one option involving no upfront cost, in a move intended to nearly eliminate the co-payment system that the party said is a barrier to access. If there is a generic drug available but an individual chooses a brand name instead, there would be a $5 co-payment with exemptions for vulnerable populations.

It's time to make medication available to all Canadians who need it, Singh said.

""We can't afford not to do this at this point, given how difficult it is for so many people to get the medication they need,"" he said.

The legislation would be modeled on the Canada Health Act and provide an annual pharmacare transfer to the provinces and territories, with provinces paying about 60 per cent of the total cost and the federal government providing the remaining 40 per cent.

Davies, who represents Vancouver Kingsway, said the cost to provinces will be about the same as they are paying now.

It would cost the federal government an additional $10 billion annually on top of what the provinces already pay but Singh said it's worth it, pointing to overall cost saving identified in an analysis by the parliamentary budget officer.

The report says the total cost of a national pharmacare program would be $23.7 billion in 2020, representing a $4.2 billion savings each year over the current amount being spent on drugs in Canada.

Last week, Singh said an NDP government would expand the tax on investment profits as part of a package of measures aimed to pay for pharmacare, affordable child care and housing.

""Those measures would free up billions that would be available for this as well. The rest of financing would be a matter of discussion between the federal government and provinces and territories,"" Davies said.

The federal government taxes 50 per cent of profits made on investments, or capital gains, but the NDP wants to increase that threshold — known as the inclusion rate — to 75 per cent. It said that would raise about $3 billion in revenue.

The New Democrats have also talked about closing a stock-option loophole and cracking down on the use of bearer shares and foreign tax havens, which they say help the rich avoid paying their fair share of taxes to society.

Singh took aim at the Liberal government's pharmacare plan, saying it puts pharmaceutical and insurance companies ""in the driver's seat.""

""The Liberal government is proposing to bring in a U.S.-style patchwork system that's only going to increase the premiums families pay,"" he said.

In its budget last month, the Liberal government said Canada's pastiche of drug coverage, which comprises more than 100 public programs and 100,000 private insurance plans, is not well equipped to handle the increasingly expensive drugs now coming to market.

Drug spending in Canada is expected to surpass $50 billion by 2028, an expert panel has found.

In the budget, the Liberals promised a new agency to negotiate prescription drug prices for Canadians to try and drive down costs, a move it billed as an ""important step"" on the path to an eventual national pharmacare plan. It also promised to build a national formulary and promised to spend $500 million a year, starting in 2022, to subsidize drugs that treat rare diseases.","NDP unveils universal pharmacare plan, aims program delivery by the end of 2020",Times Colonist,https://www.timescolonist.com/sports/hockey/ndp-unveils-universal-pharmacare-plan-aims-program-delivery-by-the-end-of-2020-1.23776850

If the new strategy ends up going as badly for the NDP as polls suggest it will in the October election, and Notley is lured to the Edmonton Strathcona riding in time, a possible ...","CALGARY — For the past three-and-a-half weeks, Rachel Notley has been campaigning like she’s the leader of Alberta’s Opposition and not the premier. Her election campaign has focused relentlessly on attacking the political record of her rival — the actual Opposition leader — Jason Kenney, formerly of the federal Harper Conservative government, rather than running on her own government’s record. That’s understandable given that, after four years of intense economic suffering in the province, it ain’t much of a record to run on. But if, when votes are tallied on Tuesday night, Kenney’s United Conservative Party ends up winning, as is widely expected, Notley may just end up being the best opposition leader the province has had in a generation. If so, Alberta NDPers can only hope against hope that she agrees to stick around. Because, if she doesn’t, their party is very likely to sink back into the politically irrelevant obscurity that Notley rescued it from.

Now, the odds of Notley sticking around if she loses have got to be low. Almost no leader who once held power lingers afterward to try for it again, and when they do, they almost never succeed. John Diefenbaker and John Turner tried it federally, and never won power again. Robert Bourassa had to wander in the wilderness for seven years after his Liberal party lost the 1976 provincial election to the Parti Québécois before he returned to lead his party again to victory in 1985. And as Pierre Trudeau biographer Bob Plamondon notes, PET was just lucky that his resignation from the federal Liberals was still fresh enough, with no leader yet to replace him, when Joe Clark’s PC government unexpectedly fell, that Trudeau was able to return to lead the Liberals again to victory.

Notley may just end up being the best opposition leader the province has had in a generation

For Notley, there have got to be better alternatives than returning to the leadership of Alberta’s opposition. Polls do suggest that with her NDP poised to hang on to perhaps two dozen or so seats out of 87 it would be the most potent opposition that Albertans have seen since 1993, save for the current United Conservative Party opposition, which was able to combine most of the Wildrose and PC seats, totalling 25. In between, opposition parties in Alberta usually amounted to not much more than a handful of MLAs.

As of Wednesday, Alberta could be a rather lively two-party democracy, and Notley, as one of the NDP’s strongest performers even before she became premier, would be just the kind of Opposition leader that could effectively hold government to account. One senior member of the Kenney team even confided that it would be better for them if someone did. Without an effective opposition, he said, governments lose their hunger and grow complacent, while the government ends up bedevilled by internal intrigues like infiltration and leadership rivals. These things led to the eventual collapse of the hegemonic Alberta Progressive Conservative dynasty.

Meanwhile, Kenney, if he wins, will be leading a government made up largely of rookie members facing four years of painful budget decisions to control a ballooning deficit and an underdog battle to get the rest of Canada to let Alberta export more of its oil. There’s no guarantee the UCP will live up to its promise of rescuing the province’s beleaguered economy, and any backlash from potential public sector cuts (although the UCP hasn’t talked of any) could keep them from a second term. Notley is already a very different leader than the one who readily admitted she was surprised to find herself elected premier in 2015 after a split conservative vote gave her a majority government with a minority of the popular vote. She spent the past four years gradually replacing the socialist idealism she espoused in opposition with a more realistic understanding of investor economics and the importance of energy exports to the livelihoods of average Albertans. Too gradually, it may turn out, to save her government this time. But in an interview the other day with Maclean’s magazine, Notley chattered on about the need to attract investment, rejecting further tax increases, and regretting her opposition to the Northern Gateway pipeline, which had given the federal Liberals additional cover for cancelling it. She almost sounded conservative. Even today, even after her many serious missteps, her personal popularity numbers among Alberta voters are higher than Kenney’s and her disapproval is lower, even though support for his party overall is stronger than for the NDP.

Yet Notley’s star outside of Alberta surely shines even brighter. Where many Albertans are revolting against her carbon tax, oilsands emissions caps, a forced shutdown of cheap coal power and expensive subsidies for renewables, a lot of CBC listeners elsewhere in the country, where the economy and their livelihoods aren’t mostly dependent on fossil fuels, probably see a progressive and palatable climate plan. There are surely some bank boards on Bay Street that would love to open up a director’s chair paying a healthy six figures to a female former leader of Alberta with credentials just green enough to look serious on the climate file, but reasonable enough to understand the vital need for energy infrastructure in a resource-based country.

Still, there are far more interesting possibilities than that. The federal NDP just happens to have a fairly safe seat coming open in Edmonton Strathcona, held for the past eight years by Linda Duncan. Duncan is one of the many New Democrat MPs who decided to leave the party after Leap Manifesto extremists amassed enough power inside it to throw overboard the pragmatic leadership of Thomas Mulcair in favour of college-campus socialism and a new leader, Jagmeet Singh. If the new strategy ends up going as badly for the NDP as polls suggest it will in the October election, and Notley is lured to the Edmonton Strathcona riding in time, a possible return by the party to more pragmatist policies could come in the form of a Notley campaign for federal leader just a few months from now.

The biggest loser in that scenario, of course, would be Notley’s own Alberta NDP. It was almost certainly her firm leadership and discipline that kept the party from being dragged completely into Bernie Sanders territory, as she kept her grip on a caucus heavy with environmental activists, labour organizers and even the occasional unabashed communist. It was probably a far closer scrape than it appeared and there aren’t many in the Alberta NDP today besides Notley who could do it. If the NDP loses power on Wednesday, and Notley with it, the party could easily fall to the same hard-left revolutionaries that have consumed the party federally and elsewhere, virtually guaranteeing it a return to political irrelevance in the province. The party would be poorer for it, but so would Alberta’s democracy.

Quebec's draft legislation is designed to ban specific public employees from wearing head scarves, turbans, kippas, crosses and other visible items of religious importance while at work. The proposed law would apply to dozens of positions, including teachers, school principals, police officers, judges, prosecutors, court clerks and regulatory board members.

The supposed compromise by Premier Legault that would allow current employees to continue wearing a religious symbol as long as they remain in the same position is an insult. Some Muslim teachers, for whom wearing a hijab is a vital part of their faith, know they'll be barred from promotion or moving to another board unless they bow to the government's demands.

They should not face such a choice. And other similar jobseekers should not face closed doors. Across Canada it has become increasingly common and, thankfully, acceptable to see police wearing turbans and teachers wearing hijabs doing their jobs — and doing them well. Our courts, along with the court of public opinion, have over decades recognized there's nothing incompatible with a government employee wearing a religious symbol at work.

The ugly, enforced secularization being proposed in Quebec is contrary to the free and open society Canada has tried to build. It is not the way to foster trust between communities of different faiths and backgrounds. This is especially so when so many Quebec Muslims feel they are being singled out, even as they painfully recall the fatal shootings of six Muslims at a Quebec City mosque two years ago.

Nor is it likely they overlooked the recent Facebook remarks from Lynne Shand, a councillor in the Montreal borough of Anjou, who said the head scarf was part of the ""Islamification of our country"" and that Muslims are ""trying to convert the planet … through massive immigration and multiple births."" What a nonsensical but chilling conspiracy theory.

There is some, though limited, comfort in hearing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh denounce this legislation. Yet it is doubtful that during this election year, in which Quebec votes could decide who governs Canada, any major party will vigorously oppose legislation that's popular with many Quebecers despite its egregious flaws.",Editorial: Quebec’s assault on religious freedom,The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/opinion-story/9248237-editorial-quebec-s-assault-on-religious-freedom/

And that seems to be a problem, less so for Kenney and more so for the NDP.” Political columnist Graham Thomson on the Alberta election.","EDITOR'S NOTE: This is one opinion. Under the heading Opinion, we are carrying a range of different points of view on the issues facing Albertans during the current election. You can find them on our Alberta Votes 2019 page.

Has NDP Leader Rachel Notley made a mistake?

Has she made a strategic error by focusing so much of her campaign on UCP leader Jason Kenney — and so comparatively little on her own record?

I raise the question fully aware the campaign is not over and the NDP, despite being behind in the public opinion polls, is fighting for every vote, for every scrap of support between now and April 16.

But is the anti-Kenney strategy making that fight more difficult?

As I wrote at the beginning of this election campaign, from the very first day Notley framed the campaign as a choice, ""about who is going to be the premier of Alberta and who is fit to be the premier of Alberta.""

Then she fired both barrels of her rhetoric squarely at Kenney over questions surrounding the 2017 UCP leadership race and allegations of a ""kamikaze"" candidate.

""Two days ago,"" she said, ""we learned Mr. Kenney cheated to win his party's leadership. And when he was caught, he didn't tell the truth. Mr. Kenney looked Albertans in the eye and very casually and very comfortably lied to us which in many ways goes to the heart of this issue: how comfortable Mr. Kenney is with lying.""

Kenney has denied any wrongdoing, but the NDP ramped up its offensive by running a vigorous side-campaign attacking Kenney's socially conservative history.

The NDP handed the anti-Kenney cudgel to Sarah Hoffman, who held a series of news conferences and released videos aimed at raising questions about Kenney's qualifications to be premier based on his history against rights for same-sex couples. (Kenney says his views on gay rights have evolved over time)

In this campaign, the NDP only has eyes for Jason Kenney. And that seems to be a problem. Less so for Kenney and more so for the NDP.

Its own record

United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney at a campaign rally in Calgary on Thursday, April 11, 2019. (Jeff McIntosh, The Canadian Press)

By focusing so much on Kenney, the NDP is trying to get Albertans to think twice about his ability to be premier. But the New Democrats may simply be making Albertans think twice about why the NDP is so reluctant to discuss its own record as government.

On the surface that's understandable.

The province's economic recovery seems to have stalled, unemployment in Edmonton and Calgary is the highest of any major cities outside of Atlantic Canada, and the Trans Mountain pipeline is still not under construction.

Oh, and the provincial debt is more than $60 billion and climbing each year.

It's not exactly a record you'd want to shout from the rooftops or wrap around the side of a campaign bus.

But perhaps that's exactly what Notley should have done.

The NDP record

Notley has fought long and hard for a new pipeline.

She has tried to kick-start employment through projects funded by the carbon tax. She has protected jobs by investing in infrastructure.

Here, for example, is Notley in 2017 responding to the Saskatchewan budget that cut spending:

""Frankly, that's not the approach we're taking. We're maintaining a steady hand because we believe that keeping money in the economy is the way to ensure that we come out of the recession faster. And so we think our plan is the more measured approach.""

It might not make for the best campaign slogan but it is honest and measured.

As the Notley government has explained, for the past three years it invested that money in infrastructure projects such as roads, schools and hospitals. It also used the money to keep public sector workers, such as nurses and teachers, employed.

All those billions of dollars have meant Albertans have continued to receive government services.

At a focus group in Edmonton Monday night run by the CBC in partnership with Janet Brown Research, a cross-section of 10 voters, disparate in party affiliation, age and gender, discussed the campaign.

Several expressed disappointment that the NDP didn't run a campaign extolling the virtues of its own record. And disappointment that Notley hasn't explained her deficit spending as a way to protect government services and build infrastructure projects.

Defending their own record

Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley at a campaign stop in Calgary on Friday, April 12, 2019. (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press )

""The NDP's going to lose the election because they really didn't defend why they're running a deficit. I thought they would have made an effort to say, you know, 'We're going to start trimming the deficit a little bit or show a path forward' and they really didn't,"" said one of the participants.

""There was a path forward, eventually, and it was prudent and the money wasn't being wasted, it was going to be spent prudently.""

This election campaign could have been run differently.

The NDP could have leveraged ""bozo eruptions"" as a campaign tool and then concentrated far more on a positive and sympathetic message centered around its economic track record and plans for the future. This, rather than, ""vote for us, because they're worse"".

Even before Kenney won a seat in a byelection, the NDP government demonstrated its obsession with him. In October 2017, Notley held a mini-rally of her caucus members in her Legislature offices, and invited in the media.

""From the start, Jason Kenney and the UCP caucus have opposed almost every change we've made,"" said Notley. ""They insist we go backwards to the same policies Albertans rejected in the last election.""

Sign up to get our election newsletter The Scrutineer delivered directly to your inbox twice weekly

You half expected Notley to call the election right then and there, especially when she, to the cheers of her colleagues, pledged to, ""stand up against the UCP's job-killing, climate-denying, gay-outing, school-cutting, health-privatizing, backward-looking, hope-destroying divisive agenda.""

And the attacks continued.

New Democrats no doubt thought they were running hard at Kenney, but it looked like they were running scared.

They have poked so often and so hard at Kenney they have apparently killed the nerve.

The message, while effective in it's own way, isn't going to be the determinant - the ""Kamikaze-gate"" scandal, or Kenney's socially conservative background, or his apparent softening on protection for gay-straight alliances in schools.

Aesop had the boy who cried ""wolf!"" We seem to have the premier who cried ""Kenney!"" Eventually, people stop listening.

Outlining policies

When Albertans saw Kenney in action at last week's leaders debate, they didn't see the Grim Reaper wielding a scythe. They saw a polished politician outlining his policies.

Oh, there are days Kenney is so polished as to be slippery, and some of his promises -- to fight the federal equalization program and scuttle the federal carbon tax, to name just two -- are not based in Constitutional reality.

But he has not launched into the kind of personal attack against Notley that she's hurled at him.

Mind you, that's probably because Notley has a higher approval rating compared with Kenney, according to recent opinion polls. People tend to like Notley more than Kenney, even those who intend to vote UCP.

By going so hard and so negative against Kenney so early in the campaign, Notley may have undermined her image as a positive politician, and reinforced an image created by her opponents that she is a politician unable to defend her own record.

Yes, there are Alberta conservatives who were outraged by the NDP victory in 2015 and who have been itching to vote Notley out of office — no matter what she did the past four years. But there are many regular Albertans like the gent in the focus group, who understand that the NDP, through no fault of its own, became government at the start of a deep recession.

They were willing — even eager — to hear Notley not just defend her record, but explain why running a deficit was the most responsible action a government could have taken during a recession. Notley could have made the economy an issue on her own terms rather than having Kenney make the economy his pet cause.

Notley lost the narrative and that may now make it more difficult for her to squeeze out a few extra drops of crucial support as the campaign enters its final days.",OPINION | Is the NDP's anti-Kenney strategy making the fight more difficult?,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-election-rachel-notley-jason-kenney-campaign-strategy-1.5096675

Premier John Horgan if he is getting a bit apprehensive about what kind of relationship his government may have with its counterparts in the coming months.

If the federal Liberals completely tank things (a big “if”, but by no means out of the question given their inability to deal with the SNC Lavalin mess) and allow Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer to unexpectedly form government it could be a major setback for B.C.-Ottawa relations.

WATCH: Alberta UCP leader Jason Kenney threatens to cut off B.C.’s gas supply

Of course, the federal election is not until October and many things can happen between now and then. And once Scheer undergoes more public scrutiny, the mood and opinion of the electorate may once again shift (or not, depending on whether Trudeau’s brand is so tarnished it allows Scheer to win over fence-sitting voters).

Throw in the scenario that sees United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney win the Alberta election this month (an almost certainty, but not locked down yet) and the electoral map would show the B.C. NDP government smack up against a solid wall of right-wing governments that stretch all the way to the Maritimes.

READ MORE: Transcript: Charles Adler’s fiery interview with UCP Leader Jason Kenney

In addition, I am not talking about Red Tory governments. Instead, the governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Ottawa would tilt significantly to the right.

This bloc of right-wing conservativism could have serious implications for a number of issues, not the least of which is fighting climate change.

While the B.C. NDP is by far the greenest government in the country, a string of governments that do not share its priorities when it comes to fighting climate change may frustrate many of its goals and ambitions.

WATCH: (Aired Feb. 9, 2018) Jason Kenney urges Ottawa to take B.C. to court over

For example, should Scheer and Kenney both form government, B.C. will likely be the only jurisdiction with a carbon tax (and an ever-increasing one at that). That could have significant repercussions on B.C. remaining economically competitive with other provinces.

As well, you can bet on Scheer and Kenney (aided to no small degree by Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe) pushing for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. Kenney, in particular, has vowed a form of aggression to B.C. if the pipeline is not built.

Kenney has threatened to include various options, including literally “turning off the taps” of Alberta oil sent into B.C. (if you think the price at the pump is high now, just wait to see what would happen if a Kenney-led government reduced the amount of oil flowing into this province).

He has also mused about mandatory “rat” inspections at the B.C.-Alberta border (Alberta is officially “rat-free”) of any B.C. trucks headed into that province. Commercial trucking traffic is a cornerstone of any well-performing economy, and any slowdown of something like that could have dire consequences.

While Kenney, being a next-door neighbour, is potentially the biggest disrupter of the B.C. economy, the NDP government’s relationship with the federal government is in most ways more important.

WATCH: Andrew Scheer on ‘erosion of trust’ in SNC-Lavalin affair

As I have noted here before, Trudeau and Horgan have forged some kind of bromance that is paying off impressively for B.C., particularly when it comes to jointly building badly-needed infrastructure, such as the Broadway subway line and whatever transit line is eventually built in Surrey.

Trudeau has also promised significant resources for coastal protection, and more programs to fight Indigenous poverty.

It is hard (no, actually impossible) to see Horgan having as strong a relationship with Scheer. The two men simply do not share the same values or philosophies.

This partly explains why I keep picking up from some NDP caucus members a nervous apprehension about what is going on in Ottawa right now. Some seem split about whether Jody Wilson-Raybould should have been expelled from the federal Liberal cabinet (it appears the bruising internal takedown of Carole James as party leader means some view her actions with less sympathy than their federal party counterparts).

Having Kenney as a belligerent neighbour seems a foregone conclusion. However, unless the federal NDP significantly ups its game it seems to me that many B.C. New Democrats will be secretly cheering for Trudeau to hang on and win again in October.

“Mental health is absolutely very important to the United Conservatives. Mental health is, sadly, very stigmatized when people are struggling and the United Conservative Government is committing to invest in mental health, both for children and as well for those who are trapped by the cycle of addiction.”

Sometimes that’s counseling; sometimes that’s prescription medication. Everyone is different, and people should rely on the best advice of health care professionals.

Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley says she hasn’t campaigned with the federal party leader because her focus is on what’s best for the province – including pipelines.

Provincial Affairs reporter Clare Clancy is following NDP Leader Rachel Notley’s campaign.

NANTON — NDP Leader Rachel Notley stands on a hay bale in the centre of a barn, flanked by supporters wearing plaid and cowboy hats against a scenic prairie backdrop.

It’s the picture-perfect image of rural Alberta, where the NDP have consistently lagged behind the UCP in polls.

And it’s a chance for Notley to highlight her latest message — that former Progressive Conservative voters have a place with the NDP.

The campaign stop is an event with Livingstone-Macleod candidate Cam Gardner, a fourth-generation rancher who declares that the last party membership he had was for the PCs in 2015.

“I truly believe Rachel is here to serve Albertans, and she’s got a long vision for the future of this province,” said Gardner, a former councillor and reeve with the Municipal District of Ranchland. “I’m there, win or lose, to support her as long as it takes.”

Taking the microphone, Notley retorts that Gardner represents “all that is best of Alberta,” and he’s the kind of person the NDP want in a re-elected government.

At the rural campaign stop Thursday, Notley feeds a baby calf and uses her characteristic off-the-cuff humour to joke about a horse that nuzzles bystanders.

“I’m feeling right now that I’m being heavily lobbied for … an equine vacation plan or something, or wild horse massage therapy,” she said to laughs.

It’s the kind of banter that comes easily to Notley on the campaign trail, while supporters thrust babies at her to hold and pose with her for selfies.

Her tour through southern Alberta, where NDP signs seem scattered amongst seemingly more consistent blue conservative logos, ends with a rally in Lethbridge, where candidates Shannon Phillips (Lethbridge-West) and Maria Fitzpatrick (Lethbridge-East) are facing tough races.

But during the campaign’s final days, it’s Calgary where she plans to spend the bulk of her time. And it’s the conservative Calgary vote that she’s after.

“My riding is in Edmonton, I’ve been an Edmonton MLA since 2008. I think the people of Edmonton know me, know what I stand for,” she said Thursday morning at a Calgary café event.

“Even though I’ve been premier for four years, it is true that Calgarians are still getting to know me and what I stand for,” she said.

“I think there’s a lot more volatility in the vote in Calgary right now, so I’m really interested in having the conversation down here as much as I can.”

On Friday, Notley released a campaign video calling on former conservatives to consider a vote for the NDP. She doubled down on her message, telling voters that if they are considering casting a ballot for the Alberta Party or Liberal Party, think instead about the NDP.

“We are at a crossroads in this election,” she said at the Grand Theatre in downtown Calgary. “The best way to make sure we take the right direction … is by buying a ticket for the vehicle that has the most gas, and I suggest that’s ours.”

Later during an interview in Canmore, where she campaigned with NDP candidate Cam Westhead who has adopted the charming Obama-style slogan “yes we Cam,” Notley reiterates that the NDP has a “path to victory.”

She said the NDP are gaining momentum in Calgary, despite polls continuing to tilt in favour of UCP Leader Jason Kenney.

“We know the areas that we can win, and we know there are enough of them that we could still win a majority government,” she said.

The sentiment harkens back to her campaign rallies, where she has repeated the line that “Alberta doesn’t belong to anyone but Albertans.”

In Lethbridge, she told the crowd not to count the NDP out.

Her election campaign has focused ...","CALGARY — For the past three-and-a-half weeks, Rachel Notley has been campaigning like she’s the leader of Alberta’s Opposition and not the premier. Her election campaign has focused relentlessly on attacking the political record of her rival — the actual Opposition leader — Jason Kenney, formerly of the federal Harper Conservative government, rather than running on her own government’s record. That’s understandable given that, after four years of intense economic suffering in the province, it ain’t much of a record to run on. But if, when votes are tallied on Tuesday night, Kenney’s United Conservative Party ends up winning, as is widely expected, Notley may just end up being the best opposition leader the province has had in a generation. If so, Alberta NDPers can only hope against hope that she agrees to stick around. Because, if she doesn’t, their party is very likely to sink back into the politically irrelevant obscurity that Notley rescued it from.

Now, the odds of Notley sticking around if she loses have got to be low. Almost no leader who once held power lingers afterward to try for it again, and when they do, they almost never succeed. John Diefenbaker and John Turner tried it federally, and never won power again. Robert Bourassa had to wander in the wilderness for seven years after his Liberal party lost the 1976 provincial election to the Parti Québécois before he returned to lead his party again to victory in 1985. And as Pierre Trudeau biographer Bob Plamondon notes, PET was just lucky that his resignation from the federal Liberals was still fresh enough, with no leader yet to replace him, when Joe Clark’s PC government unexpectedly fell, that Trudeau was able to return to lead the Liberals again to victory.

Notley may just end up being the best opposition leader the province has had in a generation

For Notley, there have got to be better alternatives than returning to the leadership of Alberta’s opposition. Polls do suggest that with her NDP poised to hang on to perhaps two dozen or so seats out of 87 it would be the most potent opposition that Albertans have seen since 1993, save for the current United Conservative Party opposition, which was able to combine most of the Wildrose and PC seats, totalling 25. In between, opposition parties in Alberta usually amounted to not much more than a handful of MLAs.

As of Wednesday, Alberta could be a rather lively two-party democracy, and Notley, as one of the NDP’s strongest performers even before she became premier, would be just the kind of Opposition leader that could effectively hold government to account. One senior member of the Kenney team even confided that it would be better for them if someone did. Without an effective opposition, he said, governments lose their hunger and grow complacent, while the government ends up bedevilled by internal intrigues like infiltration and leadership rivals. These things led to the eventual collapse of the hegemonic Alberta Progressive Conservative dynasty.

Meanwhile, Kenney, if he wins, will be leading a government made up largely of rookie members facing four years of painful budget decisions to control a ballooning deficit and an underdog battle to get the rest of Canada to let Alberta export more of its oil. There’s no guarantee the UCP will live up to its promise of rescuing the province’s beleaguered economy, and any backlash from potential public sector cuts (although the UCP hasn’t talked of any) could keep them from a second term. Notley is already a very different leader than the one who readily admitted she was surprised to find herself elected premier in 2015 after a split conservative vote gave her a majority government with a minority of the popular vote. She spent the past four years gradually replacing the socialist idealism she espoused in opposition with a more realistic understanding of investor economics and the importance of energy exports to the livelihoods of average Albertans. Too gradually, it may turn out, to save her government this time. But in an interview the other day with Maclean’s magazine, Notley chattered on about the need to attract investment, rejecting further tax increases, and regretting her opposition to the Northern Gateway pipeline, which had given the federal Liberals additional cover for cancelling it. She almost sounded conservative. Even today, even after her many serious missteps, her personal popularity numbers among Alberta voters are higher than Kenney’s and her disapproval is lower, even though support for his party overall is stronger than for the NDP.

Yet Notley’s star outside of Alberta surely shines even brighter. Where many Albertans are revolting against her carbon tax, oilsands emissions caps, a forced shutdown of cheap coal power and expensive subsidies for renewables, a lot of CBC listeners elsewhere in the country, where the economy and their livelihoods aren’t mostly dependent on fossil fuels, probably see a progressive and palatable climate plan. There are surely some bank boards on Bay Street that would love to open up a director’s chair paying a healthy six figures to a female former leader of Alberta with credentials just green enough to look serious on the climate file, but reasonable enough to understand the vital need for energy infrastructure in a resource-based country.

Still, there are far more interesting possibilities than that. The federal NDP just happens to have a fairly safe seat coming open in Edmonton Strathcona, held for the past eight years by Linda Duncan. Duncan is one of the many New Democrat MPs who decided to leave the party after Leap Manifesto extremists amassed enough power inside it to throw overboard the pragmatic leadership of Thomas Mulcair in favour of college-campus socialism and a new leader, Jagmeet Singh. If the new strategy ends up going as badly for the NDP as polls suggest it will in the October election, and Notley is lured to the Edmonton Strathcona riding in time, a possible return by the party to more pragmatist policies could come in the form of a Notley campaign for federal leader just a few months from now.

The biggest loser in that scenario, of course, would be Notley’s own Alberta NDP. It was almost certainly her firm leadership and discipline that kept the party from being dragged completely into Bernie Sanders territory, as she kept her grip on a caucus heavy with environmental activists, labour organizers and even the occasional unabashed communist. It was probably a far closer scrape than it appeared and there aren’t many in the Alberta NDP today besides Notley who could do it. If the NDP loses power on Wednesday, and Notley with it, the party could easily fall to the same hard-left revolutionaries that have consumed the party federally and elsewhere, virtually guaranteeing it a return to political irrelevance in the province. The party would be poorer for it, but so would Alberta’s democracy.

Five NDP members of parliament signed a letter on Friday to Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez urging a commitment to stable funding for the Indigenous theatre project, which launches its inaugural season this year.

The letter says while the federal government has pledged to protect and promote Indigenous cultures and history, it “must go much further” and that includes acknowledging Indigenous cultures “as a foundational pillar of Canadian culture.”

Playwright Kevin Loring, the first-ever artistic director of the NAC’s Indigenous program, posted a note on Facebook earlier this month lamenting a lack of support for the project from Canadian Heritage in the 2019 federal budget.

He said it will have a tangible impact on the first season, leaving the Ottawa-based performing arts centre to rely on fundraising efforts. The scope of any subsequent seasons remains in question after $3.5 million of requested federal funding was denied.

The federal government supports the performing arts and Indigenous art, having “recently invested $225 million to support the renewal of the National Arts Centre,” a representative for Canadian Heritage said earlier this month.

The NDP MPs say the new theatre was created as a space for Indigenous people to share their stories “in the heart of our country’s capital for all to see and hear.”

“Support for such a vision is key to reconciliation,” the letter added.

“Canada must redefine its vision of its heritage to centre the original peoples, Indigenous Peoples, and incorporate their history, their cultures, and that plurality to how we view ourselves,” the letter continued. “Denying that influence, and returning to our two traditional solitudes, does a disservice to us all, a disservice we cannot afford.”

New Democrat MP Niki Ashton asked the Liberals during question period on Monday why the government isn’t supporting the theatre program. Gary Anandasangaree, parliamentary secretary to Heritage Minister Rodriguez, responded saying the Liberals are working on reconciliation efforts.

The first season’s lineup of NAC’s Indigenous Theatre is scheduled to be announced on April 30.

The NDP and its leader Wab Kinew are opposing the Pallister government’s plan to cut the PST to 7% July 1. And every step along the way the beleaguered party has fought government’s measures to balance the books.

Those are the two main issues that drove the NDP out of office in 2016 under former premier Greg Selinger. Yet when a new government takes steps to reverse those egregious errors, the NDP still opposes it. Go figure.

Selinger promised voters in 2011 that he would not raise the PST. He also pledged that his government at the time would balance the books in short order. The NDP reneged on both of those commitments.

The following year the NDP expanded the PST to include services such as insurance premiums while also raising the fuel tax from 11.5 cents to 14 cents per litre. Then came the bombshell. With no warning and no consultation, the NDP raised the PST to 8% in 2013. Despite that, they continued to run large deficits and commitments to balance the books were ignored. There was no balanced budget in site.

Instead, provincial debt was climbing at $2 billion a year and the finances of the province were deteriorating so rapidly, government was subject to credit rating downgrades.

These are the reasons the NDP was tossed from office three years ago.

Shockingly, they’re still fighting for the things that led to their defeat. They are opposed to the PST cut. They believe Manitobans should continue to pay the higher tax, even though taxpayers in this province pay among the highest taxes in the country.

They are also opposed to measures that bring spending in line with revenues. They support chronic deficits which would lead to even more unmanageable debt and further credit rating downgrades. Manitobans are aware of how destructive such a path would be to take. Which is precisely why they booted the NDP from government.

What’s bewildering is the NDP don’t appear to be learning from their mistakes. Manitobans clearly don’t want higher taxes and they want an administration that’s going to live within its means and run a fiscally responsible government.

That was something former NDP premier Gary Doer understood when he won office in 1999. The current group of NDPers on Broadway just don’t get it.",EDITORIAL: NDP not learning from past mistakes,Winnipeg Sun,https://winnipegsun.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-ndp-not-learning-from-past-mistakes

Huh!?

Almost daily since well before the official election campaign began, the provincial New Democrats have been sending disingenuous fundraising messages like this to their supporters.

Why do I call these appeals disingenuous? Because, by law, rich voters cannot donate more than anyone else and corporations are forbidden entirely. The NDP know this. It was their law.

However, nearly daily they plead: Send us money because the “billionaires,” the “CEOs,” the “fat cats” and the “One Percent” are going to flood the United Conservatives with money. We plucky defenders of the little guy just can’t compete without your donations.

And maybe the NDP leadership truly believes this snake-oil pitch. Maybe class envy is so bred in the bones of social democrats that they have to see themselves as the underdogs, even if they have become the party of well paid, job-secure, benefit-rich, public-sector workers.

The income group in which the NDP do best relative to the UCP are people making over $250,000 a year.

One of the Notley government’s first acts in 2015 was to ban all corporate and union donations to political campaigns. Only “ordinary residents of Alberta” may donate to “a party, constituency association, candidate, nomination contestant or leadership contestant,” and each may contribute no more than a total of $4,000 a year to “any combination of the above.”

Well off Albertans are more likely to have $4,000 lying about to give to political parties, but no party could raise enough money to run an election campaign – not even close – relying solely on “rich donors.”

It’s true that last year the UCP collected (and had to pay back) nearly $30,000 donated by people who were over their $4,000 annual limit, but the NDP had to return nearly $25,000. And the NDP raised only half as much as the UCP, so a greater percentage of its donors exceeded the maximum amount permitted by law.

So maybe the frantic New Democratic fundraisers mean PACs, the political action committees that have fewer limits on them than do political parties and their candidates.

But here, too, the NDP have the upper hand, money-wise.

Sure, there are PACs that have shared UCP goals and messages. Unite Alberta and the Alberta Victory Fund both raised tens of thousands to highlight the NDP government’s failures and push for free-market alternatives. Shaping Alberta’s Future, which is mostly funded by car dealers, did too.

But the big kids on the PAC block are more likely to be affiliated with the NDP, such as the Alberta Federation of Labour, whose PAC was funded by the United Nurses of Alberta, United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), the Health Sciences Association of Alberta, the Canadian Union of Public Employees and UNIFOR.

There’s Project Alberta, run by a former NDP communications director and funded by UFCW and the United Steelworkers, and the Public Interest Alberta Society (the Alberta Teachers’ Association, the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, the Health Sciences Association of Alberta and United Nurses of Alberta).

It’s also no coincidence that NDP support in Edmonton tends to be highest in the city’s wealthiest ridings. Senior civil servants (who live in those ridings in big numbers) are only too happy to support the huge spike in public spending under the NDP.

The real clanger, though, in the latest desperate appeal from NDP party treasurer Siobhan Vipond is the claim “we’ve diligently planned to stretch every penny as far as it’ll go” in our campaign spending.

Funny, when they’re spending their own money, the NDP are quite frugal.

New Democrats unveil their plan to help our local farmers and producers, and to protect supply management.

SAINTE-HYACINTHE – Today, Jagmeet Singh, Leader of Canada’s NDP, and Brigitte Sansoucy, MP for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, presented the New Democratic plan to defend supply management, and reaffirmed the NDP’s position as strong allies of Quebec. Quebec farmers and producers depend on supply management for their survival, with it representing 60% of total production, and generating over 116,000 jobs.

""The NDP is an ally to Quebec. Farmers must be fully compensated, over the long term, for losses incurred by the three breaches made in the latest trade agreements signed by Justin Trudeau’s Liberals, and the Conservatives before them. We also commit to never opening more breaches during future free trade negotiations,"" added Singh. ""We must stop sacrificing supply management when negotiating international agreements and protect our agriculture. We must hold reciprocal standards with our business partners, and give our farmers and producers equal footing when competing with foreign products in the Canadian marketplace. We must value and be proud of our local agriculture because products made here meet high quality standards.""

In a single mandate, Justin Trudeau traded away nearly 8.4% of our dairy production and processing capacity. That’s the annual production of 1,200 medium-sized dairy farms in Quebec. The Liberals, like the Conservatives before them, are gradually destroying our supply management system and the vitality of our agriculture system.

""Supply management has been the lifeblood of our regions, and it contributes to our food sovereignty. Quebecers should be proud of the system they implemented and we must support it! However, over the last few years, it's become normalized to use supply-managed farmers as bargaining chips during trade negotiations,"" stated Brigitte Sansoucy. ""Over the past several months, the NDP has repeatedly demonstrated that we are the only party in Ottawa committed to protecting supply management, in its entirety.""","The NDP, an Ally to Farmers and Producers",New Democratic Party,https://www.ndp.ca/news/ndp-ally-farmers

Eligilble voters: 29,782

The riding of Edmonton-Highlands-Norwood has been about as reliable an NDP seat as any in the province.

The question this election: does that continue after Brian Mason?

Last year, the longtime NDP MLA and former party leader announced he would not run again. Former premier Ralph Klein famously said Mason was so popular in the riding that “you’re going to need an atomic bomb to get him out of there.” In 2015, Mason won again with nearly 80 per cent of the vote.

Mason’s departure is just one of the things that makes Highlands-Norwood interesting. It’s among Edmonton’s most diverse ridings. Twenty-six per cent of residents are immigrants, while 11 per cent are Indigenous — the highest rate in any Edmonton riding. It also has the lowest median income in the city and higher than average unemployment.

Janis Irwin is the NDP candidate seeking to take the baton from Mason, first elected in 2000. She’s confident Mason’s endorsement and the NDP’s policies will resonate with voters in the neighbourhood.

“To be able to say it was our government that was able to halve the rate of child poverty in two years, it’s incredible, and that’s because of explicit action that Rachel (Notley) took like introducing the Alberta child benefit.”

Two Indigenous women are also in the running. Leila Houle, the UCP candidate, comes from Whitefish Lake First Nation. She said many Indigenous families in the riding share her story: growing up on reserve and then moving to Edmonton for school or work and facing barriers.

She finds the overarching issue for residents is jobs and the economy. “That is the overwhelming response at the door.”

The Green Party’s Taz Bouchier is a former Edmonton civic candidate whose background is in social work.

“The complaint I’ve been getting is ‘Brian Mason did not listen to us. We want someone who will,’” she said.

“There’s many Indigenous people in that community, and there’s many people suffering from poverty, and they’re feeling like they’re not being listened to or heard.”

Tish Prouse, a property manager running for the Alberta Party, thinks the party can break through as a centrist alternative to the UCP and NDP.

“It’s not an ideologically driven party,” he said. “There’s considerable input and sway and … discourse (among members) to come up with varied alternatives to a particular problem.”

Two lesser known parties are hoping to convince voters.

Joe Hankins, who lives in Boyle Street, represents the Alberta Independence Party. He says people are dissatisfied with the UCP and the NCP, as well as Alberta’s place in Canada.

“It’s not hard to broach the subject” of separation at the doors, he said. “Maybe half the people are a little apprehensive about independence but they seem willing to listen.”

Representing the upstart Alberta Advantage Party is Chris Poplatek, who says he will represent residents in the riding and not the party.

“How my party decides to vote is based on each individual candidate, if we get elected,” he said, adding education, the carbon tax, seniors care and crime are the biggest issues he’s hearing.

There’s also a candidate from the Communist Party of Alberta.

“We’re the only party that says we want working people to take power and abolish capitalism,” said candidate Alex Boykowich.

The candidates

Joseph Hankins, Alberta Independence Party

Age: 48

Occupation: Industrial cleaner

Reasons for running: “Like many Albertans I grew tired of the lies and corruption of political parties. There was no party to choose so we here at AIP created one solely made up of regular citizens, the only type of people that are willing to make the changes needed to hold politicians accountable.”

Priorities: Gain independence from Canada and create the biggest tax revolt ever seen. Economy. We need to stop demonizing our oil industry and take steps to curtail foreign influences from doing so. Aggressively attack our homeless and poverty problem with more mental health, education and tax reductions.

Website: Albertaindependence.ca

Leila Houle, UCP

Age: 42

Occupation: Engagement and relationship adviser for Indigenous Relations

Reasons for running: “I am running as part of the United Conservative team because I saw how much my friends, family and neighbours were suffering due to bad NDP polices. To make a difference in everyday Albertan’s lives I knew we had to elect a fiscally responsible government that focused on jobs, economy and pipelines.”

Priorities: Get Albertans back to work by pursuing policies that catalyze growth and jobs, make life better for all Albertans by boosting our economy and protecting front-line services, and stand up for Alberta within the federation by unapologetically defending our economy.

Janis Irwin, NDP

Age: 34

Occupation: Teacher, civil servant

Reasons for running: “As a former teacher and school administrator, I know how important it is that our young people get the best start in life.

Chris Poplatek, Alberta Advantage Party

Age: 43

Occupation: Small business owner/community peace officer

Reasons for running: “I decided to run for office after continuously hearing from friends, family and persons I meet that they have lost faith in our political system. I have heard too often that people have lost their trust in politicians. That helped me decide to run for office, so that I could give the people in my riding an actual voice in our government.”

Priorities: Binding referendums by a citizen-initiated petition. Crime control by training and elevating sheriffs to police service levels and to hire more provincial prosecutors and judges. Getting the unemployed back to work by allowing abandoned oil and gas wells to be leased out to small and medium companies.

Tish Prouse, Alberta Party

Age: 39

Occupation: Property manager

Reason for running: “As a business owner, husband, father, and community volunteer, I want to ensure everyone in Highlands-Norwood has a voice whether LGBTQ+, new arrival, business owner, tradesworker or stay-at-home parent. Issues that are important to us aren’t sufficiently dealt with by this government. They affect my family, my business, and my neighbours. I can offer new, effective strategies, not just Band-Aid solutions.”

Priorities: Changing the rules governing problem properties, unaccountable landlords, landowner responsibilities and commercial tenantry rights. Addressing homelessness and addictions with the focus on small communities in Alberta. Greater accountability for provincial money invested in transportation projects and quality of infrastructure upgrades.

NDP Justice Critic Tracey Ramsey issued the following statement:

“Today, at the Justice Committee, Liberal MPs refused to launch an investigation into the leak of Chief Justice Joyal’s application for a seat on the Supreme Court of Canada by voting down an opposition motion. This leak, which was manipulated to smear the former Attorney General, was a flagrant attack on the independence of the judiciary and a severe form of disrespect of its work.

Liberals are compromising the integrity of our judiciary, namely the process for selecting judges in Canada. It is clear that they are trying to normalize the violation of the core principle of our justice system by avoiding any attempt to get to the truth about the leak.

With the case of the political interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, this is the second justice scandal that implicates the PMO in three months, and no one on the Liberals’ side is willing to deliver the truth to Canadians. This is wrong.

Canadians want a Prime Minister that works for them, not one who does everything in his power to protect his political interests and the interests of his rich friends.

The NDP will continue to use all the tools available to get to the truth about the leak of confidential information.

A legend of Canadian politics is speaking in Owen Sound Saturday.

Former NDP leader Ed Broadbent will appear at the Bruce Grey Owen Sound NDP association’s meeting to select a candidate for the coming federal election. Broadbent was leader of the NDP from 1975 to 1989. He’s considered one of the best known and respected public figures over the last several decades.

The local association’s past president Michael McLuhan compares Broadbent to a respected indigenous elder.

“Ed is really the archetypal elder in politics right now and he has a lot of wisdom to share and that wisdom isn’t always going to be partisan,” said McLuhan.

Broadbent will be in conversation on current political topics with former Globe and Mail columnist Michael Valpy, an Owen Sound-area resident.

There is one declared candidate for the NDP in Bruce Grey Owen Sound for the coming election, Chris Stephen of the Paisley area.

Michael McLuhan believes, what with the retirement of Larry Miller, the riding is wide open and the NDP has a good chance.

“I think that we have an opportunity here. It would be very good for Grey Bruce to get a good, active member from the NDP in there,” said McLuhan.

THUNDER BAY – The NDP have a pair of candidates looking to take back a Northern Ontario seat they’d held for eight years before losing it to the Liberals in the 2015 federal election.

Jason Storkson, president of the Nishnawbe Aski Police Service police association, and labour activist Yuk-Sem Won on Friday confirmed they’re in the running to represent the party in Thunder Bay-Rainy River, a seat soon-to-be-vacated by Liberal Don Rusnak, who has decided not to seek a second term in the House of Commons.

Neither candidate has held public office before, but both said they can bring the necessary changed needed in a riding as diverse and unique as Thunder Bay-Rainy River.

“I’ve always been an active member in this community and I’ve been able to participate and be a strong voice for the groups that I’ve worked with,” said Won, who in addition to her roles at both Lakehead University and Confederation College, is a well-known local visual artist.

“I wanted to bring that representation to the people of Northwestern Ontario through Thunder Bay-Rainy River.”

Storkson, born and raised in Thunder Bay, said he’s a problem-solver with a strong character who thinks his voice can be a meaningful one in the world of politics.

“I’m just tired of arm-chair politicking with my friends over coffee and I think it’s time to change and put myself out there and try to change things for the better for our community and the surrounding area.”

Both candidates see a huge opportunity, with Rusnak deciding to leave politics behind to focus on his young family.

“I think it is a strong NDP riding,” Storkson said. “I think what happened in the last election cycle was just an angry electorate trying to get rid of the (Conservatives) and I think everybody just jumped on the Liberal bandwagon to make sure that happened, instead of splitting the vote.

“And I think they’ll come back now to the NDP.”

The Liberals have opened the door, Won said.

“There are definitely some issues that the Liberals are facing and I think the concerns of the people of Northwestern Ontario are with the government in general that we’re seeing all over the place. It’s (important) to find a representative that has those same values and will be able to bring that to the forefront, without the conflict and the divisiveness.”

The party has yet to set a date for the nomination meeting, though it’s expected to happen in late May.

Campaign promises and homophobic, racist and other intolerant remarks by candidates have done little to shake the narrative.

Frustration and anger over the failure to build a new outlet for oil and gas, as well as four years of economic hardship, have dominated a dark campaign. United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney has vowed to fight Alberta’s “enemies” while NDP Leader Rachel Notley has called for diplomacy. Within days, the heart of Canada’s energy industry will be in the hands of one of the two leaders.

Both parties have laid out extensive fiscal plans that chart different paths for Alberta’s future – neither calls for a dramatic break with the present, through a sales tax or a pivot away from oil and gas. However, much is at stake, as both parties offer differing views on how to stoke economic growth and whether Canada’s unity question should migrate from Quebec to Alberta.

Pipelines

UCP

Mr. Kenney has vowed to see through the completion of the Trans Mountain and Keystone XL expansions. He’s also said he wants to restart talks to build the Energy East and Northern Gateway pipelines. The UCP Leader has proposed an aggressive strategy to see that through. His government would file constitutional challenges against Ottawa and would enact legislation to stop oil flows to B.C. as a form of punishment if pipelines aren’t built.

He’s also said he would hold a referendum in 2021 to remove equalization from the constitution if “substantial progress” is not made on the construction of a coastal pipeline.

The UCP would also create a war room with a $30-million annual budget to run advertising and defend Alberta’s oil and gas on social media. Mr. Kenney has also said he will sue groups that have fought the energy industry, including the David Suzuki Foundation.

NDP

Ms. Notley said she expects Trans Mountain will get federal approval before the end of May. Construction on the first pipeline to the Pacific Ocean since the Korean War would start soon after. Instead of cutting off oil to B.C., Ms. Notley has insisted a soft approach has swayed the majority of Canadians, saying seven out of 10 are now in support of Trans Mountain.

To supplement overburdened pipelines, Ms. Notley brought in oil curtailment and signed a $3.7-billion contract to lease 4,400 cars to ship oil by rail.

Reality check

The election is partly a referendum on Ms. Notley’s approach to pipeline diplomacy, however, Alberta has little control over pipeline construction. Decisions on the Trans Mountain pipeline are made in Ottawa, in the courts and in consultations with First Nations. The federal government has until the end of May to respond to the latest regulatory approval of the pipeline by the National Energy Board.

Constitutional experts have warned Mr. Kenney’s plan to cut off oil to B.C. and hold a referendum on equalization could fail in the courts.

Economy and jobs

UCP

The centrepiece of Mr. Kenney’s economic plan is a proposal to cut corporate taxes from 12 to 8 per cent. Mr. Kenney has said the cut will create tens of thousands of jobs and signal businesses to invest. The UCP had initially claimed the tax cut would pay for itself through increased economic activity, however, the party’s platform says the cut will cost $2-billion over four years.

The party has said it will look to spark the economy by slashing regulations. The platform promises to reduce the youth minimum wage from $15 to $13 an hour, and will look at reducing the minimum wage for alcohol servers.

NDP

The NDP’s key economic strategy is to increase diversification in the oil patch by providing incentives to petrochemical and oil refining ventures. The party has set aside $7-billion in financing and hopes to create $75-billion in investment and tens of thousands of new jobs.

Over the past four years, the NDP government’s $3-billion diversification fund has led to the opening of a number of new refineries and petrochemical facilities near Edmonton.

The party would create a fund to help first-time home buyers and link all Albertans to high-speed internet. It has also promised to streamline regulations for small business, as well as oil and gas wells.

Reality check

Despite party promises, energy remains the main driver of the province’s economy. The biggest challenge facing Alberta will continue to be a North American market awash in oil and gas that can be produced at prices Alberta producers generally can’t match.

Health

UCP

The UCP has promised to maintain health spending at current levels or increase budgets, but it has not budgeted additional funds in its platform. It wants to cut administrative costs and direct savings to front-line staff. The money would also help fund an ambitious plan to reduce surgical wait times to no more than 16 weeks – hip-replacement wait times now top 37 weeks and knee replacements require 41 weeks. Private clinics will be allowed to provide major surgeries.

Two of the UCP’s largest spending promises are in health, with $40-million allocated over four years to an opioid strategy. There’s also a $100-million promise over four years to bulk up mental health and addictions services.

The party would review existing supervised drug-use sites and only fund those that have gone through rigorous consultations with local groups and an impact study. The same rules would apply to new sites.

NDP

The NDP said it would increase health budgets at the same rate as Alberta’s population. It has also committed $90-million annually to emergency rooms and would target additional funds to reduce wait times for cataract, heart and cancer surgery.

The party’s second-biggest promise is to fully cover drug prescriptions for seniors who earn less than $75,000. The program is expected to cost $110-million annually.

To combat opioids, the party has committed to opening two storefront mental-health clinics in Calgary and Edmonton. It will also sue opioid manufactures to recoup the costs of the health crisis.

Reality check

Alberta has one of Canada’s youngest populations and one of its most expensive health programs. The NDP reined in increasing health spending, allowing budgets to increase by only 3 per cent annually over the past four years. From 2000 to 2010, health budgets climbed by more than 9 per cent annually. Health experts have warned that the UCP’s pledge to freeze budgets isn’t realistic.

Education and child care

UCP

Mr. Kenney has promised to maintain education spending at current levels or increase it. He’s said he will cancel “discovery learning” and pause the province’s curriculum review. He’s also said he will bring back a number of standardized and assessment tests for students in Grades 1 through 3, and would lift caps on charter schools.

The UCP would rescind a law barring teachers from telling parents when students join gay-straight alliances.

NDP

The NDP said it would increase education budgets at the same rate as the province’s population. Ms. Notley has said she would build or modernize 70 schools, with funding to build new playgrounds.

The NDP’s biggest promise is to create a system of $25-a-day child care across the province over five years. With a $1.5-billion price tag, the program would expand to include 75,000 spaces and could include child care during evening and weekends to accommodate work schedules.

Reality check

Calgary has Canada’s third-most expensive child care, with a monthly space for a toddler topping $1,030. Albertans will need to decide whether or not the province can bear the additional expense. The UCP has said it won’t allocate more cash for child care while the NDP says the system would help the economy.

A number of protests have been held during the campaign about the UCP’s promise on the GSA issue.

Climate change

UCP

The first bill from a UCP government would repeal the carbon tax, according to Mr. Kenney. He would then file a legal challenge against the federal government’s climate plan.

The UCP’s climate strategy would impose a tax on emissions from large industrial facilities, requiring them to meet increasingly stringent targets or pay a $20 a tonne tax. The UCP would allow coal-fired power plants to remain open past 2030 and would cancel supports for renewable energy projects.

NDP

The NDP would keep the carbon tax, currently set at $30 a tonne. Future increases in the tax have been ruled out until a new pipeline is built. A proposed cap on oil sands emissions is also pending.

Ms. Notley would keep the 2030 coal phase-out date and plans to have 30 per cent of Alberta’s electricity sourced from renewables by 2030.

Reality check

The NDP’s climate plan, which includes the carbon tax and energy efficiency programs, is expected to cut 50 megatonnes of emissions by 2030. The UCP’s plan would cut 43 MT. If the federal government’s power to impose a carbon tax is upheld in court, it’s unclear what would happen to Mr. Kenney’s plan.

Debt and deficits

UCP

Mr. Kenney has promised to balance the province’s budget by 2022. He will do so by cutting taxes and freezing spending. By the end of a four-year mandate, government spending adjusted for inflation and population growth would be down 14 per cent for every Albertan.

With total debt approaching $100-billion, the UCP has said it would appoint an independent panel to look at Alberta’s fiscal situation, recommend how to balance the books and pay down debt.

NDP

The NDP plans for balance in 2023, with a boost in resource revenues paying for new social programs, including child care. A three per cent reduction in per capita spending would wipe out the deficit.

New capital projects, including a second road out of Fort McMurray, would be added to spending plans.

Reality check

Economists have expressed worry with the NDP’s projections for resource revenue growth. Both plans depend on spending restraint, which would require Alberta’s government to make difficult choices, consistently, for years.





Democracy

UCP

Mr. Kenney has promised to allow constituents to recall their MLAs. The party would require floor crossers to resign and run in a by-election before they could join the UCP. A $30,000 limit on contributions to political action committees would be set.

NDP

Ms. Notley has promised increased enforcement and stronger disclosure rules on cash funnelled to political action committees. The NDP would introduce spending limits on party leadership races.

Conflict of interest rules would be extended, barring cabinet ministers from lobbying for two years after leaving government.

Reality check

Political action committees have proliferated in Alberta’s politics prior to this election and both parties have confronted groups who can outspend them and not disclose all their funding – tough new rules should be expected.

Recall legislation in B.C. has not lead to a single politician being ousted. Alberta’s recall rules were dumped after residents attempted to recall then-premier William Aberhart.

Opposition Leader Ryan Meili ...,"The Saskatchewan NDP is calling on Premier Scott Moe’s government to introduce legislation that would protect students’ rights to form gay-straight alliance clubs.

Opposition Leader Ryan Meili said the clubs are a topic of debate right now in the Alberta election, where United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney has promised to replace legislation that prevents educators from telling parents if their children participate in GSAs.

Meili said such a move would be backward. He said the Saskatchewan Party government needs to legislate students’ rights to form or join a GSA.

The NDP said Saskatchewan is one of the only provinces where a student’s right to do so is not protected by legislation.

Moe said a policy exists that allows GSAs in school divisions and respects the confidentiality of students.

Cat Haines, program co-ordinator with UR Pride Centre at the University of Regina, said she knows youth who face bullying and negative comments about their gender and sexual identity.

She said the centre has encountered students who had difficulty forming GSAs because of unsupportive school staff and administration, as well as students not feeling safe because their parents may find out.

“A GSA really provides a safe space and community within their school where they can feel supported and where they feel like they can really be themselves,” Haines said Wednesday.

Without legislation around GSAs, students lack a clear path about what to do in cases where the policies are not being followed, she added.

Education Minister Gord Wyant said the province’s existing policy that says school divisions should respond positively to student requests to form GSAs works well. His office has not received a complaint where a student has been denied forming such a group, he said.

Wyant said it’s incumbent on people to report their complaints, and there is an online tool to help.

“If there’s a student who … isn’t able to create a GSA or with a group of people to create a GSA, I’m not sure how I would know or anyone else would know that they were denied unless they told us,” said Wyant.

In fact, Kingston is not mentioned even once in Ontario’s 2019 budget.

READ MORE: How the Ontario 2019 budget will affect families across the province

Local NDP MPP Ian Arthur said Kingston’s lack of acknowledgment is not exactly a bad sign for the city.

“We’ll continue to make investments as a community,” he said.

It’s the larger trends away from social services that Arthur claims could be potentially problematic.

“It’s a terrible budget, the Doug Ford Conservatives, they just don’t actually believe it’s their job to help folks.”

Arthur said overall, he feels the budget is too focused on cutting services that would affect the most vulnerable citizens in Ontario — he believes this spending plan will hurt children, students, Indigenous people and those living in rural and Northern Ontario.

One of the biggest threats to Kingston, Arthur said, is the announced changes to how colleges and universities will be funded.

So far, only a small proportion of funding has been linked to the performance of post-secondary institutions — 1.4 per cent for universities and 1.2 per cent for colleges — but that will go up to 60 per cent in the next five years.

The first year of the new agreements will tie 25 per cent of funding to performance, and that proportion will rise annually until 2024-25.

The plan will also include cutting almost $700 million in overall funding for post-secondary education.

“That’s scary for Kingston. We have three post-secondary institutions, and they’re going to be hard hit by this budget.”

Student assistance spending is also meant to go down from $2 billion to $1.4 billion, which could affect university and college students in the area, many of whom depend on that funding to attend post-secondary schools.

READ MORE: College and university funding tied more to performance

Nevertheless, the budget also outlines the previously announced plan to reduce tuition by 10 per cent at colleges and universities starting in the 2019–20 school year and freeze tuition fees for the 2020–21 school year.

When asked if he had seen anything good from the budget, Arthur answered:

“Haven’t found it yet. It’s going to hurt Ontario and it’s going to hurt folks who already have enough trouble affording life.”

261,,2019-04-12T06:27:00.0000000Z,"VICTORIA — Called to account Wednesday for a caribou rescue plan that threatens hundreds of forest jobs in the northeast, the New Democrats fell back on the excuse that Ottawa made them do it.","VICTORIA — Called to account Wednesday for a caribou rescue plan that threatens hundreds of forest jobs in the northeast, the New Democrats fell back on the excuse that Ottawa made them do it.

“The federal government issued an imminent threat of extinction in May 2018,” said Forests and Lands Minister Doug Donaldson, referring to a finding under Canada’s Species at Risk Act.

Faced with that finding, the New Democrats entered into months of consultations with the federal government and First Nations, leading to draft rescue plans that are just now being shared with the public.

Those plans have generated widespread anger and opposition, particularly in northeast B.C., where even the lowball estimate points to the loss of 500 forestry jobs and at least one mill.

The alternative, said Donaldson would be even worse: “The path that we were headed down … was leading to a result where the federal government would unilaterally impose an order, based on habitat only, that would be catastrophic to workers, catastrophic to communities, and could result in billions of dollars in economic losses in B.C.”

Premier John Horgan took much the same tack in responding during question period to a challenge from the B.C. Liberal Opposition.

“We are seeking feedback on a response to federal legislation,” he told Mike Bernier the B.C. Liberal MLA for Peace River South. “To characterize this as somehow an NDP plan is a mischaracterization of the enormous challenges we face.”

In one breath he blamed the B.C. Liberals for letting the problem slide for more than a decade. In the next he appealed to Bernier “to work with us to try and find a way forward in the interest of his constituents, the B.C. economy and mountain caribou.”

But central to Bernier’s complaint — and to the 30,000-plus name petition he tabled in the house — was a concern he and his constituents had been cut out of the process until the last minute.

Public consultations on two caribou rescue plans — one for the northeast, the second for other parts of the Interior — only began this month.

The New Democrats have dictated that the process ends with the month as well.

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw dig into new legislation that bans ticket bots. Will the changes help you get a better price on your favourite concert tickets? They also delve into the politics around B.C.’s money-laundering scandal, parties flip-flopping over gas taxes and criticism of the carbon tax, and the Speaker’s attempt to clean up heckling at the legislature.

As for the “Ottawa made us do it” argument, one has to note the New Democrats are not always quick to say “how high?” when the federal government says “jump!”

They were not in the least submissive to Ottawa’s decision to twin the Trans Mountain pipeline, instead spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal actions. Nor did they simply accept the prospect of increased tanker traffic without a fight.

If the prospective loss of 500 B.C. forestry jobs did indeed originate with the Justin Trudeau federal government, Premier John Horgan could readily push back against that threat in the political arena.

His lines were practically written for him by columnist Merlin Nichols in a recent piece in the Dawson Creek Mirror.

“If we enact changes that result in massive job losses we are doing no one any good and we cannot be sure that the changes will benefit the caribou,” he wrote in part.

“Mr. Trudeau expressed a touching concern for the potential loss of 9,000 jobs, one of which might have been his, in Quebec.

“We understand, Mr. Trudeau, we really do. But 9,000 jobs in Quebec would be less painful to the body politic than 500 or more in our Northeast.”

Provincial officials maintain some reduction in access to the land base for forestry and other resource development is essential to protecting the caribou habitat.

But they also admit that (as one official put it last week) “you could stop all logging and industry today, and it would take decades for the habitat to recover, and you would still need predator control or other management.”

On that expectation, the province might try to preserve jobs now while experimenting with more proven methods of restoring populations.

The same provincial officials who made the case for reduced forestry have admitted the decline in caribou herds has been partly reversed by culling wolves.

Also promising is the use of pens to protect caribou calves from predators. One such experiment led to a five-fold increase in the number of survivors, a representative of the Salteau and West Moberly First Nations told a consultation session in Prince George this week.

The combination of culling wolves and penning pregnant cows offers the best hope of reversing a decline in caribou populations, according to a recent study by University of Alberta biologist Rob Serrouya.

He and his colleagues looked at 18 herds in Alberta and B.C., some managed, others not. The most promising results were in the managed herds where protective measures included killing wolves, penning cows and relocating the herds.

“It doesn’t mean recovery, “ Serrouya told Bob Weber of The Canadian Press, “but it means some of these herds have turned around.”

He also said those measures are better than trying to restore habitat damaged by oil, gas and forestry activity. The latter is too slow; herds don’t have the decades it would take to recover.

None of which says the New Democrats can put off the reckoning for as long as the Liberals did.

But neither is it necessary to impose an artificial timeline of barely a month, before finalizing a plan that could do so much damage to jobs and communities in the northeast.

Unlike the polished, visually appealing sites the governing NDP and opposition UCP have launched to attack each other in recent weeks, this one has the black-and-white esthetic of a Windows 95 text document. However bland and antiquated its look, though, it inserts a set of damning allegations into the middle of this Alberta election campaign.

The site, not-so-artfully named after the person running it, was launched earlier this month by lawyer and former power executive Robert Hemstock, who is currently suing the Alberta government, Deputy Premier Sarah Hoffman and NDP Premier Rachel Notley’s top spokesperson Cheryl Oates for defamation. It breaks down in lawyerly detail what Hemstock considers to be a series of mistakes the NDP government made as it changed the rules governing the province’s deregulated electricity market — moves he claims cost Alberta power consumers $2 billion, a niggling scandal of the NDP’s first term.

Hemstock filed the defamation suit in July 2018, based on events dating as far back as 2015, when Notley’s New Democrats were elected. The website went live after he filed a new affidavit on March 29.

He launched the suit because he believes the government unfairly blamed him for a series of contract cancellations in the power market in 2015 and 2016, based on a clause he helped negotiate into those contracts in 2000.

He launched the website because he wants to “expose” the details of the controversial episode, and because he believes the public doesn’t understand how or why those cancelled contracts ended up saddling consumers “with an estimated $2 billion in unnecessary costs” — and how the province could have avoided those mistakes in order to save Albertans money.

Both the suit and the website also appear to be an attempt by Hemstock to clear his name.

“It’s also about how our elected representatives in the Alberta Government used their position of power and access to taxpayer funds to attempt to achieve their political objective of avoiding accountability,” the website charges.

Hemstock declined to comment on the site because his defamation suit is still before the court but the affidavit filed March 29 contains a new allegation that the government has not provided all the documents requested in the case.

“That a decision was made to defame me, by implicating me as the cause of the loss of approximately $2 billion to electricity consumers, with no records showing how that decision was arrived at discloses the defendants have not discharged their obligation to provide all relevant material records,” Hemstock states in the affidavit.

“I’m not aware of anything new being filed, but because the matter is before the courts we won’t be commenting,” said Oates, who was Notley’s communications director before the writ dropped and is working on the NDP campaign.

It is a scandal. It is absolutely a scandal

Alberta’s electricity sector is unique in Canada and is confusing even for Albertans. The province has no Crown corporation like BC Hydro, SaskPower or Hydro Quebec that produces and distributes power to its residents. Instead a jumble of private-sector companies and some city-owned utilities like Calgary’s Enmax Corp. own the power plants, transmission lines and distribution networks while multiple provincial government agencies regulate or oversee the market.

In the middle of 2015, the province’s then-new NDP government increased the price industrial companies had to pay for emitting carbon in the province, which triggered an opt-out clause for many of those power producers, letting them cancel their contracts to purchase power in the province.

On his website, Hemstock called the price increase “a mistake” that government ought to have known would trigger the opt-out clause. Further mistakes, Hemstock alleges, include trying to deflect blame for the cancelled contracts, and specifically, going “on the offensive” by blaming him.

The government called the opt-out clause the “Enron clause,” after Enron Canada had asked for it to be added before that now-defunct company agreed to bid on power contracts.

Hemstock was in-house counsel for Enron Canada in the late 1990s when Alberta was in the midst of deregulating its electricity market and when the contracts in question were signed. He later joined Enmax as an executive.

In his defamation suit, Hemstock said he was employed by Enron Canada and “was not employed by nor did he advise (parent company) Enron Corporation in relation to any financial reporting obligations in the United States of America, at any time.”

Enron Corp. — rather than Enron Canada — collapsed amid a corporate scandal that included misleading investors and falsifying financial information.

In December 2015, Enmax became the first company to make use of the opt-out clause and handed the money-losing contracts it was holding over to an arms-length government agency called the Balancing Pool.

In the following months, other money-losing power contracts were also handed to the Balancing Pool, shifting the potential losses from the contracts from companies directly onto Albertans.

One power executive, speaking on condition of anonymity because they didn’t want to run afoul of the government or comment on the defamation case, said the case should be “a cautionary tale when it comes to political interference in the electric market” because electricity “is a complicated but essential commodity.”

The issue stirred up controversy in Alberta — though many residents don’t fully understand what happened — as the government moved to support the Balancing Pool through a loan.

“What I can’t fully grasp, and perhaps this is a failing on my part in opposition, is how it is that $2.2 billion has gone into the Balancing Pool, backstopped by Alberta taxpayers, and it isn’t the single greatest scandal that Albertans have seen,” said Greg Clark, then leader of the Alberta Party, in the province’s legislature in May 2017. “It is a scandal. It is absolutely a scandal.”

A decision was made to defame me

Industry groups have also sharply criticized how the government handled the series of cancelled contracts.

“Albertans should be concerned about the government’s $2.25-billion loan to the Balancing Pool and the mounting interest cost (about $400 million), which will need to be repaid,” the Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta said in a release.

The controversy is not a key focus in the current Alberta election, partly because it’s so complicated, but it is a point that parties have included in their platforms.

The UCP has promised that, if it forms government, it will “Ask the Auditor General of Alberta to conduct a special duty audit of the NDP-incurred financial losses on the power purchase agreements held through the Balancing Pool.”

In an emailed statement, the UCP said the NDP has not been transparent about their electricity market changes.

Hemstock’s defamation case is expected to drag on long after the April 16 election. He believes the government blamed him for the power contracts being handed over to the Balancing Pool.

In their statement of defence, the provincial government, Hoffman and Oates state they never referenced Hemstock directly and “as such, the statements cannot be defamatory or cause harm to the plaintiff, as alleged or at all.”

The defence also states that comments were made “as senior government officers in the performance of their official duties and are protected by absolute privilege” and their comments were “based on true facts about matters of public interest and are fair comment on a matter of public interest.”

CHARLOTTETOWN, P.E.I. - Gord McNeilly doesn’t see himself as a political opportunist.

The District 14 Charlottetown-West Royalty candidate makes no apologies for the fact that he’s running for the Liberals in this election after running for the NDP in the 2015 provincial vote.

McNeilly fell short in his 2015 effort by 109 votes to Liberal Kathleen Casey in District 14 Charlottetown-Lewis Point. The electoral maps were redrawn after the 2015 election.

“I’m proud of my past and have had really great discussions about that,’’ McNeilly told The Guardian, referring to the fact the issue has come up at the door. “I think I’ve found the right home and I’m going to use my abilities if I do get the opportunity to make everybody’s life a little bit better.’’

District 14 will be one to watch on April 23 as it’s one of only two ridings in the province (District 19 Borden-Kinkora is the other one) that features a five-way race to the legislature.

McNeilly is facing incumbent Bush Dumville who ran for the Liberals in 2015 and will run as an independent this time, Angus Birt for the Progressive Conservatives, Gavin Hall for the Green party and Janis Newman for the NDP.

When it comes to issues, McNeilly said housing and health care are the two big ones.

Dumville says affordable housing, mental health and wait times at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital have come up with him.

“I’m hearing a lot of affordable housing,’’ Dumville said. “People are just being squeezed and they’re going around trying to find better rent or better living conditions and they’re just a few hundred dollars short.’’

The candidates in District 14 Charlottetown-Lewis Point include, from left, Angus Birt, Bush Dumville, Gavin Hall, Gord McNeilly and Janis Newman.

The 2019 candidates

Angus Birt – Progressive Conservative

Bush Dumville – independent

Gavin Hall – Green

Gord McNeilly – Liberal

Janis Newman – NDP

Dumville said he’s running a modest campaign with no campaign office or telephone committee.

“Maybe we’re at a little bit of a disadvantage ... but I feel there is enough positive stuff out there in regards to me standing up to the premier.’’

Birt also points to affordable housing and health care as the two big issues.

“I have quite a bit of (low-income) housing in my area,’’ Birt said, adding that those residents like the PC promise to raise the low-income tax reduction program from $17,000 to $20,000.

Birt added that seniors are also happy his party is promising free shingles shots for those 60 years of age and older.

Hall identifies wait times at the hospital, access to a family doctor and the cost of housing, both in rentals and single-family homes, as major issues.

“A general theme is that people seem to be pretty disenfranchised, like they’re not really getting represented by the current government,’’ Hall said. “They may express that in different ways, but it seems to be an overarching theme I hear at the door.’’

Hall said he’s getting an overwhelmingly positive response at the door, saying people are ready for change and ready to vote Green.

Newman said mental health care and minimum wage are coming up at the door.

“I did get a feeling from those I spoke to that they want a change in leadership, a change in direction,’’ Newman said.

By Palak Mangat on April 12, 2019

Those looking to serve on the Yukon government’s commission on electoral reform will now have an extra week to submit their applications.

That’s after the deadline to apply was extended from April 26 to May 3.

That’s a move that Premier Sandy Silver said Wednesday afternoon came out of conversations with both opposition parties.

The government had initially come out with the call for applications in a release issued on Tuesday which noted an April 26 deadline.

Just a day later, on Wednesday afternoon, an update showed the release had been changed to note a May 3 deadline instead.

Speaking Wednesday after question period, Silver said his intention wasn’t for the process to drag on.

“We’re going to go through the process of listening to feedback” from the opposition parties to appoint the three-member group, he said.

The intent is to eventually make public the report the commission submits to the government later this fall.

That commission will serve a term from May for an estimated six months, but could extend to the end of this year.

According to the draft terms of reference, each commissioner is to be paid for about eight days of work every month for the six months.

The group’s total budget is just over $178,000, and includes secretariat support that includes research and administrative help.

The commission will look to include feedback found from the government’s public engagement, the results of which were made available earlier this week.

According to the draft terms of reference for the group, the mandate of it is to include the feedback to do three things.

They are investigating and assessing choices to:

• ensure the electoral system captures the intentions of voters as well as possible;

• improve how parties and elected officials operate; and

• improve how Yukoners make their voices heard.

If the group finds there is a need for electoral system reform based on feedback from Yukoners, it could suggest “the strongest electoral system for territorial elections and propose a way” to bring this suggestion forward to voters.

When looking at how to improve political parties and how elected officials work, there is to be a focus on fair and transparent elections as well as political fundraising and spending rules.

The last goal of improving how citizens make their voices heard includes making sure they have flexible and accessible voting choices, are registered to vote and have the necessary information to vote, as well as understand how government works.

As for the results themselves, under five per cent of respondents chose options that suggested they did not want to pursue electoral reform or have a commission.

If there is a need to change electoral systems, the same number of people who believe the role of the commission is to show the strongest system for territorial elections, feel it should also recommend a public education plan about other systems.

Other results show that half of respondents feel elected officials reflecting the diversity of the territory is important, but most believe fair and transparent elections and political fundraising and spending are more important.

The territory is just one Canadian jurisdiction looking at the topic of electoral reform; currently, all use the same “first-past-the-post” style, but areas like P.E.I. are to hold a referendum to gauge interest in switching systems later this month.

The Yukon’s southern neighbour, B.C., rejected making a change to proportional representation in a referendum late last year and opted for the status quo of first-past-the-post.

Brad Cathers, the Yukon Party critic for democratic institutions, objects to the delay in the process.

“The Liberals have been caught trying to stack the deck on electoral reform in favour of the Liberal Party,” he said Thursday.

“Now, barely 24 hours after he made the original announcement for the electoral reform commission, the premier has conveniently delayed the appointment of the commission until after the legislature rises. It is clear that the premier is trying to avoid the scrutiny of the legislature and avoid criticism of his one-party- decides-all approach to electoral reform.”

The party is calling on the government to rethink its “non-collaborative approach to electoral reform” and work with all parties to ensure a fair and balanced process, Cathers added.

The NDP also furthered its critique of the selection process Thursday, as MLA Kate White asked if the premier would press pause to gather all-party support.

“In order for the committee to be successful and to be considered legitimate, the terms of reference and the principles guiding its mandate need to be agreed upon by all political parties in the legislative assembly,” White said.

“But when one party is calling all the shots and shortlisting the candidates, that is the textbook definition of partisanship.”

Silver countered by saying he will commit to working with both opposition parties and reiterated that the draft terms of reference were just that – a draft.

“When it comes to the short list, we will be happy to work with the opposition,” he said, adding that “any names that they want to put forward, or any names that they have exceptions to, of course, we will work with them on that as well.”

Meanwhile, Sally Wright, with Fair Vote Yukon, felt the premier is placing too much on his shoulders.

Speaking to reporters Thursday, Wright added the group has put forth the idea of a citizens’ assembly, with such groups having been created over the years in areas like Ontario and B.C.

Wright, an NDP hopeful in the 2016 election for the riding of Kluane (held by the Yukon Party’s Wade Istchenko), echoed the party’s worry that the work of the commission could run too broad.

“There’s many things in here that are already covered by the Elections Act,” she said of the terms and survey results.

“We want to talk about the vote; very clear, concise,” she said, echoing NDP Leader Liz Hanson.

Simone Webster has been nominated to be the NDP candidate in District 13.

Webster moved to Charlottetown from her native Switzerland in 2001 for what she thought would be a one-year stay in Canada as a doctor of veterinary medicine at the AVC.

In the nearly 20 years since then, she has acquired a husband (Campbell Webster), two children, Louis and Sophie, and Canadian citizenship.

""Today, I love the Island as much as I love the Swiss Alps,"" she said.

It is on the Island that Webster became active in social justice pursuits, helping to found Canada’s Veterinarians Without Borders, serving on the boards of the Voluntary Resource Council, as well as the CW Foundation, which supports social justice projects in Atlantic Canada and Latin America.

Internationally, Webster and her husband regularly visit Central America, where they work with poverty reduction and human rights groups.

Webster says every economic decision the province takes has to be carefully weighed for its connection to the social and ecologic well-being of society and the Island.

Maybe the old dear should tuck up her borders and go for counselling.

For now, the province is stuck with two amateur therapists who are not doing great things for collective mental health.

There’s UCP Leader Jason Kenney, who believes the best medicine is to spray the anger in every direction, from B.C. to Ottawa and many directions here at home.

He threatens revenge on the federal government and B.C., both through the courts and with new laws. Not yet done with this campaign, he’s already fighting the next one, against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Kenney shouts all this at rallies, sometimes from his pickup truck. He is wildly cheered by the desperate, unemployed victims of a wounded economy.

Then there’s NDP Leader Rachel Notley, who counsels a quieter, calmer approach, lest the anger run out of control and end up backfiring on Alberta.

But while Notley speaks reasonably, her campaign acts every bit as angry as Kenney, with one of the most vitriolic attack agendas ever seen in Canada.

Multiple websites assail Kenney, revealing his past words as well as the utterances of various fringy UCP candidates.

Some of this stuff we had to know; I, for one, am boggled to learn that the West Yellowhead riding may soon have an MLA who thinks yoga is a sin.

The kamikaze candidate scandal, mainly inflicted on the United Conservatives by other conservatives, is also a matter of real public concern.

But the messages from both sides are as relentless as a pounding headache. Anger mounts. The bizarre lawn sign takedown Wednesday was just a small taste of it.

Most Albertans are more interested in solutions than anger or vengeance. They want good government, a strong economy, social fairness, and even — for somewhat older folks — a return to Alberta’s storied values of mutual help and social cohesion.

These qualities are not coming back to politics anytime soon. The well is already poisoned for the next legislature, no matter who’s running it.

When a political system is healthy, opponents on policy and ideology can still respect and like each other personally. They often meet and collaborate on sensible answers for the public.

That will be a lost art in the legislature, maybe for years. Whichever party wins will stick its policies down the other’s throat.

A telling moment came during the TV debate, when Notley accused the UCP of bigotry and intolerance, and Kenney said her comments were “just defamatory.”

He looked genuinely furious. This rivalry is no longer just political. It’s bitter and personal.

But for Alberta’s sake, there has to be a middle road between Kenney’s promises to strike out at enemies, and Notley’s trust in the powers of persuasion.

In my view, Alberta does have to look tougher on the national scene.

I don’t see any problem with a referendum on equalization, for instance. It would be purely symbolic — we have to admit that — but would also send a powerful message, and educate other Canadians about the unfairness of this loaded deck.

We also have to fight unfair laws such as Bill C-69 and C-48; not just because they endanger the economy but because they violate the province’s ownership of natural resources and hence the right to develop them.

Related

Those rights were won in 1930 after a long struggle. No slapdash federal government should be allowed to steal them away now.

But never, in fighting for Alberta, should the rest of Canada come to see us as a hostile fortress of angry citizens.

This is where Notley has it right. She points out that B.C. — and certainly Ottawa — have their own powers that can be turned back on Alberta.

Alberta anger is deep and genuine, she says, “but as a leader, you shouldn’t exploit it, ever, and you definitely shouldn’t be exploiting it in a way that can actually undercut your ability to get the thing done that would help the people who are angry.”

Good advice. Alberta may someday take it, after counselling.

And, amid this political soap opera that is so blatantly transparent in its partisanship, we should also pause and remember that no political party is innocent in this land title tumult.

article continues below

The current NDP government certainly deserves to have its knuckles rapped for making an utter mess of this issue.

To recap, the two Kamloops B.C. Liberal MLAs — Todd Stone and Peter Milobar — were doing their jobs well when, a couple of months ago, they mentioned hearing rumours the Kamloops land title office might be closing.

It turns out they were on to something. While the office isn’t scheduled to close (yet), land title officials finally confirmed to media that documents stored here would be moving to Victoria and that staff in Kamloops would be leaving their offices in the Kamloops Law Courts to a yet-to-be-determined location in the city.

In a March 21 email to KTW reporter Sean Brady, the Land Title and Survey Authority said:

“We are currently seeking alternate space in Kamloops, which will be a smaller, modern office in keeping with the quality of our other land title offices in Victoria and New Westminster.

“The Kamloops hard copy records will be moving to our state-of-the-art vault space in Victoria, where they will be conserved as required. There will be no reduction in staff in our Kamloops office.”

That was close as anybody has come, as far as I can tell, in trying to find out why the records are being moved.

That they are being moved without consultations with local MLAs, city council or First Nations in the area is offensive.

And it has prompted Whispering Pines Clinton Indian Band Chief Michael LeBourdais to launch legal action this week to stop the movement of the original documents.

While the current NDP government, from Premier John Horgan down to Forests Minister Doug Donaldson (whose ministry administers land title registries), should be criticized for this boondoggle, let’s not forget that other governments under different political flags have done exactly the same thing with land title offices — including the B.C. Liberals.

For more than a century, there had been seven land title offices in the province: Kamloops, Nelson, Prince George, Prince Rupert, New Westminster, Vancouver and Victoria.

Following the NDP’s election in 1991, those seven offices began to be reduced, with Vancouver records moving to New Westminster, Prince Rupert records moving to Prince George and Nelson records moving to Kamloops.

In 2003, under the B.C. Liberals, the Prince George land title office was closed and all its records moved to New Westminster. At that time, the B.C. Liberals also announced plans to close the Kamloops and Victoria land title offices and move those records to New Westminster.

(So, as we can see, such decisions are not exclusive to particular political parties.)

But, as a Kamloops Daily News article of April 5, 2003, notes, then-premier Gordon Campbell was praising a plan by Kamloopsians — including then-mayor Mel Rothenburger — to convince the province to instead move the New Westminster records to Kamloops and use this city as a centralized land title registry.

Alas, Vancouver city council and others in the Lower Mainland balked at the plan, leaving the land title grouping as we see it today.

This brief history illustrates that how dastardly a government decision is remains predicated on which side of the legislature aisle one sits.

“I am honoured to take on the role of Justice Critic for the NDP and to continue on in my role as International Trade Critic,” Ramsey said in a news release.

“I look forward to working with people from across Canada to build a stronger, fairer justice system that values Canadians equally.”

On Thursday, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced 14 changes to the party’s critic roles and responsibilities. He named Saskatoon West MP Sheri Benson as one of two deputy leaders along with Alexandre Boulerice, MP for Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie, who was named deputy leader with special responsibility for Quebec.

Ramsey said she was proud that Singh appointed her to the high-profile portfolios and added that she will follow in the footsteps of distinguished NDP justice critics including former Windsor-Tecumseh MP Joe Comartin.

“I will continue to speak out and fight for fairness and justice for all.”

The last several free trade deals negotiated by Conservative and Liberal government were meant to profit large multinational corporations, she said.

“Canadians have felt it increasingly difficult to get by — that there is a growing gap between the powerful, connected insiders and everyone else,” she said.

The assembled group, which included everyone from young professionals to retirees to one mother who brought along her two kids, belonged to the local chapter of Extinction Rebellion (XR). The recently viral environmental movement was founded in the United Kingdom last year and has since grabbed headlines by blockading landmarks, including London bridges, in its quest to get politicians to address climate change.

XR, which has chapters in at least thirty-five countries, is driven by a sense of urgency around the impending impacts of our changing planet. A new report from the International Panel on Climate Change stressed that climate change will render swathes of the earth uninhabitable within the century unless drastic changes are made. It now appears that we in Canada will almost certainly miss our commitment, made under the Paris agreement, to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to 30 percent below our 2005 level by 2030. Instead of being content to continue on with the status quo of incremental changes, members of XR in Canada, drawing inspiration from rising stars like Swedish student Greta Thunberg and US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are calling for a rapid move away from of oil-sands, and other fossil-fuel, extraction, with a corresponding government-sponsored economic transition to a zero-emissions economy by 2030.

Members of XR Edmonton got together on that night to brainstorm ways to participate in a worldwide week of civil disobedience slated to begin April 15. The goal of the local chapter is to pressure Alberta’s and Canada’s leaders into initiating a “World War Two–style mobilization” to kick-start a transition to a fossil-fuel-free economy within a decade. A few weeks earlier, XR Edmonton had participated in a march through the downtown core, which drew more than 100 demonstrators. The scenarios proposed for the week of April 15 ranged from the artistic to the disruptive but typically involved the high-visibility occupation of an Edmonton landmark.

Not on the docket for the evening was a discussion of Alberta’s upcoming provincial election, on April 16. Notley’s NDP may be the most progressive government that the province has had in decades, or ever. But, even so, committed environmentalists may have a hard time cheering for the party. Premier Notley is not an environmentalist, and her promotion of pipelines, such as the stalled Trans Mountain expansion, on the national stage has made her seem like the antithesis of one. Still, her NDP’s approach to the environment is a step removed from that of the conservative governments that preceded her and is at odds with those now itching to regain power. The NDP’s main challenger, the United Conservative Party (UCP)—currently ahead 8 to 19 percent, depending on the poll—has proposed cutting back the modest environmental policies that the NDP spent years putting in place.

One of the questions environmentalists must ask when evaluating Notley, and other progressive candidates across the country, is whether they need to make a decision between being pragmatic and principled. Does Notley represent how far a politician can go to push emissions reductions in Alberta without courting electoral suicide, or could a more ambitious program of drastic emission cuts, like those recommended by scientists, XR, and other environmentalist groups, actually be possible with the right kind of push?

Since its surprise victory in 2015, the Alberta NDP has enacted a series of incremental environmental measures, including the establishment an energy-efficiency agency, the financing of clean-energy and infrastructure projects, and the expansion of protected areas. However, it was its Climate Leadership Plan (CLP), which was announced with much fanfare six months after the party’s victory, that represented the largest cultural shift. The multipronged strategy included a plan to phase out coal electricity generation, to put a cap on oil-sands emissions, and to implement a carbon tax. It also stated the goal of achieving one-third of power generation from renewable sources by 2030.

Notley, however, has also seemed to value the CLP for its ability to grant Alberta the social legitimacy needed to sell oil from the oil sands, which use a steam-heating extraction process that has a large carbon footprint compared to conventional oil extraction. She was quoted in the Edmonton Journal invoking then US president Barack Obama’s rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline and his designation of the oil sands as “dirty oil” as a reason to adopt the CLP.

This strategy of pushing environmental protection as a way to continue destructive resource extraction is a gamble that could alienate all voters. Speaking in the provincial leadership debate on April 4, Notley contrasted her approach to building pipelines with that of her main opponent, Jason Kenney, a former Harper cabinet minister and leader of the UCP: “I didn’t just talk to echo chambers of people who already agreed with us,” she said. “I spoke to people who were opposed to pipelines, and I changed their opinions.” The result, she said, is that “we’ve gone from four in ten to seven in ten Canadians supporting pipelines.”

Whether her approach will actually satisfy voters remains to be seen. It’s unclear if any of the crude-oil pipelines currently on the drawing board will actually be built (two projects, Keystone XL and Enbridge’s Line 3, are held up in the US regulatory system). The province is now recovering from a recession that started in 2014—induced in part by low oil prices and stalled pipelines—and Notley is facing a sour electorate.

According to pollster Janet Brown of Janet Brown Opinion Research, most Albertans don’t blame Notley for failing to deliver Trans Mountain, which has been suspended by a federal court order pending new consultations. But, says Brown, “they are frustrated that her efforts didn’t result in ‘social licence’ to build pipelines, as she promised it would.” Brown argues that Albertans aren’t entirely convinced that Kenney’s approach would be more effective than Notley’s, but many residents would like to see their provincial government be more aggressive in pursuing pipelines. Kenney and the UCP’s approach includes a stated intention to scrap Notley’s signature environmental programs, including the coal phase-out and the provincial carbon tax, and he has announced his intention to challenge the federal carbon tax in court.

The province’s environmentalists will undoubtedly stay away from the UCP. But the question in this election is whether they can still accept Notley and her pursuit of pipelines as the lesser of two evils.

While the NDP faces its critics on the right, environmentalists on the left say that the much-hyped CLP didn’t go far enough. Some parts duplicate existing federal programs, and others have been described as greenwashing. The oil-sands cap, for example, is set at 100 megatonnes of carbon emissions annually. That number is actually about thirty megatonnes above current emissions for the sector.

Still, the program was proactive by Canadian standards. For example, the provincial carbon tax, introduced in 2017, pre-empted the federal tax that came into force this month. One tangible benefit to Albertans is that the province’s program sees the money goes into provincial revenue, instead of to the feds. The Notley government puts this money toward rebates to consumers and toward green investments, including transit expansions, incentives to help consumers switch to more energy-efficient housing, and programs to switch to clean electricity generation in First Nations and Métis communities.

NDP spokesperson Leah Holoiday says that the coal phase-out has already reduced Alberta’s emissions by seven megatonnes a year. (This is a drop in the bucket compared to the province’s total annual emissions of 263 megatonnes, measured in 2016, though Holoiday argues that its programs will equal up to seventy-five megatonnes of emissions savings by 2030.)

All these environmental savings are projected as comparisons to a business-as-usual scenario in which emissions continue to grow. But scientists and researchers are arguing that a slight decline or a levelling off of emissions is not enough—radical cuts are needed to prevent the worst-case scenarios of climate change. Even if Alberta meets the projections in the CLP, the province’s emissions in 2030 will equal about 260 megatonnes, which is roughly what they are today.

Duncan Kenyon is director of the Edmonton chapter of the Pembina Institute, a think tank that advocates for green energy. He says that both government and the environmental lobby have done a poor job of explaining how a carbon tax is an effective tool for reducing emissions and attenuating the destructive effects of climate change, like forest fires, that Albertans are already feeling. “We haven’t brought people along to buy into what we have on paper right now,” he says.

Kenyon argues that the Notley government is facing the consequences of its instrumentalist approach to the CLP. Its vision, says Kenyon was “let’s do this climate-change [mitigation] because it’ll make all the opponents [to our pipelines] go away.” In a world where all crude-oil pipeline options are currently delayed, that approach has left Notley looking like a weak negotiator. Kenyon argues that it would have been more strategic to promote the CLP on its own merits, emphasizing the impacts that climate change is already having on Alberta, like floods and forest fires, and branding the CLP as part of a strategy to fight those natural disasters. He says that Albertans are genuinely concerned about climate change and that neither the NDP government nor advocacy groups have made a forceful enough case for policy that could deal with it. “We never connected that emotional understanding that our economy needs to change,” he says. “We never said, ‘Here is how you do it.’”

In the course of my interactions with the Edmonton chapter of XR, it seemed like the environmentalists’ attitudes to Notley were divided. “[Notley has] done a lot of great things for the province,” said Linda Fontaine, a retired bus driver. “There’s a solar program, and she’s put money into a lot of renewable-energy projects. And, if she gets another term, we’re going to see those things get a lot more financial backing.” Others, like science teacher and Green Party candidate Tanya Herbert, are more critical. “If she gets into power again, it’s going to be a heck of a lot better than any UCP government, which I’m absolutely fearing,” she said. But she can’t avoid looking at the last four years as a partially missed opportunity. “I wish that she would have had the bravery over the last four years to let Albertans see that we’re stronger than oil and gas. We’re more than oil and gas.”",Rachel Notley's Support for Pipelines Could Cost the NDP the Election,The Walrus,https://thewalrus.ca/rachel-notleys-support-for-pipelines-could-cost-the-ndp-the-election/

So imagine my surprise when I watched NDP Leader Ryan Meili take a run at Jason for 13 minutes during question period on April 1, fittingly, April Fool’s Day. Conveniently he did this where he had parliamentary privilege, and can say whatever he wants without reprisal. I say that because his allusions bordered on slanderous.

Jason is not a politician, nor does he intend to be. He will be the first to tell you that he’s a farmer, first and foremost, but I will expand on that and note he is a damned good one, and a successful auctioneer, to boot.

The last three months have been rather remarkable for him. Being an ardent opponent of our current prime minister, he made sure he was right at the front of the line to get into the very-short notice town hall session Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held in Regina on Jan. 10. Doing so placed him front row, centre, opposite the TV cameras so that he was in almost ever shot. And being there, he was fortunate enough to be handpicked by Trudeau to ask a question. Jason let him have it on the carbon tax. Trudeau promptly turned that around to talk about “putting a price on pollution.”

This led to Jason being invited to take part in a convoy to Ottawa to protest that very thing, among others, on Feb. 19. This became known as the United We Roll! convoy to Ottawa. It very specifically dropped any association with the yellow vest movement, but did not tell people who wore yellow vests to stay home.

Jason never once wore a yellow vest, nor did he carry a sign with some of the yellow vests more questionable issues, like the United Nations and immigration. When I wrote a column regarding how the yellow vest moniker had become tainted (which Meili, himself, quoted last week), it was precisely with this in mind.

Jason delivered the longest speech on Parliament Hill when that convoy made it to Ottawa, saying, “In my hometown of Estevan, Saskatchewan, we are known as the Energy City. We are proud of that claim and proud of our city, but Prime Minister Trudeau’s policies have had profound impacts on our community. The state of uncertainty has clouded investments, killed jobs, eroded community support for programs, made it difficult for businesses to obtain and retain qualified employees, decreased property values and turned people’s dreams and hopes of an amazing life into a nightmare.”

Pretty radical stuff, huh? He spoke in particular about climate change, clean coal, and the carbon tax, and I watched all of it on live feeds on Facebook.

Coming back from that convoy, several of the participants, including Jason, soon started planning one of their own, to Regina. Their message would be four points, and four points only – fight the carbon tax, build pipelines, kill Bill C-69 and kill Bill C-48. And that’s it. No talk of anything that would take away from that energy and carbon tax message.

I wasn’t there on Day 1, but I was there on Day 2, and pretty much every other day, covering this planned convoy and rally in Regina from the get-go.

And I was there when Jason LeBlanc, at the very beginning of that first key organization meeting, stood up and said they needed to be clear, in no uncertain terms, “yellow vests prohibited.”

And it was at his insistence, with the concurrence of the rest of the organizers, that those very words appeared on the poster, drafted that morning. That was a group decision, but one led by him. And a lot of people who had been die-hard yellow vesters slagged him mercilessly as a result.

At the time, I expected that if any of the key organizers of the United We Roll convoy with former ties with the yellow vest movement became involved with this new rally, they would be tarred and feathered by those in favour of the carbon tax. I had expected it from the CBC. I did not expect it from the leader of the opposition.

Meili led off question period by quoting a post online questioning climate change, goading the premier into identifying how might have said it. Premier Scott Moe did not take the bait.

Then Meili smeared Jason by saying the following, “And one of the main organizers and the spokesperson for this rally — the spokesperson for the group that the premier has accepted to address — is a fellow by the name of Jason LeBlanc.

“And Jason attended the rebranded yellow vest convoy event in Ottawa, the event that featured Faith Goldy among other great luminaries, Mr. Speaker. And he gave a speech at that rally, and in his speech he described himself as a ‘man-made climate change doomsday denier.’ And he said that the Prime Minister is someone who ‘. . . manipulates society through basic human needs and wants to make the globe a one-world government,’ Mr. Speaker.

“Far-out-there conspiracy theories, climate change denial, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic sentiment — this is what the yellow vest movement has become, Mr. Speaker. And I do not understand, but I’d like the Premier to explain why he wants to be associated with that group,” Meili asked of Moe.

Let me point out some the glaring issues with that statement. First, having followed the United We Roll! convoy intently through the lead up and the event, at no point did Faith Goldy come into the consideration. To the best of my knowledge, she just showed up and started talking, making a scene right in the centre of the counter protest. I don’t think Jason had ever even heard of her before that day, and yet Meili tried to draw some sort of association to one of the most politically blackballed people in the nation.

Regarding being a doomsday denier, yes, Jason did say that. And I have said similar things, many times, questioning the argument for anthropogenic climate change. I have pointed out in this column numerous times that no one, including climate change scientists I have spoke to, have been able to give me an adequate answer on how is it Canada was almost entirely covered with ice for 80,000 of the last 100,000 years, and yet it melted, and it wasn’t my gas guzzling SUV or the two coal-fired power plants six miles from my house that caused it to melt, either.

But you see, Meili used the strategy of calling anyone who does not conform to current orthodoxy, the religion of anthropogenic (man-made) climate change, for all intents and purposes, a heretic. They should be totally discredited in all that they say and do! Burn them at the stake!

That is what Meili implied in his line of questioning. If Jason LeBlanc had the audacity to question climate change, then how could Premier Moe dare associate himself with anything related to Jason, including the rally he has been working to organize.

I am just waiting for the day when I am given the same treatment. Heretic! Burn him!

And let’s not forget the biggest slur of the all – in the same breadth, Meili seemed to associate “anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic sentiment” with Jason. Those were precisely the things that Jason stood up against when I saw him vehemently argue for “yellow vests prohibited.” And there wasn’t any real argument, because the organizers were all on the same page.

But don’t let reality get in the way of a good smear job, Mr. Meili.

What Jason has been fighting against is this carbon tax. By one estimate he’s seen, it may cost his family of five $6 per acre, each year. Now this is my argument: His farm, at 15,000 acres, equates to $18,000 in carbon tax impact for each member of his family. Should his 12-year old daughter who, goes to school with my son, be responsible for $18,000 in carbon tax, and going up every year?

Are those numbers accurate? We don’t know. And one of the motivating factors here is the fear of the unknown. We don’t know for sure what the impact will be. But we do know it will double in two years, and keep going up beyond that.

That is the reality Jason LeBlanc will soon have to contend with. That is the reality farmers across this province will contend with. That is why he’s went toe-to-toe with Trudeau in Regina. That’s why his grain truck was parked at the gates of Parliament. That’s why he gave a speech in a snowbank. And that’s why he’s been working so hard to get this Regina Rally Against the Carbon Tax on April 4.

Maybe more people should be following his example.

The voter turnout numbers come in the wake of a new poll showing the UCP’s lead is shrinking with just days left until election day.

A poll by Angus Reid shows that the NDP has narrowed the gap by 12 percentage points, but the United Conservatives are still holding strong.

FULL SURVEY

The lead for the UCP comes mainly from the party’s strength in Calgary and rural ridings, while the NDP holds a substantial lead in Edmonton.

The poll also looked at the approval of the party leaders, with 57 per cent saying Rachel Notley hasn’t done enough to stand up to the oil and gas industry.

About 53 per cent of respondents said Jason Kenney is the best leader to deal with issues surrounding the energy sector.

This interview has been edited for clarity and concision.

Q: As we all know the economy is struggling, particularly here in Calgary, the unemployment rate is still high. Why should Albertans give you another chance if things haven’t turned around in the last couple of years?

A: The key thing is we have an economic plan. We have a plan to balance the budget, we have a plan to create jobs and what Jason Kenney is talking about actually puts that in jeopardy on a number of different fronts. To the degree that he has a plan, people should be worried that it’s actually going to make the situation worse.

His whole plan is we’re going to give a massive, historic corporate tax cut and then new jobs will magically reappear. What we’re seeing across the board is that doesn’t actually work.

Contrast that with what we are focused on which is diversifying the economy as a whole and diversifying our energy industry so our diversification efforts can serve as a hedge against the drop in the price of oil.

We have a made in Alberta plan which has already incented about $13 billion worth of investment with just under $1 billion worth of incentives—primarily royalty credits. We’ve proposed to multiply that seven-fold.

Q: In 2015, you raised the corporate income tax and at the time that was a popular move. But it hasn’t brought in more corporate income. In hindsight was it the best move or was it the popular move?

A: I do think it was the best move because we’re comparing it to what corporate income tax was before the price of oil went down. I think that we are getting more income through those increased corporate taxes than we would have had we not increased it. It’s very convenient for people to say ‘Oh, well the amount of the corporate income revenue went down.’ Well, yes, because the price of oil dropped by 70 per cent, so I do think it is the right thing and particularly when you compare it to overall we continue to be the most competitive place to do business by a long shot.

With the absence of a sales tax, we do have an $11 billion tax advantage over the next lowest tax province and those provinces have a whole series of other problems like housing and affordability. They struggle to attract people. We don’t have that problem. So we continue to be a great place to invest. The merits of this massive corporate tax cut when economists use it, it’s typically when you’re going from being over taxed to becoming competitive or really super competitive. When you’re going from already being competitive to more competitive, it doesn’t bring in the same investment.

Q: A future Alberta government, whether it’s yours or Kenney’s, is going to have to look at tax increases. Is that part of the conversation that you’re having right now?

A: We’re not. We’re still in the recovery stage and to be quite frank I’ve been very clear in this campaign that we’re not looking at increasing taxes outside of the pricing changes that would occur as part of the Climate Leadership Plan [the carbon tax], should the Trans Mountain pipeline get back under construction. We are very much hoping our personal income taxes and corporate income taxes, not the rate, but what comes in through our investment diversification.

Q: One of the things that Kenney keeps on coming back to is the Trudeau-Notley alliance. What is the nature of your political relationship with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau right now?

A: The nature of my relationship is one that you would expect to see between a premier of a province that is engaged in a determined, strategic, well informed, deliberate effort at advocating on behalf of the people of their province.

In his role as Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau has the authority to make critical decisions that have an impact on the people of this province therefore it is worth it for me to be able to engage in a conversation that doesn’t involve solely name calling and political grandstanding. We don’t always agree on things; I have called him out on things, but it is strategic. And it’s strategic to the long term goal. It’s not about using the relationship with the federal government as a political backdrop to my own political objectives, it’s about working the relationship with the long term objectives of what Albertans need from their federal government in line.

It’s not an alliance and it’s not a war. It’s a mature intergovernmental relationship and, frankly, something that Albertans should expect from their leaders.

Q: Has the relationship gotten worse over time as things have become rockier over things like the stalled Trans Mountain pipeline?

A: I think it’s changed. It is not one particular line as it’s gotten worse or it’s gotten better. Sometimes it’s better and sometimes it’s more challenged. It depends on the issues as they come up, because we certainly don’t hesitate to call them out both publicly and privately. We need to advocate for Albertans.

Q: One of the criticisms that is lobbed against you is when you first came to power you opposed Northern Gateway. With the benefit of hindsight, do you regret opposing Northern Gateway?

A: I would say that to some degree yes. I realize now that I have a better understanding of the takeaway capacity needs and pipeline needs of our industry, and I realize now what we’re coming up against and we see what’s happened with the differential. And the degree of uncertainty when you’re dealing with Line 3 and KXL. You’re a hostage to U.S. fortune there.

What I will say is that most people who have really dug into the issue will agree that Northern Gateway was essentially dead before I was elected and before the Prime Minister was elected because of the depth and breadth of the judicial critique around everything associated with that application. Some would argue that [Stephen] Harper himself would do that.

That’s why I did what I did with C-48 yesterday [Notley opposed the federal Liberals’ bill which would place a moratorium on much oil tanker traffic along the northern section of the West Coast.] We know we need to get our products to different markets and going west is a good way to do that.

Q: What should the Alberta government do about C-48 and Bill C-69 (the federal government’s overhaul of the regulatory structure overseeing major infrastructure like pipelines)?

A: What we’re doing right now is we are working with many, many people. On C-69, we’ve worked with the industry, we’ve worked with other provinces to develop the suite of recommendations that would achieve the objectives that the federal government is trying to achieve, but at the same time provide the certainty that industry needs so that we don’t kill investment.

It’s the same kind of approach that will need to go ahead with C-48 in its current form. I’m not convinced that with the timing being what it is that it will. But if it is we’re just going to have to keep fighting and that’s exactly what we will do. We will get more information and align with more Canadians and we will push hard and leverage where necessary and do the things that a provincial government does when we need to push back on an ill-advised decision of the federal government.

Q: Do you think the federal government would shut down the Trans Mountain expansion if the oil sands emissions cap doesn’t go through (as per Jason Kenney’s promise).

A: Kenney is literally jeopardizing the pipeline at this point. Politics is politics, we’re going into a [federal] election period and so what the federal government is going to do is it’s going to listen to what voters want them to do in places where they need votes—B.C., Ontario, Quebec. I spent the last three-and-a-half years having a reasonable conversation with Canadians about the need for the pipeline.

If I’m not here and Jason Kenney is here and starts randomly trying to turn off the taps, creating massive amounts of investor uncertainty with that, by the way, and then demonizing Canadians outside of Alberta then I think the public support for the pipeline will start to go down.

The federal government was clear that our emissions cap was part of their deal in terms of approving it. Mr. Kenney wants to blow that up for no apparent reason, so I think it’s a risk.

Q. Are you angry at Justin Trudeau?

A: No. I have no particular emotion one way or another. It’s a working relationship.

Q: After the 2015 election, you were pretty candid that you weren’t necessarily expecting to win. That this was something that happened by surprise. Are you expecting the win this time and are you prepared for that?

A: I’m super prepared. I’m very proud of the team we’ve pulled together, not to mention the team that’s running again. They’ve matured and handled the pressure of government [in a way] that should be inspiring to all people who want to get into politics, actually. Because there were some regular folks that stepped up to run because of what they believed in and they found themselves in positions that they didn’t necessarily expect to be in and they have all risen to the occasion.

But now, there’s no question that where we’re at from a party perspective, our organization so much better, our contacts, our reach, our engagement across the province; if there were a word I could use that would take it beyond qualitative, I would.

Q: What are you going to do if Jason Kenney becomes premier, what is your plan?

A: That is a hypothetical question that I am not interested in engaging in now because I’m still planning on being Premier.

Both the B.C. Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association say Minister of Solicitor General and Public Safety Mike Farnworth’s additions to the 2013 law violate rights such as the presumption of innocence when charged with a crime and due process in the court system.

article continues below

The groups said the changes violate the Constitution’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms section on right to life, liberty and security of the person.

“They can think whatever they like,” Farnworth said April 9 as he defended the changes, saying similar acts have been passed in other provinces and that local governments support the proposals.

Farnworth said B.C.’s amended law is similar to those in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Yukon.

However, only the Alberta, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick laws go as far as apparently presuming people to be guilty based on past convictions.

But, when a Nova Scotia couple was evicted under a community safety order in that province’s legislation, the courts upheld the order. The court found that the property was habitually used for the possession, use, consumption, sale, transfer or exchange of illicit drugs. It said previous convictions were not needed to corroborate that fact. The court said that police observations of known drug dealers, confessions of drug use and multiple anonymous complaints established a problem property.

“The impugned activity need not be daily, continual or permanent,” the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal ruled in 2012. “Occasional activity implying ongoing conduct would suffice.”

Farnworth said B.C.’s bill has passed a legal review.

“We have every confidence in it,” Farnworth said, adding people in communities around B.C. are tired of nuisance properties and drug houses.

Farnworth said April 4 that Bill 13 will help crack down on such properties.

The law would allow people to make confidential complaints to a dedicated government unit, Farnworth said April 4 as he announced the 2013 law would be revamped and enforced.

The original act was passed in 2013 after being presented by then-minister of Justice Shirley Bond.

While it allowed confidential complaints, the legislation did not specify use of previous convictions or that officials need not testify to those offences as the current bill does.

Liberal attorney general critic Michael Lee, a lawyer, said the 2013 law tried to balance legal rights and community concerns.

“This government has had a tendency to step all over those rights,” Lee said, pointing to the looming ICBC minor injuries claims cap as another example.

Lee said the Liberals would be addressing concerns about the community safety bill when it gets to committee stage.

Targets of complaints would have evidence of their past criminal convictions presented to courts as evidence of current wrongdoing.

The civil liberties associations say the law strips British Columbians of the constitutional right to face an accuser, pits landlords against tenants and will put the poor and mentally ill onto the streets during a housing crisis.

The bill provides for so-called certificates to be presented to courts. They would include previous criminal convictions of people at problem sites that are subject of anonymous reports.

The ministry said prior convictions are relevant because “they are proof that specified activities have been occurring at or in close proximity to the property. Previous criminal convictions may also show how the community is being adversely impacted.”

The ministry also said including people’s past convictions reduce court administrative burdens, meaning investigating officers needn’t testify, and that less evidence would “have to be gathered and submitted to the court to prove that specified activities are occurring that are adversely impacting the community when there is a lengthy criminal history associated with the property.”

The ministry said the lower standard of proof required under the bill would allow a court to accept that alleged offenses are occurring given similar offense had happened in the past.

Victoria lawyer Michael Mulligan, a member of Lawyers’ Rights Watch Canada, said Farnworth should be discussing “whether it’s wise, fair, or reasonable, to permit people to be evicted from their home based on anonymous reports, or things they may have done in the distant past.”

“There is some significant risk that this legislation will be used by landlords as a mechanism to evict tenants, without needing to go through the residential tenancy process, so that they can raise rents, Mulligan said.

“It would be entirely possible to design legation that would meet the reasonable objective of ensuring communities aren’t inappropriately disrupted by unlawful activity without resorting to anonymous reports, or decision making based on past, rather than present, behavior,” Mulligan said.

Canadian Civil Liberties Association executive director and former Ontario attorney general Michael Bryant said April 8 the bill poses “significant constitutional risk.”

It targets people struggling with poverty and with mental health and addiction issues, Bryant said.

B.C. Attorney General David Eby, former executive director of the B.C. Civil Liberties Association and PIVOT Legal Society, which advocates for the poor, has championed the rights of the underprivileged in the past.

“Minister Eby is not available for an interview,” his staff said, directing Glacier Media back to Farnworth’s office.

Farnworth stressed the tools in the act will target criminals operating in neighbours and will be in addition to the existing justice regime, not an alternative to it.",Updated: NDP's Farnworth defends new law against charge it violates democratic rights,CoastReporter VOICE OF THE SUNSHINE COAST,https://www.coastreporter.net/updated-ndp-s-farnworth-defends-new-law-against-charge-it-violates-democratic-rights-1.23785980

In a post to members, the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness said ""the government got a lot right"" on housing in the ...","OTTAWA — The federal Liberals are using their omnibus budget bill to legislate a ""right to housing"" in Canada, a pledge advocates worry could fall short of being the historic step the government wants without a few parliamentary tweaks before summer.

The budget bill would set into law rules for the Liberals' 10-year national housing strategy, now valued at more than $55 billion, impose those rules on future governments and create two new oversight bodies meant to make sure the spending reduces homelessness.

A national housing council is to advise the government on the effects of the strategy and a new housing advocate, tied to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, is to report annually on systemic issues preventing Canadians from finding affordable and safe places to live.

Reports would also be required every three years on how well the strategy is meeting national goals and furthering ""the progressive realization of the right to adequate housing"" — wording that mirrors international standards.

Watch: Trudeau touts home-buying measures in budget

In each case, the minister in charge of the strategy would have to ""reply and act"" on the reports, said Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos, ""which will ensure there is sufficient pressure on the federal government to meet the legislated right to housing.""

Characterizing housing as a human right is meant to provide recourse, usually through tribunals, to anyone wrongfully denied a home for reasons such as ethnicity, religion, or gender identity, and put pressure on the federal government to help make the right a reality.

""The federal government has admitted to having an obligation when it comes to protecting the most vulnerable of Canadians,"" Duclos said in an interview Wednesday. ""There will always need to be a continuing conversation (and) that's exactly what the bill says — the national housing strategy will need to evolve, but I think we've made major steps in very little time.""

The United Nations special rapporteur on the right to housing said wording in the budget bill is a big step forward and addresses a long-running concern from the international body.

But Leilani Farha said her chief concern is that having an advocate ""hot-desking"" at the human-rights commission and filing annual reports ""doesn't amount to human-rights accountability by any measure.""

""The government needs to strengthen the role of the advocate so that they can appoint panels to hear systemic housing-related claims and recommend remedies,"" said the Canadian-based Farha.

""And the government can't be allowed to just ignore recommendations. If the legislation is strengthened in this way, then Canada would not just be in compliance with its international human rights obligations, it might also be a model for other countries.""

The Liberals have been looking into setting the right to housing into law since early in their mandate, when they met with housing advocates about ways to pump more money into affordable housing.

What followed, though, was a debate among officials in Duclos's Department of Employment and Social Development Canada and their counterparts in the Finance and Justice departments over how far the government could go in its wording, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

The federal government has admitted to having an obligation when it comes to protecting the most vulnerable of Canadians. Jean-Yves Duclos

As time wore on, housing advocates became concerned about whether the government would have time to pass a law before the next election.

Putting the housing law into the budget bill is a tacit acknowledgment that time was running short. Inside the budget bill, it is practically assured passage by the summer.

Now, groups plan to lobby MPs for amendments to give the new housing council greater powers to critique government progress on the strategy and allow the advocate to refer issues to the human-rights tribunal for public hearings.

In a post to members, the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness said ""the government got a lot right"" on housing in the budget bill, but the legislation lacks ""important elements of a workable, rights-based accountability framework that would ensure that the housing strategy is effective.""

The provincial budget proposes cuts in post-secondary education and social services, scaling back the growth in spending projected by Ontario's former Liberal government.

Federal Employment Minister Patty Hajdu, an MP from Thunder Bay in northern Ontario, called the budget ""reckless"" in how it takes a knife to programs that affect everything from social security and job creation to northern development and the province's ability to fight forest fires.

At almost every turn at a news conference Friday, Hajdu told reporters in Ottawa that voters across the country can expect the same kind of ""cruel"" fiscal slashing from the federal Conservatives under Scheer's leadership, should they choose him to govern the nation in the October election.

""From my perspective, Doug Ford and his cronies are trying to pull a fast one on Ontarians,"" Hajdu said. ""It's quite clear that Andrew Scheer would take exactly the same tactic.""

Ontario on 'reasonable path to balance'

Much as the federal Liberals did in 2015, the Ford government is pledging to balance Ontario's books several years down the road.

Justin Trudeau didn't deliver on his campaign pledge of ""modest"" deficit spending with a plan to balance the federal budget by 2019. Every year, his government has produced bigger deficits than it promised, and this year's is nearly $20 billion.

Balancing the provincial budget was a key election promise for the Ontario Tories. Finance Minister Vic Fedeli said Thursday he expected the province would eliminate its budget deficit by the 2023-24 fiscal year, two years beyond the end of their term.

""We have developed a reasonable path to balance,"" Fedeli said. ""Our path to balance in five years is a thoughtful and a measured approach to take.""

Federal Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre, who for months has been hounding the Trudeau Liberals to say when the federal books will be balanced, said Friday he understands the Ontario PC government was handed a tenuous fiscal situation by the province's former Liberal government.

With that in mind, the Ford government has taken a responsible approach with a plan to bring deficit spending to an eventual end, Poilievre said.

""They inherited a disastrous financial situation and they've tried to balance fiscal responsibility against the continuing needs of the people while constrained by enormous record debt,"" he said. ""I think they got the balance right.""

Program expenses to rise an average 0.8%

Under the Ontario budget, program expenses in the province are to rise over three years by an average of 0.8 per cent, compared to the 3.3 per cent in growth that the former Liberal government had projected.

The document talks about fighting climate change ""without a carbon tax,"" but provides no new money for climate programs. It does, however, earmark cash for clean-technology investments that could create jobs in industries producing solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicle charging stations.

""Canadians want us to take action on things like climate,"" Hajdu said, denouncing the Ford government's criticism of the federal carbon tax. ""They know that their children's health and safety depends on governments that are going to take responsible action.""

Hajdu wasn't focused only on the Ford government Friday. She lumped Jason Kenney's Alberta Conservatives together with the Ford government in warning Canadians that they can expect ""cuts, cuts, cuts"" to spending under a Scheer government similar to those announced in Ontario and proposed in Alberta where Kenney is fighting to unseat his province's NDP government.

""We see the Conservative governments behave the same way no matter where they are elected,"" said Hajdu.",Trudeau Liberals link 'reckless' Ontario budget with Scheer's Conservatives,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/trudeau-liberals-criticize-ontario-budget-1.5096433

Documents tabled in the House of Commons show all the invitation-only meetings were held between October 2018 and early March in cities including Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Thunder Bay, Calgary, and Vancouver. The last one was held in Iqaluit, Nunavut on March 4.

Attendees were encouraged to share a link to an online questionnaire to those who were interested in participating, but unable to attend the meetings.

Watch: Residential schools' ugly legacy on Indigenous youths' mental health

The Department of Canadian Heritage is responsible for the development of a national anti-racism strategy ""to combat discrimination and racism,"" according to the Minister Pablo Rodriguez's mandate letter.

The government set aside $23 million in the 2018 budget to increase funding for its multiculturalism program, including $2 million to fund cross-country consultations toward the development of the plan. New $45-million funding was promised in this year's budget for the implementation of the strategy over three years.

NDP MP Jenny Kwan is frustrated by the secrecy surrounding the consultations and wants more transparency on how the government plans to spend money. ""There's no accountability whatsoever within that envelope,"" she said.

The consultations were not advertised, Kwan said, prompting questions about who the government decided to include and exclude.

Kwan said the Trump administration in the United States has stoked anti-immigrant sentiments that have jumped across the border. It's important for the government to develop a thorough, multi-year strategy to curb the ""rise of racism,"" she said.

""We don't even know what was discussed behind closed doors on this consultation process,"" the Vancouver East MP said. ""How is that a robust process to ensure that they have the best suggestions and recommendations to tackle this issue?""

The population size of minority communities and Indigenous people factored into where the department organized its meetings, Canadian Heritage spokesman Daniel Savoie told HuffPost Canada. The number of reported hate crimes in an area was also a consideration.

Savoie said the invite-only meetings gave participants safe spaces to share how racism and discrimination has affected their lives. Invites were prioritized to people ""with lived experiences of racism and other forms of expertise related to anti-racism,"" he said.

""Participants also mentioned that since the government of Canada decided to not renew Canada's Action Plan Against Racism in 2010, there is currently no strategy to fight racism.""

It's important for the federal government to show leadership on the issue, Savoie said, adding a final report will be released ""in the near future.""

National strategy shelved in 2010

Paul Martin's Liberal government introduced Canada's Action Plan Against Racism in 2005. It sought to introduce the ""first-ever horizontal, coordinated approach across the federal government to combat racism.""

An evaluation of the plan in 2010 by Stephen Harper's Conservative government found trouble in the way it dealt with ""multiple departments with very different mandates."" There were also issues at the senior management level among those responsible for implementing planned initiatives that included a loss of momentum and commitment that ""waned over time.""

Noticeably absent from the action plan against racism was a strategy to address Islamophobia — which has continued to rise in recent years. Hate crimes against Muslims rose 253 per cent between 2012 and 2015, according to Statistics Canada.

The Liberal government's new anti-racism strategy is focused on addressing barriers in how people access employment, community, and justice systems. Its objective is to support community education and skills development projects that ""to counter racism in its various forms.""

Online participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to collect written answers and a survey that asked participants to agree, disagree, or pass on statements such as, ""Systemic racism exists in Canada.""

It's a statement the minister responsible for the strategy struggled with last year. Rodriguez walked back remarks to a national newspaper that systemic racism is an ""expression"" that ""is not part of my vocabulary.""

Watch: Heritage minister walks back remarks questioning systemic racism

Evidence of systemic racism can be found in policies based on ethnicity or race. The history of residential schools and the systemic forced separation of Indigenous children from their families is one example of Canadian systemic racism.

Manitoba Sen. Murray Sinclair offered MPs his own definition of systemic racism in a House of Commons committee last year, calling it ""the racism that's left over after you get rid of the racists.""

Discussion and debate about racism has sometimes fallen victim to partisan political interests.

On Wednesday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was forced to clarify comments made by a Tory senator who appeared to show a tepid response to concerns about racism and Islamophobia raised by Foreign Affairs Minister Chyrstia Freeland.

The President is wrong, of course, but uncontrolled migration is a crisis in the United States and a problem in Canada, because it undermines confidence in the immigration system.

This is one reason the Trudeau government introduced legislation this week to stem the flow of people who cross at unauthorized points of entry from the United States.

Another might be that, even though the Liberals have done a good job over the past year of slowing the flow of unauthorized crossings, they fear the public might think they haven’t done enough.

Story continues below advertisement

In either case, it’s also important to remember that the core purpose of immigration is to stoke the economy and prevent population decline. The intent of deterring crossings at unauthorized places should be to bolster the overall system.

The total fertility rate in the United States has fallen to 1.8 children per woman, and will likely continue to fall. The Canadian rate is 1.6. Both countries are reproducing far below the average of 2.1 children per woman needed to prevent population decline.

This is good news. Teenage pregnancy rates have fallen by two-thirds in the United States since 1990, and 80 per cent in Canada, thanks to improved access to sex education and birth control. In the United States, white, African-American and Latino birth rates are converging, reflecting improved education and economic opportunity for minorities. More women are waiting to establish their careers before having a child, a reflection of increasing equality. Low fertility means social progress.

But fewer babies eventually means fewer young workers to pay the taxes needed to sustain health care and pension for older folks. It also means lower economic growth, because there are fewer young consumers buying that first car, first house and so on. Two dozen countries are losing population each year, and in many cases their economies are struggling.

The United States and Canada counter the effect through high levels of immigration, which is why their populations continue to grow, and to age more slowly.

But the United States faces a growing crisis of uncontrolled immigration, with more than 100,000 crossers from Mexico detained in March alone. In Canada, the number of people who crossed at unauthorized points of entry was just less than 20,000 for all of 2018, mostly from the United States into Quebec.

Mr. Trump wants to build a wall, which would be ineffective, and is threatening to close the southern border completely, which would be an economic disaster.

Story continues below advertisement

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government is taking a different approach. The budget bill introduced Monday includes a new law that would prohibit people from making refugee claims who have already made a similar claim in the United States and certain other countries. And Canadian officials are working with their American counterparts to toughen the Safe Third Country Agreement so as to further deter crossers.

Opinion: Justin Trudeau, a Prime Minister of symbols, falls to Earth

Trudeau defends tougher stand on border crossers as refugee advocates express outrage

Ottawa to pay more than $400,000 to Quebec border residents to compensate them for migrant disruptions

The Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers has condemned the new legislation as “callous.” But Canada will continue to take in refugees who make legitimate claims through regular channels, such as the refugees from Syria.

The immigration system is not humanitarian; it is economic. In Canada, we bring in almost 1 per cent of our population each year so that our economy and population will continue to grow. Mr. Trump encourages nativist, anti-immigrant sentiment. If Americans listen to him, their country will eventually start losing people − with or without unauthorized migrants − surrendering a key geopolitical advantage, since the Chinese and Russian populations will both start to decline in a few years. (In Russia, it may already have begun.)

Some people argue for policies − enhanced parental leave, subsidized daycare, even cash payments − that will encourage couples to have more children, while limiting immigration. Such policies are very expensive and research shows they don’t work. Women in developed countries today for the most part don’t have children because the state, or God, or their kinfolk, or domineering husbands want them to. Parenting for most couples is an act of personal fulfilment. And they are quickly fulfilled.

The Trudeau government should not have placed these new rules in an omnibus budget bill. And those rules may not survive a judicial challenge. But the goal is sound, even if it was opportunistic. Governments have a duty to control their borders. Failure undermines confidence in the immigration system.

He was formerly Director of Communications to Stephen Harper.

Hark! Word comes from Ottawa of the vaunted channel change from SNC-Lavalin!

With everyone busy rubbernecking the multi-car, highway-closing SNC-Lavalin pile up, Finance Minister Bill Morneau went ahead and tabled his budget implementation bill. And buried in that 392-page (!) behemoth was a change to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that would make it harder to claim refugee status in Canada.

To take things in order: 1) yes, there was a federal budget this year; 2) yes, it is being jammed through the House via an omnibus bill (which the Liberals promised never to do); 3) yes, omnibus legislation is how Liberals tucked deferred prosecution agreements into the criminal code for SNC last year; and 4) the Liberals are now massive hypocrites.

Trudeau’s vaunted “Welcome to Canada” poster is now festooned with giant brand-damaging caveats: If you, dear asylum seeker, have opened a claim for refugee protection in another country, have already made an unsuccessful claim in Canada, been deemed inadmissible because of your criminal record, or been granted refugee protection elsewhere, your claim is now ineligible for consideration.

And if all of that sounds like common sense to you, welcome to where federal and provincial Conservatives have been for the past three years. Or, as the Liberals used to call it: being un-Canadian.

The budget bill sleight of hand on asylum claims follows the Liberals’ earlier fold on the Safe Third Country Agreement, which they are now looking to revise in negotiations with the United States, another step the Conservatives have been urging for the better part of two years.

“I can tell you we’ve been working very hard over the past several months to significantly reduce the number of people who are crossing our borders irregularly,” Conservative Minister Bill Blair told reporters. “There’s a right way to come to the country to seek asylum and/or to seek to immigrate to this country, and we’re trying to encourage people to use the appropriate channels and to disincentivize people from doing it improperly,” Blair added.

Blair is, of course, a Liberal. He just sounds like a Conservative, based on the volte-face evidence; 40,000+ “irregular” asylum claims from the United States will do that to you. The Liberals have been thoroughly mugged by the reality of this year’s election.

And what of the mountains of prior Liberal talk of principles, compassion and openness? One presumes they’re buried in the backlog of asylum claims Trudeau said the system was equipped to handle.

The step change in direction on entry to Canada has certainly upset the cast of immigration and asylum advocates who threw themselves at Trudeau’s feet after Trudeau threw open Canada’s doors in the midst of the 2015 refugee crisis in Europe.

Janet Dench, executive director of the Canadian Council for Refugees, anticipates a Charter challenge to Trudeau’s proposed reforms, while Maureen Silcoff, chair of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers’ litigation committee, bemoaned the “degraded” nature of the system being proposed. “This is really a devastating attack on refugee rights,” Dench concluded.

These criticisms—to say nothing of the changes themselves—should terrify the Liberals who, as they never fail to tell us, are the party of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. One wonders whether the lemmings on the Grit backbench were even made aware of them. It certainly explains why the changes were buried in a budget bill and not debated in the harsh light of day. Opaque ways, my friends.

Refugee advocates will now add their names to the rather long and distinguished list of disappointed Liberal stakeholders: electoral reform advocates, transparency gurus, balanced-budget believers, sticklers for the rule of law, Indigenous rights groups and environmentalists, to name a few.

But the criticism from the asylum crowd is of a different calibre, one that will leave a mark. The Liberals are sawing at a pillar of their core identity, to say nothing of their brand promise. Liberals of the Trudeau vintage didn’t get into politics to be a Tory on asylum and immigration.

Now that the media have spotted the change we shouldn’t be surprised if Trudeau kicks Jody Wilson-Raybould out of caucus again to change the channel. Or, barring that, give another $12 million climate gift to a wealthy grocery retailer with a history of price-fixing a food staple. The point being, the longer the discussion stays on the asylum about-face the more Trudeau will sink.

And with Liberal support continuing to bleed every which way, Trudeau could yet have further to fall. Indeed, bar the carbon tax, it’s not clear what the Liberals propose to stand on in the next election. Well, other than power for power’s sake, which has always been the Liberal proposition.

But it wasn’t Trudeau’s; he promised a different Liberal Party. The fact that Michelle Rempel could now be the Liberal spokesperson on immigration wasn’t a part of the vision he sold to Canadians.

But on asylum, as with Trudeau’s other disappointments, it turns out that #WelcomeToCanada was #OnlyAMarketingSlogan.

In recent weeks the party mailed a survey to Tory donors, signed by the party’s campaign director Hamish Marshall, asking them to rank major Canadian newspapers and TV stations — the Globe & Mail, Toronto Star, the Sun papers, Global, City, CTV, CBC and the National Post — based on the outlets’ perceived ideological leanings: “left of centre,” “neutral/balanced,” or “right of centre.”

The mail-out, sent to supporters as a pitch to kick in monthly donations to the party, further asks: “In your opinion, which of Canada’s major political parties is most favoured by the mainstream news media?”

A party spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the questionnaire.

“It was about raising funds for our campaign, and gathering supporters feedback on where and how they consume media, and their personal perceptions,” said party communications director Cory Hann. He added that the appeal for donations was spurred by the Liberal Party’s proposed support program for Canadian media outlets — a program that would be administered by an arms-length body, to avoid possible political favouritism.

Beyond surveying supporters’ news diet, the mail-out asks whether the party should “bypass” the news media and instead hone “an aggressive social media strategy to communicate with people directly in their homes or on their mobile devices” and whether the party “should focus on direct voter contact … that will allow us to take our message to voters unfiltered.”

It also asks whether the campaign should prioritize local and community media outlets, and invest more in advertising and a “sophisticated ground game” in order to “counter the efforts of pro-media news organizations.”

In your opinion, which of Canada’s major political parties is most favoured by the mainstream news media?

The direct-mail appeal to donors included a letter from Marshall, but the party refused to provide it to the Post.

While the Conservative Party is no stranger to taking aim at perceived bias in the media, the proliferation of hyper-partisan, conspiratorial and outright hateful online news outlets has made such tactics a riskier proposition.

As he pummelled the New York Times and CNN, Donald Trump enjoyed almost relentlessly flattering coverage from alt-right websites like Breitbart, Infowars, and the Gateway Pundit — and he, in turn, used them to relay his message to his base. He hired Breitbart co-founder Steve Bannon to apply his sharp-elbowed media tactics to the Republican presidential campaign. In so doing, though, he may have emboldened the likes of Infowars, which promotes baseless conspiracy theories including that the American government carried out the 9/11 attacks and that a 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 20 children and six adults was a hoax. Infowars has been removed from numerous platforms, including YouTube and Twitter, for promulgating hate speech.

Scheer appointed Marshall as his campaign director for the upcoming election despite controversy over Marshall’s connections to Rebel Media, an ideological cousin of Breitbart.

Marshall ran a digital strategy company, Torch Agency, from Rebel’s Toronto office, where he also ran Scheer’s leadership campaign. While with Rebel, where he was a corporate director, Marshall and Torch helped design its outreach strategies, which included aggressively microtargeting possible supporters and donors with issue-specific campaigns — a tactic he appears to have made use of in the Conservative Party as well. Often, that outreach involved attacking the mainstream media as untrustworthy.

Though a longtime Conservative strategist, Marshall’s close association with Rebel Media prompted questions, including over Scheer’s own involvement with the media organization.

Scheer made several appearances on The Rebel, but in August 2017 he announced he would no longer grant interviews to the outlet after Rebel host Faith Goldy appeared on a neo-Nazi podcast while in Virginia to cover a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, at which one person was killed. Rebel fired Goldy amid the ensuing controversy.

The questionnaire asks supporters to what extent they agree with the statements: “The mainstream Canadian media spend too much time covering left-wing social justice issues and not enough time reporting on the economy or international affairs,” and “When union leaders who represent news media workers attack Conservatives, it creates an undeniable conflict of interest.”

The party spokesperson elaborated that the mailer was referencing Jerry Dias, the president of Unifor, who has been openly critical of the Conservative Party. Unifor represents a number of newsrooms, although they represent a small fraction of the union’s 300,000-plus members.

HALIFAX -- Nova Scotia's Tory leader says possible federal bids from three provincial PC legislators is a signal of Justin Trudeau's falling fortunes.

The spring session of the legislature ended Friday with three Progressive Conservative MLAs discussing potential plans to run in this year's national race.

Chris d'Entremont, the member for Argyle-Barrington and a former cabinet minister, confirmed to journalists he will seek the federal nomination in West Nova.

Eddie Orrell, the member for Northside-Westmount, also confirmed he's in the final stages of planning a potential bid for a federal nomination in Sydney.

And Alfie MacLeod, the member for Sydney River-Mira-Louisbourg, said he will take the next month to finalize his decision on whether to run in the Liberal stronghold of Cape Breton-Canso.

Party leader Tim Houston said if the exodus unfolds, it won't reflect poorly on him or suggest there is unfinished business from his recent victory in the party's leadership contest.

Rather, he says there's ""a lot of pressure to seek a federal nomination,"" for members of his 17-person caucus, who are keen to break the Liberal grip on Atlantic Canada.

""It's more a reflection of what is happening elsewhere in government,"" he said.

""I think what you're seeing here is there is pressure on members of the legislature to seek federal nominations and there's opportunities that are created by the way the (federal) Liberals are working.""

""I don't think, if this were the last federal election, that you would see that many members seeking opportunities. The landscape has changed.""

D'Entremont is a former cabinet minister in past Tory governments, and has held his seat in southern Nova Scotia for five provincial elections.

He said outside the house that he's done most of what he'd set out to do in provincial politics.

The party stalwart served in the governments of former Tory premiers John Hamm and Rodney MacDonald, and his accomplishments include bringing in the family pharmacare program while he was minister of health.

He's looking to run in the southern Nova Scotia riding of West Nova -- which has swung back and forth between the Liberals and Conservatives over the past century. Incumbent Liberal MP Colin Fraser announced last year he would not seek re-election.

Orrell said outside the house that he wants to deliver more for Cape Breton as a federal MP.

""I figure ... it's time to get back to a Tory government in Ottawa to deliver more for the area... I'm up for a challenge,"" he said.

He said he'll finalize his decision over the weekend following a discussion with his wife and family.

MacLeod, wearing his trademark tartan tie, said ""this may very well be my last question in the House of Assembly,"" during question period.

He then asked -- to loud cheers -- about what the minister's plan was to upgrade the New Boston Road, a rural route in his riding that he's complained about for the past decade.

MacLeod later told reporters his decision may be influenced by whether Cape Breton-Canso Liberal MP Roger Cuzner decides to re-offer, noting that incumbency is a key factor in Atlantic Canadian politics.

""I believe there is a switch going on. I believe there is a shift in the attitude of individuals and I want to be the agent of that change,"" said MacLeod.

The Liberal government doesn't seem to be facing a similar exodus, though Environment Minister Margaret Miller has said she won't be re-offering in 2021.

Premier Stephen McNeil wished the departing Tory members well, focusing on d'Entremont's record of cordial conduct.

He said he expects all of his party's members will be back for the legislature's fall session.

However, the premier says a cabinet shuffle is likely before that session.","Prominent N.S. Tories considering federal bids, buoyed by Liberal troubles",Atlantic CTV News,https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/prominent-n-s-tories-considering-federal-bids-buoyed-by-liberal-troubles-1.4377665

In late March, while the SNC-Lavalin affair was at full boil, CTV News and The Canadian Press both reported — citing anonymous sources ...","OTTAWA — Liberal MPs have spiked a motion that would have seen the Commons justice committee hold hearings on the leak of information about the last selection process for the Supreme Court of Canada — a leak widely viewed as a political attack on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.

In an hour-long meeting that consisted mostly of partisan bickering, the Liberals used their 5-4 majority on the committee to reject the motion, backed by both Conservatives and New Democrats. The motion did not give a list of potential witnesses, but called for the committee to sit additional hours to study the matter and report back by May 31.

“Is this the perfect venue to investigate this matter? No it isn’t,” said Conservative MP Michael Cooper during the meeting. “But seeing as the Prime Minister is seeming to take no action, and given that the attorney general has shown no interest in pursuing the matter, we’re left with where we are today.”

In late March, while the SNC-Lavalin affair was at full boil, CTV News and The Canadian Press both reported — citing anonymous sources — that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had disagreed with Wilson-Raybould’s choice to replace chief justice Beverley McLachlin on the court in 2017. Wilson-Raybould had preferred Manitoba Chief Justice Glenn Joyal, the reports said, but Trudeau rejected that choice because he saw Joyal as too critical of how courts apply the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Trudeau eventually chose to appoint Alberta Judge Sheilah Martin to the top court and promoted sitting Justice Richard Wagner to the role of chief justice. The reports said the episode led Trudeau to doubt Wilson-Raybould’s judgment, and it soured their relationship long before the SNC-Lavalin affair came up.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the leak did not come from him or his office.

The leak was widely condemned by organizations representing lawyers and judges, who described it as a threat to the integrity of a selection process that is supposed to be highly confidential. At the time, Wilson-Raybould herself also condemned the leak, said she was not the source of it, and called for “some sort of investigation as to the source of this information.”

Joyal also issued a statement, saying he feared that “someone is using my previous candidacy to the Supreme Court of Canada to further an agenda unrelated to the appointment process. This is wrong.”

At Wednesday’s committee meeting, opposition members argued that this appeared to be the only real chance to get to the bottom of the matter.

“The integrity of how we appoint people to the highest court of our land is at issue,” said the NDP’s justice critic Murray Rankin during the meeting.

He added that it’s personal for him, as he was one of the two opposition members, along with Conservative MP Rob Nicholson, who sat on the nomination advisory committee on the agreement they keep the information secret.

“I am under a cloud of suspicion, as is my colleague from the Conservative Party,” he said. “I was prepared to go to my grave with the information as to who were the finalists in the process.”

He also rebutted Liberal accusations that they were trying to haul journalists before the committee, saying he’s focused on who leaked the information, not on journalists for doing their job in publishing it.

“I want to hear from people in the Department of Justice,” Rankin said. “I want to hear from people in Prime Minister’s Office. Somebody leaked it. It was either my Conservative friend, myself, or an official.”

Liberal MPs said they were rejecting the motion because the committee is a poor venue for investigating the leak, and pointed out there were also leaks of information over the botched 2013 Supreme Court nomination of Marc Nadon at a time when a Conservative government was in power.

The Liberals accused the opposition of just trying to play politics and keep the SNC-Lavalin affair alive in the news.

“This is really becoming an abuse of process, when we’re trying to politicize everything and trying to make sure that we don’t get around to dealing with all of the issues that Canadians expect us to deal with,” Liberal MP Ali Ehsassi said.

Rankin argued that the Liberals have condemned leaks in much stronger terms in the past. He pointed to Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale calling it “very, very serious” in 2017 when the Omar Khadr $10.5-million settlement payment was leaked. The Privy Council Office went on to investigate that leak, though it won’t say if the hunt was successful.

In 2015, the government referred an investigation to the RCMP into who leaked information about a $700-million shipbuilding project; it eventually resulted in a criminal charge against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, who has a trial scheduled for August.

Rankin told reporters that he thinks decisions over which leaks to investigate “get made on political grounds, sadly, and the administration of justice, and Canadians, deserve better.”

The spring session of the legislature ended Friday with three Progressive Conservative MLAs discussing potential plans to run in this year’s national race.

Chris d’Entremont, the member for Argyle-Barrington and a former cabinet minister, confirmed to journalists he will seek the federal nomination in West Nova. Eddie Orrell, the member for Northside-Westmount, also confirmed he’s in the final stages of planning a potential bid for a federal nomination in Sydney. And Alfie MacLeod, the member for Sydney River-Mira-Louisbourg, said he will take the next month to finalize his decision on whether to run in the Liberal stronghold of Cape Breton-Canso.

Rather, he says there’s “a lot of pressure to seek a federal nomination,” for members of his 17-person caucus, who are keen to break the Liberal grip on Atlantic Canada. “It’s more a reflection of what is happening elsewhere in government,” he said.

“I think what you’re seeing here is there is pressure on members of the legislature to seek federal nominations and there’s opportunities that are created by the way the (federal) Liberals are working.” “I don’t think, if this were the last federal election, that you would see that many members seeking opportunities. The landscape has changed.” D’Entremont is a former cabinet minister in past Tory governments, and has held his seat in southern Nova Scotia for five provincial elections. He said outside the house that he’s done most of what he’d set out to do in provincial politics. The party stalwart served in the governments of former Tory premiers John Hamm and Rodney MacDonald, and his accomplishments include bringing in the family pharmacare program while he was minister of health. He’s looking to run in the southern Nova Scotia riding of West Nova — which has swung back and forth between the Liberals and Conservatives over the past century. Incumbent Liberal MP Colin Fraser announced last year he would not seek re-election. Orrell said outside the house that he wants to deliver more for Cape Breton as a federal MP. “I figure ... it’s time to get back to a Tory government in Ottawa to deliver more for the area... I’m up for a challenge,” he said. He said he’ll finalize his decision over the weekend following a discussion with his wife and family. MacLeod, wearing his trademark tartan tie, said “this may very well be my last question in the House of Assembly,” during question period. He then asked — to loud cheers — about what the minister’s plan was to upgrade the New Boston Road, a rural route in his riding that he’s complained about for the past decade. MacLeod later told reporters his decision may be influenced by whether Cape Breton-Canso Liberal MP Roger Cuzner decides to re-offer, noting that incumbency is a key factor in Atlantic Canadian politics. “I believe there is a switch going on. I believe there is a shift in the attitude of individuals and I want to be the agent of that change,” said MacLeod. The Liberal government doesn’t seem to be facing a similar exodus, though Environment Minister Margaret Miller has said she won’t be re-offering in 2021. Premier Stephen McNeil wished the departing Tory members well, focusing on d’Entremont’s record of cordial conduct. He said he expects all of his party’s members will be back for the legislature’s fall session. However, the premier says a cabinet shuffle is likely before that session.

Now they’ll have to fight Mr. Scheer ...","Justin Trudeau’s federal Liberals were waiting, in anticipation, for Doug Ford’s budget to hack and slash everything. But they didn’t get the political gift they were waiting for.

Instead, the new Ontario budget was middling, vague and wrapped in tailgates and licence plates. The Liberals were left to argue that the ugly cuts are going to come later, six months or a year down the road, after the federal election.

The federal Liberals, you see, were expecting that Mr. Ford’s provincial budget was going to provide a picture-book illustration of cuts to the services that ordinary folks care about. They would then use that to illustrate their message about the federal Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer – that harsh cuts are what conservatives are all about, and that Mr. Scheer’s Tories would do as Mr. Ford ‘s Ontario Progressive Conservatives did.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Ford’s Tories had, after all, already made some politically ham-fisted cuts, messing with programs for autistic children, cutting a francophone services commissioner and announcing increases in high-school class sizes (arguing it would make kids more resilient). Mr. Ford promised to balance the budget in his first term, so many thought they’d get the cutting done in their first budget, when a provincial election was three years away.

Instead, Mr. Ford’s Progressive Conservatives dumped the balanced-budget pledge. Ontario Finance Minister Vic Fedeli now says they won’t balance the budget until 2024. That’s only one year before the forecast set out last year under Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne – the premier that Mr. Ford had cast as a profligate money-waster. On the evidence of Thursday’s budget, Mr. Ford’s Tories are more populist than fiscally conservative.

There are cuts. Indigenous services and the Environment Ministry will be cut. Presumably Mr. Ford and Mr. Fedeli think their voters won’t mind that. The biggest provincial spending items, health and education, will be constrained to slight shrinkage in after-inflation terms. Universities will get less money this year. Children’s-services budgets will be cut, but it’s not clear precisely how.

Liberal MP Adam Vaughan argued that Mr. Ford’s budget was carefully crafted so that it’s hard to immediately identify what services will be cut.

“For six months, it’s going to feel like there’s no cuts. And then all of a sudden, the bottom is going to drop out,” he said in a telephone interview.

Why delay the impact? “I think they’re running cover for the Conservatives up in Ottawa,” Mr. Vaughan said.

He argued that Mr. Ford’s PCs were out to protect the Tory brand to help Mr. Scheer get elected in October. Both really want to “cut, cut, cut,” but don’t want people to realize it yet, he said.

Take those arguments any way you like, but for Mr. Trudeau’s Liberals in Ottawa, it amounts to an admission that the Ontario budget didn’t give them the easy-to-caricature picture they expected.

They wanted, figuratively speaking, to campaign by showing voters a picture of Mr. Scheer standing next to an axe-wielding Mr. Ford. Now, they’re complaining that Mr. Ford is hiding the axe behind his back.

That robs Mr. Trudeau’s team of the weapon they expected. Some of Mr. Ford’s people are already gloating about that.

Certainly, Mr. Vaughan is right that the details of cuts have an impact that figures don’t. People feel more strongly about a hospital closing than a billion-dollar cut to a budget line.

The Ontario budget included some details that will open the PCs to political criticism – but more were shiny-penny novelties, such as new blue licence plates.

Many were populist moves Mr. Ford might paint with his “For the People” slogan – child-care credits (for the people with kids), a hastily planned and probably semi-fictional map of a new subway line (for the people who commute in Toronto) and legalized tailgating (for the people who party). Some came out of the blue, such as letting bars sell booze at 9 a.m. (for the people with a problem).

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Andrew Vaughan

FREDERICTON – New Brunswick’s Liberal party has confirmed Kevin Vickers is the lone candidate for its leadership, setting the stage for his acclamation.

The party’s leadership steering committee says it decided late Wednesday to recommend to the party’s board that the former House of Commons sergeant-at-arms be appointed leader.

The board will make a decision next Tuesday evening.

The steering committee says it still wants the June 21-22 leadership convention in Saint John to proceed, “with an altered itinerary.”

Hailed as a hero for helping to end the 2014 attack on Parliament Hill, Vickers was the first candidate to officially enter the race two weeks ago.

The only other declared candidate, Rene Ephestion, leader of the party’s Multicultural Inclusion Commission, announced earlier this week that he is withdrawing from the race.

“I wish good luck to Kevin Vickers,” Ephestion said on Facebook.

Vickers, a political neophyte in his early 60s, issued a statement last month saying he is looking forward to speaking with Liberals “about a new path forward.”

He has drafted a five-point plan that calls for growing the province’s economy and population, improving health care, “transforming” education, ensuring environmental protection and making sure provincial finances are well managed.

Vickers, who also served as Canada’s ambassador to Ireland, has acknowledged spending many years away from the province, but he has also focused on his deep roots in New Brunswick.

Vickers had a long career of public service, including 29 years in the RCMP. He also served as aide-de-camp for the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick. He served as sergeant-at-arms for the House of Commons between 2006 and 2015.

On Oct. 22, 2014, Vickers was serving as sergeant-at-arms of the Commons when he shot and helped take down a man armed with a .30-30 rifle. Michael Zihaf Bibeau had barged into Centre Block on Parliament Hill after killing honour guard reservist Cpl. Nathan Cirillo at the National War Memorial.

The provincial Liberals under then-premier Brian Gallant won just 21 seats in an election last fall – one fewer than the Tories – and they relinquished their hold on power in November after losing a confidence vote in the legislature.

Premier Blaine Higgs’ minority government is relying on support from a third party – the right-leaning People’s Alliance, led by Kris Austin.

But that arrangement is set to expire in less than 18 months.

It was always going to be a long shot, but former Liberal MP Jane Philpott’s claim earlier this week that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau violated her parliamentary privileges when he unilaterally expelled her from the Liberal caucus fizzled out Thursday.

Unruly law: Philpott had asked House Speak Geoff Regan to rule on whether Trudeau failed to abide by reforms made to the the Parliament of Canada Act in 2015 that aimed to give MPs more control over caucus expulsions. Regan didn’t explicitly rule yes or no, just that it’s not part of his job description to decide such things and that it’s up to the caucuses. Meaning the law may well be law, but it’s not a law that’s enforceable, ergo Trudeau did nothing wrong. Confused yet? Some may benefit from this at-times existential Twitter exchange about the non-law law between Maclean’s journalist John Geddes and former House of Commons law clerk Rob Walsh (CTV News)

Because it’s 2019: With big name expulsions, repeated shuffles and resignations, Trudeau’s cabinet has changed a lot since 2015 Here’s a look back at the original cabinet—where are they now … and why? (Maclean’s)

Think of the journalists: In one of the more unseemly chapters of the SNC-Lavalin saga, anonymous leaks revealed confidential details about Supreme Court appointments, with the initial leaks apparently meant to discredit former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould (while smearing a judge in the process), and then in a second round of leaks, seemingly to defend her. Liberal MPs who control the House justice committee say it’s terrible the leaks happened, but as with earlier opposition calls for the committee to investigate the SNC-Lavalin controversy, the government MPs nevertheless voted against opening an investigation. Why this time? Because of straw men carrying press passes. Liberals argued they opposed the idea of asking the journalists who reported the leaks to testify. That puzzled opposition MPs on the committee, such as NDP MP Murray Rankin: “I want to hear from the officials. Who they leaked it to is irrelevant to me.” (CTV News)

Everybody isn’t do it: The most oft-repeated justification among Liberal MPs, their supporters and SNC-Lavalin itself for why the company should be offered a way to avoid criminal trial was that the vast majority of SNC’s rivals had received deferred prosecution agreements from their home countries. SNC-Lavalin’s CEO Neil Bruce claimed 75 per cent of its U.S. and European competitors had got DPAs at one time or another. Better check that math. According to the Canadian Press, hardly any of SNC-Lavalin’s rivals have received DPAs. “Of 216 DPAs and non-prosecution agreements — which are similar, but more lenient — in the U.S. since 2014, only eight were granted to construction or design firms, and only three of those companies qualified as global players.” (Canadian Press)

Call the auditors: Here’s a tip this tax season—don’t confuse your Conservative MP for an accountant. MPs from the party have been handing out 11-page booklets in their ridings with the words “2018 Tax Guide. Claim everything you qualify for!” on the front. There should also be a rather large asterisk—the 30 tax benefits listed in the guide don’t include the Trudeau government’s carbon tax rebate, worth between $250 and $600 depending on the province. (CTV News)

The Trudeau Conservatives: Tucked away in the Trudeau government’s omnibus budget bill were changes to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that have sparked outrage from refugee advocates. As Andrew MacDougall writes, the Liberals’ about-face on refugees saws at a pillar of their core identity, to say nothing of their brand promise:

Trudeau’s vaunted “Welcome to Canada” poster is now festooned with giant brand-damaging caveats: If you, dear asylum seeker, have opened a claim for refugee protection in another country, have already made an unsuccessful claim in Canada, been deemed inadmissible because of your criminal record, or been granted refugee protection elsewhere, your claim is now ineligible for consideration. And if all of that sounds like common sense to you, welcome to where federal and provincial Conservatives have been for the past three years. Or, as the Liberals used to call it: being un-Canadian.

Liberal government implemented amendments to the Tobacco Control Act to regulate e-cigarettes.","TODD Stone, MLA for Kamloops-South Thompson, on Thursday introduced the Vulnerable Adolescents Protection from E-cigarettes (VAPE) Act 2019 in the Legislature.

“Vaping and e-cigarette use is quickly becoming an epidemic among the youth of British Columbia,” said Stone. “Recent Canadian estimates suggest that a third of students in grades 10 through 12 are vaping, outpacing tobacco use at an alarming rate. By enticing youth with sugary flavouring, tobacco companies are lining their pocketbooks as a generation of kids succumb to nicotine addiction. It is baffling and simply dangerous that more is not happening immediately to quell this. Government needs to act on this now.”

This bill contains amendments to the Tobacco and Vapour Products Control Act in an effort to better keep these addictive products out of the hands of our children. These amendments include banning the sale of flavoured vapour products, limiting the supply and accessibility of e-cigarette products through stricter retail controls, restricting the sale of products to adult-only tobacco stores, vape stores and approved pharmacies, and enacting tougher penalties for non-compliance.

“Alongside these amendments I am also calling on government to provide the resources needed in every middle and high school across B.C. to implement evidence-based vaping awareness, prevention and support programs,” added Stone.

“Addiction is not something lost on British Columbians,” said North Vancouver-Seymour MLA Jane Thornthwaite. “Addiction can ruin lives and destroy futures. Every year vaping creates more addicts, and studies show that adolescent e-cigarette use correlates to cigarette use later in life. Parents are calling for immediate action from government to address this growing epidemic. There needs to be a concerted effort to intervene, take real steps, set real controls and create real change.”

“The fruity flavours, slick packaging, and ease of use are appealing factors for young people to try vaping, but they mask serious health risks under their kid-friendly cover,” said Kelowna-Lake Country MLA Norm Letnick. “Though touted as a ‘safer alternative’ to smoking, e-cigarettes are still laden with toxins like formaldehyde and contain highly-addictive nicotine. We know that this can be very damaging to a developing adolescent brain. Government needs to act now before more teens get hooked on vaping, more lives are damaged by addiction, and more strain is put on our health care system.”

The unfolding acts in the current Ottawa drama – SNC-Lavalin – are revealing and disturbing. Canadian taxpayers are paying millions to have 338 Members of Parliament and 100 senators earn a livelihood in the top two percentiles of Canadian incomes and then to observe their conduct as if they are the worst dregs of our society.

Apparently rules are for other Canadians, and conduct with integrity, what is that for our politicians? When a minister of the crown, Jody Wilson-Raybould follows the rules and protocol, she is panned as inadequate for her job and for her hidden native agenda. She cautions a minion, like Michael Wernick, the once Clerk of the Privy Council, that his arguments for the prime minister are beyond acceptable boundaries of her position and they would be political interference in the process. She did not accede, then she will have to pay the price.

Liberal MPs, mainly men, are now in full attack mode. Wilson-Raybould and her supporter Jane Philpott are unfit to be in the Liberal caucus. They will have to be purged. What is the message, honest, credible politicians like these two women must be kicked out of caucus for they have challenged the prime minister’s preference for SNC? She also legally taped a highly-explosive conversation to have evidence against lying men; therefore, she apparently has no honour. Are these attack dogs honourable men?

To discredit this woman for not caving to the prime minister’s bias, two additional items were leaked to the press to portray her with her own agenda. She proposed that Glenn Joyal, a jurist from Manitoba, be appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada so that a fellow Indigenous judge allegedly could be appointed to the Manitoba higher court. The prime minister ignored her advice and appointed an Albertan. Gerald Butts, the prime minister’s once principal secretary, filed that Wilson-Raybould argued that her removal from justice would have consequences with the Indigenous people. These so-called Liberal male feminists can’t seem to work with females as their equals.

If this way is how our country is governed, then we are in serious trouble. Our rules and procedures for governing are secondary to politics. The country be damned. And, this kind of happening is not limited to a single party.

We, Canadians, either tolerate this conduct, or we do what has to be done. That is why we have elections. We should hold all our elected representatives at the three levels of government to the highest standards of performance. If they fail, then out they go. We also fail when we ignore reality, and we continue to elect or re-elect these misfits. Our system of governance will only improve if the population demands better, and acts if better does not happen.

From the initial wrongdoing, through to the escalating bullying, clumsy cover-up, mounting casualties and fallout, this is the trajectory of major whistleblowing crises. History is littered with the fall of powerful politicians and corporate titans as testament that nothing is more powerful than truth.

But like so many authoritative and blundering bosses acting to extinguish “truth-tellers” — including using surrogates (former principal secretary Gerald Butts and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick) to do the dirty work — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau woefully miscalculated the steely determination of now-independent MPs Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott. Betting his “righteous” outrage — contrived, or simply “his truth” — would contain the crisis, Trudeau was blind to their fortitude, trumping first his suspect intentions and latterly his blundering exculpations by the conscientious exercise of their own voices. This crisis challenges something profound and central to our national identity: the doctrine of judicial independence and equal rights under the law, and the sensibility of Canadians to tolerate, let alone trust, the public institutions on which we rely.

As other countries promote the value of public-interest whistleblowing, Canada remains a feudal fiefdom. This is the real scandal.

As other countries promote the value of public-interest whistleblowing, Canada remains a feudal fiefdom. This is the real scandal.

No political party in Canada has ever committed to a sustained and consistent campaign to protect whistleblowers: the Wilson-Rayboulds and Philpotts of the world. In this regard, Liberals and Conservatives are, always have been, just different names on the same coin, mutually and complicitly understanding that power is at risk when people are free to speak about wrongdoing and violations of public trust. While Andrew Scheer may appear in this scandal to be the more ennobled of the two, based on his effusive calls for Wilson-Raybould to be free to speak, history reveals both parties’ track records of stonewalling and hiding truth. From Jean Chrétien to Stephen Harper and through to Trudeau, all promised transparency, all practised secrecy. All promised whistleblower protection, all embraced restrictive and oppressive anti-free speech regimes.

Worse still, they made integrity the signature piece of their electoral platforms. Hope given, hope crushed, oppresses more than hope never given. Too often Canada masquerades as the gatekeeper of enlightened, free-speech democracy, when reality is darkly different.

Today, Trudeau and his “team” are working hard to characterize the expulsion of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott as a breakdown in “trust.” But the sin of these two women was not about acts of disloyalty but about committing the truth. The birthplace of scandal is not in environments of respectful and open dissent but in dark corridors of power and secret phone calls and communications. This scandal is not that Wilson-Raybould taped Wernick’s gut-heaving proselytizing but, rather, what Wernick was trying to achieve, and might very well have achieved but for the smoking-gun of that recorded conversation.

Yet Trudeau continues to vilify the messenger. While guilefully denouncing Wilson-Raybould’s recording as “unconscionable,” what is actually unconscionable is Trudeau’s feigned moral indignation, and his and his Liberal acolytes self-serving pronouncements that loyalty required Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to quit before Trudeau threw them out. People of courage and moral foundation don’t quit; they persevere.

The real and lasting scandal arising out of the SNC-Lavalin Affair is the retrograde and quiescent culture in Canada requiring silence about matters that threaten the public interest. Those in government who speak out are subject to swift and cruel punishment. Moreover, the SNC crisis shows just how difficult it was for two women of privilege — as Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were as ministers — to be heard. Imagine ordinary, honest, and dedicated public servants. They don’t stand a chance.

It is said that it takes courage to speak truth when challenging formidable power and institutions. But speaking truth is what we are born to do. Shutting up is what the powerful force us to do. Election 2019 exhorts Canadians to demand from those running a commitment — evidenced through action, not words — to lock in real and meaningful protection for truth-tellers and good-faith whistleblowers. Otherwise, the new norm will be successive governments cycling through perpetual crisis while lying and deceiving us.

The motion, put forward by Conservative MP Michael Cooper, was for the committee to examine the leak of confidential information around Manitoba Chief Justice Glenn Joyal as a potential pick for the top court.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould reportedly disagreed on who to appoint to fill the vacancy left by retiring Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin in 2017, suggesting there were rifts in their relationship well before the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Liberal MPs said the committee was not an appropriate venue to hold such an investigation and that it would amount to hauling journalists in and forcing them to testify.

“This is really becoming an abuse of process, when we’re trying to politicize everything,” said Liberal MP Ali Ehsassi, who argued that a study would be “tantamount to investigating journalists.”

Cooper and other opposition MPs said hearing from journalists who received the leaks was nonsense and instead wanted to get to who did the leaking.

They questioned whether the Liberals were serious about the breach of confidentiality in the judicial appointments process since there is no other investigation into the leaks by the Prime Minister’s Office or justice ministerial officials.

The federal privacy commissioner, though, is investigating whether Joyal’s privacy rights were violated.

Cooper said after the meeting, which involved cross talk usually reserved for question period, that it wasn’t surprising the Liberals used their majority to vote his motion down.

“They just want to cover this up and hope that it’s going to go away,” he said. “We do need to get answers as to who was the source of a leak that has undermined the integrity of the appointments process and cast a shadow on a distinguished jurist.”

In late March, CTV and the Canadian Press reported that Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould disagreed on whether Manitoba judge Glenn Joyal should be named to fill a vacancy on the country’s highest court.

Joyal, Wilson-Raybould’s reported preference, later responded that he withdrew his name from consideration because his wife had cancer.

Justice Richard Wagner was eventually elevated to the chief justice role and Alberta judge Sheilah Martin was appointed to the top court.

The judicial appointments process is subject to extreme confidentiality in order to preserve its integrity, and the leak was immediately condemned by the legal community, Trudeau, Wilson-Raybould, Justice Minister David Lametti and opposition MPs.

Conservative justice critic Lisa Raitt suggested the Prime Minister’s Office was to blame for the leak, though Trudeau vigorously denied this. Wilson-Raybould also denied leaking the information and said the breach of confidentiality should be investigated.

The Globe and Mail later reported, citing an anonymous source, that Wilson-Raybould wanted Joyal to become chief justice of the Supreme Court in order to place a judge with progressive views on the top court and make way for Canada’s first Indigenous chief justice of a superior court.

Ehsassi and other Liberals also said they believed additional safeguards would eventually be put in place to stop leaks, which opposition MPs responded to with disbelief.",Liberals block committee probe into SCC nominee leaks,iPolitics,https://ipolitics.ca/2019/04/11/liberals-block-committee-probe-into-scc-nominee-leaks/

Norman has been accused by the RCMP of warning Davie that Liberal cabinet ministers wanted to derail the Asterix project.,"MV Asterix is now operating with HMCS Regina in Middle Eastern waters as part of a Canadian-led coalition task force.

The Asterix, a commercial ship converted by Davie shipyards in Quebec and leased to the federal government to perform a military supply role, has been going almost non-stop since it was launched. It has refueled both Canadian and allied warships.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said there is no need for a second such interim supply ship and the head of the Royal Canadian Navy, Vice Admiral Ron Lloyd, says he is happy with having the Asterix as the force’s only supply ship until 2023 when the first of two Joint Support Ships, to be built at Seaspan in Vancouver, is expected to be ready.

Davie, however, has offered to convert a second such ship, MV Obelix, to the same capabilities of Asterix and lease it to the government.

At one point the navy had three of its own supply ships supporting its vessels.

Information recently tabled in Parliament indicates that even though Asterix has been going full-tilt over the last year, there was still a requirement for Canadian warships to receive fuel and provisions from supply vessels operated by foreign navies or for Canadian ships to head to port to receive fuel and supplies.

Here are the details from Parliament:

The Asterix is also at the heart of federal government’s case against Vice Admiral Mark Norman. Norman has been accused by the RCMP of warning Davie that Liberal cabinet ministers wanted to derail the Asterix project.

That development leaked out to the news media and the resulting embarrassment was one of the factors that forced the Liberal government to back down on its plans and Asterix proceeded. Norman has denied any wrongdoing.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had twice predicted that Norman would eventually wind up in court, prompting concerns of political interference and concerns the Liberal government is punishing the officer.

Norman’s lawyers are in pre-trial trying to get documents they argue are needed so the officer can defend himself. Norman’s trial is scheduled for August.",The case for a second interim supply ship?

Analysis How the liberal tide turned against Julian Assange and WikiLeaks WikiLeaks Assange charged with hacking ...,"Now that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been hauled out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to face extradition to the United States on charges that he conspired to access a classified U.S. government computer, here is a look back at some of what we learned about Canadian operations through information leaked by the whistleblower site.

1. Canada offers to aid Iraq invasion

The same day former prime minister Jean Chrétien publicly refused to join the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a high-ranking Canadian official secretly promised the U.S. clandestine military support for the operation, according to a classified U.S. diplomatic memo obtained by CBC News from WikiLeaks.

The classified U.S. document showed that senior Canadian officials met the same day with high-ranking American and British diplomats at Foreign Affairs headquarters in Ottawa.

According to the account, Canadian Foreign Affairs official James Wright ""emphasized"" that contrary to public statements by the prime minister, Canadian naval and air forces could be ""discreetly"" put to use during the pending U.S.-led assault on Iraq and its aftermath.

""Following the meeting, political director Jim Wright emphasized that, despite public statements that the Canadian assets in the Straits of Hormuz will remain in the region exclusively to support Enduring Freedom,"" the document states.

""They will also be available to provide escort services in the Straits and will otherwise be discreetly useful to the military effort. The two ships in the Straits now are being augmented by two more en route, and there are patrol and supply aircraft in the U.A.E. [United Arab Emirates] which are also prepared to 'be useful.'""

The U.S. diplomat wrote in his briefing note to State Department bosses in Washington that ""this message tracks with others we have heard.""

""While for domestic political reasons … the GOC [Government of Canada] has decided not to join in a U.S. coalition of the willing … they are also prepared to be as helpful as possible in the military margins.""

2. Mentally ill Canadian man held at Bagram

U.S. diplomatic cables exposed a troubling case of a mentally ill Canadian-Egyptian man held in a U.S.-run Afghanistan prison for more than 18 months. Khaled Samy Abdallah Ismail, an Egyptian-born engineer, was captured in April 2006 and held at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility.

The U.S. military held Ismail until at least October 2007, often relegating him to segregation despite ""largely circumstantial"" evidence against him, while they debated whether to send him to Egypt or Canada.

While former prime minister Jean Chrétien publicly refused to involve Canada in the invasion of Iraq, a U.S. diplomatic memo obtained by WikiLeaks said Canadian forces would be 'discreetly useful to the military effort.' (Jonathan Hayward/Canadian Press)

The Americans confiscated Ismail's Canadian passport and expired Egyptian passport, assigned him internment serial number US9EG002770DP, and medically assessed him as mentally sound but ""narcissistic and arrogant,"" according to U.S. diplomatic cables.

After a psychotic break in 2007, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, was segregated and given intravenous anti-schizophrenia medication.

Ismail is the only known Canadian to have been held at the Bagram detention facility other than OmarKhadr, who spent approximately four months there before being transferred to the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo, Cuba.

Government officials have refused to say if he was eventually transferred back to Canada.

3. Montreal Metro bomb plot

An anonymous letter sent to the RCMP in late 2004 warned of bomb threats to the Montreal Metro system and the U.S. Embassy in Canada by a man affiliated with Osama bin Laden, a secret U.S. diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks to CBC News revealed.

The letter, dated Nov. 29, 2004, spurred American government facilities across Canada to heighten security. Though the RCMP noted such letters are frequently received and the threat was doubted to be ""credible,"" U.S. Embassy officials said in the document that few such threats specifically mention the U.S. Embassy.

The anonymous letter writer claimed to have overheard a man detailing a possible plot to bomb the Montreal Metro system on Dec. 15, 2004, and the U.S. Embassy on Jan. 10, 2005.

The brief letter in French, addressed to the RCMP's Montreal headquarters, included the suspected bomb plotter's name and cellphone number.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was arrested by British police on Thursday in the Ecuadorian Embassy where he'd been holed up since 2012 after the United States requested his extradition, London police say. 2:43

4. Curbing the oilsands

Former environment minister Jim Prentice told U.S. Ambassador David Jacobson that he was prepared to step in and impose tougher regulations on the oilsands if the industry damaged Canada's green reputation, according to another cable released by WikiLeaks.

""[Prentice] noted that if industry did not take voluntary measures and if the provincial government did not set more stringent regulations, he would step in and press federal environmental legislation,"" according to the cable, apparently written by Jacobson.

5. Libya threatens to nationalize Petro-Canada operations

Libya threatened to nationalize Petro-Canada's operations in the North African country over a spat with the Canadian government according to a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable.

Moammar Gadhafi — the Libyan dictator killed during the 2011 civil war that ended his four decade-long rule — cancelled a late September 2009 stopover in Newfoundland after Canada promised a tongue-lashing for the hero's welcome Libya extended to a man convicted for the Lockerbie bombing.

The U.S. cable, obtained from WikiLeaks by British newspaper the Daily Telegraph, said Libya's state oil company called in a senior Petro-Canada official with a threat to nationalize the firm's operations in Libya if Canada did not apologize.

WikiLeaks also uncovered the case of a Canadian detainee held in a U.S.-run prison in Afghanistan for more than a year and a half. (Jonathon Burch/Reuters)

6. Canada wanted to copy U.S. hostage policy

Canada sought U.S. help in crafting a national hostage policy, hoping to follow the secretive American policy as ""closely as possible,"" a U.S. diplomatic cable leaked by whistleblower website WikiLeaks revealed.

In early January 2009 — after five kidnappings in as many months — Canada asked for a briefing on U.S. policy in hostage situations as it planned to create a formal national policy of its own.

""Canada seeks to co-ordinate its policy as closely as possible with that of the U.S.,"" the leaked U.S. State Department diplomatic cable states.

7. Harper's empty Arctic sovereignty bluster: U.S. cable

A WikiLeaks cable suggested the U.S. government viewed former prime minister Stephen Harper's talk about Canadian Arctic sovereignty as little more than empty chest-thumping designed to win votes.

In a diplomatic cable posted by WikiLeaks, the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa said the Conservatives have made successful political use of promises to beef up Canada's presence in the Arctic.

Now-deceased Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi threatened to nationalize Petro-Canada assets in northern Libya, according to a U.S. cable obtained by WikiLeaks. (Reuters)

But it also said the Harper government had done only scant implementation on pledges such as increasing surveillance over the Northwest Passage.

""Conservatives make concern for 'The North' part of their political brand … and it works,"" says the note, titled Canada's Conservative Government and its Arctic Focus.

8. U.S. viewed John Baird as rising star

U.S. diplomats saw a bright future for Conservative MP John Baird, describing him as ""a young, ambitious and dynamic minister who should be one of the Conservatives' top leadership prospects in the future,"" according to a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable.

Americans devoted an entire nine-page diplomatic cable to analyzing Baird after he was appointed to the tricky file of environment minister in January 2007.

""Baird clearly enjoys and is comfortable with the rough-and-tumble of parliamentary debate in contrast to his predecessor Rona Ambrose,"" says a section of the cable marked ""embassy comment.""

""It is clear that Baird hopes a strong performance handling the politically sensitive environmental file will eventually be rewarded by his appointment to an even higher-profile ministry.""

9. U.S. contrasted 'forceful' Rae with 'meek' Ignatieff

After a meeting with David Jacobson, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, on Oct. 23, 2009, American diplomats found Bob Rae to be forceful, eloquent and dominant in comparison to then-Liberal leader and former rival Michael Ignatieff, according to leaked diplomatic cables.

Their relations ""remain clearly tense, with Rae arriving late and then immediately dominating the conversation, while Ignatieff sat back almost meekly,"" says a cable marked ""confidential.""

""Rae was by far the more forceful and eloquent of the two and showed little deference to his party chief, without at any time displaying any rudeness or personal animosity.

""He came across as better read and more substantive than Ignatieff, who stuck mostly to pleasantries and generalities.""",9 Canadian stories WikiLeaks helped bring to light,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/9-canadian-stories-wikileaks-helped-bring-to-light-1.5094640

Lamont told the Canadian Press in March that he knew about Klassen’s possible departure ...,"Northern Manitoba Liberal MLA Judy Klassen confirmed what has been rumoured since early March by announcing April 11 that she intends to seek the federal Liberal nomination in the Churchill-Keewatinook Aski riding and take on incumbent NDP MP Niki Ashton.

“Justin Trudeau and the federal government have made much-needed investments into Truth and Reconciliation initiatives as well as significant investments in the Northern Manitoba economy,” said Klassen in a press release. “Manitoba’s North needs these investments more than ever, and Justin Trudeau and the federal Liberals are the only choice to ensure that the North continues to see this much-needed investment and work needed for Truth and Reconciliation within our Indigenous communities.”

article continues below

Originally from the fly-in northeastern Manitoba First Nation of St. Theresa Point in the Island Lake area, Klassen was elected in as Keewatinook MLA in 2016, defeating former NDP MLA Eric Robinson as one of three successful Liberal candidates in the election that brought Premier Brian Pallister’s Progressive Conservative government into power, breaking a 17-year hold on government by the provincial NDP.

Klassen’s press release announcing her intent to jump to federal politics said that she is known by some of her Manitoba legislature peers as the “Dragon Slayer” for her defeat of the long-time MLA and says she is up for the challenge of taking on Ashton, who has represented Churchill and then Churchill-Keewatinook Aski since 2008, though her margin of victory shrank considerably in the last election from the previous one. Ashton beat Liberal candidate Rebecca Chartrand, who doesn’t live in Northern Manitoba, by fewer than 1,000 votes in the 2015 federal election, while she beat Conservative candidate Wally Daudrich from Churchill by 5,000 votes in the 2011 election.

“This will be a challenging race, but I have the complete support of my community and my family,"" Klassen said. ""The continued commitment to the North by Justin Trudeau and the federal government is crucial in both achieving more Truth and Reconciliation initiatives as well as building our northern economy. The time of Ashton family representation in the North is over, and now is the time for representation and leadership that can get results for the North.”

The Churchill-Keewatinook Aski riding is 75 per cent Indigenous and many of its First Nations are accessible only by air or by winter roads.

Klassen’s move to the federal realm will put the Manitoba Liberal Party at risk of losing official party status, which it just regained last summer for the first time since 1995 when party leader Dougald Lamont won a byelection in Winnipeg’s St. Boniface riding to give the party four seats.

River Heights MLA Jon Gerrard and Burrows MLA Cindy Lamoureux are the Manitoba Liberals’ other MLAs.

Official party status gives parties access to funding, research staff and a guaranteed presence during Question Period and on committees.

Lamont told the Canadian Press in March that he knew about Klassen’s possible departure but expected that he would have his party’s full complement of MLAs at election time, because he believed the PC government would call it in the spring.",Keewatinook MLA announces she’s seeking federal Liberal nomination,Thompson Citizen,https://www.thompsoncitizen.net/news/nickel-belt/keewatinook-mla-announces-she-s-seeking-federal-liberal-nomination-1.23788342

The Liberal government has insisted it wants to find a scientific solution to the canola dispute, in keeping with ...","OTTAWA—Canola farmers whose livelihoods have been targeted by China in its feud with Canada say it’s time for the federal government to be aggressive at the political level in its fight against a growing number of agricultural trade barriers around the world.

Several producers told two parliamentary committees Tuesday that China’s recent rejection of Canadian canola-seed shipments is only the latest trade disruption that’s hurt the country’s agriculture sector.

They reminded MPs in Ottawa about a number of major trade obstacles faced by Canadian agricultural exporters in faraway markets like India, Italy, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia.

“Canada can feed the world but not if our government does not act strongly on our behalf, removing non-tariff trade barriers, enforcing existing trade agreements and removing political roadblocks,” Alberta canola farmer Stephen Vandervalk told the House of Commons agriculture committee.

Citing concerns about pests, China has rejected canola-seed imports from Canada and has suspended the licences of two major Canadian exporters.

The moves to cut off the critical Canadian export have been widely viewed as China applying economic pressure on Canada in response to the December arrest of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver at the behest of the United States.

Any extended canola dispute with China, which imported $2.7 billion worth of canola seed from Canada last year, would deliver a painful economic blow to producers, the supply chain and the wider Canadian economy.

The price of canola has fallen since the dispute started last month. The late-winter timing of the disruption has been particularly difficult because it’s forced many farmers to suddenly rethink the planting decisions vital to their businesses.

On Tuesday, producers made it clear to MPs at the committees that even with the urgency around the China conflict, the pain is not only about canola. Canadian farmers, they said, are staring at other big trade hurdles in world markets.

Several of the witnesses mentioned issues that have affected Canada’s durum wheat exports to Italy, wheat sales to Vietnam, pulse exports to India and feed-barley shipments to Saudi Arabia.

Saskatchewan grain farmer Mehgin Reynolds (who is seeking a Conservative party nomination) told MPs that, for instance, her four-year crop rotation includes lentils, barley, canola and durum wheat—all products that face obstacles on foreign markets.

“The frightening reality is that almost every crop being grown in Canada is currently struggling with one trade barrier or another,” Reynolds said.

The Liberal government has insisted it wants to find a scientific solution to the canola dispute, in keeping with China’s insistence that the problem is tainted seeds.

The Liberals have established a working group that includes officials from Richardson International Ltd. and Viterra Inc.—the two exporters that have had their licences to sell canola revoked by China—and representatives from the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau has requested to send a delegation of experts to China to examine the issue. She’s said officials are exploring options to support farmers by expanding existing programs.

Canola producer Mark Kaun told the committee it’s time for the Canadian government to start playing “hardball.”

“There’s a pile of imports that come into this country from China&mdash’and maybe some of their ships should sit and wait in the water,” Kaun said. “Canadian canola is contaminated—it’s contaminated with political dirt and bureaucracy.”

“This is a political issue plain and simple. Political problems need political solutions,” agreed Vandervalk, who’s also vice-president representing Alberta with the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association.

“If we must play the game of grain inspections, so be it. But in the meantime Canadian grain farmers are the ones paying the price for the political failings.”",Canadian farmers demand strong response to expanding trade obstacles,plant.ca,https://www.plant.ca/general/canadian-farmers-demand-strong-response-to-expanding-trade-obstacles-182787/

""Let us know how the ...","OTTAWA – Liberal MPs have penned a letter to Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer imploring him to cancel a Greater Toronto Area candidate's $250-a-ticket fundraising event billed as a discussion of ""the business of healthcare.""

The Liberals say they're concerned about the framing of the event, but also say it's ""quite clearly an attempt to sell access to power,"" in the letter obtained by CTV News.

The event, scheduled in North York, Ont. next week, includes the tagline: ""healthcare reimagined, it’s time for change."" Based on the wording of the event website it appears geared towards people who work in the health-care field.

The fundraiser is being hosted by the Conservative candidate for Don Valley West, Ont. Yvonne Robertson, and was initially described as a policy forum and cocktail reception with Conservative MPs Pierre Poilievre, or ""our next finance minister"" as the event describes, and Marilyn Gladu, ""our next health minister.""

However, the reference to the two MPs as potential future ministers was removed after CTV News approached Robertson's campaign for comment.

""There is only one person that decides cabinet, and that’s the Prime Minister of Canada. As an opposition party, we have Shadow Ministers, not a cabinet, and referencing them as anything else is not representative of their actual position. That has been changed,"" Robertson's campaign said in an email.

The letter to Scheer—sent before the event webpage was amended—said that it’s ""alarming"" that the party is promoting attendees' ability to be able to bend the ears of Poilievre and Gladu, who are described as future ministers.

""That was one of the least offensive parts,"" Rob Oliphant, the Liberal MP who currently represents the riding, told CTV News after learning that the event description had been amended. He said regardless, the event is still troubling and should be cancelled. ""It's still cash for access,"" Oliphant said, because it is inviting people to donate to the Conservative Party to be able to help shape their policy.

He was one of the seven MPs—who all are either doctors, or represent GTA ridings—who signed the letter.

The event also lists deputy Conservative Party leader Lisa Raitt, MP Peter Kent, and senators Linda Frum and Nicole Eaton, as well as others who will be there to hear ideas about improving the Canadian health-care system related to small businesses and modernizing the Canada Health Act.

""Let us know how the current healthcare system affects your practice and which policy changes you think would have the greatest positive impact on you and your patients,"" the event page reads.

Nowhere in the event listing is privatizing health care stated, though the Liberals are calling on Scheer to ""prove you support public health care, by immediately cancelling this event.""

Oliphant said he found it ""worrisome"" that the event description states that health policy should be ""shaped heavily"" by ""dedicated practitioners."" Oliphant said that while doctors and nurses should be involved, so too should patients and public health officials.

In an effort to counter the event, he's planned an open townhall earlier in the week, featuring Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor.

""The concept that the business of health care comes over the patient outcomes… that's what worries me,"" Oliphant said. ""Health care is not a business, health care is about life and death.""

In response to the Liberals’ concerns about privatization and framing of health care as a business, Robertson's campaign spokesperson Matthew Poon said that the event was designed ""to bring together small business owners like doctors who were unfairly targeted by Justin Trudeau’s small business tax hikes and discuss ways to help them better deliver health services within the principles of the Canada Health Act.""

""Conservatives have always and will always support the principles of the Canada Health Act,"" the statement said.

After coming under fire, largely from the Conservatives, for holding ""cash for access"" events — where for sizeable donations, guests could rub shoulders with the prime minister or members of his cabinet—the Liberals changed the rules to set up more transparency around these events.

The new political fundraising laws came into effect at the end of 2018, requiring parties to advertise fundraisers in advance, and report back afterwards, if they're charging $200 or more per ticket and featuring the prime minister, cabinet ministers, party leaders, or party leadership candidates. Under these rules, there are no requirements for advertising or reporting fundraising events where MPs are the featured guests.

CTVNews.ca has also reached out to Scheer's office for comment.

THUNDER BAY – Mayor Bill Mauro has sent a letter to Premier Doug Ford, urging the Ontario government to maintain Canadian content requirements in its subway procurements.

Mauro, who as a Liberal MPP helped usher in Canadian content legislation to help protect companies like Bombardier, said he’s concerned the multi-national company’s Thunder Bay plant could be in jeopardy once its latest round of contracts are up, potentially affecting as many as 1,200 high-paid employees.

The province recently announced plans to upload responsibility of Toronto’s subway system and Mauro reminded Ford, whose office has acknowledged the letter, that Bombardier is Thunder Bay’s largest private-sector employer that helps drive the local economy and the quality of life of the city’s residents.

“We all understand and appreciate how important Bombardier is to the local economy. We all are aware that we’re close to seeing the end of contract work at the plant, so we’re all very concerned,” Mauro said, explaining his decision to send a letter to Ford.

“We have sent a number of letters, we have had a number of conversations with the provincial government around the importance of Bombardier and the workforce to the economy. This was just one more example of outreach by us, and others doing the same thing, to try to reinforce how important this is to our economy here in Thunder Bay.”

Mauro said both Ford and his minister of economic development are aware of the issues.

The previous Liberal government required at least 25 per cent Canadian manufacturing content in order to provide funding for mass transit projects, which Mauro said often led to 50 and 60 per cent Canadian content. But a recent Via Rail contract was fully awarded to a German company and the trains will be manufactured in the United States, a country that has recently upped its American-made content requirements under the watch of President Donald Trump.

Mauro’s letter indicated that as recently as 2015 Bombardier had a network of more than 500 Ontario-based suppliers that benefited workers not only in Thunder Bay, but also Mississauga, Markham, London, Hamilton and Toronto.

He added he sees opportunity to continue existing contracts with both the Toronto Transit Commission and Metrolix for up to 231 more trains.

Mauro also noted he’s spoken with Toronto Mayor John Tory recently, who indicated plans for mass transit upgrades and expansion, work the Thunder Bay’s mayor believes Bombardier is perfectly suited to undertake.",Mauro asks Ford to continue Canadian content requirements,Tbnewswatch,https://www.tbnewswatch.com/local-news/mauro-asks-ford-to-continue-canadian-content-requirements-1357680

A B.C. Liberal MLA says it's time for the government to protect kids and ban flavoured vape juice.

Todd Stone, MLA for Kamloops-South Thompson, introduced a private member's bill Thursday that he said would keep tobacco and vapour products away from young people.

In a statement, Stone said the bill would amend the Tobacco and Vapour Products Control Act to ban flavoured vape juice, make retail rules stricter and stiffen penalties for rule-breakers.

""Vaping and e-cigarette use is quickly becoming an epidemic among the youth of British Columbia,"" Stone said.

""It is baffling and simply dangerous that more is not happening immediately to quell this. Government needs to act on this now.""

Studies show one-third of high school students from Grades 10 to 12 are vaping, Stone said, adding tobacco companies are ""enticing youth with sugary flavouring.""

Health minister not opposed

In Question Period Thursday, Stone posed a question to Health Minister Adrian Dix asking if he would ban ""kid-friendly flavouring"" of vape juices, like bubblegum, cotton candy and gummy bears.

Dix responded that while flavoured cigarettes are banned, flavoured vape juice is an ""evolving"" area for the law to deal with.

""I'm very interested in looking at that option,"" Dix said of a ban. ""Maybe the regime we put in place is not adequate.""

He said a bigger push was needed involving government, teachers, parents and youth.

Peace River North MLA Dan Davies pushed the Education Minister Rob Fleming on providing better resources in schools to improve awareness of the risks of vaping.

Fleming said new efforts are being made to snuff out e-cigarette use.

“I think the Queen just might be eating babies. Fuck, there’s all kind of circumstantial evidence that states she’s a Satan worshipping cannibal, which is kind of fucked up and weird isn’t it? I never did trust authority but I would’ve never bet on it being this weird.”

Murray Acton aka “The Cretin” is as an anti-authoritarian punk-rock anarchist and frontman of Canadian hardcore-punk outfit Dayglo Abortions. For nearly 40 years, Acton and his band of misfits from Victoria, B.C. have caused controversy all around the globe with their “fuck you” attitude and groovy heavy-rock riffs, garnering worldwide acclaim in the underground punk and hardcore scene.

The band’s highest selling record to date, Feed Us A Fetus, showcases former president of the United States Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan sitting at a table with a cooked fetus on a dinner plate. Their following record, Here Today, Guano Tomorrow, saw the band encounter obscenity charges from an Ontario police officer, who found great offense in his teenage daughter listening to tracks like “Fuck My Shit Stinks” and “Fuck Satan to Death” plastered alongside the image of a hamster brutalized by gunshot. The charges were dropped in in 1990 and Dayglo Abortions released their next album, Two Dogs Fucking, in 1991. The artwork is exactly as it sounds. Their latest album, 2016’s Armageddon Survival Guide, originally held a much different title that would have definitely landed them a date in court.

“Originally that was supposed to be out in 2012. This album was supposed to be called Kill Stephen Harper,” Acton says. “They really didn’t like it because it was provoking people to sue us again. I was gonna start a Stephen Harper popularity fund where we have this thing on Facebook that says ‘Would you pledge $5000 dollars to have Stephen Harper assassinated?’ and a thermometer would go up. Obviously that thing was gonna hit the roof in no time, eh.”

Though the album’s title changed, Acton still got a dig in on Harper with the song “Canadian Hate-Triot” where the frontman yells obscenities at our former Prime Minister, calling him a corporate whore and towel-boy for the global elite.

Acton isn’t too pleased with our current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau either. He calls Trudeau a “Fuckin’ elitist slob” who is “Just like his father. A fuckin’ lawyer looking out for himself and his corporate cronies.”

“He’s never come through with anything,” Acton says. “He makes like he’s gonna come clean with the aboriginals and stuff like that, and fuckin’ nothing. It was all just campaign smoke. The guy is full of shit and he’s ruined fuckin’ marijuana. I’m fuckin’ pissed about that. One of my favourite things to do and he’s fuckin ruined it.”

Acton admits that the upcoming Canadian elections are making him nervous. He doesn’t plan to vote for either the Liberals or Conservatives and will most likely cast his ballot for the Green Party. Acton usually votes Green regardless, but there’s a lingering fear of what this election could bring if Conservative leader Andrew Scheer becomes our PM.

“We could end up with a fuckin’ right wing nut bar want to be like Trump character the way things are going.”

The past U.S. election gave Acton a flurry of new material, and he says a new Dayglo Abortions album is written, and ready to record.

“It’s gonna raise a few eyebrows,” Acton concludes. “It’s not particularly politically correct, but I’ve never been politically correct anyways. I don’t go out of my way to hurt people’s feelings or anything like that, but sometimes you gotta hurt a few feelings just to get the job done, ya know? It’s like trolling in real life.”

In conclusion, Acton can forget about all of this when he’s on stage. He assures the band is tighter than they have ever been, and urges anyone who hasn’t seen the band to check them out at SBC on April 12.",B.C.

(Bloomberg) — Canadian spending on legal pot will increase ninefold to $5.2 billion by 2024, but the market’s potential continues to be hindered by a patchwork of provincial regulations, according to a new report.

After becoming the first major economy to legalize recreational cannabis on Oct. 17, Canadian sales are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 44 percent to $5.2 billion in 2024 from $569 million in 2018, Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics said Tuesday. That’s down from a January forecast of $5.9 billion by 2022.

Competition from a well-established illicit market, limited product selection, a slow retail rollout and “languid online distribution” are all inhibiting the growth of the Canadian pot market, the report says.

This resulted in medical patients spending an average of $1,452 on legal cannabis in 2018 versus $3,634 in Colorado and $3,933 in Arizona, while per-person recreational spending is forecast by 2024 to only reach the low end of the $500-to-$1,000 range seen in some U.S. states.

In addition, spending will be “highly regional and tightly tied to provincial-level regulations that created vast gaps in business friendliness across the provinces,” the report says.

Alberta, for example, accounted for 38 percent of Canada’s pot sales in 2018 despite having less than 12 percent of its population. Quebec, by contrast, had 6.2 percent of sales and 23 percent of the population, while Ontario had 36 percent of sales and 39 percent of the population.

“Alberta’s comparatively liberal regulatory regime suggests it will rank among the fastest-growing provincial cannabis markets,” Arcview and BDS said. The western province, where retailers are privately run, is expected to open more than 200 licensed stores in the first year of legalization compared with fewer than 50 in each of the other provinces.

Ontario just opened its first 10 stores on April 1, nearly six months after legalization, while Quebec has 13 government-run stores open to date.

Product shortages have also restricted early sales, forcing Ontario to limit its initial number of retail licenses to just 25, while Quebec had to close its cannabis stores three days a week. This was typical of the U.S. states that legalized before Canada and should ease as more licensed production comes online, the report says.

He and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party are trailing the rival Conservative Party in most polls.","(Bloomberg) -- Some investors see plenty of reasons to bet against Canada’s big banks. Don’t count Bill Morneau among them.

Canada’s finance minister, who’s visiting Washington for a series of meetings with policy makers, was asked about recent news reports that some investors are short-selling the country’s biggest lenders. After a brief caveat that he wasn’t trying to give advice, Morneau laid out a defense of the sector.

© Bloomberg Morneau Interview

The banks are well-capitalized and not overexposed to credit risk, he said. The broader economy is doing well and the government continues to work on what he called a core risk of household indebtedness. All that adds up to a good view of the lenders.



“The underlying thesis, I don’t buy into,” Morneau told reporters Thursday in Washington, after an event at Georgetown University, adding he continues to be “optimistic about our banking sector.”

Some short-sellers have been targeting Canada’s indefatigable banks, which soldiered on through the financial crisis a decade ago and are up about 9 percent so far this year -- even as household debt hovers near record levels and signs emerge of softness in Canada’s economy.

Housing Markets

Policy makers have taken a series of steps to cool the housing market in particular to try and avert any bubble, targeting Vancouver and Toronto in particular. Morneau cited that as a pillar of the outlook for the banking sector.

“We see that loan losses, credit risk, is being managed very effectively. We have a sense that the core risk that we’ve wanted to deal with, which is high household debt -- that we’re dealing with through the housing system in a way that’s managing that situation,” he said. “So my view is that the broader economy is doing well, that our banking system is doing well. We’ll continue to work on high household indebtedness, Canadians will need to work on that.”

Morneau delivered his fourth budget last month, ahead of a federal election this fall. He and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party are trailing the rival Conservative Party in most polls.

309,Politics,2019-04-12T02:06:00.0000000Z,"BC Green leader Andrew Weaver: ‘We have not been good at telling our story, and I can tell you we’re going to be a lot better at that going forward.’ Photo by Chad Hipolito, Canadian Press.","Over the last few weeks the three BC Green Party MLAs have been repeatedly outvoted on legislation related to liquefied natural gas development.

But the defeats in the legislature have given the Greens a chance to demonstrate how they differ from the province’s two main political parties, starting with their opposition to the $40-billion LNG Canada project in Kitimat.

“In the face of what to us looks like staggering... evidence about this being the worst possible direction to be taking, it was really important that we voice that opposition,” said Sonia Furstenau, the MLA for Cowichan Valley. “All of the evidence right now is telling us the last thing the world needs is a massive new point-source emitter of greenhouse gases.”

The LNG debate was the latest chapter in the ongoing story of the Green MLAs’ attempts to navigate their relationship with the NDP, which since 2017 has relied on their support on key votes to stay in power.

It comes following a poor showing in a January byelection in Nanaimo, where the party’s share of the vote fell by more than 50 per cent from the 2017 election.

The results left some inside and outside the party wondering whether the Greens were being overshadowed by their partners in power-sharing and in danger of losing relevancy. There were questions about whether the party could keep building momentum, or if it had peaked with three MLAs.

Green leader Andrew Weaver has emphasized the party’s different vision for the future of the province, but the opposition to LNG development has made that vision most visible.

Besides the greenhouse gas emissions, Furstenau said, supplying gas for the LNG Canada site will mean more fracking in the northeast of the province. A recent government report found there’s not enough data to understand fracking’s environmental impacts, though it is conclusively linked to an increase in seismic activity.

“I’m quite shocked,” Furstenau said. “Fundamentally the vast majority of British Columbians want to see governments making decisions that will move us away from increasing our emissions and will move us towards climate action.”

Nor would most British Columbians support providing what amounts to a $6-billion subsidy to the fossil fuel industry, she said.

Yet in the legislature, only the three Green MLAs made the case against the government’s direction.

NDP-Liberal agreement

Premier John Horgan has argued that the LNG Canada proposal fits with the CleanBC plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and that the provincial government stands to gain $23 billion from the project over its lifetime.

It will see thousands of jobs created in a part of the province that badly needs them, he’s argued.

In doing so, he’s contributed to the conclusion among many environmentalists that despite the Green role in the government, it values jobs over anything else.

An April 6 Globe and Mail article found there was little difference between the NDP minority government and the former BC Liberal government in policies on forestry, mining, LNG and Site C.

Longtime activist and Order of Canada recipient Vicky Husband offered a blunt assessment in an interview: “They haven’t changed a damn thing ... there doesn’t appear to be an environmental bone in their body.”

The message from Horgan’s office to his ministers is clear, she said. “If it’s a choice between jobs and the environment, jobs just win.”

That means it’s extremely important that the Greens keep building on their success, she added. “We have two major parties in B.C. who don’t care about the environment, no matter what they’re saying.”

Warren Bell, a Salmon Arm doctor and Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment board member, said the Greens are taking the right position given the threat of climate change.

“It’s not surprising this rift has developed,” he said. “What is surprising is the BC Liberals and the NDP are finding common cause around this particular matter... It’s turning the NDP and the Liberals into Tweedledee and Tweedledum on this particular policy area.”

The Greens have long argued that the BC Liberals and NDP have many policies in common.

“We were clear about this in the 2017 election campaign, that the other two parties were offering a pretty similar vision, and I think the Greens, what really sets us apart, is we have a very different vision for the future of B.C. than either of the other two parties,” Furstenau said.

“Both of them have a very, as far as we’re concerned, backward-looking approach to the economy and to the future of B.C.”

Stark contrast

Evan Pivnick, the chief of staff for the BC Green caucus, said the debate of the past few weeks was about climate change, the biggest challenge facing the world, and choosing how to build the provincial economy.

“I think it’s safe to say the LNG debate is absolutely the starkest difference that has come before the legislative assembly,” Pivnick said. “Our folks used every single tool they had at their disposal.”

While the LNG debate has been a defining moment for the Greens, it comes within a couple months of a Nanimo byelection where the party’s candidate finished a distant third.

Final results showed the NDP’s Sheila Malcolmson received almost 50 per cent of the vote and wasn’t far off the total number of votes Leonard Krog got in the 2017 general election. Krog stepped down as MLA to run successfully for Nanaimo mayor. Tony Harris, the BC Liberal candidate, increased his party’s vote count by almost 800 votes over 2017.

But the Green vote dropped to 1,783 for Michelle Ney, down from the 5,454 the previous Green candidate got in the general election.

In a mid-February interview, Weaver said the Green vote had collapsed in the byelection.

“Michelle’s vote was Michelle’s friends and family. We lost our Green vote. The Green vote did not exist. The Green vote went to the NDP.”

He attributed that collapse to voters’ fear that if the BC Liberals captured the seat, the NDP government would fall and the Liberals would return to power.

Weaver said the party knew from its own polling that the main question on voters’ minds in Nanaimo was whether they wanted to send the province into another general election.

Green donors and members were voting NDP because they liked the direction of the NDP government, with Green support, over the past two years, he said.

“The number of times I got hugged on the doorstep by people saying, ‘We like what we’re seeing, but we’re voting for Sheila.’ Very frustrating for me,” he said.

Weaver’s interpretation of the byelection is backed up by pollster Barb Justason with Justason Market Intelligence. “Much of the collapse in Nanaimo’s Green support can be explained by 2017 Green supporters’ strategic voting, largely to the benefit of the BC NDP,” she wrote at the time.

“But BC Liberals can thank right-leaning 2017 BC Green supporters for some of their support bump. As our poll illustrates, party support is mobile — increasingly so when strategic voting factors in a race empowered to take down the government.”

For every 10 people who voted Green in 2017, she said, four stayed with the party in the byelection, four voted NDP and two voted Liberal.

‘Work to do’: Weaver

One of the things Weaver took from the byelection was that many people don’t understand how the political system works or the role that an opposition party like the Greens play in a minority government. “Clearly we have some work to do to articulate what our role is,” he said.

“On top of that a lot of people didn’t know our contributions,” he said. The Greens had been influential in shaping of the CleanBC plan to reduce carbon emissions while growing the economy, as well as in reviews of the environmental assessment process and the professional reliance model for assessing resource projects, but failed to get credit, he said.

“We have not been good at telling our story, and I can tell you we’re going to be a lot better at that going forward.”

The Nanaimo result should have been sobering for Greens, said Matt Toner. A former NDP candidate, the Vancouver tech entrepreneur joined the Green Party in 2015 and served as deputy leader until the end of 2017. He was part of the backroom negotiating team when the Greens reached an agreement with the NDP that allowed the latter to form government.

The Nanaimo byelection was likely a preview of the dynamic that will shape the next general election, Toner said. “People were backed into a strategic voting corner, and we got clobbered,” he said.

“If I’m the Green Party, I’m looking at the byelection and I’m freaking out. It says something in a riding that seemed friendly to us exactly how people do the math internally when it comes to these decisions. It’s not in our favour.”

Success in the electoral reform referendum would have changed everything for the Greens, and it was a mistake not to be more closely involved in the process all the way through, Toner said.

“Now we’re forced back into playing the old game, and not one we’ve not been historically especially good at,” he said. It will make it harder to attract candidates and find support than it would have been. “It’s a pretty strong headwind in my opinion.”

Old dynamic remains

Pivnick said if there was a message in the Nanaimo byelection it was one that party has heard before.

“I don’t view it as anything particularly new,” he said. “The dynamic in the next election is going to be the NDP saying, ‘Vote for us, we’ll continue this agenda and we’re the only ones that can actually earn a place to do this, and we can do more of this with a majority.’”

“And the Liberals say, ‘If you don’t like that direction, we’re the only ones who can earn a majority and go the other direction.’ That’s nothing new. That’s what both parties have relied on for a long time.”

The NDP has always been strong in Nanaimo, and it was unsurprising that voters there agreed to keep the party in government, he said. “It was always going to be a fairly persuasive argument.”

The dynamic can benefit the Greens, Pivnick said. “Our view is that’s also kind of what people are sick of in this province. This dichotomy between two large parties that define so much of their identities based on being against what the other person is for and vice versa.”

For example, he said, the Liberals are now criticizing the NDP on the carbon tax, a tax that the Liberals introduced a decade ago and that the NDP then opposed.

It’s the Greens’ job to bring grey into what’s often been a black-and-white debate in the province, he said. “I think there is a real space there, and I think that’s what is different in a general election.”

“We’ve taken stock of this moment, and we’re very hyper-aware of the fact there’s two years left in this minority government,” he said.

‘Love ‘em to death’

Toner recalled a Georgia Straight article from 2017 that suggested the NDP might deal with the Greens the same way Vision Vancouver dealt with COPE on city council. The article quoted a senior official in the then-mayor’s office saying, “We’re going to love ’em to death.”

He worried that’s exactly what’s happening to the Greens provincially. “You can be a constructive partner,” he said. “You can also be a partner that should make the NDP kind of sweat through these decisions. I honestly think right now they kind of figure they’ve got things where they need to be and the Greens won’t risk overturning the apple cart.”

It’s great to be vocal on topics like LNG, and it was a good step to leave the legislative chamber on the final LNG vote last week, but the party’s MLAs should have been more adversarial from day one and need to do more to press Horgan and the NDP, he said. “The challenge for the Green Party is they haven’t really effectively exercised their veto in Victoria.”

The Greens need to ratchet up pressure on the NDP so that if they do bring the government down, the public will understand why, Toner said.

He referred to a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that found there are as few as 12 years to act to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. “If you really think we have 12 years to turn this around, then every minute counts,” he said.

“Maybe now is the time for the Green Party to say, ‘If this government goes down on this issue, that’s OK. We’ll risk a new election because we think the situation is serious enough to warrant it.’ People value authenticity in politics. They value courage.”

Adam Olsen, who represents Saanich North and the Islands for the Greens, said the party needs to keep highlighting areas the other parties would rather not touch, such as launching a public inquiry into money laundering.

“Our job over the next number of months is to continue to tell our story about our role in this parliamentary session,” he said. “We need to continue to define ourselves as being in large respect an alternative to the establishment.”

At the same time, the Greens need to take their role seriously and demonstrate that minority governments can be stable, Olsen said.

“People don’t need to inherently fear minority governments,” he said, adding he hears calls from advocacy groups wanting the Greens to bring down the government. “There is a balance we need to strike to be responsible in this place.”

It’s possible to achieve things without bringing the government down, Olsen said, pointing to success he had raising concerns about the survival of wild salmon that led to the appointment of an advisory committee on the issue.

“We have taken great steps forward,” he said. “There is no question the Greens have been influential... We have to continue to talk about the things that concern British Columbians and need to be relevant. We have a responsibility for our own fate.”

Different voices needed

In a general election, strategic voting will be a factor, but not to the same degree that it was in Nanaimo, said Sonia Theroux, a former political strategist who worked on election campaigns for Green candidates, including Furstenau and Jo-Ann Roberts.

“It was such a high stakes byelection,” she said. “There’s more complexity in a general election, and it’s not so pointy.” That leaves more room for people to make a “hopeful” vote, she said.

She said the Greens did well during the LNG debate. “It was the right move for them from a values perspective,” she said. “Why have Greens at all if they’re going to cave to things like an LNG tax break?”

On any given issue the Green MLAs have to decide where they stand, and also whether to support the government, she said. They need to be vocal in their opposition to LNG and to building the Site C dam, but on a pragmatic level they need to be looking ahead to what happens if the government falls.

In the wake of the Site C decision, for example, Weaver argued that bringing the government down over the issue would have led to an election that almost certainly would have been won by one of the two parties that support building the dam.

Theroux said that when the Greens appear to prop up the government, people don’t see the many hard conversations that are happening behind closed doors.

Fursteneau said there are a number of issues where Greens have brought a voice that would otherwise have been lacking in the legislature. She cited her work to address the overrepresentation of Indigenous children in government foster care, reforms to rules around lobbying and calls for a public inquiry into money laundering, plus all the constituency work MLAs do.

“We’ve been the only three on a number of files that have moved forward in the last two years, and without us there I would say that a lot of those files wouldn’t be moving forward, much less be on the radar,” she said.

“We are demonstrating the value of having a third party, of having different voices and the value of having MLAs that are going to work quite relentlessly on a number of files,” she said. “It’s not like there’s one thing and that’s the only thing that matters. There are dozens of things that we are collectively working on and making a difference on, and we’ll continue to do that.”

Furstenau said it’s positive for British Columbians to see that politicians don’t always have to be in a state of conflict.

“If you put first and foremost public service as your guiding principle, then evidence as your guiding decision-making principle, you can achieve a lot more,” she said. “Even if you don’t win every battle.”",Can BC’s Greens Avoid Disaster in the Next Election?,The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/04/09/Can-BC-Greens-Avoid-Disaster-Next-Election/
310,Business,2019-04-11T03:43:00.0000000Z,This has helped lead to sharp reductions in Canadian oil and gas capital spending ... streamlining and reducing regulations. Kenneth Green is a resident fellow at the Fraser Institute.,"A new report by Ernst & Young, commissioned for the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, should serve as a wake-up call for Alberta.

According to the report, the last several years have seen an increase in the “volume, complexity, and duplication” of regulations imposed on Canada’s energy industry.

This has helped lead to sharp reductions in Canadian oil and gas capital spending.

The report notes that U.S. capital spending in oil and gas increased 38% in 2017, reaching a new high of US$120 billion while Canadian spending fell to US$45 billion, a 19% decrease since 2016.

The report also documents the growth of regulation in a section on “Regulatory Layering” in Canada, and gives numerous examples of overlapping greenhouse gas regulations at the federal and provincial level.

Such layering occurs when redundant laws and regulations from multiple levels of government pile up over time including, according to the report, the “structure of the programs and compliance mechanisms, reporting thresholds, reporting mechanisms and verification requirements varies between provinces.”

Furthermore, different quantification methodology requirements and boundaries for reporting require companies to undertake “multiple approaches for calculating their Greenhouse Gas Emissions.”

The report also compares pipeline project approvals in Canada and the United States.

The data show that average approval timelines in Canada grew from 357 days in 2009 to 681 days but in the U.S. dropped from 561 days in 2015 to 336 days in 2017.

Finally, the report profiles changes to TransCanada Pipelines, which has cancelled several major Canadian projects in recent years.

It finds that “in 2016, TransCanada Pipelines capital investment in natural gas pipelines was evenly split between Canada and the U.S., but in 2017 nearly 60% of capital spend was based in the U.S.

Perhaps more alarming are the statistics on construction spend for new natural gas projects.

In 2016, 46% of spend was in Canada and 54% in the U.S. In 2017, only 20% of spend was in Canada an 80% was in the U.S.”

As we have previously observed, there’s an urgent need for regulatory reform, especially in Alberta, where red tape is steadily strangling a major contributor to Canada’s economy.

Certainly falling oil prices have contributed to Alberta’s troubles, but many other factors affect investment in Alberta and many of them are regulatory.

For example, respondents to the Fraser institute’s Global Petroleum Survey said the key deterrents to investment in Alberta are all regulatory — respondents point to uncertainty about environmental regulations and their enforcement, and the cost of regulatory compliance.

This was particularly true in the oil and gas sector, where 70% of respondents registered compliance costs as a deterrent to investment in 2017 compared to only 32% in 2013.

Clearly, more must be done to resolve regulatory duplication, lighten the overall regulatory burden in the oil and gas industry and position Canada to be competitive with its neighbour to the south that’s aggressively streamlining and reducing regulations.

Now both the numbers and the momentum are on Conners’ side, even though Canadian history isn’t. “He’s confident and ...","After the first hole Thursday at the Masters, Corey Conners had the lead, and the jokes came quickly. The Canadian was in the first group, and since he had made par, while the other two members of the opening trio made bogey, of course he was leading.

But no one was laughing after the native of Listowel, Ont., curled in an eight-foot eagle on the par-5 15th, giving him the solo lead late in his opening round.

Conners, who held the early clubhouse lead after a 2-under-par 70 (10 shots better than his Thursday round in 2015, when he played the Masters as an amateur), was the last guy in the field this week but the tournament’s first leader.

Twenty-three Canadians have played the Masters in the event’s history, and despite a Mike Weir victory 16 years ago, it’s rare to see the red-and-white near the top of the leaderboard.

And even though Conners wasn’t in the Valero Texas Open 11 days ago, let alone the Masters, he very much looked like he belonged.

“We didn’t really talk about ‘the Masters’ or anything like that,” Conners’ caddie Kyle Peters told Sportsnet by phone from Augusta of the first round. “We treated it like a normal day, a normal tournament.”

Peters said the one thing that was different Thursday was Conners having a front-row look at Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player’s ceremonial tee shots. Peters stood on a cooler on the practice green.

But while Peters’ is trying to keep things as similar as last week, at least in terms of his appetite (he ate a hot dog Wednesday in Texas and continued to eat one each day through Sunday, since Conners was playing so well. And so far this week, he’s kept up the hot dog order the last few days. Yes, even at Augusta National), there is, of course, a lot that’s different.

“The challenge is that this is not normal,” Canadian PGA Tour winner Richard Zokol told Sportsnet of Conners’ opening-round result.

Zokol, who played the Masters in 1993 but missed the cut, said Conners’ run up the leaderboard early was “abnormal, but wonderful to watch.”

He describes it as such because, although this is the 50th anniversary of George Knudson’s runner-up Masters result in 1969, the average best finish of the other Canadians who have played the Masters is 30th.

And 14 of the 23 golfers to tee it up at Augusta National at least once? Their best finish is a missed cut.

But the Masters, for Canadians, is a sure sign that spring is around the corner. There is always extra hype. Mix in a Canadian on the leaderboard – and one who is fresh off his first PGA Tour win – and the hype machine is in overdrive.

Now, said Zokol, it’s up to Conners to reign it in.

“When you qualify for the Masters with a victory you have maybe a year, or at least some time, to think about obtaining these childhood dreams of one day playing the Masters (as a professional) but he didn’t have time for that,” said Zokol. “If he’s able to compound this state of mind and state of presence and performance, he’s going to be building wonderful traction.

“And if he keeps doing this, there’s no reason he couldn’t handle this right through the weekend.”

It’s early, yes, and Thursday morning at the Masters is equal parts an indication of Sunday night (each of the last eight Masters winners were in the top-10 after round one) and a mere blip on the tournament’s radar (only five golfers in the tournament’s history have lead wire-to-wire), but on a day while some of the best players in the world struggled, Conners was as solid as ever.

Justin Rose was 4-over through his first nine holes. Ditto Jordan Spieth. Rory McIlroy shot a 1-over-par 73. Same with the defending champion Patrick Reed.

But there’s Conners, under par and on the first page of the leaderboard, having relied on his world-class iron game to set him up to score.

Augusta National is known mostly as a second-shot golf course, and this year on the PGA Tour Conners is third in greens in regulation and was the early leader in the strokes gained: approach-the-green stat (a measurement of the performance of approach shots) at the Masters. Field leaders of strokes gained: approach-the-green at the Masters the previous four years have finished 1st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.

Now both the numbers and the momentum are on Conners’ side, even though Canadian history isn’t.

“He’s confident and knows the golf course well,” said Peters, “so I’m sure he feels pretty good.”

“He’s on a wave and he should just let it ride,” added Zokol. “Because it’s working.”

So a Canadian is near the top of the leaderboard at the Masters, which is an oddity, at least as recent history indicates.

The analyst likes ...","Analyst Corey Hammill of Paradigm Capital says US cannabis company Green Growth Brands (Green Growth Brands Stock Quote, Chart CSE:GGB) has assembled a virtual dream team of retail expertise, with the analyst giving GGB a “Buy” rating in his coverage initiation on Thursday.

Columbus, Ohio-based Green Growth commenced listing on the Canadian Securities Exchange this past November and is backed by the Schottensteins of American footwear chain DSW fame, one of the wealthiest families in the US, Hammill notes.

The analyst likes the company’s makeup, which he says is comprised of a management team highly experienced in retail and brands and an R&D team that has a combined 70-plus years of experience in consumer goods.

Green Growth is focused on both CBD/wellness products and THC-based products, with Hammill asserting that there’s a tonne of runway ahead for the company.

“Green Growth Brands boasts the most experienced retail team in the North American cannabis space and has relationships to access a large distribution network at little to no cost. We believe this provides GGB with a fundamental competitive advantage, which, paired with the lucrative market opportunity, has the potential to generate half-a-billion in annual revenue for the company within the next five years,” Hammill said in his coverage launch.

Rather than providing an absolute target price, Hammill is giving a target range. He sees the cannabis space evolving into an industry similar to that of specialty retail, whose companies trade at 3-4x forward revenue, with the wellness space —where Hammill places GGB— trading at 2.5-3.0x revenue.

“Given the early stage but aggressive plan for GGB’s retail build-out, we believe it is appropriate to assign a higher near-term revenue multiple, moderating it over time. Our analysis values GGB using a 5x near-term revenue multiple, declining to a long-term 3x multiple in 2022,” he says.

That modelling puts GGB in a near-term share price of approximately C$5.00 per share, which the analyst puts as increasing to C$9.00-plus over four years. The C$5.00 rough target would translate into a one-year return of 17.9 per cent at the time of publication

Hammill thinks GGB will generate fiscal 2019 revenue and EBITDA of $27.9 million and negative $8.9 million, respectively, and fiscal 2020 revenue and EBITDA of $149.6 million and $51.5 million, respectively.

He has plenty of fans cheering him on. “There are way more Canadian people than I was expecting — or at least people pretending to be Canadians — out there,” Conners quipped.","Corey Conners followed up a thrill at the first tee — a greeting from Jack Nicklaus — with a 2-under 70 that put the Canadian in solid position after the opening round Thursday.

Playing in the first group of the day, he got a chance to watch Nicklaus and Gary Player hit the ceremonial tee shots that traditionally kick off the first major of the year. On his way back to the clubhouse after his one and only swing, the 79-year-old Nicklaus congratulated Conners on last weekend’s victory at the Valero Texas Open — the performance that got him into the Masters as the final entrant in the field.

The 27-year-old Conners of Listowel, Ont. endured a sluggish front nine at 1 over. He was solid off the tee, but a little too cautious on the treacherous greens. Then in the middle of the back side, Conners made his move.

“I’ve shot this number and won four coats, so hopefully I can do it again,” said Woods, who slightly miscalculated. The last green jacket he won in 2005 began with a 74.

Tiger Woods played earlier in the day and plodded to a round of 70. It was a solid start for Woods in his quest to end 11 years without a major, and he was atop the leaderboard briefly until a late bogey. He sounded satisfied.

Mickelson began the back nine with shots into the pine trees and the water, only to follow with four birdies over the next five holes, including a tee shot on the par-3 16th that stopped inches from the cup.

At the end of an entertaining opening act at Augusta National, Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau shared the lead at 6-under-66, one shot ahead of 49-year-old Phil Mickelson.

A three-putt bogey at the final hole put a bit of a damper on his day, but Conners wasn’t complaining. Not after his improbable journey just to claim a spot in the first major of the year.

He rolled in back-to-back birdies at the 13th and 14th holes before making eagle at the par-5 15th. After a booming drive left only 212 yards to the green at the bottom of the hill, he launched his approach over the water, the ball coming to a stop just six feet past the cup for barely more than a tap-in.

Since he’s ranked outside the top 125 in the FedEx Cup standings, he had to go through Monday qualifying just to get into the Texas Open. He made a 20-foot birdie at No. 18 to sneak into a six-man playoff for the final berth in the actual tournament. Then, with a birdie at the first extra hole, he eliminated the other five contenders. With a 10-birdie round on Sunday, Conners captured the first PGA Tour victory of his career — and an invite to Augusta.

Conners certainly understands the enormity of the odds of everything falling into place the way it has.

“Look, I’m a math and stats guy,” he said, standing near the giant magnolia tree that shades the porch of the stately clubhouse. “I know I was very unlikely to be here. I can say with certainly that I didn’t think I would be here, but it worked out very well.”

Conners is off to a much better start than his only other appearance in the Masters. After qualifying as an amateur in 2015, he opened with an 80 that left him no real chance. Now, with another solid round, he’ll be playing on the weekend for the first time. He has plenty of fans cheering him on.

“There are way more Canadian people than I was expecting — or at least people pretending to be Canadians — out there,” Conners quipped. “It was awesome.”

Mike Weir, the 2003 Masters champion and the only other Canadian in the field, shot a 72.

Mike Weir of Brights Grove, Ont., the 2003 Masters champion and only other Canadian in the field, carded a 72.

Rory McIlroy’s bid for the last leg of the career Grand Slam began with a 73, which featured six bogeys.

“I made five birdies — that wasn’t the problem,” McIlroy said. “I just made too many mistakes, and that was the problem.”

Even more surprising to McIlroy was no one from the early starters took advantage of soft turf from recent rains.

“It’s there for the taking, and I’m surprised someone hasn’t run off,” McIlroy said.

That was right about the time when Koepka and DeChambeau took off. More impressive than the four straight birdies by DeChambeau was how he made them. After a two-putt birdie on the par-5 15th, his tee shot grazed the edge of the cup in the front left portion of the green. From the woods, he went just over the back of the 17th green and chipped in from 35 feet.

He didn’t see until later how good his shot was into the 18th because he was in light rough short of the fairway bunker, unable to see the green but knowing it was good from the roar of the crowd. The ball ran true to the cup and smacked into the middle of the pin with enough force to knock it backward a few inches.

“I guess I should have pulled the flagstick,” DeChambeau said.

He is not the only player to putt with the flagstick in the cup — now allowed under the new Rules of Golf — just the only one to apply science to the decision .

Koepka shot his 66 while playing in the last group of the day, and not seeing very good golf alongside him. Jordan Spieth had to rely on his short game to salvage a 75, matching his highest score at Augusta. Paul Casey, coming off a victory three weeks ago in Florida, failed to make a birdie in his round of 81.

Blinders on, Koepka played bogey-free in his first time at the Masters in two years. He missed last year recovering from a wrist injury that left him wondering if he would ever play again. Then he won a second straight U.S. Open, held off Woods to win the PGA Championship and has established himself as a major player.

He holed out from behind the green at No. 12 , picked up birdies on the par fives and rolled in a bending 20-footer in between on the 14th.

Dustin Johnson and Ian Poulter were at 68, while Jon Rahm and Adam Scott were among those at 69.

Justin Rose, who returned to No. 1 in the world and was among the favourites this week because of his recent history at the Masters, opened with a 75.

“It’s just a great test of golf to start out the first round of Masters,” DeChambeau said. “And to be honest, it’s great to sift through some of the really good players and maybe not so great players in this event right now. And look, it’s not to say they are bad players. It’s just it’s very difficult out there and every aspect of your game has to be on point.

Since yellow pea exports dropped significantly in the middle of the year, “there’s going to be a lot of carryover in yellow peas for 2019,” Darwin Hamilton, president of Kalshae Investments in Winnipeg, predicted. “That will cause prices to drop.”

“Twelve months ago, we saw peas in the $10 per bushel range. Now they’re around $7, and some are contracting in the $6.50 range.”

Even with attractive prices for buyers, yellow peas aren’t moving very quickly. New-crop acreage for yellow peas in 2019 will likely decrease accordingly.

“They don’t want new-crop peas planted if last year’s crops are still in the bin,” Hamilton said.

A portion of acreage originally slated for yellow peas will likely transfer to their green counterpart, which are stronger price-wise.

“Green pea prices for new crops are around $12.50 per bushel to the grower, for farm gate pricing.”

If significant yellow pea acreage is switched to green, prices may correct back down to under $10 per bushel.

Green peas are in high demand in South American and European markets, though in the past, quality has been an issue. Unpredictable rainfall and drought impacted green pea quality in 2018.

“Green peas are a little more finicky to grow to get a high grade,” Hamilton said. “If you get rain during harvest, you’ll get bleaching.”

Canadian farmers seeded over 3.6 million acres to yellow and green peas in 2018.

One of the 16 people killed in the Saskatchewan bus crash a year ago was Broncos player Logan Boulet of Lethbridge, Alta. Shortly before he died, Boulet signed up to be donor, and six people later benefited from his organs.

What soon followed has been called the Logan Boulet Effect — Canadian Blood Services estimates that within two months of Boulet's death more than 150,000 people registered to become organ donors.

Boulet's parents, Bernadine and Toby Boulet, took part in an afternoon skate at a Lethbridge rink to mark the day.

Bernadine said it was all bit overwhelming.

""It just kind of exploded with what it is and people wanting to have green shirts. We just wanted people to wear green, we want people to be inspired, to register, to have a conversation with their family about being an organ donor,"" she said.

""We wear green because it's hope. It's renewal. It's for the Broncos and it's for organ donation.""

Toby says his son's legacy makes them very proud.

""We're asked this question many, many times. At the beginning, we'd say well, if this is a silver medal, we'll take it. But now it's like, it is a silver medal and I'll gladly take it,"" he said.

Toby hopes the family skate catches on as a yearly tradition.

""Get your local minor hockey group, like we did, to donate the ice and have a skate and it'll be awesome,"" he said. ""So maybe that will be the marker for Green Shirt Day for families to come out as a family event.""

Michael Ravenhill is head of the David Foster Foundation, which provides financial support to families with children who need organ transplants.

He says Boulet's selfless act changed the landscape of organ donation in Canada.

AUGUSTA, Ga. – Corey Conners kept himself in the Masters hunt while Mike Weir’s quest for a weekend game came up painfully short.

With a 1-under 71 in trickier conditions Friday afternoon, Conners heads into his first Masters weekend four shots off the lead. His run of good play continued since sneaking into the field at the 11th hour with a victory in last week’s Valero Texas Open.

“Pretty steady round for the most part,” Conners said. “Did a nice job on the par 5s with three birdies out of the four, which is very important around this golf course. And had a little trouble on the other holes. Hit a few shots that I didn’t love but overall it was really good.”

Weir, however, was let down by the very part of his game that earned him a green jacket in 2003, missing a slew of short putts en route to a 76 that left him 4-over for the tournament, one shot too many to make his first cut at Augusta since 2014.

“It was just awful; I mean my short game was just horrendous around here,” Weir said. “Any little up-and-downs I didn’t get them up and down. I have to have a good short game to play well around here. The rest of my game was very good, but when you don’t putt well around here or chip well or wedge it well, just nothing, it’s very disappointing.”

With a chance to take a nap and get a good night’s sleep to settle down from his whirlwind return to Augusta, Conners posted his third consecutive round under par in his two Masters appearances and walked away smiling again, despite his second consecutive three-putt bogey on the 18th hole. He made five birdies on Friday to keep himself in striking distance on a very crowded leaderboard.

“There’s really not a lot of chances where you can be that aggressive,” he said of the difficult setup the first two rounds to counter soft conditions. “The pins were all tucked. And you miss on one side and you virtually have no chance to get the ball up and down. So have to be a little bit safe.”

With a leaderboard loaded with so many top-ranked players and former major winners, Conners said he needs to resist the temptation to try to make something happen on the weekend.

“I’m sticking with the same game plan,” he said. “I don’t need to force anything out here and try to shoot the course record. I think people who try to force things go the opposite direction. So keep being steady and maybe tidy up the scorecard a little bit and throw in a few more birdies and I think a decent number is out there for me.”

Weir’s mood was the opposite of his fellow Ontario native’s. His putter wasn’t doing him any favours as he tried to make his second Masters cut in nine years.

On the ropes after an early three-putt and scrambling bogeys at 2, 9, 11 and 12 moved him to 5-over for the day, Weir had a chance to make a good chunk of it back when he stuffed his 3-wood from 245 yards to 4 feet on the par-5 13th hole. But his eagle putt never touched the hole and he settled for birdie.

Then, however, he got the break he needed when his 35-foot putt on 14 slammed hard into the hole and rattled to the bottom to get him back to 3-over and within 10 shots of the leaders.

After failing to wedge it close and make birdie on the par-5 15th to give him some cushion, he missed the green right from the fairway on 17 and failed to get up and down when his 8-footer for par skated past the cup. His 45-foot downhill bender on the last ran out of steam and ducked under the hole by inches to deny his chance of making the cut.

“I missed all kind of putts this week inside of 10 feet,” said Weir, who had 64 putts in two rounds. “When I won here and played well here, you make those. When you miss 10 of them in two rounds, you’re not going to do very well.

“This is what I’ve been doing all year, playing good but just not scoring. If you don’t have your short game, you can’t score. It doesn’t matter how good you hit it.”","CANADIAN CONTENT: Conners stays in hunt at Masters, Weir misses cut",Toronto Sun,https://torontosun.com/sports/golf/canadian-content-conners-stays-in-hunt-at-masters-weir-misses-cut

1. Canada offers to aid Iraq invasion

The same day former prime minister Jean Chrétien publicly refused to join the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a high-ranking Canadian official secretly promised the U.S. clandestine military support for the operation, according to a classified U.S. diplomatic memo obtained by CBC News from WikiLeaks.

The classified U.S. document showed that senior Canadian officials met the same day with high-ranking American and British diplomats at Foreign Affairs headquarters in Ottawa.

According to the account, Canadian Foreign Affairs official James Wright ""emphasized"" that contrary to public statements by the prime minister, Canadian naval and air forces could be ""discreetly"" put to use during the pending U.S.-led assault on Iraq and its aftermath.

""Following the meeting, political director Jim Wright emphasized that, despite public statements that the Canadian assets in the Straits of Hormuz will remain in the region exclusively to support Enduring Freedom,"" the document states.

""They will also be available to provide escort services in the Straits and will otherwise be discreetly useful to the military effort. The two ships in the Straits now are being augmented by two more en route, and there are patrol and supply aircraft in the U.A.E. [United Arab Emirates] which are also prepared to 'be useful.'""

The U.S. diplomat wrote in his briefing note to State Department bosses in Washington that ""this message tracks with others we have heard.""

""While for domestic political reasons … the GOC [Government of Canada] has decided not to join in a U.S. coalition of the willing … they are also prepared to be as helpful as possible in the military margins.""

2. Mentally ill Canadian man held at Bagram

U.S. diplomatic cables exposed a troubling case of a mentally ill Canadian-Egyptian man held in a U.S.-run Afghanistan prison for more than 18 months. Khaled Samy Abdallah Ismail, an Egyptian-born engineer, was captured in April 2006 and held at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility.

The U.S. military held Ismail until at least October 2007, often relegating him to segregation despite ""largely circumstantial"" evidence against him, while they debated whether to send him to Egypt or Canada.

While former prime minister Jean Chrétien publicly refused to involve Canada in the invasion of Iraq, a U.S. diplomatic memo obtained by WikiLeaks said Canadian forces would be 'discreetly useful to the military effort.' (Jonathan Hayward/Canadian Press)

The Americans confiscated Ismail's Canadian passport and expired Egyptian passport, assigned him internment serial number US9EG002770DP, and medically assessed him as mentally sound but ""narcissistic and arrogant,"" according to U.S. diplomatic cables.

After a psychotic break in 2007, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, was segregated and given intravenous anti-schizophrenia medication.

Ismail is the only known Canadian to have been held at the Bagram detention facility other than OmarKhadr, who spent approximately four months there before being transferred to the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo, Cuba.

Government officials have refused to say if he was eventually transferred back to Canada.

3. Montreal Metro bomb plot

An anonymous letter sent to the RCMP in late 2004 warned of bomb threats to the Montreal Metro system and the U.S. Embassy in Canada by a man affiliated with Osama bin Laden, a secret U.S. diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks to CBC News revealed.

The letter, dated Nov. 29, 2004, spurred American government facilities across Canada to heighten security. Though the RCMP noted such letters are frequently received and the threat was doubted to be ""credible,"" U.S. Embassy officials said in the document that few such threats specifically mention the U.S. Embassy.

The anonymous letter writer claimed to have overheard a man detailing a possible plot to bomb the Montreal Metro system on Dec. 15, 2004, and the U.S. Embassy on Jan. 10, 2005.

The brief letter in French, addressed to the RCMP's Montreal headquarters, included the suspected bomb plotter's name and cellphone number.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was arrested by British police on Thursday in the Ecuadorian Embassy where he'd been holed up since 2012 after the United States requested his extradition, London police say. 2:43

4. Curbing the oilsands

Former environment minister Jim Prentice told U.S. Ambassador David Jacobson that he was prepared to step in and impose tougher regulations on the oilsands if the industry damaged Canada's green reputation, according to another cable released by WikiLeaks.

""[Prentice] noted that if industry did not take voluntary measures and if the provincial government did not set more stringent regulations, he would step in and press federal environmental legislation,"" according to the cable, apparently written by Jacobson.

5. Libya threatens to nationalize Petro-Canada operations

Libya threatened to nationalize Petro-Canada's operations in the North African country over a spat with the Canadian government according to a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable.

Moammar Gadhafi — the Libyan dictator killed during the 2011 civil war that ended his four decade-long rule — cancelled a late September 2009 stopover in Newfoundland after Canada promised a tongue-lashing for the hero's welcome Libya extended to a man convicted for the Lockerbie bombing.

The U.S. cable, obtained from WikiLeaks by British newspaper the Daily Telegraph, said Libya's state oil company called in a senior Petro-Canada official with a threat to nationalize the firm's operations in Libya if Canada did not apologize.

WikiLeaks also uncovered the case of a Canadian detainee held in a U.S.-run prison in Afghanistan for more than a year and a half. (Jonathon Burch/Reuters)

6. Canada wanted to copy U.S. hostage policy

Canada sought U.S. help in crafting a national hostage policy, hoping to follow the secretive American policy as ""closely as possible,"" a U.S. diplomatic cable leaked by whistleblower website WikiLeaks revealed.

In early January 2009 — after five kidnappings in as many months — Canada asked for a briefing on U.S. policy in hostage situations as it planned to create a formal national policy of its own.

""Canada seeks to co-ordinate its policy as closely as possible with that of the U.S.,"" the leaked U.S. State Department diplomatic cable states.

7. Harper's empty Arctic sovereignty bluster: U.S. cable

A WikiLeaks cable suggested the U.S. government viewed former prime minister Stephen Harper's talk about Canadian Arctic sovereignty as little more than empty chest-thumping designed to win votes.

In a diplomatic cable posted by WikiLeaks, the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa said the Conservatives have made successful political use of promises to beef up Canada's presence in the Arctic.

Now-deceased Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi threatened to nationalize Petro-Canada assets in northern Libya, according to a U.S. cable obtained by WikiLeaks. (Reuters)

But it also said the Harper government had done only scant implementation on pledges such as increasing surveillance over the Northwest Passage.

""Conservatives make concern for 'The North' part of their political brand … and it works,"" says the note, titled Canada's Conservative Government and its Arctic Focus.

8. U.S. viewed John Baird as rising star

U.S. diplomats saw a bright future for Conservative MP John Baird, describing him as ""a young, ambitious and dynamic minister who should be one of the Conservatives' top leadership prospects in the future,"" according to a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable.

Americans devoted an entire nine-page diplomatic cable to analyzing Baird after he was appointed to the tricky file of environment minister in January 2007.

""Baird clearly enjoys and is comfortable with the rough-and-tumble of parliamentary debate in contrast to his predecessor Rona Ambrose,"" says a section of the cable marked ""embassy comment.""

""It is clear that Baird hopes a strong performance handling the politically sensitive environmental file will eventually be rewarded by his appointment to an even higher-profile ministry.""

9. U.S. contrasted 'forceful' Rae with 'meek' Ignatieff

After a meeting with David Jacobson, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, on Oct. 23, 2009, American diplomats found Bob Rae to be forceful, eloquent and dominant in comparison to then-Liberal leader and former rival Michael Ignatieff, according to leaked diplomatic cables.

Their relations ""remain clearly tense, with Rae arriving late and then immediately dominating the conversation, while Ignatieff sat back almost meekly,"" says a cable marked ""confidential.""

""Rae was by far the more forceful and eloquent of the two and showed little deference to his party chief, without at any time displaying any rudeness or personal animosity.

""He came across as better read and more substantive than Ignatieff, who stuck mostly to pleasantries and generalities.""",9 Canadian stories WikiLeaks helped bring to light,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/9-canadian-stories-wikileaks-helped-bring-to-light-1.5094640

AUGUSTA, Ga. – The biggest problem Corey Conners might have this week is pulling a muscle by smiling too much.

Still riding the improbable adrenaline high from his last-in as a Monday qualifier in Texas to first-off in the Masters, Conners found himself lost for words early Thursday morning before he ever found himself on the Masters leaderboard.

After watching Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player hit the honorary tee shots immediately before his grouping took the first tee, Conners suddenly found his hand in the mitt of the greatest champion of all time.

“He just congratulated me on the win, that felt pretty special,” said the hopelessly grinning Conners of his Nicklaus encounter. “Never thought in a million years that Jack Nicklaus would know who I am and it just felt pretty cool. I was able to stand on the back of the tee and watch he and Mr. Player tee off and really appreciate what they have done for the game of golf and it was a really cool experience to be part of. I just tried to soak it in and really enjoy it.”

Conners is still coming to terms with being here at all.

Ten days ago, he was the 196th-ranked player in the world facing a playoff in a Monday qualifier just to get into the Valero Texas Open. By Sunday, he was making 10 birdies to win his first PGA Tour event by one shot and book the 87th and final spot into the Masters. The odds – even for someone with a T3 and runner-up already on tour this season – were off the charts.

“I’m a math and stats guy and it was very unlikely that I was going to be here, I’ll say that, especially having to Monday qualify last week,” he said. “So, yeah, could have said almost certain that I wouldn’t be here, but it’s worked out really well and I’m really happy.”

Whatever magic the Listowel, Ont. native has going did not rub off on the six-time green jacket winner’s palm. He was coasting along with a birdie and two bogeys through 12 holes before catching fire. A two-putt birdie on 13 got him back to level par and he started throwing darts.

He stuck an 8-iron from 152 yards to three feet on 14 for birdie and then drew a majestic 6-iron from 202 yards to five feet on the par-5 15th and knocked in the downhill slider for eagle that vaulted him into sole possession of the lead at 3-under.

“That was the shot of the day for me, I would say,” Conners said of his eagle approach, which earned him his first piece of Masters crystal.

Not even a 3-putt from 46 feet on the bottom tier at 18 could wipe the smile from Conners’ face, as he walked off with the early clubhouse leader at 2-under 70. It was a significant improvement over the 80 he shot in his first round as an amateur in the 2015 Masters.

“Quite a lot better,” he said. “I had a great day out there, it was beautiful, it was fun to be first off this morning, felt pretty special to be out there on the tee and I am really happy with how I played.”

Mike Weir, the 2003 Masters champion, wasn’t surprised, having seen Conners shoot 80-69 in the two rounds they played together in 2015.

“Even back then I was very impressed with his game,” Weir said of Conners. “He drove the ball well and got on the wrong side of the hole a couple times and that’s what can happen around here. You can shoot 80 and actually not play that poorly. It can get away from you quickly here. I’ve always been impressed with his game and he’s continued to get better and work on his weaknesses and enhance his strengths. He’s really doing some great things.”

Conners’ wife, Mallory, gained notoriety with her expressive reactions during his dramatic final round in San Antonio, and her heart was still racing Thursday.

“It’s been a crazy whirlwind,” she said, “and we haven’t had time to process it. It doesn’t seem real.”

Conners received a warm welcome on the first tee Thursday.

“I think there’s way more Canadians or people pretending to be Canadians out there than I would have guessed,” he said.

Now he hopes to have a moment to settle down and sleep in before his 11:15 a.m. tee time for the second round as he sits firmly in contention on a tightly packed Masters leaderboard.

“It’s been wild, definitely unexpected but I’m playing some good golf and really excited to be here and honoured to be playing in the Masters and just trying to keep riding the good play,” he said. “Everything’s still high, I’m just having a lot of positive emotions. Didn’t really sleep much the beginning of the week, I felt energized with positive things that have happened. This is a great place to be and I’m just really enjoying it.”",Canadian Corey Conners continues to ride wave of success at Masters,Toronto Sun,https://torontosun.com/sports/golf/canadian-corey-conners-continues-to-ride-wave-of-success-at-masters

Green party Leader Andrew Weaver says Alberta Premier Rachel Notley may be right with her claim that the controversial twinning of the Trans Mountain pipeline will get the go-ahead in May.

“(Justin) Trudeau has essentially been saying the pipeline will be approved all along,” Weaver told Postmedia News on Wednesday. “Cabinet has 90 days to make a decision after the NEB made their (February) recommendation and that brings it to May 22. (Rachel) Notley put two-and-two together. I suspect she is adding up what’s publicly available.”

Related

On Monday, while campaigning for the April 16 provincial election, the Alberta premier said she expected the $9.3-billion twinning of the Trans Mountain pipeline to be approved by the federal government by the end of May.

“We are this close, this close to getting that pipeline back under construction,” Notley told students at a pipeline training school in Edmonton. “In fact, we expect an approval from the federal government by the end of the month.”

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw dig into new legislation that bans ticket bots. Will the changes help you get a better price on your favourite concert tickets? They also delve into the politics around B.C.’s money-laundering scandal, parties flip-flopping over gas taxes and criticism of the carbon tax, and the Speaker’s attempt to clean up heckling at the legislature.

The Trans Mountain pipeline from Edmonton to the Westridge Marine Terminal in Burnaby has been owned by the federal government since it bought-out Kinder Morgan last summer. Kinder Morgan had been trying for several years to get permission to increase the pipeline capacity from 300,000 barrels a day to 890,000 barrels a day. The pipe carries a variety of petroleum products, including crude oil from Alberta’s oilsands.

The Alberta government claims it needs the extra pipeline capacity so it can export more crude oil to Asia and beyond. The B.C. government and the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby are opposed, due mostly to the risk of environmental disaster and the impact on marine life and some First Nations bands, but also because of the economics of the project. Bitumen is expensive to extract from the oilsands and demand from Asia has so far been sporadic.

This year there has been four oil tankers that have picked up crude oil at Westridge, and one has gone to China. Twelve of 42 tankers that visited the terminal last year went to China, but at the time the price of a barrel of Western Canadian Select crude oil was falling to a record $14 a barrel from the low $50s, where it also sits currently. China imported no crude from B.C. in 2016 and 2017.

There have been a string of protests over construction at the Burnaby terminal, leading to jail for some protesters. B.C.’s First Nations community is split over whether they support the pipeline.

Weaver, who predicted Notley would win the election, said the B.C. government still had an active court case in which it was trying to determine whether it had the constitutional right to control the amount of crude oil shipped through the province.

In a prepared statement, a B.C. Ministry of Environment spokesperson said “The province maintains the project is unnecessary and continues to recommend the federal government abandon the project.”

“We continue to argue that an oil spill could seriously impact B.C.’s environment, economy and coast,” he said. “We remain convinced this project is not in the best interests of British Columbians and it puts the environment and southern-resident killer whales at-risk. We remain focused on defending the interests of British Columbians and protecting our environment, our economy and our coast.”

Weaver predicted trouble ahead for the Liberal government over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.

“This thing is not going to go away,” he said.

321,LifeStyle,2019-04-12T07:14:00.0000000Z,"The Canadian aquaculture alliance says its members ... In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has given the green light to the AquaBounty production in Indiana, subject to a ...","HALIFAX — Genetically modified salmon raised in Prince Edward Island are poised for the leap to grocery shelves, a Canadian first that has left traditional producers concerned about setting their farmed fish apart.

Environment Canada recently gave notice it has approved U.S.-based AquaBounty to grow the salmon at its site about 74 kilometres east of Charlottetown.

AquaBounty said in a release it would begin stocking its Rollo Bay facility “as soon as possible,” with the first harvest of AquAdvantage salmon estimated late next year.

Sylvain Charlebois, director of the agrifood analytics unit at Dalhousie University, said it’s likely AquaBounty “production will be ramped up in Canada.”

“It’s a huge advantage for AquaBounty to be allowed to produce this salmon in Canada,” he said in an interview.

AquaBounty, based in Maynard, Mass., has said its salmon will contain genetic material from chinook salmon that help it reach adult size faster, creating a less expensive product.

Health Canada said it doesn’t see any need for a mandatory label to allow consumers to spot the genetically modified fish, but existing producers said they may call for that to change.

“We are reviewing it,” said Tim Kennedy, executive director of the Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance.

“Will there be a disruption in the … entire salmon market? We hope not. But I will say if that’s a possibility, then the response will be: somebody has to label.”

The Environment Canada certification has been most strongly opposed to date by environmental groups, who continue to argue there’s a risk to wild Atlantic salmon if there’s an escape.

However, the certifications in Canada and the U.S. could draw the traditional aquaculture industry and its lobbyists more closely into the debate, depending on how consumers react to the news of AquaBounty’s products entering the market sometime next year.

The Canadian aquaculture alliance says its members don’t farm or sell GM farmed salmon and aren’t researching the practice.

Kennedy said a push for labelling could come next.

“We are reviewing it. We recognize the United States is moving forward with mandatory labelling, as is the European Union,” he said.

“Does it make sense from a trade perspective to align more closely with our major trading partners?”

He said the industry could consider setting up a non-GM label, similar to the labelling of organic foods.

The federal Health Department has repeatedly said it doesn’t favour mandatory labelling for the genetically modified fish.

In a February letter to the Canadian Biotechnology Action Network – an active opponent of GM salmon – the department said it prefers “industry-led initiatives such as voluntary standards,” and “the government of Canada intends to maintain its current approach.”

Kennedy said this leaves the question of who should pay for a massive labelling redo.

“Who bears the burden of that transparency? I don’t think it should be our producers because we’re not the ones putting the new product into the market,” he said.

Meanwhile, it remains unclear how significant the level of production in P.E.I. will be in the Canadian market.

The company declined a request for an interview with its CEO about its plans going forward for production in Prince Edward Island, providing references to news releases.

Over the past two years – as it awaited its Environment Canada licence – the company had shipped eggs to Panama for growing, before the salmon were imported back to Canada and other destinations.

Charlebois says the federal decision means the firm can ship more directly to markets, particularly processors that might use the GM salmon in products ranging from sushi to pies to pates.

Still, the arrival of a form of labelling in the U.S. could lead to increased pressure to create some form of labelling in Canada, he adds.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has given the green light to the AquaBounty production in Indiana, subject to a new regulation that will require it to disclose when a food is genetically modified.

That has come amidst a pending lawsuit by a coalition of consumer, environmental and fishing groups that still hopes to block the sale through the courts.

Opponents have also criticized the upcoming U.S. labelling system, which they say uses the term “bioengineered,” a less familiar phrase than “genetically modified.”

Also, under the rules coming in 2020, companies will be able to provide disclosure of the GM salmon through codes that people would have to scan on their smart phones.

Lucy Sharratt, co-ordinator of the Canadian Biotechnology Action Network, says her group wants Canada to introduce a more transparent labelling system that consumers can easily see on any package.

“The lack of genetically modified food labelling is just the most obvious transparency issue undermining public trust,” she told parliamentarians in a hearing last week.

“Canadians are also asking for more transparent regulation of genetically modified organisms and opportunities for public engagement.”

As far back as 2015, Neilsen reported that 73 per cent of millennials worldwide were willing to spend more money on a product that was sustainable. Today, those numbers are likely even higher.

We found eight recently launched local brands that are incorporating sustainable fabrics and materials into their wares, while being thoughtful about their effects on the environment. From clothing to housewares to self-care and beauty brands, here are a few of the latest eco-friendly companies that we love.

Maison Tess.

Launched in 2017 by Laura Nezri Chetrit, this Montreal-based bedding brand has its roots in Canada (everything is designed in Quebec), but also partners with sustainable textile manufacturers in Europe.

The brand's source of cotton, for instance — a decades-old, family-run business in Portugal — is part of the Better Cotton Initiative. Maison Tess. bedding also comes with an Oeko-Tex certification, which means all fabrics and dyes are free from potentially harmful chemicals.

Sheets, pillow shams and duvet covers come in three fabrics, including washed linen, percale cotton and coco-linen (a blend of percale cotton and linen), and colours like faded grey, pale rose and soft mint green — basically an Instagrammer's dream palette.

eco + amour

Toronto's zero-waste beauty and wellness haven opened in September 2018, featuring a plethora of products like refillable containers, and bulk shampoo, conditioner and body lotion, plus a selection of housewares and baby essentials.

eco + amour, which has an e-commerce site, also sells an in-house brand that consists of bamboo hair brushes, toothbrushes, produce bags and more.

Soft Focus

Having worked for companies like Aritzia and Joe Fresh, Soft Focus founder and Ryerson fashion design grad Sammi Smith knows about relaxed, cool-girl style. But it was her decision to become a freelance designer that proved to be the impetus for her future brand.

""Working from home was a huge lifestyle change that affected my personal style, so the question of 'How do you get dressed for the day when your office is your living room couch and a laptop?' became a key raison-d'être in creating Soft Focus,"" Smith says.

The line consists of super soft robes, lounge pants, scrunchies, tees and undergarments, taking the idea of wearing #pjsallday to the next level. Making items from plant-based fabrics like Tencel (a cotton-like fabric made from sustainable wood cellulose) and saving fabric off-cuts to make the aforementioned scrunchies, are two of the ways Smith aims to keep SF as sustainable as possible.

ai Toronto

The vegan leather handbags from ai (pronounced ah-ee) are streamlined and chic, made from sustainable and recyclable polyurethane, and handcrafted by artisans in Seoul, South Korea, in small batches. The label itself was founded in 2018 by a mother and her three daughters, all of whom are based in Toronto.

Although the women only came to fashion accessories in the last two years, the leap into designing was an easy one. ""We grew up with women in our family who love fashion, including my 90-year-old grandma,"" says co-founder Hannah Kim. ""Growing up we used to watch Fashion Television with Jeanne Beker with our grandma and mom every Sunday.""

Currently an online-only venture, the brand has just launched a faux-croc, cross-body, belt-bag hybrid that will likely sell out fast.

Lithe Lashes

Taking a more natural approach to false lashes, Lithe Lashes — which just launched this year — offers a range of falsies that can easily go from minimal to night-out worthy, without looking overdone.

Brand founder Laura Secondi believes that most false lashes look too uniform, not like how our natural lashes grow. So she created versions that have lashes of varying sizes and curl in order to get a more realistic yet still beautiful look.

The brand does not use mink or silk in their reusable lash strips, which is what most lashes have been made out of until now, meaning these are a great vegan option. Lithe also uses FSC-certified paper for their 100 per cent recyclable packaging.

Hadaka Beauty

Incorporating the Japanese word for ""nude"" in its name, Hadaka Beauty produces all its organic, fair-trade beauty products here in Canada. New to the market this year, the brand relies heavily on its staple ingredient: wild-harvested marula oil from Africa.

The company's Butterful body lotions are luxuriously thick, yet don't leave a greasy film after application. Hadaka just launched a body oil and a hair oil, which both come in recyclable glass containers. Its other products come in white plastic, which are more easily recycled.

The brand, which aims to be unisex, first launched with ecommerce, and now their products are available in locations across Canada including specialty spas, like The Ten Spot.

Dresst

Turning the idea of a subscription box on its head, Dresst is a new venture created by two young Canadian women. The brand points out that women only wear about 80 per cent of what's in their closet, yet they still purchase an average of five garments per month. This adds up quickly, with the average North American throwing away about 81 pounds of clothing per year — which is alarming to say the least.

This might be just the option for you if your job requires you to ""dress up"" or if you find you need to replace your wardrobe each season. At Dresst, you can select three items per month (at a cost of $99) from their ""closet"" to wear as your own. Brands in said closet include Ted Baker, Diane von Furstenberg, Equipment, Theory and Free People.

Once your month is up, you send back the items — free of charge — to the Dresst closet. With a roster of blouses, dresses, pants and blazers, you can freshen up your wardrobe each month without putting down your credit card to purchase any items at full price. Dresst also takes care of dry cleaning and any repairs that may be needed.

Ūnika Swim

Launched in June 2018, Ūnika is a sustainable swimwear line — the brand uses Econyl, a nylon textile that comes from waste and can be recycled multiple times over, and is handmade here in Canada — that aims to update classic bathing suit pieces for all body types. The range includes bikinis, one-pieces and cover-ups, in hues from hot red to bright blue to subdued beige and crisp white.

We also love that founder Betsy Campos believes women should feel comfortable in their swimwear, and that her brand's site and Instagram account — which now boasts close to 7,000 followers — feature images that feel refreshingly real and un-Photoshopped. .",8 new eco-friendly Canadian brands working to keep our planet safer,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/life/style/8-new-eco-friendly-canadian-brands-working-to-keep-our-planet-safer-1.5096430

The two giants who collectively share about 50% of the Canadian cannabis market are projected to produce around 700,000 kilograms and 525,000 kilograms, respectively.","The number of cannabis companies has ballooned in recent years. With the stigma around marijuana evaporating before our eyes, and legalization of various uses of pot following suit, there are literally hundreds of companies looking to get their foot in the door.

No doubt such a high-risk high-reward industry will produce both winners and losers. Let’s consider whether The Green Organic Dutchman Holdings Ltd (TSX:TGOD) is likely to fall into the category of the winners.

Core operations

TGOD prides itself as an organic marijuana grower. The company uses “certified organic soil” to produce cannabis that is “clean, natural, and free of synthetic fertilizers and chemicals.” This differentiation strategy has its pros. TGOD’s process, which supposedly results in better finished products, could allow the company to charge premiums at the point of sale.

In search of substitutes for dried cannabis products (which yield perhaps the lowest margins among its peers), the Ontario-based firm is also planning to enter the cannabis-infused beverage market. The process TGOD goes through to grow its weed, though, is very expensive. This could undermine the company’s attempt at earning high margins with its organically grown products.

Production capacity

To stand out in a crowded field of competitors, the ability to produce more than its rivals is one of the tools in the belt of cannabis companies. As things stand, Aurora Cannabis (TSX:ACB)(NYSE:ACB) is projected to be the leader in this category, closely followed by Canopy Growth Corp (TSX:WEED)(NYSE:CGC).

The two giants who collectively share about 50% of the Canadian cannabis market are projected to produce around 700,000 kilograms and 525,000 kilograms, respectively. In this department, TGOD isn’t lagging too far behind. The company is set to produce about 150,000 kilograms by next year. That’s enough for TGOD to be comfortably in the top 10 cannabis companies in terms of production capacity.

International operations

For pot companies hoping to stay on top of the food chain, it is essential to have solid international footprints, something TGOD has done a decent job of. In January, the firm announced an agreement with Queen Genetics/Knud Jepsen A/S in Denmark. With this venture, TGOD will be hoping to expand throughout Europe. This isn’t TGOD’s first expansion to the Old Continent. Last year, the company invested $35 million to acquire Poland-based CBD company HemPoland.

Further, TGOD purchased 49.18% interest in Epican, a Jamaican cannabis company with cultivation, extraction, manufacturing and retail distribution licenses. At the time, the acquisition added 14,000 kilograms of annual production capacity for TGOD. Since then, the Ontario-based firm has made significant progress in expanding its cultivation and obtaining additional distribution channels in the region. TGOD’s operations expand to Mexico, a country that is predicted to be next in line to legalize recreational marijuana. Overall, TGOD’s international expansion isn’t bad, but it isn’t up to par with the leaders in this category.

Financial results

Perhaps the biggest knock against TGOD is its income statement. While most cannabis companies aren’t profitable yet, they still post revenues, and in some cases, very strong revenues. TGOD has consistently failed to even record a revenue, except for last year’s fourth quarter.

However, the company’s revenue figure was substantially lower than that of its competitors. TGOD also posted widening operating and net losses. The company’s net loss has increased every quarter since Q2 2017. TGOD currently trades at 31 times future earnings, though, which is a relatively low figure by industry’s standards.

Should you buy?

No doubt TGOD has several things going its way. The company’s process of growing and cultivating weed is unique in the industry. TGOD also boasts a high production capacity and an international presence. However, the lack of revenues (let alone profits) is a worry. I would stay away from TGOD until the company shows that it can at least consistently post strong revenues.

""The P30 Pro flagship gives consumers the power and versatility of a pro dslr in a stunningly beautiful body that feels completely natural in the hand. The P30 Pro also features one of the largest batteries in the industry, ensuring Canadians can rely on it to capture the moments that define their lives.""

Launched in Paris on March 26, the P30 Pro has earned rave reviews and has instantly become the standard by which all other smartphone cameras will be measured. Influential Canadian tech writers are already considering it one of the best cameras of 2019.

""Initial reaction by Canadian writers is extremely positive - they're really liking the Leica Quad Camera System, the incredible night capture mode and the overall control they have over their image making,"" said Mr. Li. ""And the new 32 MP front-facing camera is a selfie game-changer.""

The HUAWEI P30 Series will change users' expectations of smartphone photography. Achieving a record-high overall DxOMark score of 112, the HUAWEI P30 Pro is equipped with a new Leica Quad Camera System, including a 40 MP main camera with the HUWAI SuperSpectrum Sensor, a 20 MP ultra-wide angle camera, an 8 MP telephoto camera, the HUAWEI ToF Camera and the 32 MP front camera.

The 1/1.7-inch HUAWEI SuperSpectrum Sensor looks at light in a fundamentally new way. The RYYB HUAWEI SuperSpectrum Sensor deviates from the traditional RGGB Bayer filter by replacing green pixels with yellow pixels, yielding a high maximum ISO rating of 409600 on the HUAWEI P30 Pro and 204800 on the HUAWEI P30. This fundamental shift in sensor technology, combined with HUAWEI AIS, OIS and the HUAWEI P30 Pro's f/1.6 wide aperture, delivers extraordinary photography and videography experiences across a wide range of scenarios and lighting conditions—including extreme low light—producing images with enhanced detail, colour and clarity.

The new SuperZoom Lens unlocks a superior level of zoom photography in a slim-line device design. Through a new periscope design, the SuperZoom Lens supports high fidelity magnification of five times optical zoom, 10 times hybrid zoom and 50 times digital zoom. A prism element in the telephoto camera bends light at a 90-degree angle to maximize focal length while minimizing camera height, without disrupting device design.

The HUAWEI ToF Camera unleashes the imagination. Unique to the HUAWEI P30 Pro is a HUAWEI ToF Camera that captures depth-of-field information to deliver accurate image segmentation. Precise distance measurement allows for the simulation of multiple levels of bokeh. The Super Portrait feature captures even the smallest details, such as individual strands of hair. It combines depth information and proprietary algorithms to produce outstanding images with defocused backgrounds and highlights the subject of the image in any scenario.

Huawei AI helps users bring it all together into the perfect shot. AI HDR+ enables the front and rear cameras to combine multiple photos taken in quick succession to eliminate overexposed and backlit images.

The minor party was the first victim of the federal citizenship saga when in July 2017 Senator Scott Ludlam resigned after discovering he was a New Zealand dual citizen.

He was soon followed by colleague Larissa Waters because of her Canadian dual citizenship.

On Friday three Liberal candidates from the Victorian seats of Lalor, Wills and Cooper pulled out after discovering they were likely ineligible for parliament due to section 44 problems.

""We have done what we can, we've ensured that our candidates go through a very thorough process to make sure they are eligible to stand,"" Greens leader Richard Di Natale told reporters in Melbourne on Saturday.

Senator Di Natale, who was doorknocking alongside candidate Steph Hodgins-May in the marginal seat of Macnamara, said the eligibility rules needed to be changed.

The Green Organic Dutchman (TGOD), one of Canada's fastest-growing pot producers, applied for a bylaw exemption last summer to allow a 123,000-square-foot cannabis greenhouse at the corner of Jerseyville and Alberton roads. The current rural size limit in Hamilton for pot is 20,000 square feet.

Council rejected the proposal last year over the advice of its own planners, spurring an appeal to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.

A hearing was expected later this year — but council voted late Wednesday to sign off on a settlement proposal, although with unspecified conditions.

The organic pot grower celebrated the settlement in a release that said the decision will ""allow TGOD to operate its cannabis greenhouse in Ancaster"" and start growing by June with a staff of up to 85 people. The company embarked on a lobbying and charm offensive after the fall election in the hopes council would reconsider.

Details of the settlement and proposed city conditions are still secret, so it was not immediately clear if the original planned size of the contentious greenhouse — about one-fifth as big as Lime Ridge Mall — was endorsed by council.

Mayor Fred Eisenberger did not take part in the vote because he is an investor in the company.

TGOD originally earned criticism from some politicians, particularly Ancaster Coun. Lloyd Ferguson, for starting to build the big greenhouse before earning permission to do so.

Ferguson had pushed to fight the proposal, arguing ""monster"" pot greenhouses could pop up across rural Hamilton.

After the city issued a stop work order last year, TGOD applied for an alternate permit to continue building the greenhouse — only for potted mums.","Hamilton settles with medical pot grower, the Green Organic Dutchman, to allow ‘monster’ Ancaster greenhouse",The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9246102-hamilton-settles-with-medical-pot-grower-the-green-organic-dutchman-to-allow-monster-ancaster-greenhouse/

Right now, they are a trio of middle-aged men. And along with illustrator Frank Caruso, who is also a middle-aged man, they are launching this graphic novel. For women. By—in case we were not clear—four men. It’s utter nonsense, and Twitter agrees.

Perfect timing! I, a non member of Green Day, am writing my handbook for being in the band Green Day. Also due out 10/29 — Manny Santos (@DanuellaSantos) April 3, 2019

Genève Faranski, who has worked at Toronto comic shop The Beguiling for eight years, also agrees. “It has a certain aesthetic that seems dated,” she says. “And it’s by four men, so automatically it feels a little unpredictable in terms of the content.” Faranski also says that the world of graphic novels has historically been a boys club, but in the past 10 years, she’s seen an uptick in the number of women navigating the industry.

Does that mean she thinks Green Day could have found someone better to collaborate with on this project? “There are hundreds of women doing really popular work exhibited all over the world, and judging by the artwork, who could do a much more interesting and appealing job.” So… That’s a yes.

Here are some graphic novels that already exist, actually written by Canadian women, for women that Faranski loves. Full disclosure: we have not read Last of the American Girls, and probably never will, but we still bet these are much better.

Woman World by Aminder Dhaliwal

This novel is set in the near future, where all men have disappeared thanks to a birth defect. Earth gets a rebrand as Woman World, united under the flag of Beyoncé’s Thighs (seriously). “That’s what she said” jokes and Blockbusters are distant memories, and the biggest hurdle is continuing the species.

Available at Drawn & Quarterly, $10.

Somnambulance by Fiona Smyth

Faranski calls Fiona Smyth an “incredible figure on the Toronto comic scene.” The pages of her work are packed with images of feminism, sexuality and style. Somnabulance is a collection of her comics from the past 30 years, and while it’s NSFW, it’s also super empowering and sparks conversations that remain important, even decades after they were written.

Available at Indigo, $34.

XTC69 by Jessica Campbell

Jessica Campbell (in the novel) is from the planet L8DZ N1T3. She’s also the commander of a spaceship that’s traveling the galaxy, looking for men she and her crew can breed with. Jessica Campbell (the artist) is known for skewering gender politics, so it’s not surprising that XTC69 offers up hilarious commentary on the determination of women and non-binary folks who are constantly dealing with men who are trash.

Available at Amazon, $14.

Magical Beatdown Volume 1 by Jenn Woodall

Jenn Woodall, who Faranski says is one of The Beguiling’s best sellers, produced a series of graphic novels that’s like a feminist punk interpretation of Sailor Moon. It’s a revenge fantasy, lead by an otherwise average schoolgirl who changes into a magical being and takes down people who harass her in the street.

Available at Silver Sprocket, $6.

SuperMutant Magic Academy by Jillian Tamacki

This book is about kids in a high school for the supernaturally gifted, and all the bake sales, crushes and science experiments they experience along the way. It is geared towards a younger reader, and Faranski recommends it in case Green Day’s novel ends up being for younger women/girls, too. We truly have no idea at this point.

Available at Drawn & Quarterly, $23.

Less than a week later, the Canadian was on a charter jet with his wife Malory, flying to the Masters at the historic Augusta National Golf Club after winning his first career PGA Tour title on Sunday.

article continues below

""It's been a bit of a whirlwind,"" said Conners, who added the organizers of the Valero Texas Open provided him with the flight and accommodation in Augusta, Ga. ""Not what I expected to be doing after this week ended but I'm really excited.""

The first Monday qualifier to win on the PGA Tour in nine years, the product of Listowel, Ont., birdied three of the final five holes for his second straight 6-under 66 and a two-stroke victory over Charley Hoffman on Sunday. Conners finished at 20-under 268 at TPC San Antonio.

Conners only had a partial PGA Tour card to start the season and had to earn his way into most tournaments in 2019, creating a gruelling schedule of getting to events early, playing his way on to them, and then playing the regular rounds over the weekend.

Winning the Valero Texas Open changes all that.

In addition to automatically qualifying for the Masters, the first major of the men's golf season, it also earned him a two-year exemption on the PGA Tour, a spot in the PGA Championship (the second major) and a US$1.3-million payday. He also rocketed up the FedEx Cup standings, landing at 13th.

""I haven't thought that far ahead, but I know that a win changes things big time,"" said Conners, who is now in a position to strategically pick what tournaments he will play in. ""Making my schedule — something that I hadn't been able to do last year or this year — I'm excited to be able to pick and choose the events I'll play in.""

Although this week's Masters is Conners's first as a professional, he did play in it in 2015 while still an amateur at Kent State University. He earned the right to play in the major after finishing as runner-up to Gunn Yang at the 2014 U.S. Amateur.

He joins Hall of Famer Moe Norman of Kitchener, Ont., as the only two Canadians to play the Masters as amateurs and professionals.

A popular figure in Canada's elite golfing community, Conners had an outpouring of support during and after Sunday's final round. His wife, as well as fellow PGA golfers Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., and Nick Taylor of Abbotsford, B.C., waited for Conners at the 18th green with beers in hand. Malory Conners became a viral sensation online for her emotional reactions with every birdie that her husband sank.

After Conners sank his final putt, other Canadian golfers started tweeting their congratulations, including LPGA star Alena Sharp of Hamilton and Mike Weir of Brights Grove, Ont., who will be the only other Canadian in the field at the Masters as the champion in 2003.

""So happy for @coreconn great playing buddy! #Augusta bound,"" said Weir.

""Had a practice round with @coreconn last year(not a big dealllll). He’s been a mentor for myself, and so many others over the past couple years. A guy that’s paid his dues and done the right things for so long. Tough to not get a little emotional for the guy! Congrats CC!!"" said Jared du Toit of Kimberley, B.C., currently playing on the PGA Tour Latinoamerica.

The Walrus

Trina O’Brien Leggott, a retired librarian, enjoys a breathtaking view of Pownal Bay and the surrounding countryside from her rural home outside Charlottetown. But she’s worried about climate change—and she says she’s grown tired of politicians who seem unable or unwilling to address it. “The way we’re doing things is not really working,” she says. “Surely there’s got to be better.”

Leggott has reason to worry. According to the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, global temperatures are rising faster than scientists previously believed. Even a pledge by world leaders to cap the rise at 1.5 degrees may not be enough to prevent floods, droughts, heat waves, and catastrophic species loss. According to research from a University of Prince Edward Island climate lab, incremental rises in temperature will exacerbate already powerful storm surges and increase shoreline erosion in the province. The Island currently loses an average of twenty-eight centimetres of coastline a year. By the start of the next century, 1,000 PEI homes and cottages will be at risk of disappearing into the ocean.

Leggott’s house is far enough inland that it likely wouldn’t be one of them, but she has a sense of what’s at stake. “We’re very aware, living on an island, how fragile our ecosystem is,” she says. She wonders how the decline of organic matter in Island soil, described in a report released last year, will affect local agriculture. She also worries about what will happen to Island fisheries should the Northern Pulp mill in Nova Scotia proceed with a controversial plan to discharge effluent into the Northumberland Strait, off the Island’s southern shores.

Those concerns have led Leggott to the Green Party of Prince Edward Island. She’s not alone. Nearly four in ten Islanders have suggested they might vote Green in the next provincial election, according to a recent poll from Corporate Research Associates. (The election has since been called for April 23.) Leggott, who has voted Liberal, NDP, or Green in every provincial election since moving to PEI eleven years ago, says she appreciates the party’s focus on supporting local businesses and protecting farmland. She’s also impressed with how the party connects directly with Islanders, hosting Green Drinks gatherings in pubs and cafés across the province.

The party is headed by Peter Bevan-Baker, and under his leadership, the Green Party has vaulted ahead of the governing Liberals into first place: the latest quarterly poll from CRA has the party at 38 percent, eleven points ahead of the Liberals. If these numbers hold, tiny PEI may be on course to elect the first provincial Green government in Canada.

Frank Graves, president of Ekos Research Associates, says renewed support for the Green Party reflects wider voter concern for the environment. At a time when the majority of Canadians—particularly younger Canadians—see climate change as a serious threat to the planet, a provincial victory would vault the party and its policies into the national spotlight.

In its own unassuming way, PEI has quietly and steadfastly advanced some groundbreaking environmental policies over the past two decades. The province launched a mandatory provincial waste-sorting program in 1999 and now diverts 65 percent of its waste from landfill. It tops the country in the percentage of households that compost. A province-wide ban on single-use plastic bags will take effect in July. And PEI is a global leader in wind power, with Island wind farms producing more than 25 percent of the Island’s energy needs.

Like other Canadian jurisdictions, PEI is currently addressing robust immigration, rising housing prices, and concerns about climate change—but the small scale of the Island makes its case unique among other provinces. Nevertheless, as Prince Edward Island gradually embraces Green politics, it may become a testing ground for a party that has always been seen as an underdog rather than a serious contender for power. And whether or not the Greens win the next election, their influence on PEI politics may offer Canadians a chance to reflect on the broader splintering of traditional party loyalty across the country.

Before the 2015 provincial election, no Green candidate had ever come close to winning a seat. But, since 2017, Bevan-Baker has been the preferred choice of premier. A former dentist and father of four, he made his way to the Island from Scotland, via stints in Newfoundland and Labrador and Ontario. He cut his political teeth running (and losing) nine times for the Green Party at the federal and provincial levels before a resounding win in his own rural riding in the 2015 election brought the Greens their historic breakthrough. A surprise by-election win in a Charlottetown seat in 2017 proved the party has momentum.

Don Desserud, a political scientist at UPEI, says the Greens’ appeal can be attributed not just to their environmental focus but also to the current electoral mood. The province’s Liberals are a three-term government with an unpopular leader. The Opposition Progressive Conservatives, on their sixth leader in as many years, have been languishing in the polls.

“There’s an underbelly of frustration with the standard parties doing the same things over and over again,” says Desserud. It’s a phenomenon seen in other recent provincial elections. In New Brunswick, neither the Liberal nor Progressive Conservative parties could eke out a majority victory as support for smaller parties increased. In Quebec, the upstart CAQ surged to power and Québec solidaire made huge gains, at the expense of the once dominant Liberals and Parti Québécois.

Although right-wing populist parties have garnered much media attention as of late, Graves, of Ekos Research, believes there’s an opening in Canada for a progressive, left-of-centre populist party that can speak to voter cynicism. According to a recent Abacus poll, nearly 36 percent of Canadians would consider voting Green in the next federal election, a number that’s remained relatively consistent in the firm’s polling since 2015. In other words, Canadians sympathetic to Green policies often vote for other parties—but, in the right circumstances, might cast their vote with the Greens.

Increased Green support on the Island follows a clutch of modest successes for the party in other provincial legislatures. The Green Party is in a position of strength in British Columbia, where it’s collaborating closely with the NDP. Ontario elected its first Green MPP in June. And, in New Brunswick, the September election saw three Green MLAs elected, giving them the balance of power. Elsewhere, however—particularly in the Prairies, where resource extraction plays a much larger role in the economy—provincial Green parties have struggled.

Nevertheless, Green legislators have taken full advantage of these wins to influence policy. The BC Greens were instrumental in providing input into the NDP government’s ambitious new carbon-reduction strategy, though it’s too early to say how successful the NDP-Green alliance will be in curbing carbon outputs. In PEI, the Greens recently managed to pass one of their own bills, aimed at recognizing the vital role of Island’s creative, cultural, and clean technology industries and designed to attract new investment, trade partnerships, and economic activity in these sectors. The Greens have also rolled out an integrated housing strategy, which calls for expanded seniors housing, tighter regulations on short-term rentals, and more dedicated housing for low-income families. By making climate change and access to housing two of their key priorities in the legislature—and possible planks in an election platform—the Green Party may be demonstrating that its politics are about much more than just saving the environment. Still, despite the party’s polling lead, Desserud isn’t optimistic it will win over the province.

On a federal level, the prospects are less clear. Under leader Elizabeth May, Greens are currently polling at historic levels of support, and Graves feels the timing may be favourable for a modest Green breakthrough in the upcoming federal election. His internal polling shows the Greens leading in three federal ridings, and in play in ten to fifteen more across the country. Yet provincial and federal voting intentions don’t always correspond. Even on PEI, the popularity of Bevan-Baker’s party has resulted in only a modest increase in the number of Islanders who say they plan to vote Green federally. Partly that’s the challenge of a first-past-the-post, winner-take-all system that often penalizes smaller parties. Under a system of proportional representation, if 10 percent of Canadians voted for the Greens, they’d end up with thirty-four seats in the 338-seat House of Commons—a substantive increase over Elizabeth May’s current lone seat, and enough to be a force to reckoned with in Parliament. But, even in the best-case scenarios under our current system, that outcome is highly unlikely. (Islanders have a chance to test-case electoral reform in April’s election. In concert with the provincial election, voters on PEI will be asked in a referendum to make a clear choice between the current first-past-the-post system and a mixed member proportional representation system of government.)

In the absence of electoral reform, it would take a powerful paradigm shift to elect a federal Green government, whose Vision Green platform would pair environmental protection with fiscal responsibility. Rising environmental awareness and disillusionment with the ruling Liberals may sway some voters, but these concerns have not yet positioned the federal party any closer to power. The nature of the current electoral structure, says Graves, is such that during a tightly fought contest—as in the 2015 election—what he calls “promiscuous progressive voters” rally around the candidate most likely to stave off a Conservative victory.

“I really think people are tired of the idea that we either have to vote red or blue,” says Jill MacIntyre, twenty-two. A recent graduate of Mount Allison University, MacIntyre grew up in Summerside and rallied behind causes such as gender rights and economic equality. After flirting with the Liberals and the NDP, she’s found her political home with the Greens. Voters like MacIntyre will be key to the next federal election. She and her millennial peers recently surpassed baby boomers as the largest voting bloc in the country. They voted in record numbers in 2015, and 45 percent of those parked their vote with the Liberals—as did MacIntyre.

Now she’s frustrated by what she perceives as the government’s lack of meaningful consultation with Indigenous communities, not to mention disregard for environmental impacts, in its support for the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline. MacIntyre’s concerns are shared by a growing number of Canadians. As the election approaches, the prime minister’s approval ratings have been declining among both the general population and the millennial voters who put him over the top the last time around. “People are just so tired of that,” MacIntyre says of her peers. “And they see that the Greens are doing politics differently.”

In a province that elected Canada’s first premier of non-European descent (Joe Ghiz) and Canada’s first openly gay male premier (current premier Wade MacLauchlan), Islanders have already shown a willingness to make political history. But a provincial win for the Greens would also mark a turning point in Canada’s relationship to the party, as ascension into government would expose the scrappy grassroots party and its leaders to a whole new level of scrutiny. “It would make me so happy to elect the most progressive government in Canada, coming from this tiny island,” says MacIntyre.",Will PEI Start a New Green Wave?,The Walrus,https://thewalrus.ca/will-pei-start-a-new-green-wave/

Delores Syrota’s Saskatchewan women’s team from Wadena claimed its second gold medal in three years (to go along with a silver won last year), while Mickey Pendergast’s Alberta men’s team from Red Deer repeated as Canadian Masters gold-medallists after its victory last year in Surrey/White Rock, B.C.

On the women’s side, Syrota — backed up by vice-skip Beverly Krasowski, second June Campbell and lead Sylvia Broad — capped a perfect 11-0 performance in Saskatoon in front of friends and family with an 8-7 win over B.C.’s Janet Klebe. Syrota’s team trailed 7-5 going to the eighth and final end, but Syrota drew for the winning three to claim gold.

Klebe’s team, representing the Chilliwack and Richmond clubs, was rounded out by vice-skip Kerri Miller, second Jane Adam, lead Laurie Shimizu and coach Vic Shimizu.

Pendergast, meanwhile, added a second straight gold medal to his collection by beating a familiar face — Northern Ontario’s Al Hackner (Sudbury) — 8-4 in the final.

Pendergast was backed up by vice-skip Rob Armitage, second Randy Ponich and brother Kevin Pendergast, while the Hackner team featured Eric Harnden, Frank Morissette (a longtime rival of Pendergast when he lived in Calgary) and Bruce Munro.

Green Shirt Day’s aim was to “inspire more Canadians to register as organ and tissue donors,” according to a release. Broncos player Logan Boulet registered before dying and six people received those donations. As the news about the donations spread, more than 100,000 Canadians registered as donors.

That act inspired Vancouver-based marketer David Peckham to launch the initiative, recruiting five other individuals to help him organize. Silverthorne, owner of the Roberts Creek graphics shop Vital Signs, was one of those five. He assisted with the initiative’s logo, graphics, banners, sourcing T-shirts and other materials. “[He] found me through an old employee,” said Silverthorne. One of his current employees, Brian Hubenig, created the T-shirt logo.

“I’ve been now schooled on one person can’t make a difference. One person and five other people can make a crazy-ass difference,” said Silverthorne of the experience.

Money raised from the T-shirt sales will be donated to the Canadian Transplant Association. So far $250,000 has been raised, according to Silverthorne. Businesses and organizations on the Sunshine Coast also participated, including TD Bank, which raised more than $2,800 and had 30 people register as donors.

Silverthorne was also inspired to act because of his own experience. Two years ago he was in need of a transplant and his brother-in-law donated the kidney. “Once you have a transplant, you’re embodied with gratitude. I never volunteered a day in my life and that’s all I’m for now, helping people get registered.”

Members of the Boulet family were among the first to wear the T-shirts.",Coast kidney donor recipient key organizer in Green Shirt Day,CoastReporter VOICE OF THE SUNSHINE COAST,https://www.coastreporter.net/news/local-news/coast-kidney-donor-recipient-key-organizer-in-green-shirt-day-1.23788860

“I think the Queen just might be eating babies. Fuck, there’s all kind of circumstantial evidence that states she’s a Satan worshipping cannibal, which is kind of fucked up and weird isn’t it? I never did trust authority but I would’ve never bet on it being this weird.”

Murray Acton aka “The Cretin” is as an anti-authoritarian punk-rock anarchist and frontman of Canadian hardcore-punk outfit Dayglo Abortions. For nearly 40 years, Acton and his band of misfits from Victoria, B.C. have caused controversy all around the globe with their “fuck you” attitude and groovy heavy-rock riffs, garnering worldwide acclaim in the underground punk and hardcore scene.

The band’s highest selling record to date, Feed Us A Fetus, showcases former president of the United States Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan sitting at a table with a cooked fetus on a dinner plate. Their following record, Here Today, Guano Tomorrow, saw the band encounter obscenity charges from an Ontario police officer, who found great offense in his teenage daughter listening to tracks like “Fuck My Shit Stinks” and “Fuck Satan to Death” plastered alongside the image of a hamster brutalized by gunshot. The charges were dropped in in 1990 and Dayglo Abortions released their next album, Two Dogs Fucking, in 1991. The artwork is exactly as it sounds. Their latest album, 2016’s Armageddon Survival Guide, originally held a much different title that would have definitely landed them a date in court.

“Originally that was supposed to be out in 2012. This album was supposed to be called Kill Stephen Harper,” Acton says. “They really didn’t like it because it was provoking people to sue us again. I was gonna start a Stephen Harper popularity fund where we have this thing on Facebook that says ‘Would you pledge $5000 dollars to have Stephen Harper assassinated?’ and a thermometer would go up. Obviously that thing was gonna hit the roof in no time, eh.”

Though the album’s title changed, Acton still got a dig in on Harper with the song “Canadian Hate-Triot” where the frontman yells obscenities at our former Prime Minister, calling him a corporate whore and towel-boy for the global elite.

Acton isn’t too pleased with our current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau either. He calls Trudeau a “Fuckin’ elitist slob” who is “Just like his father. A fuckin’ lawyer looking out for himself and his corporate cronies.”

“He’s never come through with anything,” Acton says. “He makes like he’s gonna come clean with the aboriginals and stuff like that, and fuckin’ nothing. It was all just campaign smoke. The guy is full of shit and he’s ruined fuckin’ marijuana. I’m fuckin’ pissed about that. One of my favourite things to do and he’s fuckin ruined it.”

Acton admits that the upcoming Canadian elections are making him nervous. He doesn’t plan to vote for either the Liberals or Conservatives and will most likely cast his ballot for the Green Party. Acton usually votes Green regardless, but there’s a lingering fear of what this election could bring if Conservative leader Andrew Scheer becomes our PM.

“We could end up with a fuckin’ right wing nut bar want to be like Trump character the way things are going.”

The past U.S. election gave Acton a flurry of new material, and he says a new Dayglo Abortions album is written, and ready to record.

“It’s gonna raise a few eyebrows,” Acton concludes. “It’s not particularly politically correct, but I’ve never been politically correct anyways. I don’t go out of my way to hurt people’s feelings or anything like that, but sometimes you gotta hurt a few feelings just to get the job done, ya know? It’s like trolling in real life.”

In conclusion, Acton can forget about all of this when he’s on stage. He assures the band is tighter than they have ever been, and urges anyone who hasn’t seen the band to check them out at SBC on April 12.",B.C.

337,LifeStyle,2019-04-11T13:24:00.0000000Z,"The Canadian aquaculture alliance says its members don’t farm ... In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has given the green light to the AquaBounty production in Indiana, subject to a new regulation that will require it to disclose ...","HALIFAX—Genetically modified salmon raised in Prince Edward Island are poised for the leap to grocery shelves, a Canadian first that has left traditional producers concerned about setting their farmed fish apart.

Environment Canada recently gave notice it has approved U.S.-based AquaBounty to grow the salmon at its site about 74 kilometres east of Charlottetown.

AquaBounty said in a release it would begin stocking its Rollo Bay facility “as soon as possible,” with the first harvest of AquAdvantage salmon estimated late next year.

Sylvain Charlebois, director of the agrifood analytics unit at Dalhousie University, said it’s likely AquaBounty “production will be ramped up in Canada.”

“It’s a huge advantage for AquaBounty to be allowed to produce this salmon in Canada,” he said in an interview.

AquaBounty, based in Maynard, Mass., has said its salmon will contain genetic material from chinook salmon that help it reach adult size faster, creating a less expensive product.

Health Canada said it doesn’t see any need for a mandatory label to allow consumers to spot the genetically modified fish, but existing producers said they may call for that to change.

“We are reviewing it,” said Tim Kennedy, executive director of the Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance.

“Will there be a disruption in the … entire salmon market? We hope not. But I will say if that’s a possibility, then the response will be: somebody has to label.”

The Environment Canada certification has been most strongly opposed to date by environmental groups, who continue to argue there’s a risk to wild Atlantic salmon if there’s an escape.

However, the certifications in Canada and the U.S. could draw the traditional aquaculture industry and its lobbyists more closely into the debate, depending on how consumers react to the news of AquaBounty’s products entering the market sometime next year.

The Canadian aquaculture alliance says its members don’t farm or sell GM farmed salmon and aren’t researching the practice.

Kennedy said a push for labelling could come next.

“We are reviewing it. We recognize the United States is moving forward with mandatory labelling, as is the European Union,” he said.

“Does it make sense from a trade perspective to align more closely with our major trading partners?”

He said the industry could consider setting up a non-GM label, similar to the labelling of organic foods.

The federal Health Department has repeatedly said it doesn’t favour mandatory labelling for the genetically modified fish.

In a February letter to the Canadian Biotechnology Action Network – an active opponent of GM salmon – the department said it prefers “industry-led initiatives such as voluntary standards,” and “the government of Canada intends to maintain its current approach.”

Kennedy said this leaves the question of who should pay for a massive labelling redo.

“Who bears the burden of that transparency? I don’t think it should be our producers because we’re not the ones putting the new product into the market,” he said.

Meanwhile, it remains unclear how significant the level of production in P.E.I. will be in the Canadian market.

The company declined a request for an interview with its CEO about its plans going forward for production in Prince Edward Island, providing references to news releases.

Over the past two years – as it awaited its Environment Canada licence – the company had shipped eggs to Panama for growing, before the salmon were imported back to Canada and other destinations.

Charlebois says the federal decision means the firm can ship more directly to markets, particularly processors that might use the GM salmon in products ranging from sushi to pies to pates.

Still, the arrival of a form of labelling in the U.S. could lead to increased pressure to create some form of labelling in Canada, he adds.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has given the green light to the AquaBounty production in Indiana, subject to a new regulation that will require it to disclose when a food is genetically modified.

That has come amidst a pending lawsuit by a coalition of consumer, environmental and fishing groups that still hopes to block the sale through the courts.

Opponents have also criticized the upcoming U.S. labelling system, which they say uses the term “bioengineered,” a less familiar phrase than “genetically modified.”

Also, under the rules coming in 2020, companies will be able to provide disclosure of the GM salmon through codes that people would have to scan on their smart phones.

Lucy Sharratt, co-ordinator of the Canadian Biotechnology Action Network, says her group wants Canada to introduce a more transparent labelling system that consumers can easily see on any package.

“The lack of genetically modified food labelling is just the most obvious transparency issue undermining public trust,” she told parliamentarians in a hearing last week.

“Canadians are also asking for more transparent regulation of genetically modified organisms and opportunities for public engagement.”",First genetically modified salmon to hit Canadian stores,plant.ca,https://www.plant.ca/general/first-genetically-modified-salmon-to-hit-canadian-stores-182781/

Later in the day, Kim was grabbing at his right upper body with an apparent injury. Conners was two strokes ...","SAN ANTONIO – Canadian Corey Conners claimed his first PGA Tour victory and earned an invite to the Masters on Sunday, winning the Valero Texas Open less than a week after qualifying.

Conners only entered the tournament field Monday, and he’s the first golfer to win on the PGA Tour after qualifying on a Monday in nine years. He made three birdies in the final five holes, shooting a 6-under 66. He was 20-under for the tournament, winning by two shots over Charley Hoffman.

Next stop for Conners: Augusta, Georgia, for next week’s Masters.

Hoffman, the 2016 Texas Open winner, shot 67 for 18-under on the weekend.

Ryan Moore closed with an 8-under 64, a shot off the course record, and was third at 17-under.

Si Woo Kim, The Players Championship winner in 2017, led the opening three rounds but dropped to a tie for fourth with Brian Stuard (15-under) after an even-par 72.

Conners, the 2014 U.S. Amateur runner-up, will play in his second Masters. Two of the top three finishers last year at Augusta missed the top 10 this week. Rickie Fowler was tied for 17th while 10 strokes back at 10-under with a final-round 69, and Jordan Spieth (72) was 7-under.

Incredible performance from @coreconn. What a battle, and what a champion 🙌🏼🍁 pic.twitter.com/PnembdLq9q — Golf Canada (@GolfCanada) April 7, 2019

Stuard finished with 66 to get to 15-under. Kevin Streelman closed with an 8-under 64 and was 14-under. He missed tying the course record when, after four-straight birdies, he hit his approach from the 18th fairway into the gallery and bogeyed.

Mackenzie Hughes (73) of Dundas, Ont., and Adam Svensson (70) of Surrey, B.C., tied for 42nd at 5 under. Nick Taylor (72) of Abbotsford, B.C., tied for 52nd at 4 under.

It was a wild round for Conners, a native of Listowel, Ont., who had not won on any of the PGA Tour’s affiliated circuits. He had 10 birdies and four pars that sandwiched four consecutive bogeys on the front nine.

He had a one-stroke lead when he rammed home a 34-foot birdie putt at No. 12, and stayed a stroke up with a tap-in birdie at the 14th.

Moore joined Conners at the top of the leaderboard with an 8-foot putt at No. 16 that was his fourth birdie in five holes.

Moore missed a birdie opportunity on the next hole when he couldn’t convert on a putt from inside 10 feet. Minutes later, Conners sank a 10-footer to save par at No. 15, then hit to four feet to set up a birdie at the 175-yard par-3 16th. His birdie at No. 17 gave him a three-shot lead walking up the final hole.

Conners looked like he would tuck this one away early. He birdied four of the first five holes at TPC San Antonio. Trailing by a shot going in the final round, he benefited from a three-stroke swing on the leaderboard on the third hole with a 10-foot putt on the par-3. Kim hit into the water fronting the green and double-bogeyed. Later in the day, Kim was grabbing at his right upper body with an apparent injury.

Conners was two strokes ahead, and with birdies on the next two holes he led by four over both Kim and Hoffman.

But Conners bogeyed the next four, and three of those came after tee shots put him in nice position either from the middle of the fairway or close to it.

The other bogey, on a par-3 at No. 7, he hit his tee shot into a bunker, then blasted over the green.

He made the turn and clicked off three consecutive birdies. The last player to qualify on Monday and win a PGA Tour event was Arjun Atwal in 2010 at the Wyndham Championship. That was the first time it had been done in 24 years.","Canadian Corey Conners wins Valero days after qualifying, will play Masters",Golf Canada,https://golfcanada.ca/article/canadian-corey-conners-wins-valero-days-qualifying-will-play-masters

But the Senate has no right to block environmental legislation duly passed by the democratically elected House of Commons, especially given that the Liberal Party’s electoral mandate in October 2015 made enactment of these stronger environmental laws a priority commitment.""

In 2018, the House of Commons passed four environmental protection bills that would be the most in a generation. If also passed by the Senate, these new laws would:

Improve how Canada assesses the environmental and sustainability impacts of major development projects (Bill C-69).

Reform the disgraced National Energy Board (Bill C-69).

Better protect navigable waters (Bill C-69) and fish habitat (Bill C-68).

Accelerate creation of marine protected areas and strengthen their ecological integrity (Bill C-55).

Ban crude-oil tankers from B.C.’s north coast (Bill C-48).

The question is: Will the Senate also go green and vote for stronger environmental laws before Parliament prorogues at the end of June?

Conservative senators are using a variety of procedural tactics (such as the circus of extraordinary cross-country hearings in western Canada this week and eastern Canada later in the month) to kill Bill C-69.

Bill C-48 is also at risk of death by delay.

Senators are actively considering amendments that remove important new protections for fish and fish habitat from Bill C-68, and create obstacles to more marine protection in Bill C-55.

The Senate has a constitutional duty to study legislation and refer any proposed amendments to the House of Commons for reconsideration.

But the Senate has no right to block environmental legislation duly passed by the democratically elected House of Commons, especially given that the Liberal Party’s electoral mandate in October 2015 made enactment of these stronger environmental laws a priority commitment.

Conservative and several independent senators have aligned themselves with the oil and gas industry in seeking to ensure that federal assessments of development projects do not consider greenhouse gas emissions and restrict public participation in hearings.

Bill C-69 is broadly supported by most environmental groups, including Nature Canada, the Assembly of First Nations, the Native Women’s Association of Canada and the Mining Association of Canada.

The Senate is skating on thin ice with Bill C-69 and these other bills; its very credibility as an institution with an ongoing role in our democracy depends on how it handles them.

Why? A recent AbacusData survey found that almost eight million Canadians are “extremely” worried about climate change, and that nine million say it will be the top issue, or one of the top two issues, that they vote on.

On March 15, children in 100 countries (tens of thousands in Montreal alone) went on strike from school because their politicians are doing so little to address climate change.

Meanwhile, WWF reports that global wildlife populations have declined by 60 per cent in 40 years.

Yet the Senate may well vote to weaken — or kill by delay — bills passed by the elected House of Commons that would help reduce GHG emissions and reverse the loss of wildlife in Canada.

In my view, this would be a major political blunder, but even worse, a moral failure that Canadians will remember.

If these bills are killed or weakened, I predict that Canadian children and adult Canadians who care about children will know exactly where to go to protest. The former train station across from the Chateau Laurier is conveniently located.

Canada’s children and Canada’s nature need the Senate to go green this spring.

The woman who said this year that her goal was to be the happiest player on the course was thrilled about the first two.

“I still can’t believe,” Ko said. “I’m really happy.”

She wasn’t all that excited about the No. 1 spot in the world.

“I just try to focus on my game on the course,” Ko said. “It doesn’t matter about world ranking. I don’t like numbers like No. 1 or No. 2. I’m just playing on the course.”

She did that better than anyone else over four days on the Mission Hills course made more difficult by thicker rough, tighter fairways and some longer holes. On Sunday, the 23-year-old South Korean closed with a 2-under 70 in hot and mostly calm conditions for a three-stroke victory over Mi Hyang Lee.

“If ball goes right or left it doesn’t make me happy, but I’m still trying to be happy,” Ko said. “Also, I really try, don’t think about future, doesn’t matter. Just focus on my swing, on the putting. That’s why I win this week.”

After bogeys on 13 and 15 cut her lead to a stroke, Ko made a 6-foot birdie putt on the par-4 16th and closed with a 15-foot birdie putt on the par-5 18th. She also had a rough back-nine stretch Saturday, allowing In-Kyung Kim to cut a five-stroke deficit to a single shot going into the final round.

“Yesterday was a little bit hard for me,” Ko said. “I’m not robot. We are human.”

Ko won for the fourth time on the LPGA Tour, completing a desert sweep after taking the Founders Cup two weeks ago in Phoenix. She leads the money list and has five top-three finishes in six events this year.

Is she surprised by her start?

“No, no, no,” Ko said. “I had really hard practice in winter training off-season in Palm Springs.”

Ko gave caddie David Brooker his third victory in the event. The Englishman also leaped into Poppie’s Pond with Grace Park in 2004 and Lorena Ochoa in 2008.

“He knows this course,” Ko said. “He helps me all the time on the course. So really say thank you for my caddie.”

She finished at 10-under 278.

Lee parred the final six holes in a 70.

“This is really good momentum for me,” said Lee, also from South Korea. “I’m so happy with this week.”

Ko had a three-stroke lead at the turn and faced little pressure until stumbling with the two bogeys. Her drive on the par-4 13th jumped into the thick right rough and her long approach ended up short of the green in the left rough. After missing a 12-foot birdie putt on the par-3 14th, she hit into the left greenside bunker on the par-4 15th and missed a 12-foot par try.

“I had couple miss shot, but I think it will be fine,” she said.

It was.

Lexi Thompson was third at 6 under after a 67.

“My caddie, Benji (Thompson), helped out tremendously,” Thompson said. “I was getting down a little bit, but he just kept me right in there playing aggressively the whole day – making those birdies and just firing at every pin I could.”

Kim closed with a 74 to tie for fourth at 5 under with Carlota Ciganda. The 30-year-old South Korean lost a chance to win the event seven years after missing a 14-inch putt on the final hole of regulation and losing on the first hole of a playoff.

Kim declined to comment after the round.

Ciganda finished with a 68.

“(T)he many cases of (GMO) escape described in this report show that the government needs to regulate segregation and containment measures for some GMOs and that the only way to prevent contamination from certain GMOs is to stop their release,” says the report, released March 26. “Some GMOs are too prone to escape and others have impacts that are too serious if escape occurs.”

The report lists all the GM escapes in Canada costing farmers millions of dollars.

“Farmers are the first to pay the price,” Marla Carlson of SaskOrganics said in a news release. “Our experience shows that GM contamination can cost farmers dearly. We encourage the federal government to take action to prevent GM contamination to protect farmers’ livelihoods and Canada’s economy.”

Because of GM escapes some farmers have temporarily or permanently lost export markets, suffered lower crop prices in the short or long term and lost access to non-GM canola and farm-saved canola seed.

The report says GM canola is so widespread in Canada organic farmers grow almost no canola. The only place they do are “a few isolated areas” where other farmers don’t grow GM canola.

GM flax contamination temporarily shut down export markets and prices remain low because Canada hasn’t regained higher-priced flax markets.

The discovery of a few GM wheat plants temporarily shut two export markets to Canadian wheat.

Now GM alfalfa, the first perennial GM crop in Canada, threatens all Canadian organic farms and puts alfalfa seed growers at risk because of potential GM contamination, the report says.

“The biology and use patterns of some crops, such as GM alfalfa, make their unwanted spread unavoidable,” the report says.

“GM alfalfa contamination has been found in the U.S. and U.S. government scientists have reported the wide dispersal of feral GM alfalfa.”

Just as non-GM and GM canola can’t coexist, neither can GM and non-GM alfalfa, CBAN co-ordinator Lucy Sharratt said in an interview March 26.

Alfalfa is an important crop to organic farmers because it fixes nitrogen, suppresses weeds and creates organic matter.

CBAN and OAPF want GM alfalfa, currently only grown in Eastern Canada due to farmer opposition in the West, deregistered to help prevent GM contamination.

CBAN and OAPF are also wary of releasing GM trees, insects and salmon, Sharratt said.

Trees produce pollen that can spread long distances making it almost impossible to stop GM tree genetics from spreading, she said.

“The report says the production of GM salmon might not raise a huge risk of escape (especially if produced on land), but we know the consequences if escape happens would be very serious (because they would breed with wild salmon),” she said.

Current Canadian regulations only assess the food and environmental safety of commercializing GMOs, Sharratt said.

“There’s an assumption (if GMOs are deemed safe) that it’s all beneficial or the market will sort it out,” she said. “But when it comes to contamination the market can’t sort that issue out.”

If a GMO is not approved by a country there is zero tolerance for its presence.

That’s why Canola Council of Canada members voluntarily agree not to commercialize canolas with new GM traits until Canada’s major canola customers approve them.

The report notes one way to prevent escaped GM traits from undermining markets and trade is for countries to approve their presence at low levels — a policy Canada is pushing. But the quid pro quo is allowing small amounts of GMOs from other countries to be present without Health Canada first approving it as safe for human consumption.

Sharratt disputed CBAN, a network of 16 organizations, including Green Peace, the National Farmers Union and No More GMOs, is anti-GM.

“I would say we’re critical and we’re interested in a very robust debate about the use of the technology in food and farming… ” she said.

“It’s evident from 20 years where we have documented these incidents there’s a lot that can go wrong with the release of these organisms or the experimentation of these organisms. We think there needs to be stronger regulation and that includes an assessment of the contamination risk and inclusion of the potential economic impacts and that would include consultation with farmers.”

Terminator Technology tempting

One way to reduce the risk of GM traits escaping is to adopt Genetic Use Restriction Technologies (GURTs) — a.k.a. the terminator gene.

GURTs describe a range of technologies to genetically modify plants to produce sterile seeds at harvest.

The CBAN report says while it sounds good in theory, the reality is biological systems are not foolproof.

“If Terminator Technology is accepted as a containment strategy, it will facilitate the development and introduction of particularly dangerous GMOs (to produce pharmaceuticals or industrial chemicals),” the report warns.

“GURTs are complex systems involving multiple inserted genes that work together in a sequence. Scientists warn that the technology will not be 100 per cent effective and that the likelihood of system failure means it could never be a reliable tool for biocontainment.”

There is a global moratorium at the UN Convention on Biological Diversity on field testing or commercializing such technologies, however, GURTs continue to be discussed as a tool to stop GM escape, the report says.",Canadian GMO escapes common: report,Manitoba Cooperator,https://www.manitobacooperator.ca/crops/better-regulations-needed-to-prevent-contamination-from-gmos/

It's covered with postcard pictures of the Prairies, stamped with ""Calgary"" and ""Winnipeg"" and adorned with little red maple leaves that aren't nearly as welcome as they were a few months ago.

In fact, just around the corner, another grocer who used to have the oil on his shelves is quick to insist there's ""nothing Canadian here!""

Last year, Canadian canola shipments to China were worth $2.7 billion. It was a flow that supplied Chinese consumers with oil and farmers with feed. But in the last few weeks, that flow has been choked off, stopped at ports where customs inspectors said they found ""dangerous pests"" in shipments from Canada.

As a result, ships loaded with canola sit offshore, as one Canadian company after another has seen licences to import suspended by Beijing for ""non-compliance."" Manitoba's Richardson International and Saskatchewan-based Viterra, as well as a third, unnamed Canadian company, have all been blocked.

Government spokesmen in Beijing said the problem with one company was ""especially severe,"" and the sudden move was required ""to ensure the health and safety of Chinese citizens.""

China has offered few details, and no proof of what it calls ""scientifically sound and reasonable"" findings.

Officially, there is no connection between the canola ban and China's high-profile dispute with Canada over the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver last December.

But diplomats and political observers say it's clearly part of Beijing's strategy to put pressure on Ottawa by targeting agriculture, a sector China knows is important to Canada, both economically and politically.

Chinese food security

A hint of that bigger strategy came at the end of a statement by Chinese foreign affairs spokesman Geng Shuang at the end of March, when he suggested that the solution to the standoff over canola is for Canada to ""take some concrete measures to correct its previous mistakes"" in bilateral relations.

Targeting food imports is a relatively new approach for Beijing, born of a confidence that China's years of struggling to find enough to feed its huge population are over.

""It's not a problem for Chinese people to feed themselves,"" said Bingchuan Hu, a food supply expert with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Between higher productivity at home (the ability to grow more food for its population) and higher incomes (more money to buy food abroad), Hu said food security hasn't been an issue in China since at least 2004.

""Even if we altogether close or shut down [food] trade, China also can solve this problem,"" he said.

Indeed, the UN's World Food Programme said China has made ""remarkable progress"" in alleviating hunger. It met its own target of reducing the number of hungry people at home by half by 2015, and in doing so, China reduced the global hunger rate by two-thirds.

When it comes to any one product — including canola — Hu said China can always find a replacement, either by importing from elsewhere, like Russia or India, or by using other kinds of oil or feed.

""Anything can be replaced,"" Hu said.

Hu knows food hasn't always been plentiful. China's Great Famine of the early 1960s killed more than 20 million people.

Even now, Hu thanks the Canadian government for sending grain at a time when no other western country would. Prime Minister John Diefenbaker defied a U.S.-led embargo on trade with China, negotiating a system of credit that allowed Beijing to buy several million tonnes of grain at a time when it didn't have any other means to pay.

But China is a very different place today. And it appears to see itself as powerful enough to use trade issues — even in food products — as a means to achieve political ends.

The Australia example

China seems to be using a similar approach with Australia, with whom it has also had strained relations lately.

Australia has angered Beijing by banning the Chinese company Huawei from its 5G networks on national security grounds. Last month, Australia enacted tough new anti-espionage laws that, among other things, make it a crime to steal industrial secrets on behalf of a foreign government.

It is also drafting legislation to limit foreign political donations, after a heated debate about money from China.

Beijing has not been pleased, accusing Canberra of having a ""Cold War mindset"" and targeting coal imports, a sector that's critical for economics and politics Down Under. China is Australia's biggest trading partner and its best customer for coal, buying $7 billion Cdn worth annually.

Like Canadian canola, Australian coal has also faced increased scrutiny at Chinese ports: Extra tests, complaints about impurities and other unexplained delays.

Mark Beeson, a professor of international relations at the University of Western Australia, said China is throwing its weight around in unexpected ways.

""The message is that we're big and powerful, you depend on us,"" he said. ""If you upset us or do things that are really damaging to our perceived national interest, our core interest, then we've got ways of hurting you.""

Beeson said ""from China's perspective, there's not a huge amount the likes of Australia and Canada can do.""

That's the canola conundrum.

Ottawa has proposed sending a high-level delegation or a panel of experts to China, but Beijing seems in no mood to cooperate right now.

“Despite their growing political participation, women represent just 35 per cent of all legislators in Canada and remain under-represented at all levels of government,” the report said. “Increasing women’s participation in electoral politics is essential for achieving greater gender equality. Having more women in elected office is about more than achieving equality in a traditionally male-dominated field — it could also have significant effects on public policy.” The committee zeroed in on the role that political parties play, saying they should work harder to get more women to run by eliminating sexism and biases that might be built into their recruitment efforts.

One potential fix, the committee says, would be to offer cash incentives, such as subsidies, to encourage parties to help more women get nominated and then elected. Witnesses and experts who spoke to the committee cited New Brunswick’s example of changing the formula for the per-vote subsidy to favour female candidates in provincial elections. Votes received by female candidates are weighted 1.5 times greater than votes received by male candidates in the province, which encourages parties to run women in competitive ridings where they are more likely to win. The federal per-vote subsidy was eliminated in 2015. The government must now respond to the report. Gender Equality Minister Maryam Monsef’s office has yet to respond to a request for comment. Studies looking at the issue have found that when party members are given the option to vote for female nominees, they often do. In addition, early and long nomination campaigns are more likely to attract female contestants, the committee heard.

But the rules and processes associated with nomination and election campaigns can be complicated, and decision-making within parties was described by some as “opaque.” “Women may benefit from increased transparency and accountability in nomination and election campaign processes, as this would confirm that all candidates are subject to the same rules,” the report says.

The committee said Ottawa should also consider encouraging parties to set voluntary quotas for how many female candidates they plan to field and publicly report on efforts to recruit female candidates after every general election. Other recommendations include a call for publicly funded education campaigns and training to counter the negative effects of gender-based harassment of female politicians, both in traditional and social media. The committee also said Statistic Canada should get more funding to expand its data collection on the participation and engagement of diverse groups of women in political activities. The MPs who worked on the report plan to ask to another Commons committee, which studies electoral issues, to consider looking into ways to eliminate gender bias in the design of voting ballots.

1. Canada offers to aid Iraq invasion

The same day former prime minister Jean Chrétien publicly refused to join the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a high-ranking Canadian official secretly promised the U.S. clandestine military support for the operation, according to a classified U.S. diplomatic memo obtained by CBC News from WikiLeaks.

The classified U.S. document showed that senior Canadian officials met the same day with high-ranking American and British diplomats at Foreign Affairs headquarters in Ottawa.

According to the account, Canadian Foreign Affairs official James Wright ""emphasized"" that contrary to public statements by the prime minister, Canadian naval and air forces could be ""discreetly"" put to use during the pending U.S.-led assault on Iraq and its aftermath.

""Following the meeting, political director Jim Wright emphasized that, despite public statements that the Canadian assets in the Straits of Hormuz will remain in the region exclusively to support Enduring Freedom,"" the document states.

""They will also be available to provide escort services in the Straits and will otherwise be discreetly useful to the military effort. The two ships in the Straits now are being augmented by two more en route, and there are patrol and supply aircraft in the U.A.E. [United Arab Emirates] which are also prepared to 'be useful.'""

The U.S. diplomat wrote in his briefing note to State Department bosses in Washington that ""this message tracks with others we have heard.""

""While for domestic political reasons … the GOC [Government of Canada] has decided not to join in a U.S. coalition of the willing … they are also prepared to be as helpful as possible in the military margins.""

2. Mentally ill Canadian man held at Bagram

U.S. diplomatic cables exposed a troubling case of a mentally ill Canadian-Egyptian man held in a U.S.-run Afghanistan prison for more than 18 months. Khaled Samy Abdallah Ismail, an Egyptian-born engineer, was captured in April 2006 and held at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility.

The U.S. military held Ismail until at least October 2007, often relegating him to segregation despite ""largely circumstantial"" evidence against him, while they debated whether to send him to Egypt or Canada.

While former prime minister Jean Chrétien publicly refused to involve Canada in the invasion of Iraq, a U.S. diplomatic memo obtained by WikiLeaks said Canadian forces would be 'discreetly useful to the military effort.' (Jonathan Hayward/Canadian Press)

The Americans confiscated Ismail's Canadian passport and expired Egyptian passport, assigned him internment serial number US9EG002770DP, and medically assessed him as mentally sound but ""narcissistic and arrogant,"" according to U.S. diplomatic cables.

After a psychotic break in 2007, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, was segregated and given intravenous anti-schizophrenia medication.

Ismail is the only known Canadian to have been held at the Bagram detention facility other than OmarKhadr, who spent approximately four months there before being transferred to the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo, Cuba.

Government officials have refused to say if he was eventually transferred back to Canada.

3. Montreal Metro bomb plot

An anonymous letter sent to the RCMP in late 2004 warned of bomb threats to the Montreal Metro system and the U.S. Embassy in Canada by a man affiliated with Osama bin Laden, a secret U.S. diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks to CBC News revealed.

The letter, dated Nov. 29, 2004, spurred American government facilities across Canada to heighten security. Though the RCMP noted such letters are frequently received and the threat was doubted to be ""credible,"" U.S. Embassy officials said in the document that few such threats specifically mention the U.S. Embassy.

The anonymous letter writer claimed to have overheard a man detailing a possible plot to bomb the Montreal Metro system on Dec. 15, 2004, and the U.S. Embassy on Jan. 10, 2005.

The brief letter in French, addressed to the RCMP's Montreal headquarters, included the suspected bomb plotter's name and cellphone number.

6. Canada wanted to copy U.S. hostage policy

Canada sought U.S. help in crafting a national hostage policy, hoping to follow the secretive American policy as ""closely as possible,"" a U.S. diplomatic cable leaked by whistleblower website WikiLeaks revealed.

In early January 2009 — after five kidnappings in as many months — Canada asked for a briefing on U.S. policy in hostage situations as it planned to create a formal national policy of its own.

""Canada seeks to co-ordinate its policy as closely as possible with that of the U.S.,"" the leaked U.S. State Department diplomatic cable states.

7. Harper's empty Arctic sovereignty bluster: U.S. cable

A WikiLeaks cable suggested the U.S. government viewed former prime minister Stephen Harper's talk about Canadian Arctic sovereignty as little more than empty chest-thumping designed to win votes.

In a diplomatic cable posted by WikiLeaks, the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa said the Conservatives have made successful political use of promises to beef up Canada's presence in the Arctic.

Now-deceased Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi threatened to nationalize Petro-Canada assets in northern Libya, according to a U.S. cable obtained by WikiLeaks. (Reuters)

But it also said the Harper government had done only scant implementation on pledges such as increasing surveillance over the Northwest Passage.

8. U.S. viewed John Baird as rising star

U.S. diplomats saw a bright future for Conservative MP John Baird, describing him as ""a young, ambitious and dynamic minister who should be one of the Conservatives' top leadership prospects in the future,"" according to a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable.

Americans devoted an entire nine-page diplomatic cable to analyzing Baird after he was appointed to the tricky file of environment minister in January 2007.

""Baird clearly enjoys and is comfortable with the rough-and-tumble of parliamentary debate in contrast to his predecessor Rona Ambrose,"" says a section of the cable marked ""embassy comment.""

""It is clear that Baird hopes a strong performance handling the politically sensitive environmental file will eventually be rewarded by his appointment to an even higher-profile ministry.""

""Canada can feed the world but not if our government does not act strongly on our behalf, removing non-tariff trade barriers, enforcing existing trade agreements and removing political roadblocks,"" Alberta canola farmer Stephen Vandervalk told the House of Commons agriculture committee.

Citing concerns about pests, China has rejected canola-seed imports from Canada and has suspended the licences of two major Canadian exporters.

The moves to cut off the critical Canadian export have been widely viewed as China applying economic pressure on Canada in response to the December arrest of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver at the behest of the United States.

Any extended canola dispute with China, which imported $2.7 billion worth of canola seed from Canada last year, would deliver a painful economic blow to producers, the supply chain and the wider Canadian economy.

The price of canola has fallen since the dispute started last month. The late-winter timing of the disruption has been particularly difficult because it's forced many farmers to suddenly rethink the planting decisions vital to their businesses.

On Tuesday, producers made it clear to MPs at the committees that even with the urgency around the China conflict, the pain is not only about canola. Canadian farmers, they said, are staring at other big trade hurdles in world markets.

Several of the witnesses mentioned issues that have affected Canada's durum wheat exports to Italy, wheat sales to Vietnam, pulse exports to India and feed-barley shipments to Saudi Arabia.

Saskatchewan grain farmer Mehgin Reynolds (who is seeking a Conservative party nomination) told MPs that, for instance, her four-year crop rotation includes lentils, barley, canola and durum wheat — all products that face obstacles on foreign markets.

""The frightening reality is that almost every crop being grown in Canada is currently struggling with one trade barrier or another,"" Reynolds said.

The Liberal government has insisted it wants to find a scientific solution to the canola dispute, in keeping with China's insistence that the problem is tainted seeds.

The Liberals have established a working group that includes officials from Richardson International Ltd. and Viterra Inc. — the two exporters that have had their licences to sell canola revoked by China — and representatives from the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau has requested to send a delegation of experts to China to examine the issue. She's said officials are exploring options to support farmers by expanding existing programs.

""We have been sorry to see that there's a bunch of stuff out there that is either misunderstanding or poorly explained. There are a bunch of myths out there."" The commission has just published a report on carbon tax misconceptions. The worst, Ragan said, is that a carbon tax doesn't work.

At least five different published studies have found British Columbia's carbon tax, introduced in 2008, has cut overall emissions, reduced per capita gasoline use by seven per cent, improved average vehicle efficiency by four per cent, cut residential natural gas use by seven per cent and diesel use by more than three per cent. Meanwhile, the province enjoyed about three per cent annual economic growth between 2012 and 2017.

Article Continued Below

Other jurisdictions that have successfully used carbon taxes to reduce emissions include Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, several U.S. states, the U.K. and the European Union. Three separate studies found B.C.'s tax either didn't affect jobs or added them. A fourth found a small decrease in jobs for less-educated workers. Studies in the U.S. or the U.K. found little or no impact on job numbers. The commission's report finds that far from hurting families, 70 per cent of Canadian households will receive more in carbon tax rebates than they pay.

Energy economists such as Mark Jaccard at B.C.'s Simon Fraser University argue that regulations get faster, bigger results and are politically easier to enact. The big cuts to Canada's carbon emissions, he said, have come from closing coal-fired power plants and clean fuel rules. ""Some people will tell you have to have carbon pricing,"" he said on a recent podcast. ""That's not true. You could do it all through regulations."" You could, concedes Ragan. But that would cost the economy more. Besides, he said, bringing in carbon taxes gives governments an opportunity to cut other levies such as income tax. Albertans who believe the province could escape a carbon tax by rescinding provincial legislation may also be mistaken. Martin Olszynski, a University of Calgary law professor, said all Ottawa would have to do is pass an order in council to bring Alberta under the same federal tax that recently came into effect in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick. None of those provinces had its own tax. ""It's a matter of getting cabinet together and writing the order,"" Olszynski said. Looking to the courts to block Ottawa's tax is an iffy bet, he suggested. In court hearings on Saskatchewan's anti-tax constitutional challenge, Olszynski said, judges asked if allowing Ottawa to regulate greenhouse gases as a matter of ""national concern"" would impede provincial efforts to do the same. ""If you recognize this matter as a matter of national concern, you would strip away the provincial ability to regulate these things,"" he summarized.

But Olszynski notes that courts have recognized that many issues — especially environmental ones — are best managed jointly between national and provincial governments. Other federal arguments in favour of a national carbon tax are backed by decades of case law, Olszynski added. Ragan said the debate over carbon taxes is as important to Canada's future as debates over the GST or free trade with the United States. ""It's a big policy issue and it's appropriate that we're talking about it now."" Ragan just wishes the debate wasn't so mythical. ""We live in a democratic society where people play partisan politics. Those political debates don't always stick to the facts.""

For politicians eager to tap into an electorally powerful ethnic group, the huge version of Khalsa Day in Surrey, B.C., is a veritable gold mine.

But barring a significant change of tune by the federal government over the next week, this year’s edition will impose an unprecedented policy. Unless certain demands are met, Liberal MPs will be barred from speaking from its stages on April 20, says organizer Moninder Singh.

“We’ve never had to take steps like this,” said the B.C. Gurdwara Council spokesman. “But we can’t be giving platforms where half a million people are out walking around, when we don’t see a genuine relationship being formed with the community.”

The threatened ban was over an issue causing growing consternation in the Sikh community: an annual Public Safety Canada report on terrorism that for the first time this December contained a small section on the alleged threat of Sikh extremism.

Community activists insist that violent support for the independence of Sikh-dominated Punjab state from India ended in the years after the 1985 Air India bombing, Canada’s worst-ever terror act — and call the report a smear job.

Critics see the hidden hand of India, allegedly manipulating Canada to malign a diaspora fixated on Punjab separation. The government says that’s hogwash, while others warn against politicians meddling in a report penned by independent security agencies. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale has apologized for language that he says inadvertently disparaged Sikhs.

Regardless, community activists say the issue could have major implications for Canadian politics, setting off a potentially seismic shift in a minority group with wildly disproportionate political muscle.

At stake are nine Sikh-dominated ridings – in the Toronto-area suburbs, Calgary and lower-mainland B.C. — all of which went Liberal in the 2015 election, many flipping from the Conservatives.

Another eight, mostly Liberal seats across the country could be decided by the Sikh vote if the races are “competitive,” says Jaskaran Singh Sandhu, executive director of the World Sikh Organization (WSO), while 18 more are susceptible to Sikh influence if particularly close.

“Nine seats make or break their (Liberal) majority,” said Sandhu. “Sikhs can decide that.”

There are already signs of trouble for the party: a slate of candidates tied to the fathers of two Liberal MPs was roundly defeated in a recent election for the board of North America’s largest Sikh temple. The winners contend Ottawa’s terror report was a factor; the losers say it was just about religion.

About 400 people crowded into a round-table meeting on the issue in Brampton, Ont., Sunday, grilling the lone Liberal MP — Ruby Sahota — who attended.

And more Khalsa Day parades and gurdwaras — Sikh temples — are considering bans of their own on Liberal politicians speaking if the report is not changed, said B.C.’s Singh.

Other Sikhs, though, question whether there is a movement afoot, or just some very vocal leaders concerned about a niche matter.

“My sense is that it is a dead issue,“ says Ujjal Dosanjh, a former Liberal cabinet minister who has long crossed swords with the Punjabi separatist — or Khalistani — movement.

Shinder Purewal, both a political scientist at B.C.’s Kwantlen Polytechnic University and now a Conservative federal candidate, believes the south Asian community generally is souring on the Liberals, and shares others’ misgivings about the terror report. But he doesn’t expect it to play a big role in the Oct. 21 election.

“I don’t think that is one of the burning issues,” Purewal said. “People have the impression that immigrant communities have a separate agenda from other Canadians. They don’t. They care about the same issues.”

No one can question, though, that the Sikh community has some considerable political weight to throw around.

Recent elections have produced 18 Sikh MPs, including four cabinet ministers and a party leader. All from a minority community of 500,000 — barely one per cent of Canada’s population.

Canadians of Hindu Indian descent actually outnumber them, but Hindus and other south-Asian subgroups have not had the same influence politically.

That out-sized activism and clout stems partly from Sikh Canadians’ concentration in a relatively few ridings. But there may be another, more philosophical explanation, too. The religion melds the spiritual and secular in a way that encourages political service as an extension of the community-giving expected of followers, argues Sandhu.

Purewal says such an intersection of godly and earthly is common in many religions, and suggests that Sikh history — including a need to repulse a succession of invaders who targeted the Punjab — may be a better explanation for high levels of political engagement.

Whatever their reasons for getting involved, Sikhs have traditionally voted Liberal, the party they see as generally more friendly to immigrants and immigration, said Singh, though he adds they are becoming more discriminating. Purewal says the wave of Sikh support for Liberals in 2015 was largely a reaction to the Conservatives’ legislation stripping citizenship from dual citizens convicted of terrorism.

Regardless, the terror report in December was, for some Sikh leaders at least, a rude awakening after a spate of political victories.

“We thought we’d finally arrived,” Balpreet Singh, legal counsel for the World Sikh Organization, told Sunday’s town hall. “(But) what we’ve seen in the last year has been a wound to the Sikh community we haven’t seen in decades.”

The complaints centre around the document’s reference to “Sikh (Khalistani) extremism” — seen as defaming an entire, peaceful community rather than singling out a specific entity — and the lack of any evidence to support the claim of present danger. The report mentions the Air India bombing 33 years ago and two terror groups critics say have long been inactive.

Singh believes the passage stems from a counter-terrorism co-operation agreement signed between Canadian and Indian national-security czars last year, as well as the government’s desire to improve fractured relations with New Delhi.

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh suggested the report is having a “massive” effect on Sikh politics, and warned it could spark hate crimes.

“This is the type of report by the government … that is going to result in people saying, ‘Well, if Sikhs are terrorists, then maybe we should take action,’ ” he told the town hall. “That is deeply offensive.”

Conservative Garnett Genuis, though an MP from Alberta, also attended the Brampton meeting and earned generous applause when he defended the right to peacefully advocate for Punjab independence.

Sahota voiced her own concerns about the report’s language, and the lack of clarity on why Khalistanis were suddenly included after years of silence. But in a spirited defence of her government, she stressed the document was the product of independent security services, not the party.

“We can’t take it to a point where we are politically interfering with our intelligence agencies,” the Brampton North MP said. “This didn’t wind up in there by accident … Obviously there is a reason.”

Goodale has said future iterations would not reference Sikh extremism but only “extremists who support violent means to establish an independent state within India.” He has not, though, disavowed the issue’s inclusion in the report.

Asked about the lack of backup evidence, a spokesman for the minister said: “Intelligence can precede criminal charges or other law enforcement action that would result in further public disclosure.”

Meanwhile, Dosanjh says he’s appalled by the Liberal MPs of Sikh background who publicly talk down the report’s Khalistani section.

“It’s horrifying to see,” he said. “Politicians have to rise above pandering and look to the national interest.”

Organizers of the Surrey Khalsa view things rather differently. They say the government must commit to re-issuing December’s report without the mention of Sikhs as a menace — or forget about politicking at the April 20 parade.

This being 2019, opponents of the report have made their demand clear, in a Twitter slogan: #ProveitorRemoveit .

The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development presented its report on the Arctic to Canada’s House of Commons on Wednesday, and northern experts are praising the recommendations on managing the country’s evolving relationships with Russia and China in the North.

The report, “Nation-building at home, vigilance beyond: Preparing for the coming decades in the Arctic,” stressed the importance of Canada’s continuing to work with Russia through the Arctic Council on environmental, safety, transportation and human development issues, but urged the government to work more closely with NATO to “…deepen the Alliance’s understanding of Russia’s military intentions in the Arctic and to consider the most appropriate and measured response.”

Russia has made heavy investments in reviving its Soviet-era Arctic infrastructure, including military, in recent years as maritime traffic increases along the Northern Sea Route and oil and gas projects are established in the Far North.

The committee also called for greater engagement with China to better understand that country’s growing interest in the Arctic.

China is already an observer country at the Arctic Council but raised eyebrows in 2018 when it released its first ever White Paper on the North where it described itself as a `”near-Arctic state.”

“Russia and China are two actors that have garnered a lot of attention, and even some alarmism again, when it comes to the Arctic, but this report focuses on constructive engagement,” said Whitney Lackenbauer, Canadian Research Chair at Trent University in Ontario, in a phone interview.

“It looks at how we’re transiting the right strategic message to Russia in partnership with NATO allies and in partnership with the Americans through NORAD.

“On China, we need to be cognisant of some of the risks associated with China’s engagement in the region like security and safety issues when it comes to things like environment and business development in the Arctic, but I like the report’s focus on deeper engagement with China and not jumping ahead to assuming that China is this massive sovereignty risk in the Arctic.”

Indigenous partnerships – ‘Vigilant foreign and defence policies are not enough’

The report also stressed the urgency of closer work with Canada’s northern Indigenous communities.

“Canada’s challenges in the Arctic are not limited to security and defence,” the report said. “There is also the national imperative of ensuring vibrant communities. Yet, the Canadian Arctic continues to suffer from an infrastructure deficit. The needs are extensive and well-known. The absence of needed infrastructure is inhibiting the economic development of the North, perpetuating a sense of precarious isolation, and maintaining the cost of everything at a prohibitively high level.

“In choosing to tackle such issues in a report of the Foreign Affairs Committee, a direct line is being drawn between Northern and Indigenous empowerment and the assertion of Arctic sovereignty. As the title of this report makes clear, vigilant foreign and defence policies are not, on their own, enough. That approach must be combined with nation-building at home, pursued from the basis of meaningful partnerships.”

Mathieu Landriault, director of the Montreal-based Observatoire de la politique et la sécurité de l’Arctique (Observatory on Politics and Security in the Arctic) and a lecturer at the University of Ottawa, says the report’s focus on issues around governance, active occupation and management of the Arctic Region, instead of the ‘who owns what in the Arctic’ debate that dominated for so many years, signals an important maturing of Canada’s positioning on Arctic questions.

“For a long time there were two overarching narratives; either an “Arctic scramble” for resources or an “Arctic struggle” for territory,” he said in a phone interview from Gatineau, Quebec. “I think this report did a good job at tampering that down. A lot of the sovereignty section is focused on Indigenous and Inuit occupancy and more meaningful partnerships with northerners. That’s an important direction.”

Among the reports recommendations are for Canada to develop a co-management framework for Arctic Canadian waters that would see Inuit in a leadership role with the federal government, as well as increasing Inuit representation in the Canadian Coast Guard.

Jackie Dawson, an Arctic shipping expert, co-scientific director of Arctic Net and an associate professor at the University of Ottawa said the report’s focus on northern communities was one if its strengths.

“You can’t create a strategy in the South for the North, you have to start on the ground. And they actually spoke with northerners.”

Shipping & the Northwest Passage

Headlines have long trumped a shipping boom in Canada’s Arctic as ice melts and previously inaccessible waterways become navigable. However, maritime traffic in the Canadian Arctic is still dwarfed by shipping numbers in the European Arctic.

Although the report stresses that shipping numbers in the Canadian Arctic are still relatively modest, Dawson said the report underplays the risk the modest increase in shipping has in places like the Arctic.

“An accident in the Arctic is not that same as an accident in Vancouver,” Dawson, also a climate scientist, said in a phone interview from Ottawa.

“It’s factually true that ship numbers aren’t significantly increasing, but the numbers of kilometres travelled by those ships has tripled since 1990. And these increasing kilometres in Arctic travel are creating an exponential risk that’s not captured in the report – and that growth is going to continue.”

The report stresses that despite now-open waterways, unpredictable ice conditions can make them still to dangerous to navigate. But Dawson says Canada needs a more forward-looking approach to keep up with countries like Russian and China.

“We talk about ice conditions being dangerous but if you look at the kinds of icebreakers China is building, and all the technological advances we’ll be seeing elsewhere in the coming years, soon this won’t be factor anymore. Canada urgently needs a national focus on Arctic infrastructure and technology and I would have liked to see more on that.”

Lack of focus on science and technology

Climate change is the main catalyst for increasing world interest in the North. And experts who spoke with Eye on the Arctic said they were surprised by the lack of emphasis on global warming and science in the report.

“We need to know more about our Arctic than the rest of the world knows about our Arctic but now that is not the case,” Dawson said. “We have fantastic science but there’s a disconnect between Polar Knowledge Canada, Arctic Net and government science being done.

“This is on us – we as a science community need to do better. But we also need mechanisms to facilitate this vision. I would have liked to have seen a recommendation on this in the report.”

With only four recommendations on science and climate change section from the committee, Landriault says it was a missed opportunity to amplify the critical role research plays and will continue to play in the changing North.

“This was such a thin section for me,” he said. “There should have been more attention on how science can play more of a leading role in building coalitions and alliances and how Canada can put in place a robust ambitious program to fight climate change and global warming.

“Even if we look at things like the fishing moratorium and the push to gather more scientific evidence to map the Central Arctic Ocean, science is the critical element, but I didn’t see anything about that here.

“It was disappointing and a missed opportunity.”

Testimony gathered in North

The House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development is a permanent bi-partisan group that studies foreign policy, international relations and humanitarian assistance.

In producing the report they received written briefs and talked to government officials, Indigenous leaders and academics. The also gathered testimony in Canada’s eastern Arctic territory of Nunavut and the Northwest Territories.

Besides English and French, the House committee report is available in Indigenous languages spoken in the North: two Inuit language dialects, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun; as well as two First Nations’ languages, Gwich’in and Dogrib (Wiiliideh).

First elected in the Labour landslide of 1997, May took over as chair of her party in the summer of 2002, in the wake of a second electoral drubbing by Labour’s Tony Blair, the then-young and clued-in purveyor of “Cool Britannia.”

Staring a generation of political wilderness in the face, May took a look at her twice-battered rump of a party and spoke a few home truths at its annual convention.

“There’s a lot we need to do in this party of ours,” May urged. “Our base is too narrow and so, occasionally, are our sympathies. You know what some people call us – the Nasty Party.”

And while May’s analysis went down like a cup of cold sick in the room, the message was eventually taken to heart. David Cameron’s leadership largely succeeded in repositioning the party as pro-environment, pro-minority and pro-moderate. Well, until Brexit anyway.

Which brings us to the question at hand: Who is the Conservative Party of Canada’s Theresa May? Who will bravely pipe up about the need to widen a base that, while uber-reliable, isn’t exactly trending in the direction of modern Canada?

The answer should be Andrew Scheer, but the Tory leader has been slow off his mark on questions of nastiness since becoming leader. Every time Scheer can’t say “Muslim” in the wake of a slaughter, or finds himself at the same events as Faith Goldy, or leads the charge against meaningless UN migration compacts, a little piece of the accessible vote dies. The Tory leader always looks like he would rather be somewhere else when placed in the middle of a difficult conversation.

This discomfort is what happens when the primary concern is keeping your natives from getting restless. At some point, however, Scheer will have to treat his party membership as a foundation instead of a roof. There are only 250,000 or so CPC members, compared with the roughly 5.5 million people who voted Conservative in 2015, which itself is still a long way from the nearly seven million who voted for Justin Trudeau. Speaking to that delta population of 1.5 million ought to be a priority.

Who will bravely pipe up about the Tories’ need to widen a base that, while uber-reliable, isn’t exactly trending in the direction of modern Canada?

But how to broaden the coalition is the discussion the Conservative Party ducked in its last leadership race by limiting the contest to the slim and unrepresentative segment of society already in possession of a party membership card. And it’s the discussion the Conservative Party will want to avoid at the very moment Justin Trudeau is running the gauntlet on SNC-Lavalin. But the party needs to tackle the question head-on before the country goes to the polls this autumn.

The pressures are two-fold.

On the one hand, we have Maxime Bernier – i.e. the man who lost to Scheer by a margin so thin Trudeau would feel comfortable hanging his latest SNC defence on it – courting the nativist elements of the Conservative Party’s support. And on the other, we have a wounded and desperate Trudeau and his Liberal Party who will be searching for every bit of white nationalist hate they can scrape off the internet to affix to Scheer. The Tory leader needs to move before they can tar him.

Yes, Bernier will be condescending and shameless in response. And yes, the Liberal tactics will be pathetic and desperate. But their criticism will be pushing on an open door.

Stephen Harper and Peter MacKay created the Conservative Party of Canada in the wake of Theresa May’s “nasty party” speech and quickly set about their own plan to make sure the label didn’t stick in Canada.

Harper quickly ruled out revisiting abortion. A gay marriage vote was brought forward when it was certain to lose. Immigrant communities were courted and celebrated. The government then did its job so well it received two more mandates. The nastiness label was traded in for competence.

But by the end of the third go-round, the nastiness had soaked back in and become the narrative. Snitch lines, burqa bans and relentless political attacks were then rebuffed by sunny ways. There’s a reason Trudeau still uses Harper as his favourite curse word: it sells.

The proxy issues for nastiness at the moment are white nationalism and climate. Scheer needs to be unequivocal in his condemnation of the former and much more detailed in his policy toward the latter. He needs to tell people like Ezra Levant to jog on and tell people like Michael Chong to come forward. And, while he’s at it, he should ban his MPs from calling people a piece of poo emoji on Twitter.

Because SNC is the gift that forces Trudeau into nasty. Scheer should counter with his own version of sunny ways.

We were testifying on behalf of PSAC member companies, offering their views on Bill C-69, which would enact the Impact Assessment Act and the Canadian Energy Regulator Act, as well as amend the Navigation Protection Act and a number of other acts.

In short, Bill C-69 is the federal government’s attempt to impose new “environmental assessment” measures on Canada’s resource sector.

ADVERTISEMENT

It has been widely criticized as likely to further delay and discourage investment in Canadian pipelines, mines and other resource infrastructure. Its green agenda threatens to trump economic considerations, while adding new layers of bureaucracy, higher costs, longer delays and more uncertainty on Canada’s resource sector.

We felt it necessary to reiterate to the committee the issues of deep concern that had come to the fore in our assessment of the bill’s likely impact.

We pointed out that what began in 2014 as a downturn due to low commodity prices, a situation outside of the control of a federal or provincial government, has escalated into a dramatic flight of capital from Canada in response to factors that are within the control of governments.

These include competitiveness, regulatory uncertainty, the tanker moratorium, the clean fuel standard, methane emissions reduction regulations, carbon taxes and, finally, Bill C-69. At a time when investors are looking for regulatory certainty and firm timelines, Bill C-69 in its current form threatens the opposite. Canada will continue to sacrifice billions of dollars of economic prosperity and growth, even as jobs continue their flight to other countries.

ADVERTISEMENT

One of the biggest problems with Bill C-69 is that it would give the federal environment minister added discretionary power on deciding whether a project goes ahead.

This politicization of the process has been roundly criticized by numerous commentators, including the four Atlantic premiers (including three Liberals), who told the prime minister that Bill C-69 in its current form “will not meet the dual objectives of environmental protection and economic growth.”

They went on to say that a particular concern is that the bill “places final decision-making power in the hands of the minister or governor in council and provides the opportunity to veto the results of thorough scientific assessment and review of evidence.”

What is new to the debate now is a key lesson from the ongoing SNC-Lavalin saga.

In that regard, we reminded the committee that one purpose of administrative law is to take political decisions out of the hands of politicians and place it in the hands of subject experts. That’s what we seek: subject experts able to move the process forward in an objective manner.

ADVERTISEMENT

Legislators have the key responsibility of establishing the parameters for such quasi-judicial administrative bodies to exercise their authority. They then need to stand out of the way.

The problem with politicizing the process is that it will lead to lobbying by other ministers, MPs, and others with agendas. The clear danger is that issues of national interest may be forced to take a back seat to those of political interest.

Our advice to the committee? If you don’t want the Prime Minister’s Office, or ministers, or others exercising undue pressure upon an individual minister, then take away that possibility. The process must not be politicized.

Let’s take to heart what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself has said about the SNC-Lavalin affair:

“We will stand up and defend and create jobs, and we will always defend our institutions and rule of law.”

By all means, create new and better institutions and laws as they deal with resource development, but then stand out of the way and let them work to restore investor confidence and bring back those jobs for Canadians.

Yes, them. Born between 1980 and 2000, millennials are frequently described as lazy, self-centred, unfocused and lacking in basic life and workplace skills. They have been blamed for “killing” everything from bar soap to credit cards to Hooters to golf to dating to car ownership.

These much-maligned “kids” are also potentially the biggest voting bloc, accounting for 35 per cent of eligible voters. Yet right now, they are almost voiceless in parliament and legislatures, and nowhere are they so remarkably unrepresented as in British Columbia.

It’s important to acknowledge the less-remarked-upon things that have shaped this generation. They are better educated than previous generations, which has saddled them with debt that piled up because of higher tuition costs.

Many have had trouble finding jobs because they graduated during a global recession and a period of stagnant wages. They’re making do by living with parents longer and delaying having children. Those with jobs work harder than previous generations because most families need two incomes to keep roofs over their heads and food on the table.

Not since the return of Second World War veterans have young Canadians faced such a difficult housing market. Affordable rental housing is scarce, and home ownership is mostly beyond their reach, even for two working professionals.

Necessity has downsized dreams of home ownership to high-rise apartments from single-family houses with yards. Even then, home ownership often depends on having access to the Bank of Mom and Dad and/or Childcare by Grandma and Grandpa.

When the oldest millennials were born, the average house price was about six times the annual average salary, or just under $204,000 in 2016 dollars, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association. By 2016, the national average price was nearly $507,000, or 14.8 times average annual wages. In Metro Vancouver, the average house costs $1.4 million.

More than any generation since the advent of Old Age Security and the Canada Pension Plan, the millennials need to influence public policy for themselves and their children.

But to make a difference, they’ve got to find time to get involved with politics, which they have largely been loathe to do.

They are barely present in federal and provincial governments, according to a survey of 1,100 elected officials done by the Forum for Millennial Leadership. Justin Trudeau’s Liberals were big beneficiaries of millennials’ support in 2015. But only nine per cent of his cabinet and 11 per cent of his caucus were born after 1980.

Trudeau’s own cohort, Generation Xers, rule. While they are less than a third of the population, they account for 69 per cent of the cabinet jobs and hold 51 per cent of the seats.

B.C. millennials are startlingly scarce, given their population numbers. Only one of B.C.’s 42 members of parliament is a millennial, and only seven per cent of MLAs. All of the MLAs born after 1980 are New Democrats.

Taking time out for politics is tough for any generation, let alone one that is in its prime family-forming and career-building years. Federal politics is especially taxing for British Columbians because it means thousands of hours spent on airplanes and constant jetlag during the parliamentary sessions.

But as women have learned through the ages, if you’re not at the table, neither are the issues that affect you most.

For further proof, look south where Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is one of the most visible and vocal voices of her generation. At 29, she is fearlessly helping redefine political debate, including around climate change. She is doing it even though American millennials are even less likely to vote than Canadians. Only 31 per cent voted in the key 2018 midterm election, and 51 per cent voted in the 2016 presidential election.

In Canada, 57 per cent voted in the last federal election in millennials’ best showing so far. Still, they lagged every other age group, most notably baby boomers. Nearly 80 per cent of those aged 65 to 74 voted, as did roughly 75 per cent of the 55- to 64-year-olds.

Still, Trudeau’s Liberals played to them and won, even if they haven’t lived up to all of their promises. In the most recent budget, they made it clear millennials mattered by including an intergenerational analysis for the first time. They claimed that younger Canadians got nearly twice the benefits of older Canadians.

Economist Paul Kershaw disputes that, arguing that the government didn’t properly account for old-age security and health transfers. Had it done so, younger Canadians would have got only a quarter of the budget benefits, with older Canadians taking the lion’s share.

Conspicuously missing were greater investments in child care, parental leave, supports for post-secondary and housing.

“This pattern is consistent with four decades of Canadian public finance, which has seen Canadian governments grow social spending for our aging population at four times the pace of investment for younger generations,” Kershaw wrote on his blog.

But unless millennials get involved in politics from grassroots grunt work to standing for election, governments will continue to so. And if millennials don’t like things now, they might want to consider what some scientists are predicting: with technological advances, they may be the first generation never to die.

The Asterix, a commercial ship converted by Davie shipyards in Quebec and leased to the federal government to perform a military supply role, has been going almost non-stop since it was launched. It has refueled both Canadian and allied warships.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said there is no need for a second such interim supply ship and the head of the Royal Canadian Navy, Vice Admiral Ron Lloyd, says he is happy with having the Asterix as the force’s only supply ship until 2023 when the first of two Joint Support Ships, to be built at Seaspan in Vancouver, is expected to be ready.

Davie, however, has offered to convert a second such ship, MV Obelix, to the same capabilities of Asterix and lease it to the government.

At one point the navy had three of its own supply ships supporting its vessels.

Information recently tabled in Parliament indicates that even though Asterix has been going full-tilt over the last year, there was still a requirement for Canadian warships to receive fuel and provisions from supply vessels operated by foreign navies or for Canadian ships to head to port to receive fuel and supplies.

Here are the details from Parliament:

The Asterix is also at the heart of federal government’s case against Vice Admiral Mark Norman. Norman has been accused by the RCMP of warning Davie that Liberal cabinet ministers wanted to derail the Asterix project.

That development leaked out to the news media and the resulting embarrassment was one of the factors that forced the Liberal government to back down on its plans and Asterix proceeded. Norman has denied any wrongdoing.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had twice predicted that Norman would eventually wind up in court, prompting concerns of political interference and concerns the Liberal government is punishing the officer.

Norman’s lawyers are in pre-trial trying to get documents they argue are needed so the officer can defend himself. Norman’s trial is scheduled for August.",The case for a second interim supply ship?

THE GLOBE AND MAIL/CSA/ISTOCK

As if channelling World Wrestling Entertainment’s gleeful and bombastic Wrestlemania event earlier this month, an upcoming debate between renowned intellectuals – Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek and Canadian clinical psychologist, psychology professor and bestselling self-help sage Jordan Peterson – promises all the sound and fury of a cartoonish heavyweight throwdown.

Just like the prize-fighting promotions of old, there was an initial call-out, with Mr. Zizek criticizing Mr. Peterson in a column in The Independent, accusing him of advancing “paranoiac” and “ridiculous” conspiracy theories. The trash talk followed: Mr. Peterson, provoked into responding, challenged a (fake) Zizek Twitter account to a debate, which (the actual) Mr. Zizek gamely accepted. The resulting event, happening April 19 at Toronto’s Sony Centre, even has its own trumped-up title: “Happiness: Capitalism vs. Marxism.”

It may not have the ring of “Rage in the Cage,” but the debate is beholden to the sort of absurdity that has come to dominate these sorts of public frays. It is foremost a spectacle, in which we can expect much to be argued and little to be meaningfully resolved. Even the animating dichotomy of the debate – capitalism vs. Marxism – feels like a mistake of semantics, if not their fundamental definitions. Capitalism, after all, is an economic model. Marxism is a philosophy.

Yet there is a deeper friction undergirding the Zizek-Peterson showdown that speaks not just to the rival concerns of these two combatants, but also the diverging ways in which critiques of modern life are framed: their understanding of “ideology” – a word that is increasingly bandied about and, just as often, misunderstood.

In November, 1793, during the French Revolution’s bloody Reign of Terror, the royalist-sympathizing autodidact Antoine Destutt de Tracy was imprisoned. During his carceral stint, he devoted himself to popular philosophes of the time (Locke, Condillac, etc.), to better understand the fervour that had gripped the French people. Upon his release, Destutt de Tracy devised his own “science of ideas.” He called his discipline “ideology,” and recruited like-minded “ideologists” to the cause.

Theirs was a typical Enlightenment project, which aimed to demystify the lingering theological and political arbitrations of the prerevolutionary Ancien Régime. As English critic Terry Eagleton describes their mission, “in illuminating the obscurantism of the old order, it cast upon society a dazzling light which blinded men and women to the murky sources of this clarity.”

Not everyone benefited from such clarity. Chief among the ideologists’ critics was Napoleon, who feared their attacks on Christianity – and on his own self-endowed authority. He decried the “windbags and idéologues who have always fought the existing authority.” And in mistaking – or deliberately misnaming – the self-identifying “ideologists,” Napoleon coined an insult that persists to this day: ideologue.

These days, if you want to vilify someone, that’s what you label them. Or better, claim that their motivations are “pure ideology.” Doug Ford’s Ontario government, for instance, defended its 2018 rollback of the provincial sex-ed curriculum by saying lessons about homosexuality and gender identity were “based on ideology.”

What was once a word for someone devoted to the detached study of ideas has been perverted, if not totally inverted. After all, the claim that someone – typically a political enemy – is “an ideologue” is now meant to discredit their intellectual positions, because it presumes some alternate, ideal position that is unclouded by ideology; some purely rational, scientifically grounded terra firma from which one can snipe, “Oh, that’s just ideology.” Ideology, then, has become something that someone else does.

This is precisely how Mr. Peterson uses the term. In 2018, he recorded a video for the online conservative learning portal Prager U called “Dangerous People Are Teaching Your Kids,” in which he assails professors who attack the foundations of Western civilization itself with their “resentment-ridden ideology.” He has likewise expressed skepticism about climate change, telling an Australian interviewer: “You can’t trust the data because too much ideology is involved.” Such accusations also drove Mr. Peterson’s investment in the debate around Bill C-16, the amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code that granted constitutional protections to gender identity; in a 2017 Senate hearing, he claimed the law was being advanced by a vanguard of “ideologues,” echoing remarks he made in a 2016 interview on TVO’s The Agenda, in which he claimed that “ideologues” wanted to legally compel him to use gender-neutral pronouns.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Peterson’s use of “ideology” is markedly Napoleonic in its weaponization. After all, the would-be emperor despised the ideologists precisely because they posed a threat to his power and his conception of social order. He claimed that they “destroy all illusions, and the age of illusions is for individuals as for peoples the age of happiness.” (That the ideologists aimed to “destroy all illusions” was hardly some damning insult – it was precisely their mission.) Napoleon was himself practising ideology in the modern sense: misrepresenting his opponents to recertify his own authority while hiding behind a veil of bad-faith reasoning.

That veil is what contemporary philosophers such as Mr. Zizek are talking about when they talk about “ideology.” The analysis of that concept dominates his work: In his introduction to Verso’s 2012 anthology Mapping Ideology, Mr. Zizek defines ideology as “a composite of ideas, beliefs, concepts, and so on, destined to convince us of its ‘truth,’ yet actually serving some unbowed particular power interest.”

For Mr. Zizek, ideology is a sort of collective social and political unconscious that operates in all spheres of human endeavour, and while one can actively subscribe to a given ideology – fascism, feminism and the like – it doesn’t override the master ideology, which always works to mystify and hide the ways in which the powerful manipulate the less powerful. In this sense, ideology seeks to cover its tracks by obscuring its own operation, like the master criminal Keyser Soze in The Usual Suspects: The greatest and most profoundly ideological trick it pulls is convincing the world it doesn’t exist.

At the risk of reducing an esoteric (and frustrating, often deliberately obscurantist) body of work to a single theme, Mr. Zizek’s primary philosophical mission is convincing anyone who will listen that ideology not only exists but that it exists everywhere – in a Hollywood movie, in a Coca-Cola slogan, in a Starbucks coffee cup, in a crude joke about toilets. “Everything is ideology” has become a kind of rallying cry among those who find themselves excited by the philosopher’s sustained critique of everyday life.

That modern pundits and self-help authors may not be familiar with the historical and philosophical implications of labelling someone an “ideologue” may seem excusable. After all, ideology is a fairly esoteric branch of theory devoted to a highly specialized word that is often unleashed imprecisely. But ignorance is a poor excuse when many of those bleating “Ideology!” – such as Mr. Peterson, in his railing against “postmodern neomarxists” – do so while railroading the intellectual, historical and philosophical currents devoted to unravelling and understanding ideology.

It’s perhaps unsurprising that many thinkers who might fall into the category – from the Germans Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer to French thinker Michel Foucault and Mr. Zizek himself – have produced some of the best writing about ideology. Indeed, it was Marx himself who, in 1846’s The German Ideology, developed the idea of ideology as the process of “perfecting the illusion” of power relationships in order to foster an “upside down” vision of those relationships that could be marketed to the masses.

Story continues below advertisement

Given that ideologies now tend to safeguard established myths and powerful blocs, is it any wonder that Mr. Peterson and his followers feel compelled to wave away those who work to dismantle the bad-faith thinking they attempt to naturalize as “real” and “true” and “enlightened”? After all, claiming that ""what I believe is actually true and everything else is ideology” is pretty much the most ideological thing one can do. As French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu said, “To describe a statement as ideological is very often an insult, so that this ascription itself becomes an instrument of symbolic domination.” The word becomes a way to stake a (fictional) high ground in the cultural and political landscape – a perch from which the conversation can be controlled.

Such claims don’t merely deny the speaker’s own ideological grooming – they actively work against any meaningful project of intellectual ennoblement. If pretty much everyone is manoeuvring in the obscuring shadow of ideology, then labelling another an “ideologue” is little more than a cheap shot. As was the case with Napoleon, it is a blatant, desperate effort to rebuff threats to power by attempting to make the authority of that power seem like the natural way of the world.

This is what most drastically drives a wedge between those who use “ideology” as a blunt instrument, such as Mr. Peterson, and those who scrutinize it, like Mr. Zizek. Whether they know it or not, both are practising ideology in the contemporary philosophical sense – but only one can lay claim to being, in the historical lineage of Destutt de Tracy’s “science of ideas,” a genuine ideologist.",War of a word: How ‘ideology’ has been weaponized into a political slur,The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-war-of-a-word-how-ideology-has-been-weaponized-into-a-political/

The Vuntut Gwich’in First ...","New research suggests Canada’s Arctic is the warmest it has been in 10,000 years — and the temperatures are still climbing.

The study was recently published in the scientific journal Nature Communications.

Researchers studied permafrost samples in the Yukon near the Dempster Highway (northwestern Canada) and determined that temperatures in the Arctic today are almost 2 C warmer than at any time in the past 10,000 years.

The temperatures recorded today are even higher than the previous recorded highs, which happened about 9,900 and 6,400 years ago, when the earth’s axis was tilted more strongly toward the sun, the report states.

Duane Froese, a professor at the University of Alberta and a co-author of the study, suggests that time period may actually be much longer.

“I would guess we’re getting back over 100,000 years since we’ve seen temperatures at least this warm,” he said.

Research shows warming Arctic

This study adds to the growing research showing dramatic warming in the Arctic.

Last month, the UN released its environment report on the Arctic, which describes scenarios where Arctic winter temperatures increase by three to five degrees by 2050 compared to 1986-2005.

Another study, published earlier this week, suggests the Arctic will no longer look the same, with greening tundra and warmer winters.

“The earth is getting a lot warmer a lot faster,” Froese said. “We don’t seem to have any great political will or mechanisms to slow the rate of change.”

But people living in the Arctic are already taking action.

The Vuntut Gwich’in First Nation in Old Crow, Yukon, is set to declare a state of emergency due to climate change as they watch the effects unfold firsthand in their community. That includes rising temperatures, less snow cover, warmer winters and thawing permafrost.

Froese says these effects will only continue, especially as the permafrost melts, which may happen more slowly or less dramatically than melting glaciers.

“Permafrost behaves a bit different,” Froese said. “It has all the insulation of the vegetation and soil on the surface of it that slows the penetration of heat into the ground.

“Particularly in the western Arctic, we’re starting to see big, big changes from those warmer temperatures and melting permafrost.”

Canada is often cast as a foil for the United States, a place separate and distinct, untouched by the social and political currents swirling to the south. That's increased since the ...","The group that confronted them for speaking out is called the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights. The name is striking: In Canada, unlike the United States, there is no constitutional ""right"" to guns.

""New groups are using the language of rights in an effort to move talk toward talking about 'gun rights,' "" said Blake Brown, a historian at Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Brown is the author of ""Arming and Disarming: A History of Gun Control in Canada."" In the past, he said, Canadians who supported private gun ownership didn't want to be seen as anything like American groups. Now, some are adopting NRA tactics and tag lines.

The NRA didn't respond to a request for comment.

Rod Giltaca, the executive director of the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights, denied a direct link to the American group. He called the use of NRA hashtags ""an accident,"" but was proud to tout his group's assertive social media strategy.

""We are a public relations organization,"" he said.

Pro-gun groups say restrictions don't work because criminals won't obey them — an argument familiar to the American gun debate. Some argue that hunting is central to Canadian culture.

The Toronto doctors hope to shape the conversation, albeit in different ways. They're focused on guns and public health.

""This is an opportunity to inform the public discourse,"" Ahmed said.

Canada's gun debate is changing in part because Canadians are hearing a lot more about guns.

The country has restricted ownership of handguns and automatic weapons since the 1930s. The rules were expanded to include rifles and shotguns after a 1989 mass shooting in Montreal.

But more recent efforts to control gun access, including a bill currently up for debate in Parliament, have drawn substantial pushback, and the conversation has become uncharacteristically polarized.

Ahmed and her colleagues at St. Michael's Hospital, like many Canadians, have watched in horror as the United States was hit by shooting after shooting, from Columbine to Sandy Hook to Las Vegas to Parkland.

But while Canada was watching gun violence in the United States, it was becoming more common at home.

When Ahmed was a resident in the 1990s, young doctors in training would rush to the emergency room to watch gunshot wounds get treated because they were rare.

Now they're less novel. Firearm-related violent crime in Canada has increased 42 per cent since 2013, according to Statistics Canada.

Mass shootings here have galvanized gun-control advocates. In 2017, a Canadian man carrying a licensed weapon fired 48 shots into a Quebec City mosque, killing six. Last summer, another shooter opened fire in Toronto's trendy Danforth neighbourhood, killing six and wounding more than a dozen.

For Ahmed, who treated victims of the Toronto shooting, it was a turning point.

She and her colleagues, citing a growing body of medical research that treats gun violence as a public health crisis, are now calling for a ban on handguns and assault rifles.

They want Canadians to ask why the country compares its violent crime rates to those of the United States, a country with exceptionally high gun-related mortality, rather than places where regulation is stricter and rates are relatively low.

David Gomez, a trauma and acute care surgeon at St. Michael's, says the frequently cited response of Australia to a mass shooting in 1996 is worth considering.

After 35 people were killed in a 1996 shooting in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur, the country sharply tightened restrictions on firearms and launched a buyback program that netted hundreds of thousands of weapons.

And after a shooter killed 50 people in March at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, the country banned military-style semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles in days.

Gomez said Canada ""is 30 years away from where we could be.""

Lynn Wilson, the vice dean of the University of Toronto's faculty of medicine, co-chairs the doctor's group with Ahmed. She said comparisons with the United States have clouded the discussion in Canada.

""People were getting desensitized to all the shootings,"" she said. ""The horror happening there made people think, 'We are not so bad.'""

Their campaign will be met with opposition from conservative lawmakers and gun groups, including the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights.

Duck hunters and sport shooters don't commit ""drive-by's (sic) in downtown Toronto,"" the firearm rights coalition says in a policy paper.

Gun-control advocates stress that it's not just about drive-by shootings. In Canada, as in the United States, much of the death and injuries by gun are intimate partner violence, or suicide.

Giltaca's coalition wants to expand access to firearms. And the group wants new protections for concealed carry and shooting in self-defence — issues central to the U.S. debate.

In response to the doctors' call for a handgun ban, Giltaca posted a video on the coalition website describing how it might be enforced. He outlined a hypothetical scenario in which authorities in full military gear with ""semi-auto"" rifles come to seize weapons from Canadian homes. He warned that they might mistake a child's phone or a remote control for a gun and shoot the child ""through the neck.""

His group is not interested in hearing from doctors, whether those doctors pull bullets out of bodies, or not.

""I think they must have got talked into this and are probably thinking, 'Holy smokes, how did I get into this?' "" Giltaca said. ""But now that they are into this, this is never going to end.""

The doctors said they won't be intimidated from speaking out.

In a report released Monday, the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) said interference will likely come in the form of misinformation spread online through social media and untrustworthy websites.

""If a (news) report sounds implausible, maybe check it against a well-known Canadian news source to see if they are also reporting it,"" said Veronica Kitchen, an associate professor of political science at the University of Waterloo and Balsillie School of International Affairs.

""We still have enough good journalists in this country that they'll be reporting it.""

Canada is unlikely to see a repeat of Russia's widespread meddling during the 2016 presidential election in the United States. Instead, foreign adversaries could attempt to sway the ideas and decisions of voters in more subtle ways by focusing on polarizing social or political issues, or by promoting the popularity of one party over another, the report said.

""We recognize that foreign adversaries may use cyber technology to interfere and influence Canadians like they have done in other countries,"" Karina Gould, minister of democratic institutions, said in a news release that accompanied the report. Cyberattacks against elections in advanced democracies have increased threefold since the last federal election in 2015.

Voters are now the single largest target of cyber threat activity during elections, the report found, meaning voters need digital literacy skills to spot false or misleading information, Kitchen said.

""We should be skeptical of information, but deciding which information to be skeptical of is the challenge,"" Kitchen said.

The CSE believes voters will be the primary target because it's easier to change the mind of voters than it is to change the outcome of the election itself, especially with Canada's paper ballot system.

The National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians said in a report released Tuesday that the Asian tiger poses a significant national security cyber threat to Canada.

The report addresses concerns Canada’s intelligence community has about China under the heading “Espionage and Foreign Influence.”

The embassy says the issues are different concepts.

“If the report tries to accuse China of conducing espionage activities in Canada, it should produce tangible evidence, rather than making malicious attacks out of nothing,” the embassy said in a statement to Glacier Media.

The statement said China adheres to a principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

“Some Western countries are keen to engage in espionage activities in other countries, carry out ‘color revolution’ and interfere in other countries’ internal affairs,” the statement said. “Such examples are too numerous to mention.”

That’s the opposite of what the Canadian parliamentarians said.

“China is known globally for its efforts to influence Chinese communities and the politics of other countries,” said the report to Parliament.

Relations between Ottawa and Beijing have been strained since the arrest of Shenzen-China-based telecommunications giant Huawei’s chief financial officer at Vancouver airport in December. Meng Wanzhou is the subject of a U.S. extradition request on fraud-related charges and remains on $10-million bail.

Ottawa has suggested the detention of two Canadians and the increasing of another’s jail sentence from 15 years to death as retaliation for Meng’s detention.

The report also said, “The Chinese government has a number of official organizations that try to influence Chinese communities and politicians to adopt pro-China positions, most prominently the United Front Work Department.”

The Chinese embassy takes issue with that assessment.

“Is there anything wrong with that the Chinese government is committed to making the outside world take a pro-China position?” the embassy asked. “Is the Canadian government willing to let the outside world take a counter-Canada position?”

The statement said the work of an agency such as the United Front Work Department demonstrates that it is “committed to establishing friendly relations between China and foreign countries with good will. “

Further, the report said, in 2016 the issue of wealthy Chinese businessmen with close connections to the Communist Party of China making political donations in Canada was raised, an issue also seen in other countries.

And, it said, media and academic reports point to Chinese attempts to influence government through significant political donations, influencing Chinese-language media and covertly supporting community groups and demonstrations.

“Chinese police and security officials have also been caught operating without permission in foreign states to persuade or coerce Chinese fugitives to return to China,” the report said.

That was apparently the case when Lai Changxing, dubbed China’s most wanted man, was fighting extradition from Canada in Vancouver, wanted in his homeland on corruption charges.

Hearings in downtown Vancouver heard of the presence of so-called ‘420 teams’ from China operating in Canada to try and influence Lai and those around him to return.

“There was a problem in the Lai case,” Lai’s lawyer David Matas said “The Chinese got visas for a trade delegation which in fact were part of the 420 team assigned to Lai. They got the visas and used them to try to pressure Lai to return to China.”

Matas said when Ottawa “found out about the abuse of their visa system, they sent a formal diplomatic protest to China.”

The student issue was highlighted this week in a Glacier Media report about Chinese government-sponsored student groups coming under the spotlight in Canada, including in B.C. where a university authorized a military-style Chinese flag raising ceremony.

In a report issued this week, Al Mussell, research lead at Agri-Food Economic Systems in Guelph, Ont., noted that an outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in China is also disrupting the global meat supply.

“We’re in uncharted waters,” Mussell said. “We’ve never had a structural bull market in agricultural products led by the protein complex, while at the same time experiencing an opposite trend in oilseed.”

Generic lean hog futures have shot up 40 per cent since the beginning of March as a result of the outbreak, one that could wipe out seven million sows according to Rabobank estimates cited by Mussell.

“There’s not enough meat in the world to fill the Chinese pork shortage that’s coming this year,” Mussell said, predicting that the demand for all kinds of meat would rise as a result.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says ASF is a highly contagious viral disease of domestic and wild pigs. It causes high death rates in infected pigs and can infect swine herds in various ways. There is no treatment.

Mussell said that swine populations in other countries, including Canada, are at risk of infection and that the disease has already spread to Vietnam, Russia and some Eastern European and African countries.

There’s not enough meat in the world to fill the Chinese pork shortage that’s coming this year Al Mussell

According to a Bloomberg News report, China may increase U.S. pork imports to a record 300,000 metric tonnes in 2019 as part of a commitment to increase American farm imports to resolve the trade war – 81 per cent more than the 166,000 tons in 2017.

But Pan Chenjun, an analyst at Rabobank International in Hong Kong, noted that increased U.S. pork imports alone would not be enough to offset China’s shortage.

“All protein imports may rise,” as a result, she told Bloomberg.

Ray Price, president of Sunterra Farms in Acme, Alberta, is worried about ASF.

“The biggest risk is people bringing meat into Canada,” he said. “But we have a very high standard of health and biosecurity in this country.”

While the swine flu outbreak poses risks, high pork prices could also create an opportunity Mussell said, and bring about investment in pork production in China and Canada.

“This is an incredible earning opportunity for hog producers and processors,” he said.

That comes in contrast to the potential bear market in oil seeds.

On March 22, the Chinese Government placed a ban on all Canadian canola imports, with both Viterra Inc. and James Richardson International having their canola importing permits suspended for unspecified reasons.

According to the Canola Council, Canada produces 18 million tonnes annually — 10 per cent of which is exported. Approximately 40 per cent of Canadian exports go to China.

Mussell said farmers will need to rotate to different crops.

“This would increase the supply of wheat and other grains at a time when China is drawing down its supply of rice, which will lower the demand for imported feed grains.”

Jay Schultz, co-owner of a 7,000-acre Alberta grain farm, said the Canadian grain sector is in for a rough ride.

“Normally markets are driven by fundamentals, charts, supply and demand — now it might be politics,” he said.

“Right now, we should be locking in new crop pricing for harvest,” he said. “And we haven’t signed futures contracts for next year yet – something we normally do.”

Schultz explained that many farmers have already purchased seed, equipment and chemicals.

“It’s hard to change at this point,” he said.

Mussell’s assessment of the 2019 growing season was in line with Schultz’s.

“Farmers are getting their machines ready for seeding,” he said. “But how are they supposed to know what seeds to plant? What should they expect for fall prices? Who is buying?”

During his ...","Renaming the Bay Street Armoury after Sir Arthur Currie is not just historically and locally appropriate, it’s also long overdue, says a University of Victoria historian.

Jim Kempling, PhD candidate at UVic and a specialist in the First World War, said local connections to Currie, who began his soldiering in Victoria, are too strong to overlook.

article continues below

“We have Canada’s most famous soldier and perhaps Victoria’s most famous citizen and we have a couple of little streets named for him,” Kempling said. “And they are not even prominent enough for anybody to notice unless they went looking.”

Last month, the two commemorative heritage associations attached to the reserve units now headquartered at the Bay Street Armoury sent a letter to the federal government asking that the building’s name be changed to General Sir Arthur Currie Armoury.

The 5th (British Columbia) Field Regiment RCA Foundation and the Canadian Scottish Board of Regimental Trustees, representing two units commanded by Currie in years before the war, have signed the letter and are awaiting a response.

“It’s all about why would we ever name such a prominent local building after a street when we could name it after such a prominent Canadian military hero,” said Michael Heppell, former commander of the Canadian Scottish and a current trustee.

Even the armoury building has connections to Currie. It opened in 1915 and was originally intended as a home for the Gordon Highlanders during a time when Currie was commanding and organizing the regiment. The mess of the Canadian Scottish still contains a chair, re-upholstered several times, bearing a small brass plaque declaring “Sir Arthur Currie His Chair.”

Arthur William Currie (1875-1933) was the first Canadian to lead the Canadian Corps, a command to which he was appointed in June 1917, where he distinguished himself as a meticulous planner always careful with soldiers’ lives.

According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, British wartime prime minister Lloyd George called Currie a “brilliant military commander” and even considered putting him in charge of all British forces.

Currie was born and spent his childhood in Ontario. He moved to Victoria in 1894 at the age of 18 and found work as a school teacher, but later moved into real estate.

Soon after arrival, Currie signed up as a gunner with the militia regiment the 5th Brigade, Canadian Garrison Artillery, and rose in rank to lieutenant-colonel and commanding officer.

Later, he was asked to command a new infantry unit, the Gordon Highlanders. At the outbreak of the First World War, he was promoted to command the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the Canadian Expeditionary Force sent overseas to the trenches.

By the end of the war, Currie had been promoted to lieutenant-general, made commander of the entire Canadian Corps in June 1917 and knighted in July 1917.

One scandal and one political battle stained Currie’s otherwise exemplary record.

During his command and buildup of the Gordon Highlanders, Currie took $11,000 of regimental funds to pay personal debts and ward off bankruptcy. During the war, when the move came to light, he borrowed money from friends to pay the money back.

In 1919, Sir Sam Hughes, minister of militia during the war who held a grudge against Currie, rose in Parliament and called him a butcher who had squandered Canadian soldiers’ lives for his own personal glory. When a newspaper repeated the charges in 1928, Currie successfully sued for libel and restored his public reputation.

In 1920, Currie was made principal and vice-chancellor of McGill University. Despite his lack of any post-secondary education, he proved an enormously successful university administrator and fundraiser.

Currie suffered a stroke in 1933 and died that year of complications brought on by pneumonia. His military funeral in Montreal attracted 150,000 people, and a packed service was held the same day in Westminster Abbey in London.

Kempling said Currie was a remarkable soldier and a Canadian who jealously fought off all attempts to break up the corps as piecemeal supplements for depleted British units.

Instead, Currie worked hard to make sure Canadian units fielded more soldiers, more artillery pieces, more machine guns, more trucks and more engineers than British units of similar designations.

He also had no fear when it came to disagreeing with British superiors who demanded actions that could result in unnecessary casualties.

“Currie never backed down from saying ‘No’ to the Brits,” Kempling said.

“In fact, he did a lot of imaginative things that led to the success of the Canadian Corps,” he said. “He is well lauded as Canada’s best-known and most successful general.”

Though the day highlighted the realization of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s promise to legalize cannabis during his 2015 campaign, neither he nor anyone else from the ruling Liberal party was out taking credit for it – a sign that the social stigma around marijuana is still strong.

“Canadians are accepting of legalization, but I don’t think they’re celebratory,” said Peter Donolo, a political strategist at Hill + Knowlton and communications director for former Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chretien.

Aside from difficulty keeping up with demand, legalization has gone smoothly. Online pot sales to adults began nationally on Oct. 17, but storefronts only opened in the province of Ontario, which includes the capital, on April 1.

Six months before a national election, polls show Liberals deadlocked or trailing the rival Conservative Party, and Trudeau is being cautious about weed.

WATCH: Support for Liberals slips to 30% in new poll

Though Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has said he would not reverse legalization if elected, he has repeatedly expressed worries about safety – especially around people driving while high – and has said more young people might try marijuana now.

There are also some communities like the Vancouver suburb of Richmond, where 55 percent of the population list their ethnic origin as Chinese, which have prohibited cannabis storefronts.

“Legalization has gone well,” a government official said, but the issue is not a “primary focus.”

It is now safer to be a consumer because of regulation, the official said, adding that black market sales are falling and legal jobs and revenue are being created.

Interviews with customers and retailers at the Ottawa stores revealed that even if Trudeau is not talking about it, legalization has generated good will.

“I live close by and I’m excited to see how this store will change the neighborhood,” said Jessica, 23, who declined to give her last name. “I did not vote Liberal last time, but I might this time.”

Jessica was huddled close to an outdoor heater in front of the Fire & Flower store, which is just a 10-minute walk from both the prime minister’s office and parliament.

“We have a deep appreciation for the opportunity we’ve been granted,” said Michael Patterson, one of the shop’s two license holders.

Vivian Azer, a financial analysts who follows cannabis companies for Cowen and Company in New York, sees a bright future for Canada‘s nascent marijuana industry.

She forecast cannabis retail sales reaching C$3.6 billion ($2.7 billion) in 2019, including taxes. Azer sees illicit sales declining to 11 percent of the total sales by 2025 from 90 percent last year.

By 2025, Canadian recreational weed revenue will total C$10 billion ($7.5 billion), with medical marijuana at C$2 billion ($1.5 billion), Azer estimates.

Those political debates don’t always stick to the facts.”","EDOMONTON — Between politicians who fog the truth and the ones just in a fog, Chris Ragan wants to fan fresh air into a carbon tax debate that is clouding Alberta’s provincial election and drifting into an upcoming federal campaign.

“It’s pretty clear this issue is warming up politically,” said Ragan, head of Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission, a non-partisan group of academics and business leaders focused on economic and environmental solutions.

“We have been sorry to see that there’s a bunch of stuff out there that is either misunderstanding or poorly explained. There are a bunch of myths out there.”

The commission has just published a report on carbon tax misconceptions.

The worst, Ragan said, is that a carbon tax doesn’t work.

“If you look at BC, if you look at California, if you look at the UK, if you look at Quebec, these policies do work. What they don’t do is work overnight.”

At least five different published studies have found BC’s carbon tax, introduced in 2008, has cut overall emissions, reduced per capita gasoline use by 7%, improved average vehicle efficiency by 4%, cut residential natural gas use by 7% and diesel use by more than 3%.

Meanwhile, the province enjoyed about 3% annual economic growth between 2012 and 2017.

Other jurisdictions that have successfully used carbon taxes to reduce emissions include Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, several US states, the UK and the European Union.

Three separate studies found BC’s tax either didn’t affect jobs or added them. A fourth found a small decrease in jobs for less-educated workers. Studies in the US or the UK found little or no impact on job numbers.

The commission’s report finds that far from hurting families, 70% of Canadian households will receive more in carbon tax rebates than they pay.

Energy economists such as Mark Jaccard at B.C.’s Simon Fraser University argue that regulations get faster, bigger results and are politically easier to enact. The big cuts to Canada’s carbon emissions, he said, have come from closing coal-fired power plants and clean fuel rules.

“Some people will tell you you have to have carbon pricing,” he said on a recent podcast. “That’s not true. You could do it all through regulations.”

You could, concedes Ragan. But that would cost the economy more. Besides, he said, bringing in carbon taxes gives governments an opportunity to cut other levies such as income tax.

Albertans who believe the province could escape a carbon tax by rescinding provincial legislation may also be mistaken.

Martin Olszynski, a University of Calgary law professor, said all Ottawa would have to do is pass an order in council to bring Alberta under the same federal tax that recently came into effect in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick. None of those provinces had its own tax.

“It’s a matter of getting cabinet together and writing the order,” Olszynski said.

Looking to the courts to block Ottawa’s tax is an iffy bet, he suggested.

In court hearings on Saskatchewan’s anti-tax constitutional challenge, Olszynski said, judges asked if allowing Ottawa to regulate greenhouse gases as a matter of “national concern” would impede provincial efforts to do the same.

“If you recognize this matter as a matter of national concern, you would strip away the provincial ability to regulate these things,” he summarized.

But Olszynski notes that courts have recognized that many issues – especially environmental ones – are best managed jointly between national and provincial governments.

Other federal arguments in favour of a national carbon tax are backed by decades of case law, Olszynski added.

Ragan said the debate over carbon taxes is as important to Canada’s future as debates over the GST or free trade with the US.

“It’s a big policy issue and it’s appropriate that we’re talking about it now.”

Ragan just wishes the debate wasn’t so mythical.

No political party in Canada has ever committed to a sustained and consistent campaign to protect whistleblowers: the Wilson-Rayboulds and Philpotts of the world. In this regard, Liberals and Conservatives are, always have been ...","So much about the SNC-“Lava-lie” Affair was foreseeable. From the initial wrongdoing, through to the escalating bullying, clumsy cover-up, mounting casualties and fallout, this is the trajectory of major whistleblowing crises. History is littered with the fall of powerful politicians and corporate titans as testament that nothing is more powerful than truth.

But like so many authoritative and blundering bosses acting to extinguish “truth-tellers” — including using surrogates (former principal secretary Gerald Butts and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick) to do the dirty work — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau woefully miscalculated the steely determination of now-independent MPs Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott. Betting his “righteous” outrage — contrived, or simply “his truth” — would contain the crisis, Trudeau was blind to their fortitude, trumping first his suspect intentions and latterly his blundering exculpations by the conscientious exercise of their own voices. This crisis challenges something profound and central to our national identity: the doctrine of judicial independence and equal rights under the law, and the sensibility of Canadians to tolerate, let alone trust, the public institutions on which we rely.

As other countries promote the value of public-interest whistleblowing, Canada remains a feudal fiefdom. This is the real scandal.

No political party in Canada has ever committed to a sustained and consistent campaign to protect whistleblowers: the Wilson-Rayboulds and Philpotts of the world. In this regard, Liberals and Conservatives are, always have been, just different names on the same coin, mutually and complicitly understanding that power is at risk when people are free to speak about wrongdoing and violations of public trust. While Andrew Scheer may appear in this scandal to be the more ennobled of the two, based on his effusive calls for Wilson-Raybould to be free to speak, history reveals both parties’ track records of stonewalling and hiding truth. From Jean Chrétien to Stephen Harper and through to Trudeau, all promised transparency, all practised secrecy. All promised whistleblower protection, all embraced restrictive and oppressive anti-free speech regimes.

Worse still, they made integrity the signature piece of their electoral platforms. Hope given, hope crushed, oppresses more than hope never given. Too often Canada masquerades as the gatekeeper of enlightened, free-speech democracy, when reality is darkly different.

Today, Trudeau and his “team” are working hard to characterize the expulsion of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott as a breakdown in “trust.” But the sin of these two women was not about acts of disloyalty but about committing the truth. The birthplace of scandal is not in environments of respectful and open dissent but in dark corridors of power and secret phone calls and communications. This scandal is not that Wilson-Raybould taped Wernick’s gut-heaving proselytizing but, rather, what Wernick was trying to achieve, and might very well have achieved but for the smoking-gun of that recorded conversation.

Yet Trudeau continues to vilify the messenger. While guilefully denouncing Wilson-Raybould’s recording as “unconscionable,” what is actually unconscionable is Trudeau’s feigned moral indignation, and his and his Liberal acolytes self-serving pronouncements that loyalty required Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to quit before Trudeau threw them out. People of courage and moral foundation don’t quit; they persevere.

The real and lasting scandal arising out of the SNC-Lavalin Affair is the retrograde and quiescent culture in Canada requiring silence about matters that threaten the public interest. Those in government who speak out are subject to swift and cruel punishment. Moreover, the SNC crisis shows just how difficult it was for two women of privilege — as Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were as ministers — to be heard. Imagine ordinary, honest, and dedicated public servants. They don’t stand a chance.

It is said that it takes courage to speak truth when challenging formidable power and institutions. But speaking truth is what we are born to do. Shutting up is what the powerful force us to do. Election 2019 exhorts Canadians to demand from those running a commitment — evidenced through action, not words — to lock in real and meaningful protection for truth-tellers and good-faith whistleblowers. Otherwise, the new norm will be successive governments cycling through perpetual crisis while lying and deceiving us.

Segal Centre unveiled its 2019/20 season Wednesday night, with artistic and executive director Lisa Rubin, along with the participating creative spirits, supplying details of the six-show season. There will also be visits from guest artists, including a legendary screen veteran talking about his prostate.

First up is The Pianist of Willesden Lane (Sept. 8 to 29), which tells the true story of Jewish pianist Lisa Jura, whose prodigious talents helped her survive the Second World War. The one-woman show is performed by Jura’s daughter Mona Golabek, herself a piano virtuoso who will be enriching her mother’s remarkable story with renditions of pieces by Bach, Beethoven, Chopin and others.

There’s a change of tempo then with the North American premiere of the new musical Mythic (Oct. 27 to Nov. 17), a modern take on Greek myth and motherhood in which various gods are represented by pop-culture celebrities. Mythic is created by Marcus Stevens and Oran Eldor and will be directed by Brian Hill, whose adaptation of Belles Soeurs: The Musical played the Segal a few years back.

Also aiming to have them rocking in the aisles is the nostalgia-filled The Times They Are a Changin’ (March 1 to 22), which celebrates the music of great Jewish musical artists of the ‘60s such as Mama Cass, Bob Dylan, Simon and Garfunkel and of course, Leonard Cohen. This concert musical stars Louise Pitre, who brought us an unforgettable Piaf last year in The Angel and the Sparrow, along with her husband and co-performer from that show, W. Joseph Matheson.

Those looking for a little island of silence between these twin bursts of pop-rock exuberance need look no further than next door in the Studio Theatre, where Caitlin Murphy will be directing Small Mouth Sounds (Feb. 9 to March 1). A new play from Bess Wohl, it tells (largely without words) the awkward and funny story of six city people on a silent retreat in the woods.

J.T. Rogers’s marvelous Tony Award-winning docudrama Oslo (April 19 to May 10) is also set in the woods, but there’s not much silence as Israeli and Palestinian representatives try to hammer out the details of the Oslo Accord peace plan famously sealed by the Rabin-Arafat handshake. Rogers’s play, (which Théâtre Jean-Duceppe presented in French last year) is a rich feast of fast-paced, deadly serious yet unexpectedly funny back and forth. Marcia Kash will direct.

Taking us into the summer of 2020 is, aptly enough, Siberian Summer (May 31 to June 21), a world premiere from Paul Van Dyck. Ellen David will direct this sunny comedy about three women-of-a-certain age travelling aboard the Trans-Siberian Railway with one of their sons. The play is partly based on an actual trip Van Dyck took with his mother and her friends.

Guest companies visiting Segal’s Studio space in the new season will include Teesri Duniya with Rahul Varma’s Counter Offense, and “verbatim theatre” company Porte Parole, who will be reprising their fascinating round-table debate piece, The Assembly, which played Espace Go last year. And make sure you’re sitting comfortably for A Man and His Prostate, a solo performance from legendary Lou Grant (and Pixar’s Up) actor, Ed Asner, which is expected to play some time in October.

Lori Sigurdson garnered 60 per cent of Edmonton-Riverview’s votes in 2015, winning the seat away from the Progressive Conservatives, before she went on to serve in Rachel Notley’s cabinet.

She’s counting on her record from the past four years to push her into a second term.

“What I’m noticing at the doors is a lot of people are thanking our government,” said Sigurdson. “Certainly we have a very strong record on supporting people with public programs.”

Looking to unseat Sigurdson in a riding that has also voted Liberal and Progressive Conservative since its creation in 1996, are candidates from the other major parties and an independent candidate.

Katherine O’Neill, the riding’s Alberta Party candidate, said Riverview’s history as a swing riding helps her chances of winning.

“We see it’s a very centrist riding where people are very fiscally conservative but also socially progressive and that’s where we sit on the spectrum,” said O’Neill. “What we hear at many doors are people feel like it’s so polarized and it’s either too left or too right and they’re not comfortable.”

UCP candidate Kara Barker hopes the riding will swing back to the blue column in 2019. She said her story of becoming a crown prosecutor after struggling as a single mother shows her drive to improve the community.

“I was hired on as a crown prosecutor where I’ve been working, serving the community for the past 10 years,” said Barker. “I’ve always been very community-oriented and focused.”

Corey MacFadden, Alberta Independence Party

Age: 32

Occupation: Red Seal boilermaker

Reason for Running: “I am the voice for the people by the people. For decades Albertans have been working hard, and most when times get tough have nothing to show for it. We are over-taxed and over-worked and in return destroying our family unit. I want to change that by giving more opportunity and resources to the people of Alberta. I want to strengthen the family unit and create opportunity for those next generations to come.”

Priorities: Eliminate equalization payments, carbon tax and the GST; create a $45,000 base income that is tax free, and a 20 per cent flat tax on anything earned over and above $45,000; lower business tax to 8.5 per cent and international tax to nine per cent; reduce immigration to a 3.75 per cent unemployment rate.

Katherine O’Neill, Alberta Party

Age: 44

Occupation: Business owner & writer

Reason for Running: “Alberta is at a crossroads. I care deeply about public service, protecting human rights and bringing people together to get big things done for our province again. The fighting, finger-pointing and fear-mongering needs to stop. We should immediately address our serious financial issues head on and map out an ambitious, bold and forward-thinking plan for Alberta’s next century.”

Priorities: Restore fiscal management and investor confidence in Alberta, early childhood education and health, support for seniors and long-term care.

Indy Randhawa, Alberta Liberal Party

Age: 35

Occupation: Librarian/teacher

Reason for Running: “I believe political leaders have duty to represent the interests of all constituents, not just the most wealthy and influential, and this is something I promise to do. I believe this position calls for foresight, compassion and a willingness to work closely with the community.”

Priorities: Education is the best investment our province can make. Alberta’s schools must be safe, inclusive and effectual. Services for all must take priority over tax breaks for the wealthy. Moving forward does not mean leaving anyone behind. Public health care is a hallmark of Canadian society. I oppose any sort of two-tier healthcare system.

Lori Sigurdson, NDP

Age: 58

Occupation: Minister of seniors and housing

Reason for Running: “As a social worker for 25 years, I was frustrated to see public programs slashed due to Alberta’s boom and bust cycle. I am a single mom who suffered from conservative governments’ program cuts, and I saw that there were Albertans who didn’t have access to the supports they deserved. We on the other hand will make decisions that bring all Albertans health, happiness and prosperity for a long time to come.”

Priorities: An inclusive Alberta. Women, men, seniors, youth and people of all colours, sexual orientations and abilities benefit from prosperity. Diversify the economy. Grow the agriculture, forestry, technology and alternative energy sectors while continuing to support oil and gas. Create mortgage-paying jobs. Invest in needed infrastructure, retraining, apprenticeships, and new sectors like artificial intelligence.

For more than a decade, the Cree lawyer listened to the stories of residential school survivors, carefully recording the details of the physical and sexual abuses they suffered at the government-run institutions.

The documentation is part of the Independent Assessment Process that needs to be completed in order for survivors to collect compensation through the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, which came into force in 2007.

Many people who came to Sunchild’s office on Poundmaker II, roughly six kilometres south of the Town of Battleford, told her they had never spoken about their experiences before.

Sunchild accepted the stories without judgement. As survivors talked, she saw they were healing themselves in the process.

“When I started doing the Indian residential school claims, I felt a sense of power from the survivors,” says Sunchild, who is now 46.

“Hearing their stories of severe physical abuse, sexual abuse and all sorts of other ill treatment within the schools made me understand how strong Indigenous people are to have lived through that era.”

Listening to the survivors’ secrets had a profound effect on Sunchild.

Some stories, particularly ones about abandonment, would stay with her and cause her emotional distress. Sunchild dove into those feelings and spent time trying to understand them.

“My part in helping our people break that legacy of trauma is to do my own personal work,” she says. “If I get triggered or angered by hearing somebody’s story of abuse, then it’s my responsibility to figure out why it bothers me so much.”

Sunchild forced herself to look at her history as a child of the ’60s Scoop.

When she was two or three years old, she was taken from her home in Turtleford and placed with a white family in Mervin, roughly nine kilometres away.

Her adoptive parents were supportive, but “ill-equipped to deal with raising an Indigenous child in a white environment,” Sunchild says.

She maintained a relationship with her birth family — including her late grandfather, the highly respected elder Norman Sunchild — and Cree culture was part of her childhood. But in her early teens, she suffered an “identity crisis.” She couldn’t bear to stay in Mervin, so she packed her bags and made her way to Lloydminster, where she lived by herself with support from her adoptive family while attending high school.

Sunchild eventually moved to Edmonton, where she attended the University of Alberta. She did her undergraduate degree in political science with a minor in French and Native studies and stayed at the institution for law school, where she was one of the few Indigenous students. After she graduated in 1998, she moved to Poundmaker II, where she founded Sunchild Law. The office began specializing in Indian residential school claims in 2007.

As an increasing number of residential school survivors came through her doors, Sunchild took a six-week life skills coaching course that helped her confront the traumas she’d experienced in her past. She hired elders and a psychologist to work out of her office to support her and the survivors.

“I’m really grateful that I had the opportunity to do those Indian residential school files because it made me look at my own personal triggers, my own story, and deal with any residue that was left over from that,” Sunchild says. “The claims helped me improve my own wellbeing because I was forced to take care of myself. I was forced to realize when I was facing burnout or if I was holding on to somebody’s story or if a story was triggering me.”

Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, Saskatchewan’s first female Indigenous judge who now works at the University of British Columbia as director of the Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre, has watched Sunchild’s career for years and describes her as “an incredibly precious resource in the Saskatchewan justice system.”

Turpel-Lafond says many lawyers mistreated residential school survivors during the Independent Assessment Process and Sunchild stood out as an example of how the process should work. Whereas some lawyers signed up residential school survivors en masse and pushed their cases through the courts rapidly in a process that caused humiliation, Sunchild made sure survivors were heard in a way that they actually felt they were heard, she says.

“Eleanore is an individual who took the time to spend with survivors, to have trust with survivors, to respect their experience and she could relate through her own family experience to this incredible trauma … These are all things they simply do not teach you in law school.”

And she does it all with what Turpel-Lafond calls “Cree humour.”

“These stories are so hard and they can really hurt,” Turpel-Lafond says. “It just makes life so much easier if you can experience it and take the medicine of humour without minimizing the injustice. And that’s a real rare skill (that Sunchild has).”

Sunchild was 14 years old when she set her sights on being a lawyer.

She made the decision after taking an aptitude test that suggested she would do well in the profession. She used to think being a lawyer could be a stepping stone to becoming prime minister — which is why she studied French as an undergrad — but says she’s no longer interested in being a politician.

Academics always came easily to Sunchild, but her years in law school were challenging.

“The law has historically not been favourable always to First Nations people, so when you’re in law school as an Indigenous student, you have to realize that you’re not going to change how they teach law and your opportunity to change the law happens when you’re out of law school,” she says.

“You have to learn the colonial law that’s imposed on you and just learn it and get through it in law school, because I’ve seen a lot of Indigenous students try to change the system from law school and you can’t do it. And so those Indigenous students who resisted the teaching at law school, they were the ones who burned out.”

Sunchild’s work to change the system has increasingly been in the public eye since a visibly all-white jury acquitted farmer Gerald Stanley in the shooting death of Colten Boushie last year.

After the Cree man was killed in August 2016, his uncle, Alvin Baptiste, approached Sunchild for help. She spent months supporting the family as they navigated the justice system, including sitting with them through Stanley’s two-week trial in Battleford. When Stanley was acquitted, she stood alongside the family and added her voice to theirs as they spoke about the injustices Indigenous people face in the justice system and the need for change.

She stood out in a province where most people within the justice system refused to comment on the polarizing case.

Others were scared to speak out against the system, but Sunchild says her work with Indian residential school survivors taught her not to fear the truth.

“They had to talk about deep, dark secrets that they’ve never talked about for 60 years in some cases, and I had to talk them through that fear. So in doing that, I learned not to be afraid. Not to be afraid when you’re telling the truth,” Sunchild says.

“People need to know what happened. And the racism and discrimination has to change. There has to be a point when people say, ‘Well, Indigenous people can’t be treated like that anymore.’ And that’s always been my goal in being an Indigenous lawyer, is to speak for people who can’t necessarily speak for themselves.”

Sunchild’s willingness to have those courageous conversations makes her “one of the leaders of reconciliation,” says David Arnot, chief commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission.

“She’s a very articulate voice for these issues and it behooves all Saskatchewanians to listen to that voice because she’s saying something that’s very, very important for all of us to understand really to make Saskatchewan a strong province, a better province.”

Turpel-Lafond says Sunchild’s voice carries a lot of weight because she approaches controversial issues as a peacemaker.

“She wasn’t aggrandizing. She was trying to expose the fact that issues have to be dealt with at some point,” Turpel-Lafond says of Sunchild’s work following Stanley’s acquittal.

“She articulately put forward the need for fundamental reform of the justice system in Saskatchewan and I applaud that work because she’s a brave person to do it and she has the kind of leadership that is desperately needed in Saskatchewan.”

In the years the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement was accepting new claims, Sunchild Law employed 11 Indigenous lawyers who were all working on the claims.

These days, there’s just one other lawyer and an articling student in the office.

Much of their work is dedicated to looking at how they can assist survivors of Indian day schools, which were similar in many regards to residential schools, but did not require students to stay overnight.

Sunchild says she’s glad her workload has lightened. Working with residential school survivors who were torn from their families has made her cherish her own, and she is thankful to have time to be a mom to her three sons and two daughters aged six to 18.

“I need to make sure that my children always have that love that was taken from our people through systems like Indian residential schools, like ’60s Scoop, all of those colonial tactics that took our children away,” she says.

“I don’t want to be a workaholic working 14 hours a day. I did that. I did that and I don’t want to do that again. I don’t want my children to feel they weren’t loved.”

As a teen, she thought being prime minister was the way she could make a difference.

Now she believes the work she’s doing as an Indigenous lawyer and advocate in Saskatchewan is the best way she can force change.

“My practice is one-of-a-kind and what we’ve accomplished at Sunchild Law has been something so very special — not just to myself, but in the whole history of colonization. When people tell their story and they heal, they’re decolonizing. That in itself is an act of resistance and it makes me proud to have been part of it,” she says.

“Are we going to change the justice system? Probably not. But maybe we could make the experience better for another family who comes along after and faces discrimination or racism in the justice system. Maybe that won’t be their experience.”

374,,2019-04-12T02:35:00.0000000Z,According to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives ... decades of austerity politics under a neoliberal system ensures that the government still refuses to see the poorest people and people ...,"$760. Wow, you might think. What a score for a bedroom in a shared house in East Vancouver. Or maybe a holiday flight to Toronto. $760. If you’re the type, maybe a fancy pair of shoes?

$760 is a lot of things, and sometimes it’s a lot of money. Except when it is literally everything you have to survive on in a month.

$760 is the latest amount that a single person receiving income assistance will get each month in British Columbia. This is after a decade of rates being frozen under the previous government and the first increase since an initial boost in September 2017.

Please show me a single place in the Lower Mainland where you can rent a one-bedroom or even bachelor suite for $760 a month, let alone the designated “shelter rate” portion of $375.

So often, the group I work with, Raise the Rates BC, encounters the misguided belief that being in poverty means you just need to budget better or pull up your bootstraps and get a job.

But when the total amount of money you have to live on leaves no room for adequate food, clothing, shelter, transit, hygienic care, a visit to the dentist or a cell phone (to look for that job you’re supposed to be trying to find), no amount of budgeting or individualized effort makes getting off of welfare possible.

And of course, that’s assuming you’re able to access income supports in the first place, considering the ominously long application.

The thing that really got me mad after the B.C. government’s 2019 budget and in the recent reveal of the province’s first-ever poverty reduction “strategy” is how overwhelmingly clear it is that there is loads of room for a far more significant increase to income assistance.

Every time the government announces a healthy surplus, it feels like salt in the wound: “Look at all the things we did, and we still have money to spare.” Meanwhile, those on income assistance continue to face severe deprivation and legislated poverty.

That $760 a month is what we call “deep poverty,” and many of the nearly 190,000 people surviving on income assistance in B.C. live deeply below the poverty line. Federally, the poverty line is measured at the “Market Basket Measure” of around $1,600/month for a single person. $760 is less than half that amount.

The obvious question is, “but why?” Why doesn’t the government understand the depths of poverty in which it is keeping people? Why don’t they do something to help, if the money is so obviously there?

According to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives calculations (which echo similar numbers from the Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction), it would cost a mere $365 million to raise everyone receiving income assistance (welfare and disability) to 75 per cent of the poverty line. It would cost $1.16 billion to raise everyone to that poverty line.

This is a fraction of the subsidies promised to, for example, the liquefied natural gas industry. It’s around one per cent of the GDP of our wealthy province.

There is an answer to this rhetorical question, “but why?”

For all the talk and show of the “TogetherBC” poverty reduction plan, decades of austerity politics under a neoliberal system ensures that the government still refuses to see the poorest people and people with disabilities as worthy, of support or even part of our society.

It’s because of the stigma we carry in our middle- to upper-class hearts about poverty: that it’s an individual’s fault and therefore an individual’s responsibility. If you can’t work, you don’t have worth.

It’s because in our so-called democratic system, minority governments focus mostly on staying in power and refuse to plan for long-term, sustainable benefits to our society.

I want to challenge the government and all of the ministers to prove me wrong. Show me not just that you understand that ending deep poverty benefits all of society (for the $8 to 9 billion that is saved in reduced strains on the system, and for the proven benefits of a more equal society), but that you will take action.

Do something about that $760 per month. Act like this is the crisis it is, and take action beyond incremental steps. The money is there, so show me, and the 190,000 people on income assistance that you truly believe people on welfare are human beings who deserve to live in dignity.","BC Is Thriving, Yet Our Most Marginalized Remain in Deep Poverty",The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2019/03/29/Fair-Income-Assistance-Poverty-BC/
